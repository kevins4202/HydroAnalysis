8835,the use of recycled process water in steam crackers leads to the accumulation of corrosive impurities hence the need for adequate treatment two corrosion inhibitor formulations containing n 9z 9 octadecen 1 yl 1 3 propanediamine n oleyl 1 3 propanediamine with either cyclohexanamine cha or 2 diethylamino ethanol deae were compared for their performance electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and visual observations showed that the two formulations offered comparable protection against corrosion bengal rose testing and experiments conducted using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d indicated that the two formulations yielded similar coverage of the metal surfaces and that the kinetics of mass adsorption were also similar qcm d data further suggested that the films formed with the two formulations had similar rigidity and contact angle measurements indicated that they formed films with comparable hydrophobicity which were equally effective in

introduction steam crackers use water as a source of steam to limit coke formation in furnaces to quench cracked gas exiting the furnaces and as a cooling medium in a great number of heat exchangers ranging from compressor interstage coolers to distillation column overhead condensers 1 for economically viable and environmentally responsible operation of a steam cracker it is essential to recycle as much of the water as possible in all of these systems this is particularly challenging in the high pressure steam system where the danger of concentration of impurities to highly corrosive concentrations is greatest thus safe and reliable operation of such a steam system requires the use of suitable corrosion inhibitors film forming amines ffas have been used since the 1960s to inhibit corrosion in steam condensate systems in a number of industrial applications since they form films which can act as a hydrophobic barrier against corrosive species e g oxygen and carbonic acid 2 3 given its effectiveness in inhibiting corrosion while maintaining clean heat transfer surfaces organic cycle chemistry based on ffas is being increasingly employed as an alternative to conventional treatment programs for instance at the geleen petro chemical site in the netherlands ffas have been successfully utilized in a variety of applications since the mid 1990s 4 including the high pressure steam system of a naphtha cracker 5 ffa formulations typically contain neutralizing amines such as cyclohexanamine cyclohexylamine cha 3 methoxypropylamine mopa ethylamine 2 aminoethan 1 ol monoethanolamine mea morpholine and 2 diethylaminoethanol deae to control the ph 2 some of these amines and specifically cha can also provide the required volatility for alkalization of the steam condensate part of the steam cycle and stabilize the amines by acting as hydrotropes for the poorly soluble filming amine s in the blend 2 research has further shown that cha can adsorb onto metal surfaces and significantly inhibit its corrosion in the passive region 6 however alone cha cannot provide adequate protection in the active region where its adsorption occurs mainly on corrosion reaction intermediates which are only loosely attached to the substrate 6 conversely ffas adsorb on ferrous materials more strongly in the active than in the passive region 2 although cha has been effectively used in many ffa formulations cha is now characterized by hazard phrase 361f i e it is suspected of damaging fertility hence the search for suitable substitutes such as deae the transition of cha to deae has already been practised in the industry notably at the polish adamów power plant 7 and research has been conducted to compare the effectiveness of the two formulations containing cha and deae as corrosion inhibitors using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis 8 however previous research did not correlate the effectiveness of these formulations to the properties of the films pinpointing the parameters controlling the ability of ffa formulations to inhibit corrosion 8 also electrochemical methods have been used to probe the effectiveness of different types of corrosion inhibitors 6 9 and their ability to adsorb onto metal surfaces has been investigated through x ray photoelectron microscopy xps 6 10 11 with atomistic simulations 12 using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d and via atomic force microscopy afm 13 and with eis 14 however such studies did not compare the performance of cha and deae formulations investigating the reasons for their similar performance as corrosion inhibitors the goal of this research is to 1 prove that environmentally more benign deae based ffa formulations are an effective alternative to cha based ffa formulations and 2 define the parameters controlling the effectiveness of ffa formulations explaining the reasons for the comparable performance of cha and deae based formulations specifically the research presented here correlates the performance of ffa formulations containing cha and deae with 1 their ability to adsorb onto metal surfaces and the kinetics of adsorption as probed using qcm d ellipsometry and adsorption experiments bengal rose and 2 the structure of the adsorbed films as investigated with qcm d and their hydrophobicity as determined through contact angle measurements and thus their ability to isolate and protect metal surfaces against the attack of corrosive species dissolved in water 2 materials and methods 2 1 corrosion inhibitors two proprietary ffa inhibitor formulations provided by kurita were used in this study cetamine v211 referred to as ffa1 and g811 referred to as ffa2 which contain cyclohexanamine cha or 2 diethylamino ethanol deae respectively both contain ca 2 of n 9z 9 octadecen 1 yl 1 3 propanediamine n oleyl 1 3 propanediamine as the filming compound the concentrations of deae and cha in the formulations have been chosen considering their different basicity and volatility so as to ensure that the desired ph values can be attained in all parts of the water steam cycle 2 2 corrosion coupons two types of aisi certified coupons were employed for contact angle measurements c1010 low carbon steel and 316l austenitic stainless steel coupons all coupons were cleaned with ethanol and milli q water and dried with nitrogen prior to each test 2 3 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements eis measurements were conducted to study the formation of passivating films on carbon steel surfaces upon addition of ffa1 cha based and ffa2 deae based using a metrohm autolab frequency response analyzer with an electrochemical interface eis measurements allow determining the real and imaginary part of the system s impedance as well as the changes of the polarization resistance in time eis measurements were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using demineralized water to which nacl was added at a concentration of 200ppm and the ph of which was adjusted to 9 0 using hcl or naoh when no ffas were added naoh was used to increase its ph to 9 0 however addition of ffa increased the ph of the water and hcl was thus used to lower it and ensure that the ph was the same in all tests conducted the dosage of the formulated products was 200ppm volume based the working electrode was a rotating mild steel disc having a surface area of 0 2cm2 all experiments were carried out at a speed of 500rpm to mimic a flowing system representative of water steam cycles a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as reference and a platinum grid as the counter electrode the material of the working electrode was xc 38 this is the french equivalent of aisi grade 1035 carbon steel with the following chemical composition in weight 0 36 c 0 66 mn 0 27 si 0 016 s 0 020 p 0 20 ni 0 21 cr 0 02 mo 0 20 cu 0 060 al the electrochemical systems were mathematically described in terms of electric equivalent circuits comprised of resistances and a constant phase element cpe the resistances in the electrical equivalent circuit are as follows a polarization resistance rt representing the transition resistance between the electrodes and the electrolyte theoretically measured when the frequency ω of the current flowing through the system is zero a resistance rf representing the resistance of the ion conducting paths in the passivating films and a resistance rs representing the resistance of the electrolyte the polarization resistance rt is a particularly important parameter in that it correlates to the propensity of a system to undergo corrosion with high polarization resistances indicating high resistance to corrosion cpes model the behavior of a double layer formed in the proximity of the metal surface immersed in liquid such elements are described by two parameters the capacity y0 and an exponent n which are correlated to the roughness and inhomogeneity of the surface and or to a non uniform distribution of the current density on the corroding electrode nyquist plots were utilized to represent the real part of the impedance which reflects the resistance of the system to current flow and its imaginary part which represents the capacitive and inductive character of the system the rightmost part of the nyquist plots corresponds to low frequencies and approximates the polarization resistance of the system 2 4 film forming amine concentration measurements the bengal rose photometric colorimetric method detects aliphatic amines with a carbon chain length of 12 and more carbon atoms and it was used to determine the concentration of ffas in bulk solutions this method uses pink bengal rose dye to form complexes with the amines and an acid buffer to lower the ph 15 at low ph the bengal rose amine complexes are soluble in water and thus increase the absorbance which can be correlated to the amine concentration in solution all measurements were conducted at room temperature 25 c at a wavelength of 560nm using a portable dr 900 spectrophotometer hach 2 5 determination of surface coverage bengal rose test following cleaning with ethanol and water c010 and 316l coupons were soaked in 200ppm volume based solutions of filming amine formulations either ffa1 or ffa2 at ph 9 0 adjusted with naoh for 12h at room temperature 23 c and ambient pressure 1atm ptfe containers were used since amine adsorption onto this material is negligible 16 17 the mass per unit area of ffa adsorbed onto the coupon surface m u over a 12h period was determined by measuring with the bengal rose method the concentration of ffa amines in a blank in which no coupons were immersed and in ffa solutions in which coupons were immersed and by using the following formula 1 m u c t 0 c t 12 h r s a c o u p o n v where c t 0 is the concentration at time zero equal to the concentration in the blank without coupons immersed c t 12 h r s is the concentration measured after 12h a c o u p o n is the surface area of the coupon and v is the test solution s volume it is noted that the presence of metal ions dissolved in solution due to the corrosion of the coupons may sequester the ffas in solution leading to an overestimate of the ffas adsorbed onto the coupon s surface when using eq 1 2 6 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring the long and short term adsorption of ffa1 and ffa2 to stainless steel was studied with a qcm d system q sense biolin scientific this technique is described in a number of publications including 18 21 briefly the qcm d system is equipped with a flow cell at the bottom of which is a sensor sputter coated with aisi type 316 stainless steel which acts as the substrate for adsorption the sensor is intermittently oscillated at the fundamental resonance frequency as well as at its overtones odd multiples of the resonant frequency the changes in the resonance frequency and in the overtones are related to the mass of the sensor and may therefore be used to indicate film formation onto the sensor s surface moreover the rate of decay of the waves propagating through the crystal depend are correlated to the dissipation factor as follows 2 d i t 1 π f d i f f i τ i where t is the time i denotes the overtone considered d i t is the dissipation parameter for each overtone f d i f f i f i f 0 i is the current frequency of the overtone f 0 i is the frequency of the overtone measured during calibration and τ i is the time decay constant high ratios of the changes in the dissipation factor over the changes of the overtone to which it relates are indicative of soft films with visco elastic properties whereas when this ratio is small films are considered rigid and predominantly elastic in the case of rigid films the mass adsorbed on the sensor surface δ m can be estimated using sauerbrey s equation 22 3 δ m c f d i f f i i where c is a constant equal to 17 7 n g h z 1 c m 2 for 5mhz at cut crystals and the meaning of the other symbols is as outlined above it must be noted that the sauerbrey model was developed under simplifying assumptions but has been suggested to be a good approximation when the change in dissipation is less than 10 6 per 5hz of δf 23 short term adsorption experiments were conducted using concentrated ffa solutions 2500ppm of the formulations in milli q water volume based pumped in the cell at a constant flowrate of 0 1ml min whereas long term adsorption experiments were conducted using dilute ffa solutions 25ppm of the formulations in milli q water volume based pumped in the cell at a constant flowrate of 0 04ml min after injecting ffa solutions the cell was flushed with either deae or cha solutions or with milli q water to verify that ffas were irreversibly adsorbed onto the sensor s surface all experiments were conducted at room temperature 23 c and ambient pressure 1atm and the ph was adjusted to approximately 9 6 using naoh and hcl the flow regime was laminar in all tests conducted 2 7 ellipsometry ellipsometry was used to determine the mass of ffa adsorbed on metal surfaces under flow conditions ellipsometry is an optical method that measures the changes in polarization of light upon reflection at a planar surface 24 the instrument used was a type 436 thin film ellipsometer rudolph research equipped with a xenon arc lamp and high precision step motors computer controlled measurements were performed at room temperature 25 c at a wavelength of 4015å 401 5nm and an angle of incidence of 67 7 a more detailed description of the setup of the instrument can be found elsewhere 25 a stainless steel coated qcm sensor was used as substrate and cleaned as in qcm d measurements prior to multilayer adsorption a four zone measurement was performed in milli q water to determine the effective complex refractive index n of the substrate as well as to reduce effects of optical component imperfections the complex refractive index n can be expressed as follows 4 n n i k where n is the real part of the refractive index and indicates the phase velocity i is the imaginary number and k is the extinction coefficient which represents the amount of attenuation when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the material a baseline was then recorded in milli q water and the ffa2 formulation diluted to a dosage of 2500ppm was then pumped into the 5ml cuvette and the ellipsometric angles ψ and were recorded in situ during the adsorption followed by rinsing with the pure deae additive at the same dilution numerical methods can be used to estimate the mean optical thickness d f and refractive index n f of the growing film 26 and the thickness d f and the refractive index of the film n f and of the medium n b u f f e r can be used to calculate the adsorbed amount γ mg m2 using the de feijter formula 27 5 γ d f n f n b u f f e r d n d c in the calculations conducted a d n d c value of 0 15 has been used for the ffas this value was previously used for polyelectrolyte multilayers of poly l glutamic acid and poly l lysine with an initial layer of polyethyleneimine 28 since this value was not experimentally determined for ffas a sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate changes in the mass estimated using different values of d n d c during the measurements the solutions were continuously stirred simulating flow conditions 2 8 contact angle measurements contact angle measurements were conducted to assess the ability of the amines present in the ffa1 and ffa2 formulations to form hydrophobic films on c1010 and 316l coupons thus repelling water and inhibiting corrosion they were carried out using a thetalite optical tensiometer biolin scientific in combination with oneattension software biolin scientific contact angles were measured on the coupons immediately after cleaning and after exposure of the coupons to either ffa solutions at 200ppm and ph 9 0 or to milli q water at ph 9 0 for either 17 or 24h all coupons were rinsed with milli q after soaking and the contact angles measured thus reflect the hydrophobic properties of films irreversibly adsorbed at the coupon surface at least twenty droplets were analyzed for each system and the standard deviation was 5 6 or less for all systems analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements eis measurements were conducted to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of ffa1 and ffa2 in inhibiting corrosion of carbon steel in nacl solutions at ph 9 0 it is noted that salts different from nacl can be present in water however in water steam cycles much emphasis is placed on the purification of the make up water residual calcium and magnesium concentrations are in the low ppb range and there is no risk of scale formation problematic ions are especially chloride and sulfate since these may concentrate to highly corrosive levels underneath boiler deposits as well as in the phase transition zone in condensing turbines the test water represents a worst case condition of very high chloride levels in a similar way as in other studies 29 it is also noted that under the temperature conditions up to more than 500 c in the water steam cycle microbiological growth is not an issue the eis spectra obtained with blank samples without amines added were distinctively different from those obtained in the presence of ffas clearly demonstrating the formation of passivating films on the steel surface 9 figs 1 3 the eis spectra were comparable with ffa1 and ffa2 added indicating that the two formulations formed similar passivating films on the electrode surface the eis spectra for the blank could be modelled by a single asymmetrical semi circle and fitted by a single circuit with two resistances in series and a cpe representing the depletion layer at the electrode s surface conversely the eis spectra of the systems containing ffa1 and ffa2 were characterized by a shoulder at high frequencies figs 2 3 and could not be modelled by a single circuit rather two circuits each consisting of a resistance parallel to a cpe were used to model them supplementary material the parameters describing the circuits are given in table 1 among these parameters the polarization resistance rt has a particular significance because it relates to the propensity of a system to undergo corrosion after 20min the value of the resistance rt was similar for ffa1 and ffa2 and significantly greater with either formulation than for the blank showing the effectiveness of both formulations as corrosion inhibitors the polarization resistance was further determined at different times and the data are shown in fig 4 the comparison of the time evolution of the polarization resistances of the blank and the samples exposed to the amine formulations further highlights marked differences between the two systems fig 4 the polarization resistance increased with time in a similar fashion for the systems containing either ffa1 or ffa2 whereas the rt value of the blank decreased from 2 436kωcm2 to 1 652kωcm2 fig 4 the decrease of the polarization resistance observed for the blank at ph 9 0 is not visible in the plot due to the scale used these data suggest that in the presence of a passivating amine film the carbon steel surface became progressively more resilient to corrosion whereas it became more prone to corrosion with time in the absence of ffas in conclusion eis data suggest that the performance of the formulations was satisfactory and similar in agreement with the visual observations of coupons soaked in the aqueous solutions supplementary material 3 2 determination of surface coverage bengal rose analyses were performed to assess the adsorption of cha ffa1 and deae based ffa2 ffa formulations onto c1010 and 316l coupons under no flow conditions at room temperature 23 c and to correlate it to their effectiveness in inhibiting corrosion the mass of ffas adsorbed onto the coupons from 200ppm volume based solutions of either ffa1 or ffa2 over 12h is given in table 2 the data reveal that the mass of ffa adsorbed over 12h from either ffa2 or ffa1 solutions onto either 316l or c1010 coupons was similar and in good agreement with previously published data 8 the similar mass adsorbed with ffa1 and ffa2 suggests that the two formulations yielded comparable coverage these data may explain the similar increase in the polarization resistance of carbon steel coupons with ffa2 and ffa1 as shown by eis measurements and thus the comparable corrosion inhibition achieved with the two formulations as assessed by visual inspection of the coupons supplementary material in addition to good coverage the film structure and their hydrophobicity may also affect the ability of ffa films to impede corrosion as will be further discussed in the following sections it is noted that the concentration of ffa in the blank measured with the bengal rose test 2 5ppm was lower compared to the expected concentration 4ppm based on the nominal ffa concentration in the formulation 2 and the dilution used this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that ffas can form micelles in the highly concentrated ffa1 and ffa2 formulation possibly leading to statistical inhomogeneities of the ffa concentration in samples of microliter volume however because the comparison between the blank and the solution in which coupons were soaked was done with the same solution the observed changes in ffa concentration with time were truly related to ffa sorption onto the metal coupons it is further noted that the 2 5ppm concentration detected with the bengal rose test refers to the effective concentration of ffa which differs from the concentration of the formulation added to the solution because the formulation used contained 2 and not 100 ffa in this study the sorption behavior of ffa was investigated at ambient temperature 23 c only yet sorption is known to be temperature dependent 30 33 the effect of temperature on adsorption onto stainless steel has been specifically investigated for ffa n oleyl 1 3 propanediamine the adsorption of which was found to be greater at 60 c than at ambient temperature 33 although the adsorption behavior of the ffa used should be temperature dependent it is speculated that the effect of temperature on sorption would likely be similar for both ffa1 and ffa2 because 1 the two formulations contained the same ffa although the alkalizing amines differed and 2 they showed similar adsorption behavior at room temperature however since the temperature in water steam cycles for which these formulations are intended can exceed 500 c the effect of temperature on the sorption of ffa1 and ffa2 will be the object of future research 3 3 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and ellipsometry qcm d measurements were conducted to study amine adsorption onto stainless steel and to probe the physical properties of the amine film formed under laminar flow conditions using different amine concentrations and different sequences of exposure to ffa1 ffa2 and cha deae solutions adsorption of amines onto stainless steel was further investigated using ellipsometry such measurements were conducted using a qcm d sensor in a stirred cuvette the adsorbed mass estimated using ellipsometry thus correlates with the mass estimated using qcm d because of the substrate used and since measurements were conducted under similar flow conditions raw qcm d data resonance frequency and dissipation and the adsorbed sauerbrey mass for the fast and slow qcm d experiments at high and low amine concentration are shown in figs 5 8 the data reveal that when concentrated ffa1 or ffa2 solutions 2500ppm volume based were injected in the cell the overtones and the dissipation factors changed rapidly figs 5 6 phase ii the shifts of the overtones upon switching from milli q water to filming amine solutions may be due to a combination of diverse effects including bulk effects conformation of the molecules adsorbed onto the sensor mass adsorption onto the sensor formation of electric charge at the sensor surface as well as changes in the slip at the sensor surface 18 34 35 to verify that ffas were adsorbed at the sensor surface and that the observed changes were not solely due to bulk effects the cell was rinsed with either cha or deae solution at the same concentration as in the formulation used but without filming amines added figs 5 6 phase iii the data show that upon rinsing with either cha or deae solutions figs 5 6 or with milli q water fig 8 the overtones and the dissipation factors underwent minor changes and were markedly different from those measured before ffa1 or ffa2 were injected into the cell these results indicate that under the experimental conditions considered ffas from either ffa1 or ffa2 were irreversibly adsorbed onto the sensor surface after rinsing with cha and deae solutions in the long term experiments performed using low concentrations of the ffa formulations 25ppm volume based the kinetics of adsorption were extremely slow equilibrium was not attained even after 24h and the sensor needed to be exposed to a second injection of fresh formulation before an adsorption plateau was reached after 48h data only shown for the calculated sauerbrey mass in fig 8 the comparison between the equilibration time in slow and fast experiments shows that the kinetics of adsorption of ffas onto stainless steel displayed a marked dependence on the concentration long term experiments confirmed the irreversible adsorption of amines on stainless steel corroborating the results of fast qcm d experiments small changes in the overtones were detected upon rinsing with cha or deae solution and then with milli q water at ph 5 5 possibly due to bulk effects partial desorption or to a slight de swelling of the film as the ph was decreased however the overtones and the dissipation factors remained significantly different from the ones measured in milli q water before ffa1 or ffa2 were injected in the cell indicating irreversible adsorption the irreversible adsorption of ffa onto metal surfaces after rinsing with milli q was further probed with contact angle measurements as discussed in the following paragraph the comparison of the qcm d response after rinsing with the same fluid milli q water allows eliminating confounding factors such as bulk effects and differences in the ffa conformation at the surface in different water chemistries cha vs deae solutions and making an accurate comparison of the mass irreversibly adsorbed onto the sensor surface after injection of either ffa1 or ffa2 while differences in the mass adsorbed with ffa1 and ffa2 before rinsing with milli q cannot be discounted the differences in the overtones and the sauerbrey mass after rinsing with milli q were negligible phase v fig 8 strongly suggesting that the mass irreversibly adsorbed onto the sensor surface was similar with either ffa1 or ffa2 importantly the overtones measured after rinsing in tests conducted at high and low ffa concentrations were comparable suggesting that a similar mass was irreversibly adsorbed onto the stainless steel surface with either 25ppm or 2500ppm of formulation injected into the qcm d cell with either ffa1 or ffa2 the similarity of the mass irreversibly adsorbed onto stainless steel with ffa1 and ffa2 may explain the comparable corrosion inhibition achieved with the two formulations as assessed by visual inspection of the coupons as discussed earlier the irreversible adsorption of ffas suggested by qcm d experiments is in agreement with published literature reporting that amines can adsorb onto metal surfaces due to electrostatic attraction between the charged molecules and the charged metal as well as interactions of unshared electron pairs and of π electrons with the metal surface 30 31 it is reported that the effectiveness of corrosion inhibitors is correlated to the strength of the attraction between the amine and the surface 36 and the irreversible adsorption of either ffa1 and ffa2 therefore suggests that these inhibitors are effective in protecting the metal surface against corrosion in addition to good coverage the film structure and their hydrophobicity may also affect the ability of ffa films to impede corrosion qcm d data provided insights regarding the rigidity of the films the dissipation factor is correlated to the softness and the visco elastic properties of the films deposited on the sensor surface high ratios between the dissipation factor and the overtone suggest that the films formed are soft and visco elastic whereas small ratios are typical of relatively rigid and elastic films in this study the ratio between the shift in the dissipation factors and the shift in the overtones was small suggesting that films were fairly rigid and elastic for all the amine concentrations tested 37 given the rigidity of the films adsorbed at the sensor surface the sauerbrey equation was used to obtain an estimate of the mass adsorbed the irreversible mass adsorbed estimated using this method was 340 380ng cm2 approximately 4 10 3 g m 2 after rinsing with cha or deae in either the experiments conducted using low or high ffa formulation dosages see figs 7 8 the sauerbrey mass is in agreement with a previous study 31 in which the authors investigated adsorption of oleyldiamine n oleyl 1 3 propanediamine on stainless steel and reported coverages of 5 10 3 g m 2 2 10 3 g m 2 after a 3h adsorption period moreover the sauerbrey mass closely resembles results for lipid bilayers 38 however the sauerbrey mass is greatly different from the one estimated using the bengal rose test possibly due to six main reasons first of all qcm d experiments were conducted under laminar flow conditions whereas bengal rose tests were conducted under no flow stagnant conditions the different flow regime could have led to deposition of multilayers in bengal rose tests as opposed to monolayers in qcm d experiments secondly the porosity and roughness of the stainless steel sputter coated onto the qcm d sensor could differ from those of the metal coupons used in bengal rose tests thirdly in the bengal rose test the mass adsorbed on the coupon was estimated by measuring changes in the bulk concentrations rather than directly measuring the mass adsorbed onto the coupon fourthly deviations may be introduced when not all filming amine is available for photometric analysis for instance it is possible that in bengal rose tests ffa was sequestered by metal ions e g iron dissolved in solution due to the corrosion of the coupons leading to an overestimate of the ffa molecules adsorbed onto the surface of the coupons moreover the sauerbrey model was developed for perfectly rigid films uniformly adsorbed on the sensor in air whereas the films studies here were adsorbed in aqueous environments and were possibly inhomogeneous differences in the solution volume to steel area ratios used in the adsorption experiments may also have played a role to further understand the reason for the discrepancy in surface coverage ellipsometry measurements were conducted using ffa2 based on ellipsometry tests the dry adsorbed mass adsorbed from ffa2 formulation diluted to a dosage of 2500ppm was 360ng cm2 using a value of d n d c of 0 15 fig 9 changing the dn dc value between 0 13 valid for the non ionic surfactant pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether c12e5 and 0 18 valid for most globular proteins the adsorbed mass would only change by 4ng cm2 and 3 2ng cm2 respectively minimal changes in the adsorbed mass were observed upon rinsing the sensor with cha indicating that ffa films were irreversibly adsorbed at the sensor surface in agreement with qcm d and bengal rose data the mass estimated using ellipsometry measurements matches closely the sauerbrey mass estimated using qcm d data the comparison between the qcm d sauerbrey mass and ellipsometry data obtained using qcm d sensors under flow conditions and bengal rose results obtained with coupons under stagnant conditions suggests that the flow regime and the characteristics of the material used e g roughness have a major impact on the ffa mass adsorbed at the metal surface although there are fundamental differences between the sauerbrey mass and the mass estimated with the bengal rose test all datasets do indicate that ffas can yield comparable coverage of metal surfaces in the presence of either cha or deae thus protecting them against corrosion in a similar manner these data thus substantiate the use of formulation ffa2 as an environmentally more benign alternative to cha bearing ffa1 and are also in agreement with eis results and the visual observations of coupons soaked in solution for up to 24h supplementary material 3 4 contact angle measurements in addition to adequate coverage and film structure the hydrophobicity of the amine films and their ability to shield metal surfaces from corrodents in the water also plays a role in their effectiveness in inhibiting corrosion it is reported that hydrophobicity is an important parameter in controlling the performance of corrosion inhibitors in the case of amines 36 as well as of different types of corrosion inhibitors for instance it is reported that super hydrophobic films prepared by myristic acid significantly decreased the corrosion currents densities corrosion rates and double layer capacitance and simultaneously increased the values of polarization resistance of aluminium in sterile seawater 39 hydrophobicity was also reported to be an important parameter in determining the effectiveness of 12 aminododecanoic acid 40 and diquaternary ammonium surfactants 41 in protecting carbon steel surfaces against corrosion contact angle measurements were conducted to verify the formation of hydrophobic amine films able to repel water and inhibit corrosion of steel coupons all coupons were rinsed with unbuffered milli q water ph 5 5 and dried with nitrogen prior to contact angle measurements and the difference of the contact angles before and after immersion in amine solutions thus reflects the presence of irreversibly adsorbed amine films these results complement qcm d experiments in which the irreversible adsorption of ffa onto metal surfaces was verified after rinsing with cha and deae solutions as well as with milli q water the results of the contact angle measurements are graphically summarized in fig 10 te contact angles before immersion in solution were approximately 40 and 57 for the 316l and c1010 coupons respectively stainless steel 316l coupons did not corrode in milli q water at ph 9 0 with or without amines added however the changes in the contact angles measured for 316l coupons with time displayed a marked dependence on the water chemistry when amines were not added to milli q water at ph 9 0 the contact angles decreased with time conversely when amines were added the contact angles of stainless steel 316l coupons increased from 40 to 79 and 74 after 18h with ffa2 and ffa1 respectively these results indicate that the ffas had irreversibly adsorbed onto the coupon surface providing a hydrophobic barrier and rendering the metal surface only partially wettable thus inhibiting the progressive hydration of stainless steel these data are in agreement with qcm d results which showed that both ffa1 and ffa2 formed films that were irreversibly adsorbed at the stainless steel surface of the sensor under the experimental conditions considered after 24h soaking the contact angle of 316l coupons remained fairly constant and significantly higher than those measured without amines added without amines added carbon steel c1010 coupons corroded in milli q water at ph 9 0 and their contact angles were equal to approximately 4 5 and 0 after 18h and 24h respectively in the presence of either ffa1 or ffa2 corrosion of c1010 coupons was less marked than in the blank and the contact angles remained approximately constant for up to 24h the data show a correlation between contact angles and the degree of corrosion of c1010 coupons with the lowest contact angles measured for the most corroded metal surfaces qcm d measurements indicated that progressive adsorption occurred even after 18h whereas contact angles remained approximately constant from 18 to 24h these results may indicate that although the density of hydrophobic amine molecules on the steel surface increased steel surfaces progressively hydrated possibly due to partial permeability of the amine films to water to imperfections in the ffa films or to incomplete coverage the hypothesis of imperfections in the amine films and or of incomplete coverage may explain the differences in the contact angles measured for carbon steel and stainless steel coupons after exposure to ffa solutions for 18 and 24h the progressive hydration of c1010 in the absence of amines is in agreement with previous research showing that metal surfaces are strongly hydrated at alkaline ph 42 the partial permeability to water of amine films explains the presence of some corrosion product on the c1010 coupons soaked in water for 17 and 24h with either ffa1 or ffa2 however the extent of rusting in the presence of amines was markedly less than in milli q water without amines added the data reveal that both ffa formulations could adsorb onto either stainless steel 316l or carbon steel c1010 surfaces and that corrosion was inhibited by the formation of hydrophobic films with limited permeability to water the data further suggest that the hydrophobicity of the amine films obtained with either ffa1 or ffa2 was comparable indicating that the deae based ffa formulation can be a suitable substitute for its cha based counterpart in agreement with the eis qcm d and bengal rose test data discussed in the previous paragraphs it is noted that in addition to hydrophobicity and good coverage the lumo energy elumo 43 and the electron affinity 44 of corrosion inhibitors is also correlated to their performance specifically it was found that the performance of hydroxybenzaldehyde schiff bases increased with increasing elumo 43 it was further found that schiff bases synthesized by the condensation of isonicotinohydrazide and an appropriate aldehyde in methanolic solutions were most effective when their electron affinity was low 44 finally the flexibility of the corrosion inhibitor molecules can further affect the adsorption process and hence the effectiveness of the inhibitors 32 these aspects were not investigated in this study and will be the object of future research 4 conclusions the need to minimize the environmental impact of steam crackers by reusing water and treating it with environmentally benign chemicals has motivated this study which compares two commercially available corrosion inhibiting film forming amine ffa formulations to treat water steam cycles one formulation was cyclohexanamine cha based ffa1 whereas the other ffa2 contained 2 diethylamino ethanol deae as the neutralizing amine the data show that the two formulations increased the polarization resistance of metal surfaces in similar ways thus inhibiting their corrosion as demonstrated based on visual inspection of metal coupons the comparable performance of the two formulations was explained based on the coverage of the metal surface attained under flow and no flow conditions as well as on the structure and hydrophobicity of the ffa films bengal rose and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d data indicated that the mass adsorbed on stainless steel and carbon steel surfaces was similar with either ffa1 or ffa2 under either flow or no flow conditions suggesting that a similar coverage was attained with both formulations qcm d data and contact angle measurements further demonstrated that the films had similar rigidity and hydrophobicity shielding metal surfaces against water and providing equally good protection against corrosive water soluble species the combined results strongly suggest that in plant practice no notable difference in protection against corrosion is expected when cha based ffa formulations are substituted with environmentally more benign deae based alternatives acknowledgments the authors wish to warmly thank kirsten zimmer christoph weyn and julia jasper all of kurita for their support and

8835,the use of recycled process water in steam crackers leads to the accumulation of corrosive impurities hence the need for adequate treatment two corrosion inhibitor formulations containing n 9z 9 octadecen 1 yl 1 3 propanediamine n oleyl 1 3 propanediamine with either cyclohexanamine cha or 2 diethylamino ethanol deae were compared for their performance electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

dissipation monitoring qcm d indicated that the two formulations yielded similar coverage of the metal surfaces and that the kinetics of mass adsorption were also similar qcm d data further suggested that the films formed with the two formulations had similar rigidity and contact angle measurements indicated that they formed films with comparable hydrophobicity which were equally effective in

introduction steam crackers use water as a source of steam to limit coke formation in furnaces to quench cracked gas exiting the furnaces and as a cooling medium in a great number of heat exchangers ranging from compressor interstage coolers to distillation column overhead condensers 1 for economically viable and environmentally responsible operation of a steam cracker it is essential to recycle as much of the water as possible in all of these systems this is particularly challenging in the high pressure steam system where the danger of concentration of impurities to highly corrosive concentrations is greatest thus safe and reliable operation of such a steam system requires the use of suitable corrosion inhibitors film forming amines ffas have been used since the 1960s to inhibit corrosion in steam condensate systems in a number of industrial applications since they form films which can act as a hydrophobic barrier against corrosive species e g oxygen and carbonic acid 2 3 given its effectiveness in inhibiting corrosion while maintaining clean heat transfer surfaces organic cycle chemistry based on ffas is being increasingly employed as an alternative to conventional treatment programs for instance at the geleen petro chemical site in the netherlands ffas have been successfully utilized in a variety of applications since the mid 1990s 4 including the high pressure steam system of a naphtha cracker 5 ffa formulations typically contain neutralizing amines such as cyclohexanamine cyclohexylamine cha 3 methoxypropylamine mopa ethylamine 2 aminoethan 1 ol monoethanolamine mea morpholine and 2 diethylaminoethanol deae to control the ph 2 some of these amines and specifically cha can also provide the required volatility for alkalization of the steam condensate part of the steam cycle and stabilize the amines by acting as hydrotropes for the poorly soluble filming amine s in the blend 2 research has further shown that cha can adsorb onto metal surfaces and significantly inhibit its corrosion in the passive region 6 however alone cha cannot provide adequate protection in the active region where its adsorption occurs mainly on corrosion reaction intermediates which are only loosely attached to the substrate 6 conversely ffas adsorb on ferrous materials more strongly in the active than in the passive region 2 although cha has been effectively used in many ffa formulations cha is now characterized by hazard phrase 361f i e it is suspected of damaging fertility hence the search for suitable substitutes such as deae the transition of cha to deae has already been practised in the industry notably at the polish adamów power plant 7 and research has been conducted to compare the effectiveness of the two formulations containing cha and deae as corrosion inhibitors using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis 8 however previous research did not correlate the effectiveness of these formulations to the properties of the films pinpointing the parameters controlling the ability of ffa formulations to inhibit corrosion 8 also electrochemical methods have been used to probe the effectiveness of different types of corrosion inhibitors 6 9 and their ability to adsorb onto metal surfaces has been investigated through x ray photoelectron microscopy xps 6 10 11 with atomistic simulations 12 using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d and via atomic force microscopy afm 13 and with eis 14 however such studies did not compare the performance of cha and deae formulations investigating the reasons for their similar performance as corrosion inhibitors the goal of this research is to 1 prove that environmentally more benign deae based ffa formulations are an effective alternative to cha based ffa formulations and 2 define the parameters controlling the effectiveness of ffa formulations explaining the reasons for the comparable performance of cha and deae based formulations specifically the research presented here correlates the performance of ffa formulations containing cha and deae with 1 their ability to adsorb onto metal surfaces and the kinetics of adsorption as probed using qcm d ellipsometry and adsorption experiments bengal rose and 2 the structure of the adsorbed films as investigated with qcm d and their hydrophobicity as determined through contact angle measurements and thus their ability to isolate and protect metal surfaces against the attack of corrosive species dissolved in water 2 materials and methods 2 1 corrosion inhibitors two proprietary ffa inhibitor formulations provided by kurita were used in this study cetamine v211 referred to as ffa1 and g811 referred to as ffa2 which contain cyclohexanamine cha or 2 diethylamino ethanol deae respectively both contain ca 2 of n 9z 9 octadecen 1 yl 1 3 propanediamine n oleyl 1 3 propanediamine as the filming compound the concentrations of deae and cha in the formulations have been chosen considering their different basicity and volatility so as to ensure that the desired ph values can be attained in all parts of the water steam cycle 2 2 corrosion coupons two types of aisi certified coupons were employed for contact angle measurements c1010 low carbon steel and 316l austenitic stainless steel coupons all coupons were cleaned with ethanol and milli q water and dried with nitrogen prior to each test 2 3 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements eis measurements were conducted to study the formation of passivating films on carbon steel surfaces upon addition of ffa1 cha based and ffa2 deae based using a metrohm autolab frequency response analyzer with an electrochemical interface eis measurements allow determining the real and imaginary part of the system s impedance as well as the changes of the polarization resistance in time eis measurements were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using demineralized water to which nacl was added at a concentration of 200ppm and the ph of which was adjusted to 9 0 using hcl or naoh when no ffas were added naoh was used to increase its ph to 9 0 however addition of ffa increased the ph of the water and hcl was thus used to lower it and ensure that the ph was the same in all tests conducted the dosage of the formulated products was 200ppm volume based the working electrode was a rotating mild steel disc having a surface area of 0 2cm2 all experiments were carried out at a speed of 500rpm to mimic a flowing system representative of water steam cycles a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as reference and a platinum grid as the counter electrode the material of the working electrode was xc 38 this is the french equivalent of aisi grade 1035 carbon steel with the following chemical composition in weight 0 36 c 0 66 mn 0 27 si 0 016 s 0 020 p 0 20 ni 0 21 cr 0 02 mo 0 20 cu 0 060 al the electrochemical systems were mathematically described in terms of electric equivalent circuits comprised of resistances and a constant phase element cpe the resistances in the electrical equivalent circuit are as follows a polarization resistance rt representing the transition resistance between the electrodes and the electrolyte theoretically measured when the frequency ω of the current flowing through the system is zero a resistance rf representing the resistance of the ion conducting paths in the passivating films and a resistance rs representing the resistance of the electrolyte the polarization resistance rt is a particularly important parameter in that it correlates to the propensity of a system to undergo corrosion with high polarization resistances indicating high resistance to corrosion cpes model the behavior of a double layer formed in the proximity of the metal surface immersed in liquid such elements are described by two parameters the capacity y0 and an exponent n which are correlated to the roughness and inhomogeneity of the surface and or to a non uniform distribution of the current density on the corroding electrode nyquist plots were utilized to represent the real part of the impedance which reflects the resistance of the system to current flow and its imaginary part which represents the capacitive and inductive character of the system the rightmost part of the nyquist plots corresponds to low frequencies and approximates the polarization resistance of the system 2 4 film forming amine concentration measurements the bengal rose photometric colorimetric method detects aliphatic amines with a carbon chain length of 12 and more carbon atoms and it was used to determine the concentration of ffas in bulk solutions this method uses pink bengal rose dye to form complexes with the amines and an acid buffer to lower the ph 15 at low ph the bengal rose amine complexes are soluble in water and thus increase the absorbance which can be correlated to the amine concentration in solution all measurements were conducted at room temperature 25 c at a wavelength of 560nm using a portable dr 900 spectrophotometer hach 2 5 determination of surface coverage bengal rose test following cleaning with ethanol and water c010 and 316l coupons were soaked in 200ppm volume based solutions of filming amine formulations either ffa1 or ffa2 at ph 9 0 adjusted with naoh for 12h at room temperature 23 c and ambient pressure 1atm ptfe containers were used since amine adsorption onto this material is negligible 16 17 the mass per unit area of ffa adsorbed onto the coupon surface m u over a 12h period was determined by measuring with the bengal rose method the concentration of ffa amines in a blank in which no coupons were immersed and in ffa solutions in which coupons were immersed and by using the following formula 1 m u c t 0 c t 12 h r s a c o u p o n v where c t 0 is the concentration at time zero equal to the concentration in the blank without coupons immersed c t 12 h r s is the concentration measured after 12h a c o u p o n is the surface area of the coupon and v is the test solution s volume it is noted that the presence of metal ions dissolved in solution due to the corrosion of the coupons may sequester the ffas in solution leading to an overestimate of the ffas adsorbed onto the coupon s surface when using eq 1 2 6 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring the long and short term adsorption of ffa1 and ffa2 to stainless steel was studied with a qcm d system q sense biolin scientific this technique is described in a number of publications including 18 21 briefly the qcm d system is equipped with a flow cell at the bottom of which is a sensor sputter coated with aisi type 316 stainless steel which acts as the substrate for adsorption the sensor is intermittently oscillated at the fundamental resonance frequency as well as at its overtones odd multiples of the resonant frequency the changes in the resonance frequency and in the overtones are related to the mass of the sensor and may therefore be used to indicate film formation onto the sensor s surface moreover the rate of decay of the waves propagating through the crystal depend are correlated to the dissipation factor as follows 2 d i t 1 π f d i f f i τ i where t is the time i denotes the overtone considered d i t is the dissipation parameter for each overtone f d i f f i f i f 0 i is the current frequency of the overtone f 0 i is the frequency of the overtone measured during calibration and τ i is the time decay constant high ratios of the changes in the dissipation factor over the changes of the overtone to which it relates are indicative of soft films with visco elastic properties whereas when this ratio is small films are considered rigid and predominantly elastic in the case of rigid films the mass adsorbed on the sensor surface δ m can be estimated using sauerbrey s equation 22 3 δ m c f d i f f i i where c is a constant equal to 17 7 n g h z 1 c m 2 for 5mhz at cut crystals and the meaning of the other symbols is as outlined above it must be noted that the sauerbrey model was developed under simplifying assumptions but has been suggested to be a good approximation when the change in dissipation is less than 10 6 per 5hz of δf 23 short term adsorption experiments were conducted using concentrated ffa solutions 2500ppm of the formulations in milli q water volume based pumped in the cell at a constant flowrate of 0 1ml min whereas long term adsorption experiments were conducted using dilute ffa solutions 25ppm of the formulations in milli q water volume based pumped in the cell at a constant flowrate of 0 04ml min after injecting ffa solutions the cell was flushed with either deae or cha solutions or with milli q water to verify that ffas were irreversibly adsorbed onto the sensor s surface all experiments were conducted at room temperature 23 c and ambient pressure 1atm and the ph was adjusted to approximately 9 6 using naoh and hcl the flow regime was laminar in all tests conducted 2 7 ellipsometry ellipsometry was used to determine the mass of ffa adsorbed on metal surfaces under flow conditions ellipsometry is an optical method that measures the changes in polarization of light upon reflection at a planar surface 24 the instrument used was a type 436 thin film ellipsometer rudolph research equipped with a xenon arc lamp and high precision step motors computer controlled measurements were performed at room temperature 25 c at a wavelength of 4015å 401 5nm and an angle of incidence of 67 7 a more detailed description of the setup of the instrument can be found elsewhere 25 a stainless steel coated qcm sensor was used as substrate and cleaned as in qcm d measurements prior to multilayer adsorption a four zone measurement was performed in milli q water to determine the effective complex refractive index n of the substrate as well as to reduce effects of optical component imperfections the complex refractive index n can be expressed as follows 4 n n i k where n is the real part of the refractive index and indicates the phase velocity i is the imaginary number and k is the extinction coefficient which represents the amount of attenuation when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the material a baseline was then recorded in milli q water and the ffa2 formulation diluted to a dosage of 2500ppm was then pumped into the 5ml cuvette and the ellipsometric angles ψ and were recorded in situ during the adsorption followed by rinsing with the pure deae additive at the same dilution numerical methods can be used to estimate the mean optical thickness d f and refractive index n f of the growing film 26 and the thickness d f and the refractive index of the film n f and of the medium n b u f f e r can be used to calculate the adsorbed amount γ mg m2 using the de feijter formula 27 5 γ d f n f n b u f f e r d n d c in the calculations conducted a d n d c value of 0 15 has been used for the ffas this value was previously used for polyelectrolyte multilayers of poly l glutamic acid and poly l lysine with an initial layer of polyethyleneimine 28 since this value was not experimentally determined for ffas a sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate changes in the mass estimated using different values of d n d c during the measurements the solutions were continuously stirred simulating flow conditions 2 8 contact angle measurements contact angle measurements were conducted to assess the ability of the amines present in the ffa1 and ffa2 formulations to form hydrophobic films on c1010 and 316l coupons thus repelling water and inhibiting corrosion they were carried out using a thetalite optical tensiometer biolin scientific in combination with oneattension software biolin scientific contact angles were measured on the coupons immediately after cleaning and after exposure of the coupons to either ffa solutions at 200ppm and ph 9 0 or to milli q water at ph 9 0 for either 17 or 24h all coupons were rinsed with milli q after soaking and the contact angles measured thus reflect the hydrophobic properties of films irreversibly adsorbed at the coupon surface at least twenty droplets were analyzed for each system and the standard deviation was 5 6 or less for all systems analyzed 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements eis measurements were conducted to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of ffa1 and ffa2 in inhibiting corrosion of carbon steel in nacl solutions at ph 9 0 it is noted that salts different from nacl can be present in water however in water steam cycles much emphasis is placed on the purification of the make up water residual calcium and magnesium concentrations are in the low ppb range and there is no risk of scale formation problematic ions are especially chloride and sulfate since these may concentrate to highly corrosive levels underneath boiler deposits as well as in the phase transition zone in condensing turbines the test water represents a worst case condition of very high chloride levels in a similar way as in other studies 29 it is also noted that under the temperature conditions up to more than 500 c in the water steam cycle microbiological growth is not an issue the eis spectra obtained with blank samples without amines added were distinctively different from those obtained in the presence of ffas clearly demonstrating the formation of passivating films on the steel surface 9 figs 1 3 the eis spectra were comparable with ffa1 and ffa2 added indicating that the two formulations formed similar passivating films on the electrode surface the eis spectra for the blank could be modelled by a single asymmetrical semi circle and fitted by a single circuit with two resistances in series and a cpe representing the depletion layer at the electrode s surface conversely the eis spectra of the systems containing ffa1 and ffa2 were characterized by a shoulder at high frequencies figs 2 3 and could not be modelled by a single circuit rather two circuits each consisting of a resistance parallel to a cpe were used to model them supplementary material the parameters describing the circuits are given in table 1 among these parameters the polarization resistance rt has a particular significance because it relates to the propensity of a system to undergo corrosion after 20min the value of the resistance rt was similar for ffa1 and ffa2 and significantly greater with either formulation than for the blank showing the effectiveness of both formulations as corrosion inhibitors the polarization resistance was further determined at different times and the data are shown in fig 4 the comparison of the time evolution of the polarization resistances of the blank and the samples exposed to the amine formulations further highlights marked differences between the two systems fig 4 the polarization resistance increased with time in a similar fashion for the systems containing either ffa1 or ffa2 whereas the rt value of the blank decreased from 2 436kωcm2 to 1 652kωcm2 fig 4 the decrease of the polarization resistance observed for the blank at ph 9 0 is not visible in the plot due to the scale used these data suggest that in the presence of a passivating amine film the carbon steel surface became progressively more resilient to corrosion whereas it became more prone to corrosion with time in the absence of ffas in conclusion eis data suggest that the performance of the formulations was satisfactory and similar in agreement with the visual observations of coupons soaked in the aqueous solutions supplementary material 3 2 determination of surface coverage bengal rose analyses were performed to assess the adsorption of cha ffa1 and deae based ffa2 ffa formulations onto c1010 and 316l coupons under no flow conditions at room temperature 23 c and to correlate it to their effectiveness in inhibiting corrosion the mass of ffas adsorbed onto the coupons from 200ppm volume based solutions of either ffa1 or ffa2 over 12h is given in table 2 the data reveal that the mass of ffa adsorbed over 12h from either ffa2 or ffa1 solutions onto either 316l or c1010 coupons was similar and in good agreement with previously published data 8 the similar mass adsorbed with ffa1 and ffa2 suggests that the two formulations yielded comparable coverage these data may explain the similar increase in the polarization resistance of carbon steel coupons with ffa2 and ffa1 as shown by eis measurements and thus the comparable corrosion inhibition achieved with the two formulations as assessed by visual inspection of the coupons supplementary material in addition to good coverage the film structure and their hydrophobicity may also affect the ability of ffa films to impede corrosion as will be further discussed in the following sections it is noted that the concentration of ffa in the blank measured with the bengal rose test 2 5ppm was lower compared to the expected concentration 4ppm based on the nominal ffa concentration in the formulation 2 and the dilution used this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that ffas can form micelles in the highly concentrated ffa1 and ffa2 formulation possibly leading to statistical inhomogeneities of the ffa concentration in samples of microliter volume however because the comparison between the blank and the solution in which coupons were soaked was done with the same solution the observed changes in ffa concentration with time were truly related to ffa sorption onto the metal coupons it is further noted that the 2 5ppm concentration detected with the bengal rose test refers to the effective concentration of ffa which differs from the concentration of the formulation added to the solution because the formulation used contained 2 and not 100 ffa in this study the sorption behavior of ffa was investigated at ambient temperature 23 c only yet sorption is known to be temperature dependent 30 33 the effect of temperature on adsorption onto stainless steel has been specifically investigated for ffa n oleyl 1 3 propanediamine the adsorption of which was found to be greater at 60 c than at ambient temperature 33 although the adsorption behavior of the ffa used should be temperature dependent it is speculated that the effect of temperature on sorption would likely be similar for both ffa1 and ffa2 because 1 the two formulations contained the same ffa although the alkalizing amines differed and 2 they showed similar adsorption behavior at room temperature however since the temperature in water steam cycles for which these formulations are intended can exceed 500 c the effect of temperature on the sorption of ffa1 and ffa2 will be the object of future research 3 3 quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring and ellipsometry qcm d measurements were conducted to study amine adsorption onto stainless steel and to probe the physical properties of the amine film formed under laminar flow conditions using different amine concentrations and different sequences of exposure to ffa1 ffa2 and cha deae solutions adsorption of amines onto stainless steel was further investigated using ellipsometry such measurements were conducted using a qcm d sensor in a stirred cuvette the adsorbed mass estimated using ellipsometry thus correlates with the mass estimated using qcm d because of the substrate used and since measurements were conducted under similar flow conditions raw qcm d data resonance frequency and dissipation and the adsorbed sauerbrey mass for the fast and slow qcm d experiments at high and low amine concentration are shown in figs 5 8 the data reveal that when concentrated ffa1 or ffa2 solutions 2500ppm volume based were injected in the cell the overtones and the dissipation factors changed rapidly figs 5 6 phase ii the shifts of the overtones upon switching from milli q water to filming amine solutions may be due to a combination of diverse effects including bulk effects conformation of the molecules adsorbed onto the sensor mass adsorption onto the sensor formation of electric charge at the sensor surface as well as changes in the slip at the sensor surface 18 34 35 to verify that ffas were adsorbed at the sensor surface and that the observed changes were not solely due to bulk effects the cell was rinsed with either cha or deae solution at the same concentration as in the formulation used but without filming amines added figs 5 6 phase iii the data show that upon rinsing with either cha or deae solutions figs 5 6 or with milli q water fig 8 the overtones and the dissipation factors underwent minor changes and were markedly different from those measured before ffa1 or ffa2 were injected into the cell these results indicate that under the experimental conditions considered ffas from either ffa1 or ffa2 were irreversibly adsorbed onto the sensor surface after rinsing with cha and deae solutions in the long term experiments performed using low concentrations of the ffa formulations 25ppm volume based the kinetics of adsorption were extremely slow equilibrium was not attained even after 24h and the sensor needed to be exposed to a second injection of fresh formulation before an adsorption plateau was reached after 48h data only shown for the calculated sauerbrey mass in fig 8 the comparison between the equilibration time in slow and fast experiments shows that the kinetics of adsorption of ffas onto stainless steel displayed a marked dependence on the concentration long term experiments confirmed the irreversible adsorption of amines on stainless steel corroborating the results of fast qcm d experiments small changes in the overtones were detected upon rinsing with cha or deae solution and then with milli q water at ph 5 5 possibly due to bulk effects partial desorption or to a slight de swelling of the film as the ph was decreased however the overtones and the dissipation factors remained significantly different from the ones measured in milli q water before ffa1 or ffa2 were injected in the cell indicating irreversible adsorption the irreversible adsorption of ffa onto metal surfaces after rinsing with milli q was further probed with contact angle measurements as discussed in the following paragraph the comparison of the qcm d response after rinsing with the same fluid milli q water allows eliminating confounding factors such as bulk effects and differences in the ffa conformation at the surface in different water chemistries cha vs deae solutions and making an accurate comparison of the mass irreversibly adsorbed onto the sensor surface after injection of either ffa1 or ffa2 while differences in the mass adsorbed with ffa1 and ffa2 before rinsing with milli q cannot be discounted the differences in the overtones and the sauerbrey mass after rinsing with milli q were negligible phase v fig 8 strongly suggesting that the mass irreversibly adsorbed onto the sensor surface was similar with either ffa1 or ffa2 importantly the overtones measured after rinsing in tests conducted at high and low ffa concentrations were comparable suggesting that a similar mass was irreversibly adsorbed onto the stainless steel surface with either 25ppm or 2500ppm of formulation injected into the qcm d cell with either ffa1 or ffa2 the similarity of the mass irreversibly adsorbed onto stainless steel with ffa1 and ffa2 may explain the comparable corrosion inhibition achieved with the two formulations as assessed by visual inspection of the coupons as discussed earlier the irreversible adsorption of ffas suggested by qcm d experiments is in agreement with published literature reporting that amines can adsorb onto metal surfaces due to electrostatic attraction between the charged molecules and the charged metal as well as interactions of unshared electron pairs and of π electrons with the metal surface 30 31 it is reported that the effectiveness of corrosion inhibitors is correlated to the strength of the attraction between the amine and the surface 36 and the irreversible adsorption of either ffa1 and ffa2 therefore suggests that these inhibitors are effective in protecting the metal surface against corrosion in addition to good coverage the film structure and their hydrophobicity may also affect the ability of ffa films to impede corrosion qcm d data provided insights regarding the rigidity of the films the dissipation factor is correlated to the softness and the visco elastic properties of the films deposited on the sensor surface high ratios between the dissipation factor and the overtone suggest that the films formed are soft and visco elastic whereas small ratios are typical of relatively rigid and elastic films in this study the ratio between the shift in the dissipation factors and the shift in the overtones was small suggesting that films were fairly rigid and elastic for all the amine concentrations tested 37 given the rigidity of the films adsorbed at the sensor surface the sauerbrey equation was used to obtain an estimate of the mass adsorbed the irreversible mass adsorbed estimated using this method was 340 380ng cm2 approximately 4 10 3 g m 2 after rinsing with cha or deae in either the experiments conducted using low or high ffa formulation dosages see figs 7 8 the sauerbrey mass is in agreement with a previous study 31 in which the authors investigated adsorption of oleyldiamine n oleyl 1 3 propanediamine on stainless steel and reported coverages of 5 10 3 g m 2 2 10 3 g m 2 after a 3h adsorption period moreover the sauerbrey mass closely resembles results for lipid bilayers 38 however the sauerbrey mass is greatly different from the one estimated using the bengal rose test possibly due to six main reasons first of all qcm d experiments were conducted under laminar flow conditions whereas bengal rose tests were conducted under no flow stagnant conditions the different flow regime could have led to deposition of multilayers in bengal rose tests as opposed to monolayers in qcm d experiments secondly the porosity and roughness of the stainless steel sputter coated onto the qcm d sensor could differ from those of the metal coupons used in bengal rose tests thirdly in the bengal rose test the mass adsorbed on the coupon was estimated by measuring changes in the bulk concentrations rather than directly measuring the mass adsorbed onto the coupon fourthly deviations may be introduced when not all filming amine is available for photometric analysis for instance it is possible that in bengal rose tests ffa was sequestered by metal ions e g iron dissolved in solution due to the corrosion of the coupons leading to an overestimate of the ffa molecules adsorbed onto the surface of the coupons moreover the sauerbrey model was developed for perfectly rigid films uniformly adsorbed on the sensor in air whereas the films studies here were adsorbed in aqueous environments and were possibly inhomogeneous differences in the solution volume to steel area ratios used in the adsorption experiments may also have played a role to further understand the reason for the discrepancy in surface coverage ellipsometry measurements were conducted using ffa2 based on ellipsometry tests the dry adsorbed mass adsorbed from ffa2 formulation diluted to a dosage of 2500ppm was 360ng cm2 using a value of d n d c of 0 15 fig 9 changing the dn dc value between 0 13 valid for the non ionic surfactant pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether c12e5 and 0 18 valid for most globular proteins the adsorbed mass would only change by 4ng cm2 and 3 2ng cm2 respectively minimal changes in the adsorbed mass were observed upon rinsing the sensor with cha indicating that ffa films were irreversibly adsorbed at the sensor surface in agreement with qcm d and bengal rose data the mass estimated using ellipsometry measurements matches closely the sauerbrey mass estimated using qcm d data the comparison between the qcm d sauerbrey mass and ellipsometry data obtained using qcm d sensors under flow conditions and bengal rose results obtained with coupons under stagnant conditions suggests that the flow regime and the characteristics of the material used e g roughness have a major impact on the ffa mass adsorbed at the metal surface although there are fundamental differences between the sauerbrey mass and the mass estimated with the bengal rose test all datasets do indicate that ffas can yield comparable coverage of metal surfaces in the presence of either cha or deae thus protecting them against corrosion in a similar manner these data thus substantiate the use of formulation ffa2 as an environmentally more benign alternative to cha bearing ffa1 and are also in agreement with eis results and the visual observations of coupons soaked in solution for up to 24h supplementary material 3 4 contact angle measurements in addition to adequate coverage and film structure the hydrophobicity of the amine films and their ability to shield metal surfaces from corrodents in the water also plays a role in their effectiveness in inhibiting corrosion it is reported that hydrophobicity is an important parameter in controlling the performance of corrosion inhibitors in the case of amines 36 as well as of different types of corrosion inhibitors for instance it is reported that super hydrophobic films prepared by myristic acid significantly decreased the corrosion currents densities corrosion rates and double layer capacitance and simultaneously increased the values of polarization resistance of aluminium in sterile seawater 39 hydrophobicity was also reported to be an important parameter in determining the effectiveness of 12 aminododecanoic acid 40 and diquaternary ammonium surfactants 41 in protecting carbon steel surfaces against corrosion contact angle measurements were conducted to verify the formation of hydrophobic amine films able to repel water and inhibit corrosion of steel coupons all coupons were rinsed with unbuffered milli q water ph 5 5 and dried with nitrogen prior to contact angle measurements and the difference of the contact angles before and after immersion in amine solutions thus reflects the presence of irreversibly adsorbed amine films these results complement qcm d experiments in which the irreversible adsorption of ffa onto metal surfaces was verified after rinsing with cha and deae solutions as well as with milli q water the results of the contact angle measurements are graphically summarized in fig 10 te contact angles before immersion in solution were approximately 40 and 57 for the 316l and c1010 coupons respectively stainless steel 316l coupons did not corrode in milli q water at ph 9 0 with or without amines added however the changes in the contact angles measured for 316l coupons with time displayed a marked dependence on the water chemistry when amines were not added to milli q water at ph 9 0 the contact angles decreased with time conversely when amines were added the contact angles of stainless steel 316l coupons increased from 40 to 79 and 74 after 18h with ffa2 and ffa1 respectively these results indicate that the ffas had irreversibly adsorbed onto the coupon surface providing a hydrophobic barrier and rendering the metal surface only partially wettable thus inhibiting the progressive hydration of stainless steel these data are in agreement with qcm d results which showed that both ffa1 and ffa2 formed films that were irreversibly adsorbed at the stainless steel surface of the sensor under the experimental conditions considered after 24h soaking the contact angle of 316l coupons remained fairly constant and significantly higher than those measured without amines added without amines added carbon steel c1010 coupons corroded in milli q water at ph 9 0 and their contact angles were equal to approximately 4 5 and 0 after 18h and 24h respectively in the presence of either ffa1 or ffa2 corrosion of c1010 coupons was less marked than in the blank and the contact angles remained approximately constant for up to 24h the data show a correlation between contact angles and the degree of corrosion of c1010 coupons with the lowest contact angles measured for the most corroded metal surfaces qcm d measurements indicated that progressive adsorption occurred even after 18h whereas contact angles remained approximately constant from 18 to 24h these results may indicate that although the density of hydrophobic amine molecules on the steel surface increased steel surfaces progressively hydrated possibly due to partial permeability of the amine films to water to imperfections in the ffa films or to incomplete coverage the hypothesis of imperfections in the amine films and or of incomplete coverage may explain the differences in the contact angles measured for carbon steel and stainless steel coupons after exposure to ffa solutions for 18 and 24h the progressive hydration of c1010 in the absence of amines is in agreement with previous research showing that metal surfaces are strongly hydrated at alkaline ph 42 the partial permeability to water of amine films explains the presence of some corrosion product on the c1010 coupons soaked in water for 17 and 24h with either ffa1 or ffa2 however the extent of rusting in the presence of amines was markedly less than in milli q water without amines added the data reveal that both ffa formulations could adsorb onto either stainless steel 316l or carbon steel c1010 surfaces and that corrosion was inhibited by the formation of hydrophobic films with limited permeability to water the data further suggest that the hydrophobicity of the amine films obtained with either ffa1 or ffa2 was comparable indicating that the deae based ffa formulation can be a suitable substitute for its cha based counterpart in agreement with the eis qcm d and bengal rose test data discussed in the previous paragraphs it is noted that in addition to hydrophobicity and good coverage the lumo energy elumo 43 and the electron affinity 44 of corrosion inhibitors is also correlated to their performance specifically it was found that the performance of hydroxybenzaldehyde schiff bases increased with increasing elumo 43 it was further found that schiff bases synthesized by the condensation of isonicotinohydrazide and an appropriate aldehyde in methanolic solutions were most effective when their electron affinity was low 44 finally the flexibility of the corrosion inhibitor molecules can further affect the adsorption process and hence the effectiveness of the inhibitors 32 these aspects were not investigated in this study and will be the object of future research 4 conclusions the need to minimize the environmental impact of steam crackers by reusing water and treating it with environmentally benign chemicals has motivated this study which compares two commercially available corrosion inhibiting film forming amine ffa formulations to treat water steam cycles one formulation was cyclohexanamine cha based ffa1 whereas the other ffa2 contained 2 diethylamino ethanol deae as the neutralizing amine the data show that the two formulations increased the polarization resistance of metal surfaces in similar ways thus inhibiting their corrosion as demonstrated based on visual inspection of metal coupons the comparable performance of the two formulations was explained based on the coverage of the metal surface attained under flow and no flow conditions as well as on the structure and hydrophobicity of the ffa films bengal rose and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d data indicated that the mass adsorbed on stainless steel and carbon steel surfaces was similar with either ffa1 or ffa2 under either flow or no flow conditions suggesting that a similar coverage was attained with both formulations qcm d data and contact angle measurements further demonstrated that the films had similar rigidity and hydrophobicity shielding metal surfaces against water and providing equally good protection against corrosive water soluble species the combined results strongly suggest that in plant practice no notable difference in protection against corrosion is expected when cha based ffa formulations are substituted with environmentally more benign deae based alternatives acknowledgments the authors wish to warmly thank kirsten zimmer christoph weyn and julia jasper all of kurita for their support and

8836,numerous studies have been published on water footprints wfs of agricultural products but much less on wfs of industrial products the latter are often composed of various basic materials already the basic materials follow from a chain of processes each with its specific water consumption blue wf and pollution grey wf we assess blue and grey wfs of five construction materials chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement cem i portland composite cement cem ii b and soda lime glass blue and grey wfs are added up along production chains following life cycle inventory and wf accounting procedures steel cement and glass have wfs dominated by grey wfs that are 20 220 times larger than the blue wfs for steel critical pollutants are cadmium copper and mercury for cement these are mercury or cadmium for glass suspended solids blue wfs of steel cement and glass are mostly related to electricity use keywords water footprint life cycle assessment steel cement glass industrial water use 1 introduction societies depend on freshwater for drinking washing and cleaning and for the production of food materials and energy it is expected that between 2000 and 2050 global water abstractions from groundwater and surface water will increase by 55 particularly due to a growing water demand from manufacturing and thermal electricity generation 32 this will lead to unsustainable conditions in places where water is scarce and poorly managed 40 already today 3 3 billion people live in areas that experience severe water scarcity during at least a quarter per year 28 human impacts on freshwater systems can ultimately be linked to human consumption and water shortages and pollution can be better understood and addressed by considering water use along production and supply chains 15 while it is still most common to consider only the direct water use by households farmers manufacturers or other water users it is insightful to know water use of final products by summing up the water use in all steps of the supply chain which enables an analysis of which steps contribute most to the overall water use in the production of a product this enables further focus on how water use can best be reduced in the most critical steps of a supply chain the majority of previous studies to quantify the water use and pollution along the supply chain of specific products focussed on crop and animal products which are responsible for the largest amount of water consumption in the world the industrial sector is the second largest water user but product specific studies are still very scarce 16 steel cement and glass the focus of the current study are construction materials produced in millions of tonnes globally per year 31 37 46 in the production chain of steel cement and glass water is needed and polluted in several processes besides water is required indirectly for producing the energy applied in the production chain for example electricity produced in a power plant and used to mine iron ore needs cooling water in the production chain of construction materials emissions of toxic substances cause water pollution the water footprint of these materials is potentially large but never quantified before in general steel cement and glass industries do not consider their supply chain water use and limit their scope to their own operations for example the water reporting and accounting guidelines from the cement sustainability initiative excludes the supply chain 42 43 the objective of this research is to assess the blue and grey water footprint wf of the most commonly used types of steel cement and glass in terms of water volume per unit of mass of the end product the blue wf refers to the consumption of fresh groundwater or fresh surface water the grey wf refers to the volume of freshwater required to assimilate pollutants discharged into freshwater bodies 18 the following research questions are addressed what is the blue wf of the most commonly produced types of steel cement and flat glass produced by the most commonly used production routes what is the grey wf of these products accounting for different types of pollutants which processes give the largest contribution to the wfs of steel cement and glass and which substances determine the grey wf of steel cement and glass since steel cement and glass are basic construction materials the results of this study will be helpful in water footprint assessments for infrastructure or products containing these materials the study is based on the accounting procedures as commonly employed in life cycle assessment and following the global water footprint standard published by water footprint network 18 this paper is the first study that employs commonly used lca software and databases to estimate the blue and grey wf of steel cement and glass while life cycle assessment lca and water footprint assessment wfa have different roots the current study shows that methods and tools from both fields can effectively be combined the lca research field focusses on the quantification of potential environmental impacts of products considering a range of environmental issues e g climate change emissions of pollutants to do this first an inventory is made of all processes in a production chain advanced software programmes like gabi 13 and databases like ecoinvent 7 have been developed to support the execution of lca studies the interest in applying lca to water started to develop in 2009 30 and in response to that water use has been better incorporated in the lca databases wfa is a research field that has evolved since 2002 to address the relation between the consumption of goods and services on the one hand and water use scarcity and pollution on the other it is based on four notions 17 first freshwater is a global resource because people in one place use freshwater resources elsewhere the constituents for construction materials for example are mined all over the world transported produced and then distributed again the second notion is that freshwater renewal rates are limited over a certain period of time precipitation in an area recharging groundwater and river flows is always limited to a certain amount putting a constraint to water consumption if freshwater is consumed for the production of construction materials it cannot be applied anymore for other purposes hence the interest in where precisely scarce water resources are used for the third notion is that to understand the impacts of water consumption we need to consider complete production chains the fourth notion is that we need to consider both water consumption and water pollution lca and wfa serve different purposes but the inventory stage of lca and accounting stage of wfa require the same sort of supply chain analysis and data 3 the current study is innovative in showing how blue and grey wfs can be estimated employing lca software and databases 2 production chains of steel cement and glass 2 1 steel iron and steel have played an important role in the development of human civilisation in the 13th century bc steel was first produced and the iron age began 45 in modern society iron and steel have many applications such as for construction the automotive industry for tools and machinery the construction industry is the largest steel using industry accounting for more than 50 of the world steel production in 2015 the total world steel production was 1622 8 mt 46 steel is a product derived from iron with a small carbon content that is used for iron production when other metals are added to steel so termed alloys are produced stainless steel is an alloy that includes chromium nickel and manganese the majority of steel is unalloyed steel also called carbon steel of the worldwide steel production 89 is unalloyed steel and 11 is alloyed steel 38 there are several steel production routes the most common is the blast furnace bf basic oxygen furnace bof route the bf is a furnace where oxygen is removed from iron ore by binding it to carbon the bof is a furnace where the carbon content in the iron is lowered by blowing pure oxygen onto the metal in 2014 the bf bof route produces 74 of total steel 44 fig 1 shows the six steps of the steel production chain 1 mining of raw materials 2 processing of raw materials beneficiation calcination and coking 3 iron ore reduction 4 air separation 5 ferroalloy production and 5 steel production every step needs the input of energy red arrows and water blue arrows and results in the output of products black arrows in the first step the raw materials mainly consisting of iron ore limestone caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 coal and other ores for alloyed steel such as chromite and laterite are mined in the second step the properties of the raw materials are improved by the following processes a beneficiation the process where the ore concentration is increased and fine ore particles are bound to form pellets or sinter fine coke is the main energy source for sinter production 35 water is used for dust emission control sorting material cleaning cooling and gas treatment 41 b calcination the process to produce lime cao and calcined dolomite cao mgo from limestone caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 lime and dolomite remove impurities from steel 2 sometimes water is used to wash limestone mostly gas and solid fossil fuels are used for calcination 37 c coking the process that improves coal properties coal enters a coke oven resulting in cokes cokes have a higher carbon purity than coal and are strong enough to carry the other materials inside the blast furnace water is used for wet quenching of the cokes 35 in the third step iron ore cokes and limestone are put in the blast furnace to form pig iron reduced iron oxide iron ore oxide binds to carbon from cokes emitting carbon oxide forming pig iron a hot metal the limestone acts as a slag former removing iron impurities forming bf slag as a by product 35 water is used for blast furnace gas treatment slag granulation and cooling 35 in the fourth step air separation oxygen for steel production in the bof is produced by separating oxygen from the air 1 by blowing pure oxygen over the hot metal the metal carbon content is lowered water is used for cooling and electricity provides the energy required for air separation 1 ferrochrome and ferronickel are the major alloys used for stainless steel production the fifth step the production of alloyed steel a mix of iron and other metals is added to the basic oxygen furnace the production of ferroalloys generally requires large amounts of electricity water is used for gas treatment slag granulation and cooling 27 in the sixth step of steel production the pig iron from the iron ore reduction process step 3 which contains approximately 4 carbon is transported to the bof where the carbon content is reduced by blowing pure oxygen onto the hot metal forming steel slag formers such as lime are used to remove impurities from the steel forming bof slag 35 water is used for bof gas treatment vacuum generation cooling and washing 35 2 2 cement cement is an inorganic material that binds other materials like sand or gravel together it is a hydraulic binder which means that water is needed for the chemical reactions in order to harden concrete is a mixture of cement water sand and other aggregates such as gravel or crushed stone the world cement production has grown steadily especially in developing countries in 2006 world production was 2540 mt 37 every year more than 10 000 mt of concrete is produced 29 fig 2 shows the cement production chain which includes three main steps 1 extraction and pre processing of raw materials 2 pyroprocessing and 3 grinding and mixing the raw materials needed to produce cement are limestone or other caco3 containing materials sand clay and gypsum these materials are extracted from quarries gypsum is also a by product from flue gas desulphurisation a cleaning process in coal fired power plants other waste products can also be used for example ground granulated blast furnace slag a waste product from iron and steel production fly ash is another waste product that is often used it is produced from electrostatic precipitation of coal flue gas after extraction limestone is ground and washed to prepare for pyroprocessing the process of producing clinker from limestone and clay by using high temperatures in a rotating oven limestone and clay react to form fist and marble sized hard clumps called clinker pyroprocessing is an energy intensive process the amount of energy needed depends on the moisture content of the raw materials and the oven type used for the heating of the rotating ovens coal fuel oil natural gas or waste material can be used in special cases water is used for cooling of the clinker 37 in the last processing step the clinker from pyroprocessing is mixed with approximately 4 gypsum and is ground to portland cement the grinding of the clinker requires a large amount of electricity since the production of clinker by pyroprocessing and grinding is such an energy intensive process other additives can be used to reduce the amount of clinker in cement and to change cement properties an example of a clinker substitute is blast furnace slag a waste product from steel production 37 2 3 glass glass usually refers to silicate glass a substance containing a high proportion of silica sio2 that forms glass after cooling from its molten state glass is produced in many forms and used for many purposes it includes four main categories i container glass ii flat glass iii fibre glass and iv specialty glass glass production is dominated by container glass and flat glass the construction industry is very important for the glass industry since flat glass is applied in new buildings and for replacing old glass 36 in 2009 the global market demand for flat glass was 52 mt 31 fig 3 shows the flat glass production chain including three main steps 1 extraction and processing of raw materials 2 melting and 3 annealing and cutting in the first step most raw materials are extracted from mines or quarries appendix i in the supporting information si shows a typical composition of flat glass mainly silica sand soda ash limestone and often cullet recycled glass or waste glass from manufacturing 33 usually the cullet used for flat glass is from internal origin such as from cuttings and breakages before reuse the cullet is ground and washed 9 in some places in the world soda ash is mined but it can also be chemically produced by the so called solvay process the solvay process needs large amounts of water for cooling washing and as medium for the chemical process 22 in the second step the melting step the mixture that results after grinding and mixing is heated in a furnace at temperatures between 1300 and 2000 c depending on the type of glass the mixture is melted and becomes liquid glass by chemical reactions silicate bonds are created and gas is emitted 9 36 furnaces are in most cases heated by natural gas or fuel oil rarely by electricity mostly electricity is used in addition to fossil fuelled glass production 9 33 the third step includes the annealing and cutting of the material in the annealing stage the temperature is lower than in the melting stage the glass is cooled to 900 1350 c at this stage the impurities are being disposed of and all remaining soluble bubbles are reabsorbed into the melt 36 water is used for cooling 19 after cooling the glass edges are trimmed and the glass is cut to the desired shape the edge trimmings and broken glass usually return to the furnace for remelting 3 method and data unalloyed steel contributes 89 of the global steel production 38 chromium nickel steel is the most produced unalloyed steel 20 portland cement and portland composite cement are the two most supplied cement types accounting for 86 supplied in the eu 25 in 2005 37 soda lime glass is the most applied glass type float glass the most produced flat glass 36 the five end products included in this study are i unalloyed steel ii chromium nickel alloyed steel 18 8 iii portland cement cem i iv portland composite cement cem ii b and v soda lime float glass the processes in the production chains of these end products require water and energy and often have pollutant effluents we distinguished between a direct blue wf in each process wfproc blue and an indirect blue wf related to the energy input wfenergy blue that refers to the blue wf in the fuel or electricity supply chain for each process we considered the grey wf associated with the pollutants in process wastewater if applicable the wfs associated with the process steps were allocated to the end products fig 4 shows the calculation steps for many industrial processes the ecoinvent 3 2 database specifies input and output materials by products and waste products water abstraction evaporation and water discharge energy use and pollutants in effluents 7 unless mentioned otherwise data on inputs outputs were taken from the ecoinvent database 3 2 using global glo datasets data on energy and water use were taken from oecd and iea 33 and from jrc 21 24 to compare ecoinvent 3 2 data with independent sources we used remus et al 35 for steel scalet et al 36 for glass and schorcht et al 37 for cement in step 1 of the research we drew the process schematics and assessed the scaling factors for unalloyed steel chromium nickel alloyed steel portland cement portland composite cement and soda lime float glass si appendix ii a scaling factor scales each process to yield the amount of intermediate product required for one kilogram of end product the functional unit we used the lca software program gabi 13 to build process schematics based on production chains we used the program to keep track of the product flows between processes and to scale the processes to the end product output amounts in case a single process has multiple output products water and energy consumption and pollution were allocated over the output products following the method commonly applied in both lca and wfa studies 18 the value fraction f v of an output product p is defined as the ratio of its market value and the aggregated market value of all output products p 1 to z obtained from the input products 18 we allocated according to the value fractions of the output products 1 f v p price p w p 1 z price p w p both purposes are combined by gabi into one scaling factor the scaling factor of process i is 2 f s proc i f v p f w p f s proc i 1 in which f v p is the value fraction of product p f w p is the ratio between the weight of the input product p for process proci 1 and the weight of the same product p as output from the process proci f s proc i 1 is the scaling factor of the process i 1 in step 2 we estimated the blue wf per production process and the aggregate for each of our end products the process blue wf wf proc blue is the amount of fresh water that does not return to the same catchment within the same time period either by evaporation incorporation into the product or because it is returned to another catchment or in another time period 18 we calculated the blue wf per process using water abstraction and discharge data per production process l kg end product we assumed that the process blue wf is the difference between abstraction and discharge by multiplying by the corresponding scaling factor we calculated the process blue wfs of the end products steel cement and glass as 3 wf proc blue abstraction discharge f s volume mass si appendix iii gives data on process water per production process many industrial processes use energy in the form of electricity or heat heat can be generated through the burning of natural gas fuel oil coal or hard coal cokes to calculate the wf of steel cement and glass we also included the wf of energy in step 3 we calculated the value fractions of petroleum products and hard coal cokes we used data on global weighted average wfs of electricity natural gas and coal from mekonnen et al 26 heavy and light fuel oil and diesel are petroleum products derived from crude oil using eq 1 we calculated the value fractions f v of the petroleum products p and of the products from coking table a8 in appendix iv of the si shows the value fractions of the petroleum products table a9 in si appendix iv shows the value fractions of hard coal cokes and the other output products from coking in step 4 we assessed the blue wf of the energy sources based on the value fractions from step 3 we calculate the blue wf of diesel light fuel oil heavy fuel oil and hard coal cokes as follows 4 wf prod p wf proc i f p p i i 1 y wf prod i f p p i f v p volume mass for the distillation process of crude oil and coking of hard coal the process wf is given per unit of input product the given volume needs to be divided by the product fraction for that input product f p p i the wf of conventional oil ranges from 7 8 212l gj heat 26 for the calculation of the wf of derived products we used the median value of 20l gj data on the wf of refining of petroleum products of 1 53l l crude oil were taken from wu and chiu 48 the largest part is used for cooling for hard coal mekonnen et al 26 have given a blue wf of 6 6 228l gj with a median value of 15l gj which we used for the calculation of the wf of hard coal cokes ecoinvent 3 2 reports 0 0489 mj of electricity use and 0 62l of water evaporation for the process of coking with 1 38kg of hard coal as input table 1 shows the ranges and median value of the blue wf of the energy sources we used in the production processes of steel cement and glass the blue wf from natural gas coal and electricity were taken from mekonnen et al 26 we calculated the blue wf for diesel light fuel oil heavy fuel oil and hard coal cokes appendix iv in the si shows the blue wf of the other petroleum and coking products in step 5 we calculated the energy related blue wf wfenergy blue defined as the blue wf of the energy consumed for the production of the end product appendix v in the si gives the energy consumption for the production processes of steel cement and glass the third column shows the energy input per unit product mj kg from ecoinvent 3 2 2015 to assess the energy consumption per kg end product we multiplied these values by the corresponding scaling factor from step 1 giving the wfenergy blue per process in step 6 we scaled the effluent loads per process using the scaling factors from step one giving effluent loads substance loads biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod kg kg end product for different substances the ecoinvent 3 2 database provides effluent loads kg mass output material appendix vi in the si gives the scaled effluent loads per process in step 7 we applied the loads from the previous step to calculate the grey wf wf grey of the end products per polluting substance for all individual processes by dividing the scaled load of a substance by the assimilation capacity of the water body calculated as the difference between the maximum allowable concentration and the natural concentration 18 5 wf grey l c max c nat volume mass data on natural concentrations were taken from chapman 4 the grey wf manual 12 recommends using these values when local natural background concentrations cannot be used for the maximum allowable concentrations we derived data from franke et al 12 and used the lowest concentration for canada europe eu and the united states we took data on maximum concentrations for cod and bod from the eec 8 guideline the solvay process is the process of chemically producing soda ash according esapa 10 hydroxide is present in the effluent of this process the association does not set a maximum concentration for hydroxide however the ccme guideline advises a ph range of 6 5 9 12 in order to calculate the grey wf for hydroxide ions we adapted eq 5 to express the concentration cmax and cnat in a ph see appendix x in the si 4 results fig 5 shows the blue wfs of chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement portland composite cement and soda lime glass for the production process and for the energy related to the production process the blue wf for the process l kg is largest for steel and relatively small for cement the wf of glass finds itself in between the two extremes for steel the blue process wf of chromium nickel unalloyed steel is 43 larger than the blue wf of unalloyed steel for cement the blue process wf of portland cement is 17 larger than the blue wf of portland composite cement especially the blue wf of energy of chromium nickel unalloyed steel is relatively large six times the blue wf of the process to produce the steel for unalloyed steel the blue wf of energy is only half the blue wf of the process for cement the blue wf of energy is two times the blue wf of the process for glass the values are about the same fig 6 shows how the different processes of the supply chain contribute to the five end products considered a distinction is made between direct water use in production processes p and indirect water use for producing the energy used in production processes e for unalloyed steel the blue wf of 11 8l kg is dominated by the blue wf of energy needed for pelletizing 52 followed by the blue wf of energy needed for air separation and iron ore reduction 7 for chromium nickel unalloyed steel the blue wf of 76 9l kg is dominated by the blue wf of energy needed for mining of ferronickel 60 followed by the blue wf of energy for the pre treatment of ferrochromium 17 and the wf related to the production of steel 8 for portland cement the blue wf of 2 2l kg is dominated by the blue wf of energy needed for pyroprocessing of clinker 26 followed by the blue wf of energy for grinding and mixing of cement 26 and the blue wf of the grinding and mixing of cement 13 for portland composite cement the blue wf of 1 8l kg is also dominated by the blue wf of energy needed for pyroprocessing of clinker 36 followed by the blue wf of the energy for grinding and mixing of cement 31 and the blue wf of the crushing and washing limestone 12 for soda lime glass the blue wf of 5 9l kg is dominated by the blue wf of the solvay process to make soda ash 46 and the blue wf of the energy for glass production 36 fig 7 shows the grey wfs of chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement portland composite cement and soda lime glass for the production process unalloyed steel has the largest grey wf 51 larger than the grey wf of chromium nickel unalloyed steel the grey wfs of portland cement and portland composite cement are the same they are a factor of ten smaller than the grey wf of unalloyed steel the grey wf of soda lime float glass is 15 smaller than the grey wf of chromium nickel unalloyed steel and 75 smaller than the grey wf of unalloyed steel the grey wfs of steel cement and glass are much larger than the blue wfs chromium nickel unalloyed steel has a relatively large blue wf related to energy and therefore a relatively small grey to blue wf ratio of 20 for portland cement the grey to blue wf ratio is 97 for portland composite cement 117 for unalloyed steel 192 and for soda lime float glass 221 the grey wf is calculated per pollutant as the pollutant load divided by the difference between the maximum allowable concentration and the natural concentration for that pollutant the final grey wf is determined by the critical pollutant i e the one with the largest pollutant specific grey wf for unalloyed steel and for chromium nickel alloyed steel the cadmium concentration determines the grey wf see si appendix ix figs a14 and a17 for portland cement and portland composite cement mercury is the critical pollutant see si appendix ix figs a20 and a23 for glass the grey wf is determined by suspended solids see si appendix ix fig a26 5 discussion for the first time this study uses lca software and databases to estimate blue and grey wfs of products showing that methods tools and data from both fields can effectively be combined the inventory of all processes in a production chain and estimation of water consumption and pollution per link in the chain enable the assessment of the wfs of the end products and the identification of where in the chain the largest water consumption and pollution take place the study focused on the production of construction materials excluding transportation if the materials needed for the production process are mined and processed in different locations transportation is needed requiring energy that has a wf depending on the transport mode energy source and distance there is an additional energy requirement that also has a wf that needs to be taken into account however the energy requirement of transportation is small compared to the production processes and varies between 0 09 mj per 1000kg km for transport by ship over sea to 2 9 mj per 1000kg km for transportation by lorry 14 the ecoinvent database 3 2 has been an important source for process data when working with large compiled datasets errors cannot be excluded with full certainty at the time of consulting the database the cryogenic air separation for liquid oxygen contained an error reporting an evaporation of 860l kg liquid oxygen ecoinvent is currently working on reconsidering this number for this research we used the much smaller value of 2 7l kg liquid from althaus et al 1 that is based on the cooling water for an average produced waste heat amount the products from cryogenic air separation are 1kg oxygen 3 27kg nitrogen and 0 06kg argon resulting in a water consumption of 11 7l kg liquid oxygen the accuracy of this value can also be questioned because it is not specific for this process but shows the order of magnitude difference between the reported values the applied ecoinvent 3 2 database specifies input and output materials by products and waste products water abstraction evaporation and water discharge energy use and pollutants in effluents 7 data on inputs outputs were taken from the database using global glo datasets this means that the database gives global average numbers thus averaging over industries with higher than average effluent loads in their wastewater and industries using best practices we used the global weighted average wf of electricity from mekonnen et al 26 however wfs for electricity for a specific location may differ from the global average value for example some integrated steel plants generate their own electric power from off gasses 35 other steel plants are located in areas where the energy mix used for electricity generation substantially differs from the global average several plants use salt water instead of freshwater for cooling this can have an effect on the estimated wf since some forms of energy e g electricity from wind or photovoltaics geothermal energy have a much smaller wf than other forms of energy e g energy from fossil fuels firewood or hydropower 26 and the wf of using salt water is zero by definition the data from ecoinvent used for ferronickel is probably not accurate when the impact of ferronickel is large the data for nickel are based on a study of the energy and material streams from the production of class i nickel the lacking data mainly concern process specific emissions 5 the dataset is designed for the use of the metal as raw material in the manufacturing of stainless steels and alloys as has been done in this study however classen 5 mentions that when the impact of ferronickel is high the data should not be used we derived lacking data from similar processes for copper winning assuming the processes are similar this leads to an estimation of the wf of ferronickel and thus of chromium nickel alloyed steel the relatively large electricity use of melting ferronickel influences the blue wf of chromium nickel alloyed steel however the grey wf of ferronickel is not critical for the grey wf of chromium nickel steel furthermore ecoinvent did not report process water consumption for the production of ferronickel but jrc 24 reports 6 9m3 t water consumption for ferroalloys in general although not specifically for ferronickel the water uses are for wet off gas cleaning slag granulation and cooling most data on energy consumption from oecd iea jrc and ecoinvent 3 2 are similar however for the energy consumption of clinker production the energy consumption reported by ecoinvent is lower than that of oecd and iea 34 2 mj kg excluding waste products as fuel versus 2 9 6 7 mj kg depending on the production process and kiln technology the difference can partly be attributed to the fact that ecoinvent lists waste products used as fuel but these are not included in the reported 2 mj kg the wf related to energy from waste falls outside the system boundary of this research another issue regarding energy consumption data occurs for the case of the fuel distribution for glass melting ecoinvent mentions the following distribution 58 natural gas 38 heavy fuel oil and 5 electrical power according to scalet et al 36 an electrical boost of 10 is not uncommon since electrical power consumption has a large influence on the blue wf the blue wf using 10 electrical boost would be 4 0l kg glass instead of 2 2l kg glass appendix vii in the si shows the energy related wf of float glass with other energy distributions for float glass there are three alternative production possibilities for the calculation of the wf these possibilities were not taken into account for the solvay process we assumed the use of freshwater esapa 10 mentions that for brine production it is possible to use seawater when seawater is used the wf of the solvay process is much smaller than calculated in here as the brine production is a large water requiring process 10 we also excluded the alternative dry lime process instead of the usual use of liquid of lime this might reduce water consumption of the soda ash production furthermore no quantitative data were available on soda ash mining the wf of float glass using soda ash from mining is smaller than that of float glass using soda ash from the solvay process we did not calculate the wf of glass with natural sources of soda due to a lack of data the use of supplementary materials as clinker substitutes in cement production reduces greenhouse gas emissions 11 25 our results suggest that using clinker substitutes to produce portland composite cement instead of portland cement also reduces the wf related to the energy consumption for pyroprocessing crossin 6 notes that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using ground granulated blast furnace slag ggbfs depends on the definition of a byproduct if a byproduct is defined as a waste this affects the allocation and the processes included in the analysis the same argument applies for the wf of cement and other byproducts used as supplementary materials such as fly ash or gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation fgd it can be argued that the wf from fgd should not be allocated to cement but to power generation since this is a process to clean flue gas from power generation when this process is not allocated to gypsum and cement production the grey wf will be much lower the clinker production then results in a grey wf for the substance cadmium of 0 63l kg portland cement and 0 45l kg portland composite cement the results of the grey wf should be interpreted cautiously as the wastewater is not always specified as emitted to the environment it is unclear whether all effluent loads reported by the ecoinvent database are emitted to the environment we assumed here that ecoinvent gives the effluent loads after the process of wastewater treatment i e the actual loads to the environment in cases whereby wastewater is treated such that the loads reported by ecoinvent are actually too high we will have overestimated the grey wf furthermore the application of the grey wf concept implies that we have quantified the amount of water needed to dilute the chemical loads entering the water to accepted water quality standards we did not consider the fate of pollutants once entered into the water cadmium in the effluent of especially iron ore processing activities results in the largest grey wf of all reported substances low levels of maximum allowable concentrations for cadmium are a cause of the large grey wf prevention from entering the environment by reducing the load in the effluent may reduce the grey wf of iron and steel wqa 47 lists the following six treatment methods for reducing cadmium i strong acid cation resin ii weak acid cation resin iii reverse osmosis iv distillation v precipitation filtration and vi lime softening jrc 23 mentions several best available techniques to reduce emissions to water specifically for mining activities the method discussed by jrc 23 to remove dissolved metals uses the adsorption ability of finely ground tailings water treatment by precipitation for which sulphide or lime or a combination is used is also mentioned when we compare our results with results from the case study for tata steel in india 39 there are some differences we calculated a blue wf for steel ranging between 11l kg unalloyed steel and 77l kg chromium nickel unalloyed steel where unger et al 39 find a value of 4 2l kg steel we find that for steel the critical pollutant is cadmium the tata study indicates that suspended solids are the critical pollutant our results show a blue wf for cement between 1 7 and 2 6l kg the tata study finds a slightly higher value of 3 3l kg the comparison shows that in order to make a database for industrial products more case studies are needed 6 conclusion for chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement cem i portland composite cement cem ii b and soda lime glass the wf is dominated by the grey wf which is a factor of 20 220 larger than the blue wf chromium nickel alloyed steel 18 8 has a blue wf of 77l kg and a grey wf of 1500l kg with cadmium as the critical pollutant unalloyed steel has a blue wf of 11l kg and a grey wf of 2300l kg with again cadmium as the critical pollutant unalloyed steel has a much smaller blue wf than chromium nickel alloyed steel the ferroalloys are produced in electric arc furnaces which increases the blue wf related to electricity use however the grey wf of unalloyed steel is smaller than that of chromium nickel alloyed steel beneficiation of iron ore has the largest influence on the grey wf the use of ferroalloys in alloyed steel reduces the factor of beneficiation i e concentrating sintering and pelletizing of iron ore in steel making the production of ferroalloys adds to the grey wf of alloyed steel however not as much as the grey wf is reduced by using less iron ore after cadmium copper and mercury are the critical pollutants for the grey wf portland cement cem i has a blue wf of 2 0 2 6l kg depending on the source of gypsum the grey wf is 210l kg determined by mercury if gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation is used for the production without the use of gypsum the grey wf is 0 63l kg with cadmium as the critical pollutant portland composite cement cem ii b has a blue wf of 1 7 2 1l kg the grey wf is 210l kg with mercury as the dominant pollutant if gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation is used without gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation the grey wf is 0 45l kg determined by cadmium portland cement has a larger wf than portland composite cement clinker production by pyroprocessing contributes most to the blue wf due to high energy consumption the use of supplementary materials to substitute clinker reduces the wf of cement gypsum production from flue gas desulphurisation causes the largest grey wf of 210l kg cement determined by mercury from a wf point of view it would be better to use portland composite cement cem ii b instead of portland cement cem i if both types of cement have the right properties for the circumstances in which it is used soda lime float glass has a blue wf of 5 8l kg this is for glass that includes soda ash from the solvay process the grey wf of float glass is 1300l kg with suspended solids as the critical pollutant soda ash produced by the solvay process has a large influence on both the blue and grey wf of float glass the solvay process requires a large amount of water while the effluent of the solvay process contains high concentrations of heavy metals suspended solids and can have a high ph value the blue wf related to energy consumption is a significant part of the total blue wf of chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement portland composite cement and soda lime glass the production of these materials is energy demanding and includes large electricity use the wf of electricity is large compared to other energy sources like heat we showed that the energy related blue wf is dominated by electricity use when electricity production moves towards energy sources with a comparatively small wf e g solar wind and geothermal energy the wf of the electricity related wfs of construction materials can be substantially reduced appendix a supplementary material

8836,numerous studies have been published on water footprints wfs of agricultural products but much less on wfs of industrial products the latter are often composed of various basic materials already the basic materials follow from a chain of processes each with its specific water consumption blue wf and pollution grey wf we assess blue and grey wfs of five construction materials chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement cem i portland composite cement cem ii b and soda lime glass blue and grey wfs are added up along production chains following life cycle inventory and wf accounting procedures steel cement and glass have wfs dominated by grey wfs that are 20 220 times larger than the blue wfs for steel critical pollutants are cadmium copper and mercury for cement these are mercury or cadmium for glass suspended solids blue wfs of steel cement and glass are mostly related to electricity use keywords water footprint life cycle assessment steel cement glass industrial water use 1 introduction societies depend on freshwater for drinking washing and cleaning and for the production of food materials and energy it is expected that between 2000 and 2050 global water abstractions from groundwater and surface water will increase by 55 particularly due to a growing water demand from manufacturing and thermal electricity generation 32 this will lead to unsustainable conditions in places where water is scarce and poorly managed 40 already today 3 3 billion people live in areas that experience severe water scarcity during at least a quarter per year 28 human impacts on freshwater systems can ultimately be linked to human consumption and water shortages and pollution can be better understood and addressed by considering water use along production and supply chains 15 while it is still most common to consider only the direct water use by households farmers manufacturers or other water users it is insightful to know water use of final products by summing up the water use in all steps of the supply chain which enables an analysis of which steps contribute most to the overall water use in the production of a product this enables further focus on how water use can best be reduced in the most critical steps of a supply chain the majority of previous studies to quantify the water use and pollution along the supply chain of specific products focussed on crop and animal products which are responsible for the largest amount of water consumption in the world the industrial sector is the second largest water user but product specific studies are still very scarce 16 steel cement and glass the focus of the current study are construction materials produced in millions of tonnes globally per year 31 37 46 in the production chain of steel cement and glass water is needed and polluted in several processes besides water is required indirectly for producing the energy applied in the production chain for example electricity produced in a power plant and used to mine iron ore needs cooling water in the production chain of construction materials emissions of toxic substances cause water pollution the water footprint of these materials is potentially large but never quantified before in general steel cement and glass industries do not consider their supply chain water use and limit their scope to their own operations for example the water reporting and accounting guidelines from the cement sustainability initiative excludes the supply chain 42 43 the objective of this research is to assess the blue and grey water footprint wf of the most commonly used types of steel cement and glass in terms of water volume per unit of mass of the end product the blue wf refers to the consumption of fresh groundwater or fresh surface water the grey wf refers to the volume of freshwater required to assimilate pollutants discharged into freshwater bodies 18 the following research questions are addressed what is the blue wf of the most commonly produced types of steel cement and flat glass produced by the most commonly used production routes what is the grey wf of these products accounting for different types of pollutants which processes give the largest contribution to the wfs of steel cement and glass and which substances determine the grey wf of steel cement and glass since steel cement and glass are basic construction materials the results of this study will be helpful in water footprint assessments for infrastructure or products containing these materials the study is based on the accounting procedures as commonly employed in life cycle assessment and following the global water footprint standard published by water footprint network 18 this paper is the first study that employs commonly used lca software and databases to estimate the blue and grey wf of steel cement and glass while life cycle assessment lca and water footprint assessment wfa have different roots the current study shows that methods and tools from both fields can effectively be combined the lca research field focusses on the quantification of potential environmental impacts of products considering a range of environmental issues e g climate change emissions of pollutants to do this first an inventory is made of all processes in a production chain advanced software programmes like gabi 13 and databases like ecoinvent 7 have been developed to support the execution of lca studies the interest in applying lca to water started to develop in 2009 30 and in response to that water use has been better incorporated in the lca databases wfa is a research field that has evolved since 2002 to address the relation between the consumption of goods and services on the one hand and water use scarcity and pollution on the other it is based on four notions 17 first freshwater is a global resource because people in one place use freshwater resources elsewhere the constituents for construction materials for example are mined all over the world transported produced and then distributed again the second notion is that freshwater renewal rates are limited over a certain period of time precipitation in an area recharging groundwater and river flows is always limited to a certain amount putting a constraint to water consumption if freshwater is consumed for the production of construction materials it cannot be applied anymore for other purposes hence the interest in where precisely scarce water resources are used for the third notion is that to understand the impacts of water consumption we need to consider complete production chains the fourth notion is that we need to consider both water consumption and water pollution lca and wfa serve different purposes but the inventory stage of lca and accounting stage of wfa require the same sort of supply chain analysis and data 3 the current study is innovative in showing how blue and grey wfs can be estimated employing lca software and databases 2 production chains of steel cement and glass 2 1 steel iron and steel have played an important role in the development of human civilisation in the 13th century bc steel was first produced and the iron age began 45 in modern society iron and steel have many applications such as for construction the automotive industry for tools and machinery the construction industry is the largest steel using industry accounting for more than 50 of the world steel production in 2015 the total world steel production was 1622 8 mt 46 steel is a product derived from iron with a small carbon content that is used for iron production when other metals are added to steel so termed alloys are produced stainless steel is an alloy that includes chromium nickel and manganese the majority of steel is unalloyed steel also called carbon steel of the worldwide steel production 89 is unalloyed steel and 11 is alloyed steel 38 there are several steel production routes the most common is the blast furnace bf basic oxygen furnace bof route the bf is a furnace where oxygen is removed from iron ore by binding it to carbon the bof is a furnace where the carbon content in the iron is lowered by blowing pure oxygen onto the metal in 2014 the bf bof route produces 74 of total steel 44 fig 1 shows the six steps of the steel production chain 1 mining of raw materials 2 processing of raw materials beneficiation calcination and coking 3 iron ore reduction 4 air separation 5 ferroalloy production and 5 steel production every step needs the input of energy red arrows and water blue arrows and results in the output of products black arrows in the first step the raw materials mainly consisting of iron ore limestone caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 coal and other ores for alloyed steel such as chromite and laterite are mined in the second step the properties of the raw materials are improved by the following processes a beneficiation the process where the ore concentration is increased and fine ore particles are bound to form pellets or sinter fine coke is the main energy source for sinter production 35 water is used for dust emission control sorting material cleaning cooling and gas treatment 41 b calcination the process to produce lime cao and calcined dolomite cao mgo from limestone caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 lime and dolomite remove impurities from steel 2 sometimes water is used to wash limestone mostly gas and solid fossil fuels are used for calcination 37 c coking the process that improves coal properties coal enters a coke oven resulting in cokes cokes have a higher carbon purity than coal and are strong enough to carry the other materials inside the blast furnace water is used for wet quenching of the cokes 35 in the third step iron ore cokes and limestone are put in the blast furnace to form pig iron reduced iron oxide iron ore oxide binds to carbon from cokes emitting carbon oxide forming pig iron a hot metal the limestone acts as a slag former removing iron impurities forming bf slag as a by product 35 water is used for blast furnace gas treatment slag granulation and cooling 35 in the fourth step air separation oxygen for steel production in the bof is produced by separating oxygen from the air 1 by blowing pure oxygen over the hot metal the metal carbon content is lowered water is used for cooling and electricity provides the energy required for air separation 1 ferrochrome and ferronickel are the major alloys used for stainless steel production the fifth step the production of alloyed steel a mix of iron and other metals is added to the basic oxygen furnace the production of ferroalloys generally requires large amounts of electricity water is used for gas treatment slag granulation and cooling 27 in the sixth step of steel production the pig iron from the iron ore reduction process step 3 which contains approximately 4 carbon is transported to the bof where the carbon content is reduced by blowing pure oxygen onto the hot metal forming steel slag formers such as lime are used to remove impurities from the steel forming bof slag 35 water is used for bof gas treatment vacuum generation cooling and washing 35 2 2 cement cement is an inorganic material that binds other materials like sand or gravel together it is a hydraulic binder which means that water is needed for the chemical reactions in order to harden concrete is a mixture of cement water sand and other aggregates such as gravel or crushed stone the world cement production has grown steadily especially in developing countries in 2006 world production was 2540 mt 37 every year more than 10 000 mt of concrete is produced 29 fig 2 shows the cement production chain which includes three main steps 1 extraction and pre processing of raw materials 2 pyroprocessing and 3 grinding and mixing the raw materials needed to produce cement are limestone or other caco3 containing materials sand clay and gypsum these materials are extracted from quarries gypsum is also a by product from flue gas desulphurisation a cleaning process in coal fired power plants other waste products can also be used for example ground granulated blast furnace slag a waste product from iron and steel production fly ash is another waste product that is often used it is produced from electrostatic precipitation of coal flue gas after extraction limestone is ground and washed to prepare for pyroprocessing the process of producing clinker from limestone and clay by using high temperatures in a rotating oven limestone and clay react to form fist and marble sized hard clumps called clinker pyroprocessing is an energy intensive process the amount of energy needed depends on the moisture content of the raw materials and the oven type used for the heating of the rotating ovens coal fuel oil natural gas or waste material can be used in special cases water is used for cooling of the clinker 37 in the last processing step the clinker from pyroprocessing is mixed with approximately 4 gypsum and is ground to portland cement the grinding of the clinker requires a large amount of electricity since the production of clinker by pyroprocessing and grinding is such an energy intensive process other additives can be used to reduce the amount of clinker in cement and to change cement properties an example of a clinker substitute is blast furnace slag a waste product from steel production 37 2 3 glass glass usually refers to silicate glass a substance containing a high proportion of silica sio2 that forms glass after cooling from its molten state glass is produced in many forms and used for many purposes it includes four main categories i container glass ii flat glass iii fibre glass and iv specialty glass glass production is dominated by container glass and flat glass the construction industry is very important for the glass industry since flat glass is applied in new buildings and for replacing old glass 36 in 2009 the global market demand for flat glass was 52 mt 31 fig 3 shows the flat glass production chain including three main steps 1 extraction and processing of raw materials 2 melting and 3 annealing and cutting in the first step most raw materials are extracted from mines or quarries appendix i in the supporting information si shows a typical composition of flat glass mainly silica sand soda ash limestone and often cullet recycled glass or waste glass from manufacturing 33 usually the cullet used for flat glass is from internal origin such as from cuttings and breakages before reuse the cullet is ground and washed 9 in some places in the world soda ash is mined but it can also be chemically produced by the so called solvay process the solvay process needs large amounts of water for cooling washing and as medium for the chemical process 22 in the second step the melting step the mixture that results after grinding and mixing is heated in a furnace at temperatures between 1300 and 2000 c depending on the type of glass the mixture is melted and becomes liquid glass by chemical reactions silicate bonds are created and gas is emitted 9 36 furnaces are in most cases heated by natural gas or fuel oil rarely by electricity mostly electricity is used in addition to fossil fuelled glass production 9 33 the third step includes the annealing and cutting of the material in the annealing stage the temperature is lower than in the melting stage the glass is cooled to 900 1350 c at this stage the impurities are being disposed of and all remaining soluble bubbles are reabsorbed into the melt 36 water is used for cooling 19 after cooling the glass edges are trimmed and the glass is cut to the desired shape the edge trimmings and broken glass usually return to the furnace for remelting 3 method and data unalloyed steel contributes 89 of the global steel production 38 chromium nickel steel is the most produced unalloyed steel 20 portland cement and portland composite cement are the two most supplied cement types accounting for 86 supplied in the eu 25 in 2005 37 soda lime glass is the most applied glass type float glass the most produced flat glass 36 the five end products included in this study are i unalloyed steel ii chromium nickel alloyed steel 18 8 iii portland cement cem i iv portland composite cement cem ii b and v soda lime float glass the processes in the production chains of these end products require water and energy and often have pollutant effluents we distinguished between a direct blue wf in each process wfproc blue and an indirect blue wf related to the energy input wfenergy blue that refers to the blue wf in the fuel or electricity supply chain for each process we considered the grey wf associated with the pollutants in process wastewater if applicable the wfs associated with the process steps were allocated to the end products fig 4 shows the calculation steps for many industrial processes the ecoinvent 3 2 database specifies input and output materials by products and waste products water abstraction evaporation and water discharge energy use and pollutants in effluents 7 unless mentioned otherwise data on inputs outputs were taken from the ecoinvent database 3 2 using global glo datasets data on energy and water use were taken from oecd and iea 33 and from jrc 21 24 to compare ecoinvent 3 2 data with independent sources we used remus et al 35 for steel scalet et al 36 for glass and schorcht et al 37 for cement in step 1 of the research we drew the process schematics and assessed the scaling factors for unalloyed steel chromium nickel alloyed steel portland cement portland composite cement and soda lime float glass si appendix ii a scaling factor scales each process to yield the amount of intermediate product required for one kilogram of end product the functional unit we used the lca software program gabi 13 to build process schematics based on production chains we used the program to keep track of the product flows between processes and to scale the processes to the end product output amounts in case a single process has multiple output products water and energy consumption and pollution were allocated over the output products following the method commonly applied in both lca and wfa studies 18 the value fraction f v of an output product p is defined as the ratio of its market value and the aggregated market value of all output products p 1 to z obtained from the input products 18 we allocated according to the value fractions of the output products 1 f v p price p w p 1 z price p w p both purposes are combined by gabi into one scaling factor the scaling factor of process i is 2 f s proc i f v p f w p f s proc i 1 in which f v p is the value fraction of product p f w p is the ratio between the weight of the input product p for process proci 1 and the weight of the same product p as output from the process proci f s proc i 1 is the scaling factor of the process i 1 in step 2 we estimated the blue wf per production process and the aggregate for each of our end products the process blue wf wf proc blue is the amount of fresh water that does not return to the same catchment within the same time period either by evaporation incorporation into the product or because it is returned to another catchment or in another time period 18 we calculated the blue wf per process using water abstraction and discharge data per production process l kg end product we assumed that the process blue wf is the difference between abstraction and discharge by multiplying by the corresponding scaling factor we calculated the process blue wfs of the end products steel cement and glass as 3 wf proc blue abstraction discharge f s volume mass si appendix iii gives data on process water per production process many industrial processes use energy in the form of electricity or heat heat can be generated through the burning of natural gas fuel oil coal or hard coal cokes to calculate the wf of steel cement and glass we also included the wf of energy in step 3 we calculated the value fractions of petroleum products and hard coal cokes we used data on global weighted average wfs of electricity natural gas and coal from mekonnen et al 26 heavy and light fuel oil and diesel are petroleum products derived from crude oil using eq 1 we calculated the value fractions f v of the petroleum products p and of the products from coking table a8 in appendix iv of the si shows the value fractions of the petroleum products table a9 in si appendix iv shows the value fractions of hard coal cokes and the other output products from coking in step 4 we assessed the blue wf of the energy sources based on the value fractions from step 3 we calculate the blue wf of diesel light fuel oil heavy fuel oil and hard coal cokes as follows 4 wf prod p wf proc i f p p i i 1 y wf prod i f p p i f v p volume mass for the distillation process of crude oil and coking of hard coal the process wf is given per unit of input product the given volume needs to be divided by the product fraction for that input product f p p i the wf of conventional oil ranges from 7 8 212l gj heat 26 for the calculation of the wf of derived products we used the median value of 20l gj data on the wf of refining of petroleum products of 1 53l l crude oil were taken from wu and chiu 48 the largest part is used for cooling for hard coal mekonnen et al 26 have given a blue wf of 6 6 228l gj with a median value of 15l gj which we used for the calculation of the wf of hard coal cokes ecoinvent 3 2 reports 0 0489 mj of electricity use and 0 62l of water evaporation for the process of coking with 1 38kg of hard coal as input table 1 shows the ranges and median value of the blue wf of the energy sources we used in the production processes of steel cement and glass the blue wf from natural gas coal and electricity were taken from mekonnen et al 26 we calculated the blue wf for diesel light fuel oil heavy fuel oil and hard coal cokes appendix iv in the si shows the blue wf of the other petroleum and coking products in step 5 we calculated the energy related blue wf wfenergy blue defined as the blue wf of the energy consumed for the production of the end product appendix v in the si gives the energy consumption for the production processes of steel cement and glass the third column shows the energy input per unit product mj kg from ecoinvent 3 2 2015 to assess the energy consumption per kg end product we multiplied these values by the corresponding scaling factor from step 1 giving the wfenergy blue per process in step 6 we scaled the effluent loads per process using the scaling factors from step one giving effluent loads substance loads biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod kg kg end product for different substances the ecoinvent 3 2 database provides effluent loads kg mass output material appendix vi in the si gives the scaled effluent loads per process in step 7 we applied the loads from the previous step to calculate the grey wf wf grey of the end products per polluting substance for all individual processes by dividing the scaled load of a substance by the assimilation capacity of the water body calculated as the difference between the maximum allowable concentration and the natural concentration 18 5 wf grey l c max c nat volume mass data on natural concentrations were taken from chapman 4 the grey wf manual 12 recommends using these values when local natural background concentrations cannot be used for the maximum allowable concentrations we derived data from franke et al 12 and used the lowest concentration for canada europe eu and the united states we took data on maximum concentrations for cod and bod from the eec 8 guideline the solvay process is the process of chemically producing soda ash according esapa 10 hydroxide is present in the effluent of this process the association does not set a maximum concentration for hydroxide however the ccme guideline advises a ph range of 6 5 9 12 in order to calculate the grey wf for hydroxide ions we adapted eq 5 to express the concentration cmax and cnat in a ph see appendix x in the si 4 results fig 5 shows the blue wfs of chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement portland composite cement and soda lime glass for the production process and for the energy related to the production process the blue wf for the process l kg is largest for steel and relatively small for cement the wf of glass finds itself in between the two extremes for steel the blue process wf of chromium nickel unalloyed steel is 43 larger than the blue wf of unalloyed steel for cement the blue process wf of portland cement is 17 larger than the blue wf of portland composite cement especially the blue wf of energy of chromium nickel unalloyed steel is relatively large six times the blue wf of the process to produce the steel for unalloyed steel the blue wf of energy is only half the blue wf of the process for cement the blue wf of energy is two times the blue wf of the process for glass the values are about the same fig 6 shows how the different processes of the supply chain contribute to the five end products considered a distinction is made between direct water use in production processes p and indirect water use for producing the energy used in production processes e for unalloyed steel the blue wf of 11 8l kg is dominated by the blue wf of energy needed for pelletizing 52 followed by the blue wf of energy needed for air separation and iron ore reduction 7 for chromium nickel unalloyed steel the blue wf of 76 9l kg is dominated by the blue wf of energy needed for mining of ferronickel 60 followed by the blue wf of energy for the pre treatment of ferrochromium 17 and the wf related to the production of steel 8 for portland cement the blue wf of 2 2l kg is dominated by the blue wf of energy needed for pyroprocessing of clinker 26 followed by the blue wf of energy for grinding and mixing of cement 26 and the blue wf of the grinding and mixing of cement 13 for portland composite cement the blue wf of 1 8l kg is also dominated by the blue wf of energy needed for pyroprocessing of clinker 36 followed by the blue wf of the energy for grinding and mixing of cement 31 and the blue wf of the crushing and washing limestone 12 for soda lime glass the blue wf of 5 9l kg is dominated by the blue wf of the solvay process to make soda ash 46 and the blue wf of the energy for glass production 36 fig 7 shows the grey wfs of chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement portland composite cement and soda lime glass for the production process unalloyed steel has the largest grey wf 51 larger than the grey wf of chromium nickel unalloyed steel the grey wfs of portland cement and portland composite cement are the same they are a factor of ten smaller than the grey wf of unalloyed steel the grey wf of soda lime float glass is 15 smaller than the grey wf of chromium nickel unalloyed steel and 75 smaller than the grey wf of unalloyed steel the grey wfs of steel cement and glass are much larger than the blue wfs chromium nickel unalloyed steel has a relatively large blue wf related to energy and therefore a relatively small grey to blue wf ratio of 20 for portland cement the grey to blue wf ratio is 97 for portland composite cement 117 for unalloyed steel 192 and for soda lime float glass 221 the grey wf is calculated per pollutant as the pollutant load divided by the difference between the maximum allowable concentration and the natural concentration for that pollutant the final grey wf is determined by the critical pollutant i e the one with the largest pollutant specific grey wf for unalloyed steel and for chromium nickel alloyed steel the cadmium concentration determines the grey wf see si appendix ix figs a14 and a17 for portland cement and portland composite cement mercury is the critical pollutant see si appendix ix figs a20 and a23 for glass the grey wf is determined by suspended solids see si appendix ix fig a26 5 discussion for the first time this study uses lca software and databases to estimate blue and grey wfs of products showing that methods tools and data from both fields can effectively be combined the inventory of all processes in a production chain and estimation of water consumption and pollution per link in the chain enable the assessment of the wfs of the end products and the identification of where in the chain the largest water consumption and pollution take place the study focused on the production of construction materials excluding transportation if the materials needed for the production process are mined and processed in different locations transportation is needed requiring energy that has a wf depending on the transport mode energy source and distance there is an additional energy requirement that also has a wf that needs to be taken into account however the energy requirement of transportation is small compared to the production processes and varies between 0 09 mj per 1000kg km for transport by ship over sea to 2 9 mj per 1000kg km for transportation by lorry 14 the ecoinvent database 3 2 has been an important source for process data when working with large compiled datasets errors cannot be excluded with full certainty at the time of consulting the database the cryogenic air separation for liquid oxygen contained an error reporting an evaporation of 860l kg liquid oxygen ecoinvent is currently working on reconsidering this number for this research we used the much smaller value of 2 7l kg liquid from althaus et al 1 that is based on the cooling water for an average produced waste heat amount the products from cryogenic air separation are 1kg oxygen 3 27kg nitrogen and 0 06kg argon resulting in a water consumption of 11 7l kg liquid oxygen the accuracy of this value can also be questioned because it is not specific for this process but shows the order of magnitude difference between the reported values the applied ecoinvent 3 2 database specifies input and output materials by products and waste products water abstraction evaporation and water discharge energy use and pollutants in effluents 7 data on inputs outputs were taken from the database using global glo datasets this means that the database gives global average numbers thus averaging over industries with higher than average effluent loads in their wastewater and industries using best practices we used the global weighted average wf of electricity from mekonnen et al 26 however wfs for electricity for a specific location may differ from the global average value for example some integrated steel plants generate their own electric power from off gasses 35 other steel plants are located in areas where the energy mix used for electricity generation substantially differs from the global average several plants use salt water instead of freshwater for cooling this can have an effect on the estimated wf since some forms of energy e g electricity from wind or photovoltaics geothermal energy have a much smaller wf than other forms of energy e g energy from fossil fuels firewood or hydropower 26 and the wf of using salt water is zero by definition the data from ecoinvent used for ferronickel is probably not accurate when the impact of ferronickel is large the data for nickel are based on a study of the energy and material streams from the production of class i nickel the lacking data mainly concern process specific emissions 5 the dataset is designed for the use of the metal as raw material in the manufacturing of stainless steels and alloys as has been done in this study however classen 5 mentions that when the impact of ferronickel is high the data should not be used we derived lacking data from similar processes for copper winning assuming the processes are similar this leads to an estimation of the wf of ferronickel and thus of chromium nickel alloyed steel the relatively large electricity use of melting ferronickel influences the blue wf of chromium nickel alloyed steel however the grey wf of ferronickel is not critical for the grey wf of chromium nickel steel furthermore ecoinvent did not report process water consumption for the production of ferronickel but jrc 24 reports 6 9m3 t water consumption for ferroalloys in general although not specifically for ferronickel the water uses are for wet off gas cleaning slag granulation and cooling most data on energy consumption from oecd iea jrc and ecoinvent 3 2 are similar however for the energy consumption of clinker production the energy consumption reported by ecoinvent is lower than that of oecd and iea 34 2 mj kg excluding waste products as fuel versus 2 9 6 7 mj kg depending on the production process and kiln technology the difference can partly be attributed to the fact that ecoinvent lists waste products used as fuel but these are not included in the reported 2 mj kg the wf related to energy from waste falls outside the system boundary of this research another issue regarding energy consumption data occurs for the case of the fuel distribution for glass melting ecoinvent mentions the following distribution 58 natural gas 38 heavy fuel oil and 5 electrical power according to scalet et al 36 an electrical boost of 10 is not uncommon since electrical power consumption has a large influence on the blue wf the blue wf using 10 electrical boost would be 4 0l kg glass instead of 2 2l kg glass appendix vii in the si shows the energy related wf of float glass with other energy distributions for float glass there are three alternative production possibilities for the calculation of the wf these possibilities were not taken into account for the solvay process we assumed the use of freshwater esapa 10 mentions that for brine production it is possible to use seawater when seawater is used the wf of the solvay process is much smaller than calculated in here as the brine production is a large water requiring process 10 we also excluded the alternative dry lime process instead of the usual use of liquid of lime this might reduce water consumption of the soda ash production furthermore no quantitative data were available on soda ash mining the wf of float glass using soda ash from mining is smaller than that of float glass using soda ash from the solvay process we did not calculate the wf of glass with natural sources of soda due to a lack of data the use of supplementary materials as clinker substitutes in cement production reduces greenhouse gas emissions 11 25 our results suggest that using clinker substitutes to produce portland composite cement instead of portland cement also reduces the wf related to the energy consumption for pyroprocessing crossin 6 notes that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using ground granulated blast furnace slag ggbfs depends on the definition of a byproduct if a byproduct is defined as a waste this affects the allocation and the processes included in the analysis the same argument applies for the wf of cement and other byproducts used as supplementary materials such as fly ash or gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation fgd it can be argued that the wf from fgd should not be allocated to cement but to power generation since this is a process to clean flue gas from power generation when this process is not allocated to gypsum and cement production the grey wf will be much lower the clinker production then results in a grey wf for the substance cadmium of 0 63l kg portland cement and 0 45l kg portland composite cement the results of the grey wf should be interpreted cautiously as the wastewater is not always specified as emitted to the environment it is unclear whether all effluent loads reported by the ecoinvent database are emitted to the environment we assumed here that ecoinvent gives the effluent loads after the process of wastewater treatment i e the actual loads to the environment in cases whereby wastewater is treated such that the loads reported by ecoinvent are actually too high we will have overestimated the grey wf furthermore the application of the grey wf concept implies that we have quantified the amount of water needed to dilute the chemical loads entering the water to accepted water quality standards we did not consider the fate of pollutants once entered into the water cadmium in the effluent of especially iron ore processing activities results in the largest grey wf of all reported substances low levels of maximum allowable concentrations for cadmium are a cause of the large grey wf prevention from entering the environment by reducing the load in the effluent may reduce the grey wf of iron and steel wqa 47 lists the following six treatment methods for reducing cadmium i strong acid cation resin ii weak acid cation resin iii reverse osmosis iv distillation v precipitation filtration and vi lime softening jrc 23 mentions several best available techniques to reduce emissions to water specifically for mining activities the method discussed by jrc 23 to remove dissolved metals uses the adsorption ability of finely ground tailings water treatment by precipitation for which sulphide or lime or a combination is used is also mentioned when we compare our results with results from the case study for tata steel in india 39 there are some differences we calculated a blue wf for steel ranging between 11l kg unalloyed steel and 77l kg chromium nickel unalloyed steel where unger et al 39 find a value of 4 2l kg steel we find that for steel the critical pollutant is cadmium the tata study indicates that suspended solids are the critical pollutant our results show a blue wf for cement between 1 7 and 2 6l kg the tata study finds a slightly higher value of 3 3l kg the comparison shows that in order to make a database for industrial products more case studies are needed 6 conclusion for chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement cem i portland composite cement cem ii b and soda lime glass the wf is dominated by the grey wf which is a factor of 20 220 larger than the blue wf chromium nickel alloyed steel 18 8 has a blue wf of 77l kg and a grey wf of 1500l kg with cadmium as the critical pollutant unalloyed steel has a blue wf of 11l kg and a grey wf of 2300l kg with again cadmium as the critical pollutant unalloyed steel has a much smaller blue wf than chromium nickel alloyed steel the ferroalloys are produced in electric arc furnaces which increases the blue wf related to electricity use however the grey wf of unalloyed steel is smaller than that of chromium nickel alloyed steel beneficiation of iron ore has the largest influence on the grey wf the use of ferroalloys in alloyed steel reduces the factor of beneficiation i e concentrating sintering and pelletizing of iron ore in steel making the production of ferroalloys adds to the grey wf of alloyed steel however not as much as the grey wf is reduced by using less iron ore after cadmium copper and mercury are the critical pollutants for the grey wf portland cement cem i has a blue wf of 2 0 2 6l kg depending on the source of gypsum the grey wf is 210l kg determined by mercury if gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation is used for the production without the use of gypsum the grey wf is 0 63l kg with cadmium as the critical pollutant portland composite cement cem ii b has a blue wf of 1 7 2 1l kg the grey wf is 210l kg with mercury as the dominant pollutant if gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation is used without gypsum from flue gas desulphurisation the grey wf is 0 45l kg determined by cadmium portland cement has a larger wf than portland composite cement clinker production by pyroprocessing contributes most to the blue wf due to high energy consumption the use of supplementary materials to substitute clinker reduces the wf of cement gypsum production from flue gas desulphurisation causes the largest grey wf of 210l kg cement determined by mercury from a wf point of view it would be better to use portland composite cement cem ii b instead of portland cement cem i if both types of cement have the right properties for the circumstances in which it is used soda lime float glass has a blue wf of 5 8l kg this is for glass that includes soda ash from the solvay process the grey wf of float glass is 1300l kg with suspended solids as the critical pollutant soda ash produced by the solvay process has a large influence on both the blue and grey wf of float glass the solvay process requires a large amount of water while the effluent of the solvay process contains high concentrations of heavy metals suspended solids and can have a high ph value the blue wf related to energy consumption is a significant part of the total blue wf of chromium nickel unalloyed steel unalloyed steel portland cement portland composite cement and soda lime glass the production of these materials is energy demanding and includes large electricity use the wf of electricity is large compared to other energy sources like heat we showed that the energy related blue wf is dominated by electricity use when electricity production moves towards energy sources with a comparatively small wf e g solar wind and geothermal energy the wf of the electricity related wfs of construction materials can be substantially reduced appendix a supplementary material

8837,this study was aimed at establishing a water quality database in the study area where none existed previously samples were taken from two different sites of river oluwa south western nigeria physicochemical and biological factors and the metals for one year april 2011 march 2012 were evaluated using standard methods all the physical parameters of the water samples from the two sampling sites did not show deviations from nigeria industrial standard nis for permissible levels of these parameters in drinking water virtually all heavy metals investigated deviated from the permissible levels allowed by nis and who standards in drinking water in the same vein all chemical parameters investigated during the dry season was significantly different from rainy season except for bod at p 0 05 isolated microorganisms include members of the genera bacillus micrococcus pseudomonas streptococcus proteus and staphylococcus the public health implications of consuming water from this river are fully discussed keywords bitumen drinking water health nigeria pollution standards 1 introduction one of the globally recognized health related programs and campaigns is the provision of potable and safe water especially in rural communities 1 due to the important roles play by water in supporting life and wellness 2 7 it has been reported an estimated 1 1 billion people do not have access to adequate and uninterrupted water supplies which has been linked to about 4 billion diarrhea outbreak and well over 5 million annual global deaths 8 9 researchers have reported the major causes of these shortfalls in clean water supplies to be improper management the upsurge in industrial developments and its attendant pollution menace alarming population growth unfavorable policy implementation of water related projects all these factors are also known to adversely affect the provision availability distribution access and quality of water and allied resources 10 11 one of the yet to be achieved millennium development goals mdgs set by the united nations un is to halve the number of people without access to improved water sources by 2015 7 there is the need for immediate actions to arrest water shortage especially in developing countries like nigeria and others in sub saharan africa with high records of waterborne diseases like cholera typhoid shigellosis diarrhea etc due to extreme poverty and lack of clean water 12 13 in nigeria alone over 66 million individuals lack access to good drinking water source and this has led to the upsurge in the consumption of water from diverse sources most of which are polluted or contaminated 14 15 with attendant health issues pollution of water bodies and the attendant reduction in quality is a major contributor to freshwater scarcity globally and this has called for more integrated water management and monitoring 7 also most rivers and streams have been plagued with enormous microbial and sediment pollution which threaten the survival of life forms in such environment the principal microbial water borne diseases are typhoid and paratyphoid fevers salmonellosis cholera bacillary dysentery shigellosis infectious hepatitis dracontiasis schistosomiasis etc 16 17 at the moment there is no form of treated water supply in the area of study according to the usepa sediment contamination is the second leading cause of impairment to water bodies because suspended sediment can directly impact aquatic organisms besides increasing the cost of water treatment in channel and reservoirs pollution of water by petroleum and allied products is a universal environmental phenomenon in places where there is exploration or processing of petroleum deposits 18 ondo state south western nigeria has a large deposit of natural bitumen and the exploration activities of this resource have caused numerous pollution menaces to surrounding rivers and streams since the toxicity of a material is the most common measure of its potential environmental impact the environmental impacts of bitumen pollution on the physical environment especially communities in ondo state need be assessed therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of bitumen pollution on the water quality of oluwa river as a continuation to the few preliminary studies available on the water of this economically important river 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of collection site ondo state is located in the south western socio political region of nigeria within coordinates 6 35 19 n 4 50 3 e and altitude 61m it is one of the largest agriculturally dominated areas especially with the presence of vast fresh and coastal water bodies which is undoubtedly the largest in the country one of the major sources of income for the state is the large deposit of bitumen whose exploration started in the 1960s as shown in fig 1 oluwa is an ancient and major river of immense agricultural environmental economic significance flowing through several communities within the agbabu bitumen settlement of ondo state the river continuously receives seepage of bitumen run off as a result of the exploration besides other polluting activities washing bathing farming etc that are daily carried out along its tributaries the river interestingly serves these communities for different purposes including fishing irrigation and most importantly for drinking 2 2 surface water sampling pre rinsed high density pet screw capped bottle 1 l capacity was used in the sampling of surface water for physicochemical analysis from the sampling points in the first week of every month april 2011 march 2012 the sampling containers and stoppers were thoroughly washed thrice with distilled water and once with the water from the river before the actual sample collection surface water samples for biological oxygen demand bod and dissolved oxygen do determinations were collected in two sets of 250ml glass stoppered reagent bottles at each sampling site 7 19 the bod samples were carefully filled without trapping air and the bottle wrapped with dark polythene bags this was to exclude light the presence of which is capable of the production of do by autotrophs algae which may be present in the samples the samples were all incubated for five days at the end of which 2ml of winkler solution i and ii each was added to the samples using separate dropping pipettes so as to retard further biological activities the bottles were shaken thoroughly to precipitate the floc which settled in the lower half of the bottles 2 3 sediment sampling sediment samples were collected by the grab method using eckman grab sampler on 3 4 locations representing approximately 2 3cm of surficial bottom sediments within each sampling site and wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid contamination frozen in an ice cooler and taken to the laboratory 2 4 analytical procedure determination of ph for all samples was done using the hi 9024 c hanna instruments smithfield ri usa while the temperature was determined using the hi 98517 hanna instrument salinity was determined by the hi 19311 hanna instrument while electrical conductivity was measured using the hi 2315 hanna instrument total dissolved solids tds were analyzed in situ using the vsi 22 hand digital meters vsi electronics private limited punjab india dissolved oxygen do of samples was analyzed using the azide modification of winkler s method 20 determination of chloride was done by the titration method 20 ultraviolet spectrophotometer dr 2800 hach washington usa was used in the determination of major anions as described by apha 20 and by khan et al 19 in all the blank standard and pre analyzed samples were analyzed every 10 samples in order to ensure reliability and reproducibility of samples 6 7 for the evaluation of coliform bacteria the most probable number mpn in water samples was used 7 metals analyses using the sens aa 3000at absorption spectrophotometer aas gbc australia following the method prescribed by apha 20 2 5 microbial analysis one 1 0 ml of water and 1g of sediment sample were used in the microbial analyses samples were serially diluted and subsequently plated on nutrient agar macconkey agar mannitol salt agar and salmonella shigella agar all the plates were incubated in duplicate appropriately for between 24 and 48h developed colonies were counted and recorded as numbers of colonies formed per ml cfu ml of the sample 6 21 the various distinct colonies were sub cultured until pure cultures were obtained and these were immediately transferred to slant bottles containing freshly prepared media identification of the individual colonies was done by the morphological and biochemical techniques earlier described 22 2 6 statistical analyses data analysis was done using the microsoft office excel 2007 software package with a significance level of p 0 05 using the analysis of variance anova the mean values of the

all chemical parameters investigated during the dry season was significantly different from rainy season except for bod at p 0 05 heavy metal analysis during the seasons did not differ significantly except for fluoride 3 4 sediment sample analysis sediment samples from the two sites a and b upstream and downstream of river oluwa were analyzed for some heavy metals the results were statistically compared between the sites as well as the two seasons of the year the result was also compared with united state environmental protection agency 25 safe limit of heavy metal concentrations in sediment of a water body the heavy metals analyzed in the sediment sample include zinc chromium cadmium lead nickel copper and manganese as shown in tables 3 4 cadmium concentration in the sediment from site a ranged between 2 00 and 12 80ppm with the mean value of 7 81 2 88ppm site b had values of cadmium between 6 00 and 13 00ppm with a mean value of 8 99 2 23ppm dry and rainy season values for cadmium were 10 18 2 06ppm and 6 62 1 69ppm respectively chromium concentration ranged between 18 40 and 24 20ppm with a mean value of 22 24 2 85ppm for site a 21 50 28 40ppm was recorded as chromium value at site b with a mean value of 23 43 2 11ppm chromium values for the dry and rainy season were 24 57 2 16 and 21 10 1 47ppm respectively the concentration of lead was within the range of 9 70 20 20ppm with a mean value of 13 01 3 29 for site a while lead concentration ranged within 9 80 18 40ppm with a mean value of 13 00 2 67 at site b dry and rainy season values for lead were recorded to be 12 71 0 95ppm and 13 30 4 11ppm respectively zinc values recorded was within 62 50 85 60ppm with a mean value of 71 33 5 89ppm for site a site b recorded value range for zinc to be between 66 20 and 79 20ppm with a mean value of 72 19 4 00ppm 73 92 4 75ppm and 69 60 4 25ppm was recorded for zinc during dry and rainy seasons respectively copper values for site a ranged between 10 40 and 13 00ppm with a mean value of 11 67 0 83ppm site b had values for copper ranging from 11 40 to 14 40ppm with a mean value of 12 74 0 78ppm the dry and rainy season had values for copper as 12 74 0 77 and 11 67 0 84 respectively nickel values ranged between 12 20 and 16 20ppm with a mean value of 15 08 1 22ppm for site a for site b value ranged between 13 10 and 17 70ppm with a mean value of 15 85 1 52 was recorded for nickel dry and rainy season values for nickel were 16 39 0 65 and 14 54 1 35ppm manganese had values between 12 30 and 39 40ppm with a mean value of 34 83 7 91 for site a site b had 10 40 43 70ppm with a mean value of 36 99 9 20ppm the values of manganese for the dry and rainy season was recorded to be 39 88 2 27ppm and 31 14 10 67ppm respectively 3 5 occurrence of bacterial isolates as shown in table 5 organisms belonging to 5 bacteria genera bacillus micrococcus pseudomonas staphylococcus and streptococcus were isolated and identified from the water samples bacillus spp had the highest occurrence of 21 42 followed by micrococcus spp with 14 14 and pseudomonas with 7 14 while both s aureus and streptococcus faecium each had 3 57 occurrence also bacterial isolates belonging to 6 genera were isolated from the sediment among the sediment isolates micrococcus spp and proteus vulgaris had the highest occurrence of 10 71 followed by bacillus spp 6 57 while pseudomonas s aureus and s faecium all had 3 57 each 4 discussion in this study diurnal variations were observed and water temperature was found to be lower than atmospheric temperature at the two sites this agrees with the works of previous authors 26 30 this variation in temperature could be attributed to reduction in water volume and more penetration of sunlight intensity during dry season this is in agreement with the work of jaji et al 31 on the assessment of water quality of ogun river southwest nigeria however temperature values obtained for the two sampling sites fell within the limit set by nigeria industrial standard 23 and world health organisation 24 based on these guidelines the mean temperature of the two sites does not appear to pose any threat to homeostatic balance of the water body in conformity with the report of jaji et al 31 generally the ph values for sites a and b as observed in this study were within regulatory limits 23 24 and are indicative of good water quality the higher values of ph recorded for site a upstream and during rainy season may be due to pollutants which are washed into the storm and drains directly into the water body this is in conformity with the submission of waziri et al 32 on the assessment of the physicochemical characteristics of rain and runoff water in university of maiduguri nigeria staff quarters the authors found out that the ph of the runoff water ranged from 5 90 0 18 to 6 71 0 18 indicating slight acidity while that of the rainwater ranged from 5 74 0 51 to 5 97 0 72 indicating some level of acidity they finally submitted that higher values recorded for the run off water may be due to pollutants which are washed into the storm drains however all the values fell within the who standard of 6 5 9 5 the ph values obtained in this study is slightly acidic for the sampling sites and the two seasons of the year this also conforms with previous works 26 29 33 34 these authors found that the ph of surface water ranged between 6 5 and 8 5 and was within the standard regulatory limits there were no significant differences in the ph values obtained in the two sampling sites and between the two seasons of the year this is in agreement with the work of ewa et al 35 on the impact of industrial activities on water quality of omoku creek the authors opined that the level of ph was high in the upstream and low at downstream this implies that the creek is acidic and this affects the metal solubility and the hardness of the water however the variations observed for ph values in this study could be as a result of agricultural activities near the river runoffs leachate seepages and temperature changes 36 in this present study the conductivity value obtained for the two sites and throughout the two seasons of the year were within standard regulatory limits 23 24 37 low concentration of conductivity might be responsible for the soft nature of the water however in the rainy season ec was lower than those observed in the dry season and this can be attributed to dilution of salts arising from increased water volume in the river this is in conformity with the submission of phiri et al 38 39 higher values of ec observed in site b and during dry season could be linked to the evaporation of water from the river especially site b downstream than site a upstream during dry season this is in consonance with the work of ololade and ajayi 40 on the contamination profiles of major rivers along the highways of ondo state where they observed maximum values in properties like ph ec cl so4 2 po4 3 bod and cod during dry season while minimum values were recorded during rainy season the alkalinity values obtained were still within regulatory limits 120mgl 1 by who 2011 this result is in agreement with the submission of phiri et al 38 where they recorded higher alkalinity levels in the dry season than in the rainy season significantly the higher level of alkalinity observed at site b and dry season could be attributed to very low dissolved oxygen values recorded in this study it could also be as a result of domestic activities like cloth washing and bathing by villagers around the area these activities might have attracted aerobic micro organisms which tend to degrade organic matter by making use of oxygen content of the water it could also be that in the absence of sufficient carbonic acids the bicarbonate ion in the water dissociates to form additional carbon dioxide and by so doing reduces the available dissolved oxygen 41 42 algae in the river exploit this carbon dioxide for their photosynthetic needs at the cost of allowing a build up of hydroxide ions to such an extent that the water becomes quite alkaline 42 concentrations less than 100ppm are desirable for domestic water supplies the recommended range for drinking water is 30 400ppm 42 total hardness results obtained in this study were below regulatory standard by who and nigeria industrial standards table 1 samples from sampling site b also recorded higher values than that of site a upstream but the values were not significantly different however there was significant difference in the seasonal variation values obtained were higher during the dry season than the rainy season this result is in conformity with the submission of ololade and ajayi 40 who obtained total hardness values lower than regulatory limits in their work on the contamination profile of major rivers along the highways in ondo state nigeria however generally accepted classification for hardness of water is 75 150mgl 1 of caco3 for soft water and 150mgl 1 and above for hard water 43 oluwa river could therefore be said to be soft total solids dissolved and suspended in water vary considerably in different geological regions owing to differences in the solubility of minerals 34 the result of total dissolved solids obtained in this study for the two sampling sites a and b respectively was within regulatory standard set by nis 23 and who 24 these values were not significantly different however higher values of total dissolved solids were obtained in the dry season remarkably than in the rainy season and the seasonal variation of the tds was significantly different the result obtained in this study for total dissolved solids disagrees with the submission of ololade and ajayi 40 who recorded total dissolved solids for river oluwa to be between 325 and 1410mgl 1 in their work on the contamination profile of major rivers along the highway in ondo state nigeria the high value of tds obtained during the dry season could be attributed to higher concentration of transported loads of organic matter since evaporation of the water body set in during dry season however lower tds value obtained during the rainy season could be as a result of several physicochemical reactions such as sedimentation coagulation fixation among other factors like oxidation and precipitation 44 the amount of solids present in a water body can be used to estimate the pollution load as a result of both organic and inorganic contaminants present the bod results obtained in this study were found to be higher than the regulatory limit of 6 0mgo2l 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 however high bod recorded in this study suggested that oluwa river is grossly polluted organically according to oluyemi et al 45 bod values higher than 6 0mgl 1 implied that the water is highly polluted by organic matter and may not support aquatic life well enough also chapman 46 opined that a water body is polluted if the average value of bod recorded for such water body exceeds the recommended maximum allowable concentration rmc 3 0 6 0mgo2l 1 of european union for good quality water moreover the result obtained in this study revealed that dissolved oxygen values for the two sites were below the recommended 6 0mgo2l 1 of who 24 omole and longe 47 submitted that the standard value of dissolved oxygen that can sustain aquatic life is stipulated at 5 0mgo2l 1 a concentration below this value adversely affect aquatic biological life while concentration below 2mgo2l 1 may lead to death of most fishes however low value of dissolved oxygen recorded in this study especially at site b could be attributed to anthropogenic and domestic activities of villagers on the water body and the breakdown of organic matter by aerobic microbes which in turn makes use of the oxygen required for this process from the surrounding water and by so doing reduce drastically the total oxygen content of the water body the dissolved oxygen values of site b obtained in this study conforms with those reported for many other polluted nigerian waters including 4 00 7 50 mgo2l 1 for luubara creek in niger delta 48 1 20 9 40mgo2l 1 documented by victor and onomivbori 49 for some polluted water bodies in nigeria according to united state department of agriculture 50 the level of oxygen depletion depends primarily on the amount of waste added the size velocity and turbulence of the stream and the temperature of the water frequent deaths of fish in water have been established not to often come from toxicity matters but from deficit of consumed oxygen from biological decomposition of pollutants 42 the cod results recorded in this study for the two sites a and b and for the two seasons of the year were higher than the regulatory 4 0mgl 1 limit set by nis 23 and who 24 there were no significant differences between the sampling sites p 0 05 but there were significant differences in the seasonal variation of the cod values p 0 05 however low do high bod and high cod result obtained for the sampling sites and during the two season of the year revealed that oluwa river is grossly polluted the result obtained for do bod and cod in this study conformed to the submission of etim and adie 34 in their work on the assessment of qualities of surface water sediment and aquatic fish from selected major rivers in south western nigeria they reported dissolved oxygen from the following rivers asejire ori ona ogun ogunpa eleyele majidun and lagos to be 2 24 2 89 1 04 5 54 6 68 1 73 2 02 and 5 50mgl 1 respectively the values recorded for chloride nitrate sulfate and phosphorus investigated in this study from the two sites did not differ significantly p 0 05 the values obtained from site b for all the investigated nutrients were higher than those recorded for site a this could also be as a result of human anthropogenic and domestic activities and reduction in water volume especially during dry season since site b is shallower than site a seasonal variation in the values of chloride nitrate sulfate and phosphorus investigated differs significantly the values recorded were higher in the dry season than what was obtained in the rainy season except for nitrate which recorded a low value during dry season this is in accordance with the submission of phiri et al 38 who recorded higher values of nitrate during the rainy season than in the dry season in the rivers in urban areas of malawi this observation could be as a result of usage of fertilizer on the farming areas at the banks of the river however chloride nitrate and sulfate values recorded in this study were found to be below the recommended regulatory limit in water 250mgl 1 50mgl 1 and 250mgl 1 respectively set by who 24 and nigerian industrial standards while phosphate values recorded were higher than the regulatory limits of 0 05mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 nitrate is an essential plant nutrient and its level in natural waterways are typically low less than 1mgl 1 51 an excessive amount of nitrate can cause water quality problems accelerate eutrophication as well as contribute to the illness known as methemoglobinemia 52 although the low values recorded for chloride nitrate and sulfate fell below regulatory limits set by who 24 a serious health hazard can occur in case of bioaccumulation of highly toxic nitrate in the intestinal tracts of infants 40 especially those who drink from the river water human infants below the age of six months who drink water containing excess of maximum contaminant level mcl of 10mgl 1 could become seriously ill and if untreated may die 25 in addition to the levels of nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 obtained in this study are exceedingly too high even for irrigation purpose if the guideline values of 0 5mgl 1 for no3 and 0 05mgl 1 for po4 3 respectively is to comply with fepa 53 the oluwa river water is not equally suitable for livestock watering and recreational activities if the guideline values of 0 5mgl 1 for no3 and 0 05mgl 1 for phosphate is to be complied with moreover the phosphate levels recorded in this study are generally high which could explain the observed proliferation of blue green algae on the banks and surface of the water persistence of high concentrations of phosphate in surface water body can reduce its recreational use and also endanger aquatic life 45 the low content of chloride in this study may arise as a result of various soluble salts and animal manure which might have entered the river via run offs from nearby farms this manure is also a potential source of sulfate 54 the implication of this in drinking water will lead to heart and kidney diseases and cause impair health 54 contamination of aquatic ecosystems by heavy metals has long been recognized as a serious pollution problem metals released into surface water tend to accumulate in sediments through adsorption and precipitation processes from the water the fish absorb the metal by means of gills or epithelial tissue and bioaccumulate it in the body 55 59 heavy metals cd cr pb zn fe cu f and mn concentrations in water samples analyzed were high in the two sites except for fluorine iron and copper when compared with nis 23 and who 24 standard regulatory limits however the values obtained showed that the concentrations of all the metals investigated were higher at site b than that of a b a the reason for this could be as a result of anthropogenic activities of villagers and domestic activities as well as farming activities around site b this observation is in consonance with earlier submissions 30 34 40 42 54 who observed higher levels of heavy metals in polluted rivers in southwest region of nigeria seasonal variation in the levels of heavy metals in oluwa river revealed that the concentration of metals investigated were higher during the dry season except for lead and zinc while lower concentration were observed during the rainy season this trend could be attributed to the evaporation of water from river during dry season and subsequent dilution due to precipitation and run offs from surrounding farmland during the rainy season similar observations have been reported by patil et al 60 61 generally higher levels of cadmium chromium lead zinc iron copper fluorine and manganese observed in site b follows the trend zn cr pb f fe mn cu cd the observed trend is similar to the work of etim and adie 34 on assessment of qualities of surface water sediments and aquatic fish from selected major rivers in oyo ogun and lagos states south western nigeria in the order pb cu co ni cr cd the observed trend is also similar to the submission of kuforiji and ayandiran 30 who observed higher concentration of heavy metals in river owo in the following trend fe cu cr pb cd moreover zinc was observed to have highest concentration while cadmium recorded the lowest concentration in the two sites in oluwa river comparatively with regards to the effect of season on heavy metals concentrations in oluwa river zinc had the highest concentration during the dry season and cadmium had the least concentration this could be as a result of presence of zinc in large amount in natural water and as a result of presence of domestic sewage deterioration of galvanized iron leaching of brass 42 54 62 oluwa river observed in this study could also be as a result of presence of bitumen in oluwa river adebiyi and omole 63 subjected nigerian bitumen component asphaltene oil and resin to trace metal analysis and they observed that the component contain high concentrations of zinc nickel vanadium and iron zinc is one of the earliest known trace metals and a common environmental pollutant which is widely distributed in the aquatic environment 42 studies have shown that it could be toxic to some aquatic organism such as fish 57 59 it has been found to have low toxicity effect in man however prolonged consumption of large doses can result in health implications such as fatigue dizziness neutropenia 64 the result obtained for zinc as the highest metal concentration in this study is in agreement with the work of uzoekwe and oghosanine 28 although cadmium was recorded to be the heavy metal with the lowest concentration in oluwa river its concentration in large amount constitutes a serious health hazard sources of cadmium in water include weathering of minerals and soils run offs from industries containing cd laden materials 42 this statement justified the reason why cadmium was observed in this study to be the heavy metal with the lowest concentration both in water and sediment since there are no industries at agbabu village or near oluwa river the possible accumulation of cadmium in man is mainly in the kidney and liver its high concentration lead to chronic kidney dysfunction inducing cell injury and death by interfering with calcium ca regulation in biological system in man fish and other aquatic organism 7 the result obtained for cadmium as a lowest concentration of heavy metals conforms to previous submissions 28 30 34 40 that reported low concentration of cadmium in different rivers of nigeria chromium concentration in oluwa river was also higher than 0 05mgl 1 recommended by who 24 and nis 23 high concentration of chromium next to zinc observed in this study might be as a result of the metal being one of the constituents of bitumen which is a major pollutant of the river in an elemental characterization of nigerian bitumen by total reflection x ray fluorescent which showed fe cr and mn to be part of its component 65 concentration of lead recorded in this study was also higher than the regulatory standard of 0 01mgl 1 set by who 24 and nis 23 lead is ubiquitous in our environment with diverse pollution sources it could also be as a result of lead being one of the constituent of bitumen which is a pollutant in oluwa river most natural bitumen contain sulphur and several heavy metals such as nickel vanadium lead chromium mercury arsenic selenium and other toxic element 6 the united states environmental protection agency has classified lead as being potentially hazardous and toxic to most forms of life 25 lead toxicity studies conducted on female animals revealed mostly miscarriages premature delivery and potent mortality 66 a concentration of lead 0 1mgl 1 is detrimental to fetus and children with possible development of neurological problem 67 pb usually accumulates in the skeleton where it causes health defects which include sub encephalopathic neurological and behavioral effects 62 pb when present in the food chain can result in bioaccumulation thereby becoming harmful to man s health 56 furthermore concentration of iron recorded in this study was lower than the standard limit of 0 3mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 iron concentration was higher at site b than site a the differences in the level of fe in the water across the two sites were not significant the geochemical and biochemical processes in the aquifers within the area according to tay et al 68 may be responsible for the differences sources of iron in the river could also be as a result of it being one of the components of bitumen adebiyi et al 65 carried out an elemental characterization of the nigerian bitumen by total reflection x ray fluorescence which shows fe cr and mn to be part of its component sources of iron in water may also be from dissolved rock and soil and anthropogenic sources of iron such as leached corrosive iron materials in rural and urban settlement 31 62 however iron is an important metal in both plants and animals especially in the cellular processes 7 insoluble fe3 is reduced to soluble fe2 in water by bacterial reduction iron is found in natural fresh and groundwater but has no health based guideline although high concentrations give rise to consumer complaint due to its ability to discolor aerobic waters at concentrations above 0 3mgl 1 24 the concentration recorded for copper at the two sampling sites and the seasons of the year was lower than the regulatory standard of 2 0 and 1 0mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 respectively copper is both an essential nutrient and a drinking water contaminant 24 copper concentration often increases in systems with high carbonate waters with an alkaline ph as observed in this study nis 23 and who 24 however submitted that high concentration of these metals in humans can lead to adverse gastro intestinal response the concentration of fluoride recorded in this study at the two sites a and b and the two seasons of the year was also lower than the regulatory limit of 1 5mgl 1 and 1 5mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 respectively fluoride was recorded in the study to be below the regulatory limit it could pose a health risk if it bio concentrate in fish tissues and in turn bio accumulate over time in man who is at the top of the food chain epidemiological evidence has revealed that content ration of fluoride above 1 5mgl 1 carry an increased risk of dental fluorosis and progressively higher concentration leads to increased risk of skeletal fluorosis results obtained in this study for manganese concentration in the two sites and during the two season of the year were higher than the regulatory limits of 0 4mgl 1 and 0 2mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 respectively the result obtained for manganese in this study is in agreement with the submission of lawson 42 where he obtained mean manganese level above the recommended or acceptable level for unpolluted water high concentration of this metal especially during the dry season and at site b could be as a result of the anthropogenic activities at site b and dilution due to rainfall during the rainy season another reason could be the presence of the metal as one of the constituents of bitumen which is a major pollutant in the water body as well adebiyi et al 65 in an elemental characterization of the nigerian bitumen by total reflection x ray fluorescence showed fe cr and mn to be part of bitumen manganese is known to naturally occur in many surface water and groundwater sources particularly in anaerobic or low oxidation conditions 24 it functions as co factor in the synthesis of urea from ammonia amino acid and fatty acid metabolism and glucose oxidation values of manganese above the recommended guideline of 0 4mgl 1 24 in water will elicit health impact the symptoms in man include problem with central nervous system euphoria insomnia serious headache and palsy of feet comparison of heavy metal content in sediment in different aquatic ecosystem may be a convenient way of assessing the pollution status of an environment sediment as an indicator of pollution remains an important component of the aquatic ecosystem because it acts as reservoir for heavy metals 69 moreover the concentrations of all the heavy metals zn cr cd pb ni cu and mn investigated in the sediment of oluwa river were higher than those of heavy metals in sediment of flowing streams and rivers and static lakes and ponds set by usepa 25 all the metals investigated in the sediment samples from the two sites a and b revealed that the concentrations of all the metals except lead pb were higher at site b than those of site a there were no significantly differences in the concentrations of the metals between the sites p 0 05 except for copper which differs significantly p 0 05 variations in the concentration of the heavy metal in sediment investigated revealed that higher concentrations of the metals investigated were observed in the dry season while lower concentrations were observed during the rainy season except for lead which showed higher concentration during the rainy season the statistical analysis carried out revealed that there were significant differences in the concentration of heavy metals investigated in the sediment during the two seasons of the year p 0 05 this implies that the metals are not firmly bounded within the crystal structure of the minerals comprising the sediment and were largely affected by dilution due to rain 70 this observation could probably be due to dilution by rainwater which influences concentration and heavy metal mobility this observation is in agreement with the submission of fagbote and olanipekun 70 on the evaluation of the status of heavy metal pollution of sediment of agbabu bitumen deposit area nigeria they observed that the mean concentration of cu mn cr zn pb cd ni and v were higher in the dry season than in the rainy season the increased level of metals at site b and during the dry season is of environmental significance this is because it indicates the continual input or increase in anthropogenic metal burden into the environment majority of which may persist and thus becomes toxic not only to aquatic lives but also to humans who are at the top of the food chain zinc was found in this study to have the highest concentration in the sediment of oluwa river while cadmium was recorded to have the least the concentration of the heavy metals followed the trend zn mn cr ni pb cu cd the high mean concentration of these metals especially zinc manganese nickel and chromium in sediment samples of oluwa river may be due to bitumen deposit in agbabu village and oluwa river which flows through the village this is in agreement with the submission of adebiyi et al 65 who in an elemental characterization of the nigerian bitumen by total reflection x ray fluorescence showed fe cr and manganese to be some of the constituents of bitumen adebiyi and omole 63 also submitted that nigerian bitumen components asphaltene oil and resins when subjected to trace metal analysis were found to contain high concentrations of zinc nickel vanadium and iron the result obtained for heavy metal in the sediments of oluwa river in this study is also in agreement with the submission of ololade and ajayi 40 where they reported that contamination of heavy metal in the sediment of major rivers along the highways in ondo state follows the order zn pb cu cd which is similar to what was obtained in oluwa river sediment the result recorded for lead at sites a and b showed no significant difference it could be that the metal probably originated from many sources these sources include contamination by bitumen run offs due to rainwater and anthropogenic activity such as agriculture which is noticed upstream site a high concentration of lead observed in the sediment during the rainy season table 4 which was significantly different to what was observed in the dry season implies that the metal is firmly bounded within the crystal structure of the minerals comprising the sediment and are not largely affected by dilution due to rain 70 5 conclusion from the studies surface water and sediment of oluwa river was found to be grossly polluted with organics and heavy metals as evident in high cod and bod and low do observed in this study the high increase in heavy metal concentration above the regulatory limits of who nis and usepa in the surface water as well as the sediment of oluwa river has really implicated the water body as being polluted higher concentrations of the metals investigated especially downstream site b revealed that villagers depend on the river water for domestic use which includes bathing washing and drinking or for agricultural uses like fishing and farming probably the presence of bitumen in the water body also influenced high concentrations of these metals most especially zinc villagers making use of the water body may indeed be exposed to some health risks with all these revelations oluwa river is said to be highly polluted especially with heavy metals and it is not recommended as a drinking water for human consumption 
8837,this study was aimed at establishing a water quality database in the study area where none existed previously samples were taken from two different sites of river oluwa south western nigeria physicochemical and biological factors and the metals for one year april 2011 march 2012 were evaluated using standard methods all the physical parameters of the water samples from the two sampling sites did not show deviations from nigeria industrial standard nis for permissible levels of these parameters in drinking water virtually all heavy metals investigated deviated from the permissible levels allowed by nis and who standards in drinking water in the same vein all chemical parameters investigated during the dry season was significantly different from rainy season except for bod at p 0 05 isolated microorganisms include members of the genera bacillus micrococcus pseudomonas streptococcus proteus and staphylococcus the public health implications of consuming water from this river are fully discussed keywords bitumen drinking water health nigeria pollution standards 1 introduction one of the globally recognized health related programs and campaigns is the provision of potable and safe water especially in rural communities 1 due to the important roles play by water in supporting life and wellness 2 7 it has been reported an estimated 1 1 billion people do not have access to adequate and uninterrupted water supplies which has been linked to about 4 billion diarrhea outbreak and well over 5 million annual global deaths 8 9 researchers have reported the major causes of these shortfalls in clean water supplies to be improper management the upsurge in industrial developments and its attendant pollution menace alarming population growth unfavorable policy implementation of water related projects all these factors are also known to adversely affect the provision availability distribution access and quality of water and allied resources 10 11 one of the yet to be achieved millennium development goals mdgs set by the united nations un is to halve the number of people without access to improved water sources by 2015 7 there is the need for immediate actions to arrest water shortage especially in developing countries like nigeria and others in sub saharan africa with high records of waterborne diseases like cholera typhoid shigellosis diarrhea etc due to extreme poverty and lack of clean water 12 13 in nigeria alone over 66 million individuals lack access to good drinking water source and this has led to the upsurge in the consumption of water from diverse sources most of which are polluted or contaminated 14 15 with attendant health issues pollution of water bodies and the attendant reduction in quality is a major contributor to freshwater scarcity globally and this has called for more integrated water management and monitoring 7 also most rivers and streams have been plagued with enormous microbial and sediment pollution which threaten the survival of life forms in such environment the principal microbial water borne diseases are typhoid and paratyphoid fevers salmonellosis cholera bacillary dysentery shigellosis infectious hepatitis dracontiasis schistosomiasis etc 16 17 at the moment there is no form of treated water supply in the area of study according to the usepa sediment contamination is the second leading cause of impairment to water bodies because suspended sediment can directly impact aquatic organisms besides increasing the cost of water treatment in channel and reservoirs pollution of water by petroleum and allied products is a universal environmental phenomenon in places where there is exploration or processing of petroleum deposits 18 ondo state south western nigeria has a large deposit of natural bitumen and the exploration activities of this resource have caused numerous pollution menaces to surrounding rivers and streams since the toxicity of a material is the most common measure of its potential environmental impact the environmental impacts of bitumen pollution on the physical environment especially communities in ondo state need be assessed therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of bitumen pollution on the water quality of oluwa river as a continuation to the few preliminary studies available on the water of this economically important river 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of collection site ondo state is located in the south western socio political region of nigeria within coordinates 6 35 19 n 4 50 3 e and altitude 61m it is one of the largest agriculturally dominated areas especially with the presence of vast fresh and coastal water bodies which is undoubtedly the largest in the country one of the major sources of income for the state is the large deposit of bitumen whose exploration started in the 1960s as shown in fig 1 oluwa is an ancient and major river of immense agricultural environmental economic significance flowing through several communities within the agbabu bitumen settlement of ondo state the river continuously receives seepage of bitumen run off as a result of the exploration besides other polluting activities washing bathing farming etc that are daily carried out along its tributaries the river interestingly serves these communities for different purposes including fishing irrigation and most importantly for drinking 2 2 surface water sampling pre rinsed high density pet screw capped bottle 1 l capacity was used in the sampling of surface water for physicochemical analysis from the sampling points in the first week of every month april 2011 march 2012 the sampling containers and stoppers were thoroughly washed thrice with distilled water and once with the water from the river

ranged between 2 00 and 12 80ppm with the mean value of 7 81 2 88ppm site b had values of cadmium between 6 00 and 13 00ppm with a mean value of 8 99 2 23ppm dry and rainy season values for cadmium were 10 18 2 06ppm and 6 62 1 69ppm respectively chromium concentration ranged between 18 40 and 24 20ppm with a mean value of 22 24 2 85ppm for site a 21 50 28 40ppm was recorded as chromium value at

with a mean value of 13 01 3 29 for site a while lead concentration ranged within 9 80 18 40ppm with a mean value of 13 00 2 67 at site b dry and rainy season values for lead were recorded to be 12 71 0 95ppm and 13 30 4 11ppm respectively zinc values recorded was within 62 50 85 60ppm with a mean value of 71 33 5 89ppm for site a site b recorded value range for zinc to be between 66 20 and 79 20ppm with a mean value of 72 19 4 00ppm 73 92 4 75ppm and 69 60 4 25ppm was recorded for zinc during dry and rainy seasons respectively copper values for site a ranged between 10 40 and 13 00ppm with a mean value of 11 67 0 83ppm site b had values for copper ranging from 11 40 to 14 40ppm with a mean value of 12 74 0 78ppm the dry and rainy season had values for copper as 12 74 0 77 and 11 67 0 84 respectively nickel values ranged between 12 20 and 16 20ppm with a mean value of 15 08 1 22ppm for site a for site b value ranged between 13 10 and 17 70ppm with a mean value of 15 85 1 52 was recorded for nickel dry and rainy season values for nickel were 16 39 0 65 and 14 54 1 35ppm manganese had values between 12 30 and 39 40ppm with a mean value of 34 83 7 91 for site a site b had 10 40

as shown in table 5 organisms belonging to 5 bacteria genera bacillus micrococcus pseudomonas staphylococcus and streptococcus were isolated and identified from the water samples bacillus spp had the highest occurrence of 21 42 followed by micrococcus spp with 14 14 and pseudomonas with 7 14 while both s aureus and streptococcus faecium each had 3 57 occurrence also bacterial isolates belonging to 6 genera were isolated from the sediment among the sediment isolates micrococcus spp and proteus vulgaris had the highest occurrence of 10 71 followed by bacillus spp 6 57 while pseudomonas s aureus and s faecium all had 3 57 each 4 discussion in this study diurnal variations were observed and water temperature was found to be lower than atmospheric temperature at the two sites this agrees with the works of previous authors 26 30 this variation in temperature could be attributed to reduction in water volume and more penetration of sunlight intensity during dry season this is in agreement with the work of jaji et al 31 on the assessment of water quality of ogun river southwest nigeria however temperature values obtained for the two sampling sites fell within the limit set by nigeria industrial standard 23 and world health organisation 24 based on these guidelines the mean temperature of the two sites does not appear to pose any threat to homeostatic balance of the water body in conformity with the report of jaji et al 31 generally the ph values for sites a and b as observed in this study were within regulatory limits 23 24 and are indicative of good water quality the higher values of ph recorded for site a upstream and during rainy season may be due to pollutants which are washed into the storm and drains directly into the water body this is in conformity with the submission of waziri et al 32 on the assessment of the physicochemical characteristics of rain and runoff water in university of maiduguri nigeria staff quarters the authors found out that the ph of the runoff water ranged from 5 90 0 18 to 6 71 0 18 indicating slight acidity while that of the rainwater ranged from 5 74 0 51 to 5 97 0 72 indicating some level of acidity they finally submitted that higher values recorded for the run off water may be due to pollutants which are washed into the storm drains however all the values fell within the who standard of 6 5 9 5 the ph values obtained in this study is slightly acidic for the sampling sites and the two seasons of the year this also conforms with previous works 26 29 33 34 these authors found that the ph of surface water ranged between 6 5 and 8 5 and was within the standard regulatory limits there were no significant differences in the ph values obtained in the two sampling sites and between the two seasons of the year this is in agreement with the work of ewa et al 35 on the impact of industrial activities on water quality of omoku creek the authors opined that the level of ph was high in the upstream and low at downstream this implies that the creek is acidic and this affects the metal solubility and the hardness of the water however the variations observed for ph values in this study could be as a result of agricultural activities near the river runoffs leachate seepages and temperature changes 36 in this present study the conductivity value obtained for the two sites and throughout the two seasons of the year were within standard regulatory limits 23 24 37 low concentration of conductivity might be responsible for the soft nature of the water however in the rainy season ec was lower than those observed in the dry season and this can be attributed to dilution of salts arising from increased water volume in the river this is in conformity with the submission of phiri et al 38 39 higher values of ec observed in site b and during dry season could be linked to the evaporation of water from the river especially site b downstream than site a upstream during dry season this is in consonance with the work of ololade and ajayi 40 on the contamination profiles of major rivers along the highways of ondo state where they observed maximum values in properties like ph ec cl so4 2 po4 3 bod and cod during dry season while minimum values were recorded during rainy season the alkalinity values obtained were still within regulatory limits 120mgl 1 by who 2011 this result is in agreement with the submission of phiri et al 38 where they recorded higher alkalinity levels in the dry season than in the rainy season significantly the higher level of alkalinity observed at site b and dry season could be attributed to very low dissolved oxygen values recorded in this study it could also be as a result of domestic activities like cloth washing and bathing by villagers around the area these activities might have attracted aerobic micro organisms which tend to degrade organic matter by making use of oxygen content of the water it could also be that in the absence of sufficient carbonic acids the bicarbonate ion in the water dissociates to form additional carbon dioxide and by so doing reduces the available dissolved oxygen 41 42 algae in the river exploit this carbon dioxide for their photosynthetic needs at the cost of allowing a build up of hydroxide ions to such an extent that the water becomes quite alkaline 42 concentrations less than 100ppm are desirable for domestic water supplies the recommended range for drinking water is 30 400ppm 42 total hardness results obtained in this study were below regulatory standard by who and nigeria industrial standards table 1 samples from sampling site b also recorded higher values than that of site a upstream but the values were not significantly different however there was significant difference in the seasonal variation values obtained were higher during the dry season than the rainy season this result is in conformity with the submission of ololade and ajayi 40 who obtained total hardness values lower than regulatory limits in their work on the contamination profile of major rivers along the highways in ondo state nigeria however generally accepted classification for hardness of water is 75 150mgl 1 of caco3 for soft water and 150mgl 1 and above for hard water 43 oluwa river could therefore be said to be soft total solids dissolved and suspended in water vary considerably in different geological regions owing to differences in the solubility of minerals 34 the result of total dissolved solids obtained in this study for the two sampling sites a and b respectively was within regulatory standard set by nis 23 and who 24 these values were not significantly different however higher values of total dissolved solids were obtained in the dry season remarkably than in the rainy season and the seasonal variation of the tds was significantly different the result obtained in this study for total dissolved solids disagrees with the submission of ololade and ajayi 40 who recorded total dissolved solids for river oluwa to be between 325 and 1410mgl 1 in their work on the contamination profile of major rivers along the highway in ondo state nigeria the high value of tds obtained during the dry season could be attributed to higher concentration of transported loads of organic matter since evaporation of the water body set in during dry season however lower tds value obtained during the rainy season could be as a result of several physicochemical reactions such as sedimentation coagulation fixation among other factors like oxidation and precipitation 44 the amount of solids present in a water body can be used to estimate the pollution load as a result of both organic and inorganic contaminants present the bod results obtained in this study were found to be higher than the regulatory limit of 6 0mgo2l 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 however high bod recorded in this study suggested that oluwa river is grossly polluted organically according to oluyemi et al 45 bod values higher than 6 0mgl 1 implied that the water is highly polluted by organic matter and may not support aquatic life well enough also chapman 46 opined that a water body is polluted if the average value of bod recorded for such water body exceeds the recommended maximum allowable concentration rmc 3 0 6 0mgo2l 1 of european union for good quality water moreover the result obtained in this study revealed that dissolved oxygen values for the two sites were below the recommended 6 0mgo2l 1 of who 24 omole and longe 47 submitted that the standard value of dissolved oxygen that can sustain aquatic life is stipulated at 5 0mgo2l 1 a concentration below this value adversely affect aquatic biological life while concentration below 2mgo2l 1 may lead to death of most fishes however low value of dissolved oxygen recorded in this study especially at site b could be attributed to anthropogenic and domestic activities of villagers on the water body and the breakdown of organic matter by aerobic microbes which in turn makes use of the oxygen required for this process from the surrounding water and by so doing reduce drastically the total oxygen content of the water body the dissolved oxygen values of site b obtained in this study conforms with those reported for many other polluted nigerian waters including 4 00 7 50 mgo2l 1 for luubara creek in niger delta 48 1 20 9 40mgo2l 1 documented by victor and onomivbori 49 for some polluted water bodies in nigeria according to united state department of agriculture 50 the level of oxygen depletion depends primarily on the amount of waste added the size velocity and turbulence of the stream and the temperature of the water frequent deaths of fish in water have been established not to often come from toxicity matters but from deficit of consumed oxygen from biological decomposition of pollutants 42 the cod results recorded in this study for the two sites a and b and for the two seasons of the year were higher than the regulatory 4 0mgl 1 limit set by nis 23 and who 24 there were no significant differences between the sampling sites p 0 05 but there were significant differences in the seasonal variation of the cod values p 0 05 however low do high bod and high cod result obtained for the sampling sites and during the two season of the year revealed that oluwa river is grossly polluted the result obtained for do bod and cod in this study conformed to the submission of etim and adie 34 in their work on the assessment of qualities of surface water sediment and aquatic fish from selected major rivers in south western nigeria they reported dissolved oxygen from the following rivers asejire ori ona ogun ogunpa eleyele majidun and lagos to be 2 24 2 89 1 04 5 54 6 68 1 73 2 02 and 5 50mgl 1 respectively the values recorded for chloride nitrate sulfate and phosphorus investigated in this study from the two sites did not differ significantly p 0 05 the values obtained from site b for all the investigated nutrients were higher than those recorded for site a this could also be as a result of human anthropogenic and domestic activities and reduction in water volume especially during dry season since site b is shallower than site a seasonal variation in the values of chloride nitrate sulfate and phosphorus investigated differs significantly the values recorded were higher in the dry season than what was obtained in the rainy season except for nitrate which recorded a low value during dry season this is in accordance with the submission of phiri et al 38 who recorded higher values of nitrate during the rainy season than in the dry season in the rivers in urban areas of malawi this observation could be as a result of usage of fertilizer on the farming areas at the banks of the river however chloride nitrate and sulfate values recorded in this study were found to be below the recommended regulatory limit in water 250mgl 1 50mgl 1 and 250mgl 1 respectively set by who 24 and nigerian industrial standards while phosphate values recorded were higher than the regulatory limits of 0 05mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 nitrate is an essential plant nutrient and its level in natural waterways are typically low less than 1mgl 1 51 an excessive amount of nitrate can cause water quality problems accelerate eutrophication as well as contribute to the illness known as methemoglobinemia 52 although the low values recorded for chloride nitrate and sulfate fell below regulatory limits set by who 24 a serious health hazard can occur in case of bioaccumulation of highly toxic nitrate in the intestinal tracts of infants 40 especially those who drink from the river water human infants below the age of six months who drink water containing excess of maximum contaminant level mcl of 10mgl 1 could become seriously ill and if untreated may die 25 in addition to the levels of nitrate no3 and phosphate po4 3 obtained in this study are exceedingly too high even for irrigation purpose if the guideline values of 0 5mgl 1 for no3 and 0 05mgl 1 for po4 3 respectively is to comply with fepa 53 the oluwa river water is not equally suitable for livestock watering and recreational activities if the guideline values of 0 5mgl 1 for no3 and 0 05mgl 1 for phosphate is to be complied with moreover the phosphate levels recorded in this study are generally high which could explain the observed proliferation of blue green algae on the banks and surface of the water persistence of high concentrations of phosphate in surface water body can reduce its recreational use and also endanger aquatic life 45 the low content of chloride in this study may arise as a result of various soluble salts and animal manure which might have entered the river via run offs from nearby farms this manure is also a potential source of sulfate 54 the implication of this in drinking water will lead to heart and kidney diseases and cause impair health 54 contamination of aquatic ecosystems by heavy metals has long been recognized as a serious pollution problem metals released into surface water tend to accumulate in sediments through adsorption and precipitation processes from the water the fish absorb the metal by means of gills or epithelial tissue and bioaccumulate it in the body 55 59 heavy metals cd cr pb zn fe cu f and mn concentrations in water samples analyzed were high in the two sites except for fluorine iron and copper when compared with nis 23 and who 24 standard regulatory limits however the values obtained showed that the concentrations of all the metals investigated were higher at site b than that of a b a the reason for this could be as a result of anthropogenic activities of villagers and domestic activities as well as farming activities around site b this observation is in consonance with earlier submissions 30 34 40 42 54 who observed higher levels of heavy metals in polluted rivers in southwest region of nigeria seasonal variation in the levels of heavy metals in oluwa river revealed that the concentration of metals investigated were higher during the dry season except for lead and zinc while lower concentration were observed during the rainy season this trend could be attributed to the evaporation of water from river during dry season and subsequent dilution due to precipitation and run offs from surrounding farmland during the rainy season similar observations have been reported by patil et al 60 61 generally higher levels of cadmium chromium lead zinc iron copper fluorine and manganese observed in site b follows the trend zn cr pb f fe mn cu cd the observed trend is similar to the work of etim and adie 34 on assessment of qualities of surface water sediments and aquatic fish from selected major rivers in oyo ogun and lagos states south western nigeria in the order pb cu co ni cr cd the observed trend is also similar to the submission of kuforiji and ayandiran 30 who observed higher concentration of heavy metals in river owo in the following trend fe cu cr pb cd moreover zinc was observed to have highest concentration while cadmium recorded the lowest concentration in the two sites in oluwa river comparatively with regards to the effect of season on heavy metals concentrations in oluwa river zinc had the highest concentration during the dry season and cadmium had the least concentration this could be as a result of presence of zinc in large amount in natural water and as a result of presence of domestic sewage deterioration of galvanized iron leaching of brass 42 54 62 oluwa river observed in this study could also be as a result of presence of bitumen in oluwa river adebiyi and omole 63 subjected nigerian bitumen component asphaltene oil and resin to trace metal analysis and they observed that the component contain high concentrations of zinc nickel vanadium and iron zinc is one of the earliest known trace metals and a common environmental pollutant which is widely distributed in the aquatic environment 42 studies have shown that it could be toxic to some aquatic organism such as fish 57 59 it has been found to have low toxicity effect in man however prolonged consumption of large doses can result in health implications such as fatigue dizziness neutropenia 64 the result obtained for zinc as the highest metal concentration in this study is in agreement with the work of uzoekwe and oghosanine 28 although cadmium was recorded to be the heavy metal with the lowest concentration in oluwa river its concentration in large amount constitutes a serious health hazard sources of cadmium in water include weathering of minerals and soils run offs from industries containing cd laden materials 42 this statement justified the reason why cadmium was observed in this study to be the heavy metal with the lowest concentration both in water and sediment since there are no industries at agbabu village or near oluwa river the possible accumulation of cadmium in man is mainly in the kidney and liver its high concentration lead to chronic kidney dysfunction inducing cell injury and death by interfering with calcium ca regulation in biological system in man fish and other aquatic organism 7 the result obtained for cadmium as a lowest concentration of heavy metals conforms to previous submissions 28 30 34 40 that reported low concentration of cadmium in different rivers of nigeria chromium concentration in oluwa river was also higher than 0 05mgl 1 recommended by who 24 and nis 23 high concentration of chromium next to zinc observed in this study might be as a result of the metal being one of the constituents of bitumen which is a major pollutant of the river in an elemental characterization of nigerian bitumen by total reflection x ray fluorescent which showed fe cr and mn to be part of its component 65 concentration of lead recorded in this study was also higher than the regulatory standard of 0 01mgl 1 set by who 24 and nis 23 lead is ubiquitous in our environment with diverse pollution sources it could also be as a result of lead being one of the constituent of bitumen which is a pollutant in oluwa river most natural bitumen contain sulphur and several heavy metals such as nickel vanadium lead chromium mercury arsenic selenium and other toxic element 6 the united states environmental protection agency has classified lead as being potentially hazardous and toxic to most forms of life 25 lead toxicity studies conducted on female animals revealed mostly miscarriages premature delivery and potent mortality 66 a concentration of lead 0 1mgl 1 is detrimental to fetus and children with possible development of neurological problem 67 pb usually accumulates in the skeleton where it causes health defects which include sub encephalopathic neurological and behavioral effects 62 pb when present in the food chain can result in bioaccumulation thereby becoming harmful to man s health 56 furthermore concentration of iron recorded in this study was lower than the standard limit of 0 3mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 iron concentration was higher at site b than site a the differences in the level of fe in the water across the two sites were not significant the geochemical and biochemical processes in the aquifers within the area according to tay et al 68 may be responsible for the differences sources of iron in the river could also be as a result of it being one of the components of bitumen adebiyi et al 65 carried out an elemental characterization of the nigerian bitumen by total reflection x ray fluorescence which shows fe cr and mn to be part of its component sources of iron in water may also be from dissolved rock and soil and anthropogenic sources of iron such as leached corrosive iron materials in rural and urban settlement 31 62 however iron is an important metal in both plants and animals especially in the cellular processes 7 insoluble fe3 is reduced to soluble fe2 in water by bacterial reduction iron is found in natural fresh and groundwater but has no health based guideline although high concentrations give rise to consumer complaint due to its ability to discolor aerobic waters at concentrations above 0 3mgl 1 24 the concentration recorded for copper at the two sampling sites and the seasons of the year was lower than the regulatory standard of 2 0 and 1 0mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 respectively copper is both an essential nutrient and a drinking water contaminant 24 copper concentration often increases in systems with high carbonate waters with an alkaline ph as observed in this study nis 23 and who 24 however submitted that high concentration of these metals in humans can lead to adverse gastro intestinal response the concentration of fluoride recorded in this study at the two sites a and b and the two seasons of the year was also lower than the regulatory limit of 1 5mgl 1 and 1 5mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 respectively fluoride was recorded in the study to be below the regulatory limit it could pose a health risk if it bio concentrate in fish tissues and in turn bio accumulate over time in man who is at the top of the food chain epidemiological evidence has revealed that content ration of fluoride above 1 5mgl 1 carry an increased risk of dental fluorosis and progressively higher concentration leads to increased risk of skeletal fluorosis results obtained in this study for manganese concentration in the two sites and during the two season of the year were higher than the regulatory limits of 0 4mgl 1 and 0 2mgl 1 set by nis 23 and who 24 respectively the result obtained for manganese in this study is in agreement with the submission of lawson 42 where he obtained mean manganese level above the recommended or acceptable level for unpolluted water high concentration of this metal especially during the dry season and at site b could be as a result of the anthropogenic activities at site b and dilution due to rainfall during the rainy season another reason could be the presence of the metal as one of the constituents of bitumen which is a major pollutant in the water body as well adebiyi et al 65 in an elemental characterization of the nigerian bitumen by total reflection x ray fluorescence showed fe cr and mn to be part of bitumen manganese is known to naturally occur in many surface water and groundwater sources particularly in anaerobic or low oxidation conditions 24 it functions as co factor in the synthesis of urea from ammonia amino acid and fatty acid metabolism and glucose oxidation values of manganese above the recommended guideline of 0 4mgl 1 24 in water will elicit health impact the symptoms in man include problem with central nervous system euphoria insomnia serious headache and palsy of feet comparison of heavy metal content in sediment in different aquatic ecosystem may be a convenient way of assessing the pollution status of an environment sediment as an indicator of pollution remains an important component of the aquatic ecosystem because it acts as reservoir for heavy metals 69 moreover the concentrations of all the heavy metals zn cr cd pb ni cu and mn investigated in the sediment of oluwa river were higher than those of heavy metals in sediment of flowing streams and rivers and static lakes and ponds set by usepa 25 all the metals investigated in the sediment samples from the two sites a and b revealed that the concentrations of all the metals except lead pb were higher at site b than those of site a there were no significantly differences in the concentrations of the metals between the sites p 0 05 except for copper which differs significantly p 0 05 variations in the concentration of the heavy metal in sediment investigated revealed that higher concentrations of the metals investigated were observed in the dry season while lower concentrations were observed during the rainy season except for lead which showed higher concentration during the rainy season the statistical analysis carried out revealed that there were significant differences in the concentration of heavy metals investigated in the sediment during the two seasons of the year p 0 05 this implies that the metals are not firmly bounded within the crystal structure of the minerals comprising the sediment and were largely affected by dilution due to rain 70 this observation could probably be due to dilution by rainwater which influences concentration and heavy metal mobility this observation is in agreement with the submission of fagbote and olanipekun 70 on the evaluation of the status of heavy metal pollution of sediment of agbabu bitumen deposit area nigeria they observed that the mean concentration of cu mn cr zn pb cd ni and v were higher in the dry season than in the rainy season the increased level of metals at site b and during the dry season is of environmental significance this is because it indicates the continual input or increase in anthropogenic metal burden into the environment majority of which may persist and thus becomes toxic not only to aquatic lives but also to humans who are at the top of the food chain zinc was found in this study to have the highest concentration in the sediment of oluwa river while cadmium was recorded to have the least the concentration of the heavy metals followed the trend zn mn cr ni pb cu cd the high mean concentration of these metals especially zinc manganese nickel and chromium in sediment samples of oluwa river may be due to bitumen deposit in agbabu village and oluwa river which flows through the village this is in agreement with the submission of adebiyi et al 65 who in an elemental characterization of the nigerian bitumen by total reflection x ray fluorescence showed fe cr and manganese to be some of the constituents of bitumen adebiyi and omole 63 also submitted that nigerian bitumen components asphaltene oil and resins when subjected to trace metal analysis were found to contain high concentrations of zinc nickel vanadium and iron the result obtained for heavy metal in the sediments of oluwa river in this study is also in agreement with the submission of ololade and ajayi 40 where they reported that contamination of heavy metal in the sediment of major rivers along the highways in ondo state follows the order zn pb cu cd which is similar to what was obtained in oluwa river sediment the result recorded for lead at sites a and b showed no significant difference it could be that the metal probably originated from many sources these sources include contamination by bitumen run offs due to rainwater and anthropogenic activity such as agriculture which is noticed upstream site a high concentration of lead observed in the sediment during the rainy season table 4 which was significantly different to what was observed in the dry season implies that the metal is firmly bounded within the crystal structure of the minerals comprising the sediment and are not largely affected by dilution due to rain 70 5 conclusion from the studies surface water and sediment of oluwa river was found to be grossly polluted with organics and heavy metals as evident in high cod and bod and low do observed in this study the high increase in heavy metal concentration above the regulatory limits of who nis and usepa in the surface water as well as the sediment of oluwa river has really implicated the water body as being polluted higher concentrations of the metals investigated especially downstream site b revealed that villagers depend on the river water for domestic use which includes bathing washing and drinking or for agricultural uses like fishing and farming probably the presence of bitumen in the water body also influenced high concentrations of these metals most especially zinc villagers making use of the water body may indeed be exposed to some health risks with all these revelations oluwa river is said to be highly polluted especially with heavy metals and it is not recommended as a drinking water for human consumption 
8838,in this study batch tests on anaerobic digestion of tannery fleshing skin residue waste from hides tanning process as sole substrate have been performed with the purpose of assessing the effects of high substrate concentration and consequent ammonia inhibition on the process co digestion with tannery primary sludge was also evaluated according to the results no inhibition occurred at initial organic load up to 5 gvs l an inhibited steady state was observed at 10 gvs l and system failure and instability was showed at the highest load of 20 gvs l co digestion with tannery primary sludge proved feasible probably due to dilution effect the observed ammonia and vfa accumulation over the experimental time lapse is also discussed results are intended to increase knowledge on the technological application of anaerobic digestion of sole tannery fleshing in the perspective of its application as on site treatment solution for decentralised tanneries keywords anaerobic digestion tannery waste ammonia inhibition organic load 1 introduction 1 1 tannery wastes tannery industry is among the most polluting activities due to the high production of wastewaters and solid wastes 1 when tannery industries are organized as concentrated district tannery wastewaters are treated in dedicated industrial wastewater treatment plants where the production of tannery primary sludge and secondary sludge is massive leather tanning is a multi step sequential process comprising pre tanning tanning and crusting and refinishing operations 2 therefore tannery solid wastes may vary widely in terms of quantity and quality depending on the process phase they have been generated from most pollutant load is generated in pre tanning and tanning operations 2 pre tanning solid wastes comprise mainly hairs skin trimmings and fleshing tanned solid wastes such as wet blue trimmings and shavings carry the additional polluting load associated to tanning agents i e chrome or tannins tannery fleshing tf is originated by the removal of the tissue adhered to the animal hide usually after liming treatment and before tanning process and is characterized by high proteinaceous organic content low c n ratios and high levels of chemical salts since hides are usually preserved with sodium chloride and undergo liming and pickling treatments tf and tps have been traditionally handled trhough landfill disposal and incineration 3 due to the high content in chemical pollutants and the presence of recalcitrant compounds though in response to new stringent regulations and environmental policies encouraging alternative eco friendly treatments anaerobic digestion ad turned an attractive solution in the perspective of sustainable and integrated management of tannery solid wastes and wastewaters besides ad other alternative treatments have been proposed in order to divert fleshing and other leather wastes from final landfill disposal or incineration in favour of energy and or resource recovery some of the reported bioconversion treatments include production of proteolytic enzymes from fleshing fermentation 18 composting 10 recovery of tanning agents 19 biodiesel production 20 additionally physico chemical treatments have been applied to tf since more than 20 years for fat and protein recovery or glue production generally in centralised industrial contexts where the economy of scale makes it cost effective to collect and treat tf for material recovery for example in the tuscany tannery district fleshing is collected from about 400 tanneries by a single company sgs pisa italy that separates fat and protein fractions and sells them on the market for cosmetic and fertilizer industries respectively nevertheless such a treatment requires a complex and energy consuming processes and the market of final by products is affected by strong price fluctuations thereby the technological application of ad of tf has encountered the interest of medium or large size de centralized tanneries whose solid waste production is high enough to maintain stable process operation enabling the private investors to operate their own treatment solution potentially self sustained in terms of energy saving in waste transportation and disposal costs while allowing virtuous and profitable valorisation for the treated matrices as reported by priebe et al 4 the first attempt to recover energy through anaerobic digestion of tannery wastes was conducted in 1982 by cenni et al 5 since then various authors have investigated the feasibility of anaerobic processes for tannery wastes and sludge especially in those countries where leather industry plays a prominent role within the national economy several available studies refer to tannery districts in india 6 12 china 13 14 latin america 4 15 as well as italy 1 16 as a general conclusion studies regarding ad of leather solid wastes agree on process feasibility while warning against possible operational problems related to unbalanced c n ratios and inhibitory conditions from ammonia long chain fatty acids and sulphide moreover biological treatments and specifically ad proved to perform better for untanned wastes than for tanned ones since tanning operations are aimed to stabilize leather collagen priebe et al 4 tested anaerobic biodegradability of tannery wastes holding different chrome concentrations and concluded that the higher the chrome content the lower the methane yield mainly due to the low hydrolysis of tanned stabilized material the same authors highlighted that proper selection of seed sludge and substrate hydrolysis pre treatments may be crucial to overcome low performance drawbacks similarly dhayalan et al 17 tested biodegradability of untanned chrome tanned and vegetable tanned leather solid wastes the highest methane yield was observed for untanned waste albeit vegetable tanned wastes proved more biodegradable than chrome tanned ones in the same study the effect of detanning pretreatment was also evaluated and resulted in an increase in waste biodegradability though the majority of the reported studies refers to ad of a mixture of tannery wastes and other substrate either originated from tannery industry and not the present work is intended to increase knowledge on the technological application of anaerobic digestion of sole tannery fleshing in the perspective of its application as on site treatment solution for decentralised tanneries particularly critical conditions related to high organic load and ammonia concentrations have been studied in order to define applicability range and system robustness prior to overburden conditions co digestion with tannery primary sludge has also been tested with the only purpose of confirming its feasibility and effect as possible mitigation solution 1 2 ad of protein rich wastes the potential methane yield of a given substrates strongly depends on the relative content in terms of carbohydrates proteins and lipids since the three macro compounds have different degradation kinetics and specific methane yield lipids have the highest stoichiometric methane potential due to the high number of c and h atoms in their molecular structure although long chain fatty acids lcfa accumulation and lipids adsorption onto solids surface may lead to inhibitory conditions and operational problems e g sludge floatation and or washout especially in case of granular sludge 21 23 lipids as fats oil and grease are the main component of some industrial wastewater such as slaughterhouse dairy industry or fat refineries 24 carbohydrates are characterized by high c n ratios conductive for high degradation rate albeit unbalanced acidogenic and methanogenic reactions rates may lead to volatile fatty acids vfa accumulation and system acidification 23 they are the main component of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and in general cellulose is the most abundant in complex organic wastes 22 proteins methane yield is comparable with carbohydrates and protein rich wastes are typically originated from farms agro industrial and meat processing sectors when dealing with solid wastes derived from animal tissues e g tf fibrous proteins are the main building material collagen and elastin are present in connective tissue ligaments and tendons keratin in skin hair feathers horns and hoofs and myosin in muscles 22 despite their high organic content and high biodegradability anaerobic digestion of protein rich wastes has experienced limited application worldwide this is mainly due to the inhibition effect of ammonia accumulation released during protein degradation resulting in process instability or inhibitory steady state and eventual low biogas production according to kovács et al 25 out of the more than 7800 ad plants operating in the eu in 2013 none was processing protein rich waste as primary substrate despite the relevant generation of such wastes at the european level the interest to widen further ad application as sustainable organic waste treatment and the relevant entity of protein rich waste generation have been pushing research and industry to tackle operational limitations due to ammonia inhibition kovács et al 25 challenged the common belief that protein rich feed as mono substrate should be avoided due to process inhibition in their study a preliminary experimental phase regarded two feed batch lab scale reactors fed by pig blood and casein respectively at increasing input loads until process failure took place due to ammonia inhibition results show that ad of protein rich monosubstrates is feasible up to certain weekly protein load of 4 6 g protein vs l and consequent total ammonia nitrogen tan level up to 7 8g l biomass acclimation being crucial 1 3 effect of ammonia and organic load ammonia inhibition is acknowledged as one of the primary causes of ad failure and several studies focused on the actual mechanism of its toxic effect on the microbial activities in the last decades although several technics have been proposed and implemented for efficient and cost effective ammonia control in full scale digesters ad implementation to nitrogen rich substrates is still challenging 26 28 in its review on ad ammonia inhibition rajagopal et al 26 emphasized that research on parameters influencing ammonia inhibition need to go further and that particular focus is now given on the evolution of the methanogenic population at increasing ammonia levels the role of ammonia in anaerobic digesters is multiple optimal levels of ammonia up to 200mg l ensure adequate supply of nitrogen as nutrient substance for anaerobic biomass and increase system s buffer capacity counteracting acidification lead by vfa production 26 on the contrary ammonia concentration exceeding certain critical thresholds is detrimental to the process due to its toxic effect in aqueous systems tan accounts for both the unionized free ammonia fa nh3 and the ionized form nh4 whose equilibrium is governed by ph and temperature according to eq 1 26 27 1 fa tan 1 10 ph 10 0 09018 272 92 t 1 authors widely agree that fa is the actual toxic form the main inhibition mechanisms proposed are ascribed to i direct inhibition on enzyme production by methanogenic biomass and ii effects of passive diffusion into bacterial cells as fa can cross cellular membrane and interfere with internal cell ph leading to proton unbalance and energy requirement increase 28 however the extent of fa diffusion and consequent inhibition depends on the physiology of the methanogenic biomass 14 reported toxic threshold of ammonia concentrations vary widely chen et al 14 reported that values of ammonia concentration causing 50 of methane production reduction range from 1 7 to 14g l such a wide range is due to the differences in substrate inoculum seed sludge environmental conditions temperature and ph and biomass acclimation gallert et al 29 highlighted that many studies reporting critical concentrations does not distinguish between fa and tan levels probably increasing the concentration range further prior to complete system failure an inhibited steady state has been reported as the most commune consequence of severe ammonia inhibition according to chen et al 14 such a steady state condition is characterized by process stability at a lower methane production resulting from the interaction between the concomitant effects of fa vfa and ph numerous strategies have been explored in order to prevent or control ammonia inhibition co digestion is among the most applied and successful solutions allowing for c n optimization and dilution of possible inhibitory compounds shanmugam and horan 30 reported the positive effect of co digesting tannery fleshing with municipal solid waste with respect of ad of sole tannery fleshing due to c n ratio re balance together with ph control table 3 on the other hand in full scale reactors the maximization of biogas production is generally achieved by increasing organic loading rates olr 31 high organic loads allow for high rate kinetics provided sufficient nutrients and buffering conditions and proper inoculum substrate ratios though overload conditions may unbalance kinetic rates in the pathways of ad reactions leading to unstable or inefficient states vfa accumulation is among the first consequence of process overloading in case of low buffer capacity of the system vfa accumulation causes fast drop in ph which in turn inhibits methanogenic microorganisms generally more sensitive to low ph than acid producers leading to further vfa accumulation when dealing with protein rich substrates high organic loads results in high levels of ammonia making it difficult to discriminate between the negative effect of system overload or ammonia inhibition as reported by moestedt et al 31 in the mentioned study authors aimed to separate the effect of these two factors by running two semi continuous reactors fed by protein rich thin stillage one reactor was operated at increasing olr and the other at increasing loading of urea in order to increase ammonia concentration in the reactor the outcomes showed that the critical ammonia concentration for process stability was around 1g l in both reactors irrespective of olr in the present study the role of ammonia and organic load on ad of sole tannery fleshing was investigated through parallel batch tests at increasing initial organic loads co digestion of tf with tannery primary sludge tps was also tested 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up wastes were collected from the tannery district of león guanajuato mexico which represents the largest one in mexico 32 tannery fleshing was provided by a commercial tannery after liming process tannery primary sludge was collected from the chemical primary sedimentation tank in the tannery wwtp of león in the plant polyelectrolytes are added to enhance solid precipitation together with sulfuric acid for ph adjustment all samples were stored at 4 c before the experiment granular seed sludge was collected from a uasb digester treating tequila vinasses casa herradura amatitan jalisco méxico and stored at 4 c prior to its utilization as inoculum in the tests it was re activated at room temperature with the injection of acetate and no nutrient addition the acetate consumption was monitored by analysing the supernatant liquor and the inoculum used after acetate s complete degradation around three days after injection multiple parallel tests were conducted in serum bottle of 120ml volume initial conditions for the seven tests namely test a to g are summarised in table 1 according to previous results 39 the not acclimated inoculum proved suitable for ad of tannery wastes all the tests had the same initial inoculum concentration of 5 gvs l and different initial substrate concentrations such an experimental condition was intended to assess the substrate effect on the given biomass by substrate dependent variation of the i s ratio tests a b and c had increasing initial tf concentration of 5 10 and 20 gvs l respectively test d was performed with tps at initial substrate concentration of 2 gvs l and test e was conducted to assess substrates co digestion with initial fleshing concentration of 10 gvs l and primary sludge of 2 gvs l finally test f was run as positive control with acetate addition and test g as blank control inoculum only seed sludge granules were rinsed in order to remove residual organic matter prior to be placed in the serum bottles size reduction of tf was achieved by mincing it with a commercial meat miller mineral medium was prepared according to 33 and added in order to provide optimum conditions for methanogenic activity yeast extract was added in the proportion of 100mg per liter of final volume solution the serum bottles were filled to obtain a working volume of 70ml sealed with rubber stoppers and crimped with aluminium ring the headspace was flushed with a mixed gas of 80 co2 and 20 n2 for 5min initial ph was adjusted at 7 with addition of 1m hcl solution an incubator with rotating plate ensured continuously stirred conditions and mesophilic temperature of 32 5 c biogas production was measured regularly through water displacement water was saturated with commercial sodium chloride to minimize co2 dissolution the frequency of biogas sampling was decided according to the observed biogas production in order to limit excessive overpressure interference on average gas in the bottle headspace was purged until pressure equilibrium every 12 or 24h in the first exponential production phase and every 2 3 days in the low rate production phase the experiments were run until biogas production rates levelled off to the endogenous levels observed in the blank control biogas production below 1ml per day during the duration of the experiment 2 ml samples were withdrawn from the serum bottles in order to analyse n nh4 vfa and ph process performance was assessed on the base of cumulative methane production specific methane production spm nl ch4 gvs add methane content and vfa accumulation 2 2 analytical methods analysis of cod ts vs were performed according to methods apha standard method 34 n nh4 was measured according to 4500 nh3 f phenate method 34 tannery fleshing was characterized in terms of total proteins 35 total carbohydrates 36 and total lipids 37 representative homogeneous sample of tf was achieved by mincing around 5 kilos of fleshing acetate propionate and butyrate were analysed through capillary electrophoresis agilent g1600a prior to sample dilution filtration and centrifugation at 3000rpm after purging headspace biogas into the inverted burette biogas samples were withdrawn with a lock syringe and analysed though gas chromatography to assess ch4 and co2 content the gas chromatograph agilent 6850 was equipped with thermal conductivity detector tcd and ht plot q packed column using nitrogen as carrier gas the injector oven and detector temperature were 250 70 and 250 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate characteristics results on substrate characterization in terms of ts vs cod and ph are reported in table 2 tannery primary sludge showed moderate solid content of 2 ammonia concentration of 403 5 mgn nh4 l and neutral ph however it should be noted that such a waste is characterized by strong variations in terms of solid and pollutant content due to the relevant fluctuations in tannery wastewater characteristics indeed tanneries industrial activity varies significantly over the week as well as over the year the protein and fat content on a dry weight base of tannery fleshing were 71 3 and 12 7 respectively the remaining 16 was ascribed to inorganic material these values are comparable with those reported by zerdani et al 38 protein 79 fat 7 57 and thangamani et al 8 protein 56 5 fat 4 79 3 2 methane production fig 1 shows the cumulative and specific methane production curves for tests a to e blank control exhibited very low biogas production 2ml d ascribed to endogenous metabolism only whereas the positive control with acetate presented a maximum methane production rate of 9 45 1 42 nml ch4 d during the exponential phase all the tests exhibited an initial lag phase of three days tests a and d at low initial concentrations sole tf and sole tps respectively showed stable behaviour and no detectable inhibition their final smp of 0 44 0 02 nl ch4 gvs add for test a and 0 24 0 04 nl ch4 gvs add for test d are comparable with results obtained in a previous study 39 where two experiments were performed using the same sourced tf and tps as sole substrates at low input concentrations organic loads of 1 2 5 gvs l and different i s ratios in the mentioned work average spm values of 0 47 0 05 and 0 26 0 06 nl ch4 gvs add were obtained for tf and tps respectively and no noticeable inhibition observed it should be noted that in the tannery district of león tannery wastewaters undergo a rough primary sedimentation in a specific tank within each tannery before being discharged in the industrial sewer pipelines thus part of the particulate organic content is removed before reaching the tannery wwtp and this might explain to some extent the moderate methane production obtained from tps methane yield reductions of 20 and 80 were observed for test b and c respectively fig 1b indicating that inhibitory conditions occurred the final smp of co digestion test e almost equals the sum of smp values obtained in test b and d suggesting that the main advantage of waste blending was the additive effect of tps organic load contribution and possibly a dilution effect of inhibitory compounds table 3 reports the main findings available in literature about methane production from tannery solid wastes as sole or mixed substrate under batch laboratory scale conditions our results on smp are in line with those reported by the studies reporting ad of tf as sole or blended substrate on the basis of chemical elemental analysis shanmugam and horan 40 and kameswari et al 12 reported the following empirical formulas for tf c4h11no2 and c172h295n43so132 the corresponding c n ratios ranging from 3 2 and 4 the high methane yield obtained by shanmugam and horan 30 was obtained by optimizing the blend of tf with municipal solid waste in order to obtain optimal c n value of 15 and by ph correction to the optimum value of 6 5 optimal c n values for anaerobic digestion are generally indicated between 20 and 30 23 though some studies reported successful applications at c n ratios far outside the optimal range 41 results from the present study highlight process feasibility even at that very low c n ratios 10 as in the case of sole tannery fleshing in test a although process showed quite sensible to operational conditions such as high organic load and ph although co digestion is widely encouraged in order to re balance c n ratios also the co substrate used in this study tps exhibited a low cod n ratio around 9 nevertheless co digestion test e indicates a no detrimental effect of wastes blending albeit it is likely related to dilution the actual feasibility of tps and tf co digestion was already studied in previous works reported in 16 particularly 150 liter pilot reactors were operated for more than six months testing different mixtures of the two wastes although the tannery primary sludge was kept as the main substrate in terms of vs mass contribution on the contrary and according with the purpose of the present study the fleshing was selected as the main substrate in the co digestion test e other studies 8 12 also confirmed the technological feasibility of co digestiong tf and tannery sludge zupančič et al 3 reports a methane production of 0 552 nl ch4 gvs add higher though comparable than the maximum obtained in test a 0 44 0 02 nl ch4 gvs add this is likely due to the significantly lower input organic load as well as the higher operating temperature to the best of our knowledge there are no studies reporting of batch ad of sole tf at high initial substrate concentration 3 3 organic load and ammonia influence on process performance fig 2 presents data on methane percentage together with ammonia and vfa concentrations throughout the experiment the final ammonia concentrations in tests with sole tf as substrate were 0 76 0 03 1 50 0 08 and 2 42 0 10 gn nh4 l for test a b and c respectively the increasing concentrations observed reflected the increasing proteinaceous input almost proportionally in test d ammonia was 0 22 0 06 gn nh4 l and the co digestion test e showed an additive effect of the two substrates degradation observed value 1 48 0 20 gn nh4 l as can be observed by matching results from tests b and d almost all the tests presented vfa accumulation within the first week of the experiment fig 2b though in test a and d the maximum vfa concentration kept at a minimal concentration below 0 5g l the adverse effect of high ammonia and organic load levels turned visible in tests b and dramatically in test c as mentioned above test b experienced 20 decrease in specific methane yield compared to test a but the overall behaviour throughout the test showed almost stable conditions fig 1 such a behaviour reasonably depicts an inhibited steady state i e the process performed at a lower production rate while enduring stress conditions of 1 50 0 08 gn nh4 l a temporary vfa accumulation of 1 11 0 09g l was observed in the first week conversely test c proved strikingly unstable with a final 80 reduction in specific methane yield the final ammonia concentration reached 2 42 0 10 gn nh4 l process instability is observed on the profile of methane production curve linear production phases followed by almost zero production plateau fig 1 and the behaviour of vfa accumulation throughout the test as presented in figs 2 and 3 at day 7th the highest vfa concentration of 7 07 0 95g l was detected and reflected by a low methane percentage of less than 40 whereas the other tests reached quickly stable level of 60 70 fig 2a at day 15th vfa fell below 1g l whereas increased again up to 7 1 0 33g l at day 30th looking at ammonia fig 2c in all the tests except test c ammonia rose and stabilized from day 7th on suggesting that protein hydrolysis and amino acid breakdown took place within this first time lapse conversely in test c ammonia concentration increased from day 7th to day 15th and then kept stable in day 30th this pattern might indicate that even protein hydrolysis might have been affected and slowed down by severe inhibitory conditions this hypothesis is in line with the study reported in 29 where authors investigated the role of ammonia inhibition at increasing concentrations of peptone as mono substrate and increasing addition of external ammonia source their findings report that under mesophilic conditions the rate of protein deamination i e the release of amine groups due to amino acid molecule breakdown turned slower as ammonia concentration increased tan ranging from less than 1g l up to 6g l however fernandes et al 42 evaluated ammonia inhibition on hydrolysis of carbohydrates as crystalline cellulose and lipids as tributyrin at different induced ammonia concentration and fixed ph of 8 their outcomes showed weak correlation between hydrolysis rates and ammonia concentrations questioning the actual influence of ammonia on hydrolysis the authors highlight that research on hydrolysis inhibition from ammonia are still limited in contrast with the well established knowledge on ammonia inhibition on methanogenesis and despite the fact that hydrolysis is commonly considered the rate limiting step when dealing with solid rich substrates among the different microbial groups involved in ad methanogens are generally considered the most sensitive to ammonia inhibition although conflicting positions are reported in literature several studies have reported hydrogenotrophic methanogens to be more tolerant to high ammonia exposure than acetotrophic ones promoting a shift of methane production pathway towards syntrophic acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm 13 27 39 43 more in the detail fig 3 reports the observed concentrations of acetic propionic and butyric acids at days 7th 15th and 28th tests b and e exhibited a temporary accumulation of vfa in the first week depleted until not detectable levels in the subsequent analyses moreover no significant reduction of ch4 percentage in the biogas was observed fig 2a suggesting that no strong inhibition occurred for the methanogenic population an unstable behaviour was detected for acetate propionate and butyrate concentrations in test c based on acetate concentration observed in test c it can be suggested that a first acetotrophics inhibition may have occurred by the high acetate concentration of 4 56 0 28g l at day 7th whose corresponding ch4 percentage is around 40 in fact much lower than the other tests a temporal acetoclastic biomass acclimation and or the sao hm might have occurred in the second week prior to further system failure in the last days fig 2b also propionate accumulation was noticeable and reached 1 90 0 26g l suggesting propionate degraders inhibition fig 3 some authors indicate the ratio of propionate and acetate concentration as process stability indicator specifically values higher than 1 4 are reported to be representative of strong instability 44 based on the results observed in test c the ratio was below this critical value though process proved instable gallert et al 29 observed propionate accumulation at ammonia concentration higher than 1g l whereas chen et al 27 at ammonia concentration higher than 2g l but performed under acid ph similarly moestedt et al 31 detected propionate accumulation at tan concentration higher than 1g l reporting that this might be due either to inhibition of propionate oxidizers or to a shift of acidogenesis towards more propionate production as the increase in hydrogen pressure in the system may direct this degradation phase towards the production of acids longer than acetic acid 45 in the present study it seems that propionate accumulation is likely due to propionate degraders inhibition more than other factors according to the results only the lowest organic load of 5 gvs l proved suitable for the experimental conditions tested as already discussed organic load and ammonia accumulation are strictly connected when processing protein rich substrates so that it is not easy to ascribe system failure to one rather than to the other factor especially in this latter case of test c where both organic load and ammonia nitrogen are critically high based on eq 1 a first assessment of fan concentration can be done in order to evaluate its potential inhibitory effect during the experimental time course ph raised at levels around 8 8 5 in all the test treating tf this is likely due to the alkaline ph of limed fleshing as well as to ammonia release despite the significant vfa accumulation exhibited in test c acidification never occurred confirming in fact the strong buffer capacity of the system in this study ph correction was not deemed an option as the aim was to push stressing conditions up to system failure the maximum ammonium concentration of 2 42 0 10 gn nh4 l experienced at the maximum organic load of 20gvs l test c is far below some of the toxic levels reported in literature although toxicity ranges vary widely as already discussed the evident detrimental effect observed is very likely to be caused by fa depending on ph fa might account for less than 1 of total tan at ph 7 to almost 10 at ph 8 and up to 48 at ph 9 according to the calculated values fa ranges from 0 16 p 8 to 0 42g l ph 8 5 in test b and from 0 25g l ph 8 to 0 67g l ph 8 5 in test c these values fall within the concentration range discussed in the review conducted by rajagopal et al 26 the reported fa inhibitory concentrations are 316mg l at ph 8 37 c for ad of swine manure 46 750mg l at ph 8 and 37 c during digestion of swine manure 47 1450mg l at ph 7 6 and 51 c for co digestion of swine manure and other solid organic fractions 48 it has to be noted that results from batch conditions can be far from being representative of methane production under continuous operation on the one hand the long time course of the experiment and optimum initial conditions in terms of nutrient supply is conductive to complete organic matter degradation including slow degradable compounds that might not be degraded in continuous systems unless very long sludge retention time are provided on the other hand batch systems are more sensitive to overload conditions and accumulation of different toxic compounds into a reduced working volume thereby it may be that both overloading and ammonia inhibition adversely contributed to the low performance of test c whereas test b is likely to have been affected mainly by ammonia inhibition as organic load of 10 gvs l have shown to be feasible for ad of tannery wastes at comparable experimental set up table 2 in the perspective of a technological application for onsite treatment of tf in medium or large size de centralised tanneries organic load confirmed to be crucial for successful process stability in the simplest scenario of no ammonia mitigation measures even a low performance stable state as the one indicated in test b can be an attractive solution as it would achieve solids reduction and waste stabilization facilitating final disposal management conversely in case the ad of tf is adopted within an integrated tannery and wastewater treatment train the maximization of biogas production and methane content becomes of prominent interest from an economic point of view in this case high organic loading rates would probably request operational strategies to minimize the toxic effect of high ammonia concentrations and co digestion with the tannery sludge could be a cost effective solution besides co digestion and ph and control biomass acclimation to high ammonia levels is a useful and economic solution even though acclimation periods might last some months 26 gao et al 13 claimed that only few studies have attempted to use bacterial acclimation to attenuate ammonia inhibition in n rich waste ad and their work successfully adopted in situ biomass adaptation under step wise ammonia exposure up to tan concentration higher than 4g l during ad of protein rich kitchen wastes together with ammonia control solutions such as biogas recirculation 49 or struvite precipitation 50 waste pre treatment such as preliminary tf hydrolysation could also be valuable in order to prompt organic matter degradation as well as ease operational reactor management 4 conclusions results of the present work indicate that anaerobic digestion of tf is technically feasible at low organic load of 5 gvs l at higher organic loads of 10 and 20 gvs l the system started to suffer from ammonia inhibition due to tan level of 1 50 0 08 gn nh4 l and 2 42 0 10 gn nh4 l that brought to inhibited steady state and system failure respectively the detrimental effect of ammonia exposure was exacerbated by relatively high ph values that never fell below 8 due to the alkaline ph of limed tf and the increase in buffering capacity brought by ammonia release overloading condition is likely to be occurred at the highest organic load testes contributing to the low performance observed in the perspective of full scale implementation organic loading rate is crucial for successful process stability a steady state process even at a moderate methane production rate such as the one indicated in the test with 10 gvs l could be still attractive as tf treatment solution since it would achieve on site waste stabilization and stable process conditions in order to optimize methane production high organic loading rates would probably require ammonia control strategy and tf pre treatments co digestion with tps proved a suitable solution since no adverse effect was observed and the final methane production accounted for an almost additive effect of the two substrates degradation and might represent a cost effective solution towards an integrated tannery waste and wastewater treatment train acknowledgements the study was supported by european union in the frame of the marie curie irses program carbala project 295176 
8838,in this study batch tests on anaerobic digestion of tannery fleshing skin residue waste from hides tanning process as sole substrate have been performed with the purpose of assessing the effects of high substrate concentration and consequent ammonia inhibition on the process co digestion with tannery primary sludge was also evaluated according to the results no inhibition occurred at initial organic load up to 5 gvs l an inhibited steady state was observed at 10 gvs l and system failure and instability was showed at the highest load of 20 gvs l co digestion with tannery primary sludge proved feasible probably due to dilution effect the observed ammonia and vfa accumulation over the experimental time lapse is also discussed results are intended to increase knowledge on the technological application of anaerobic digestion of sole tannery fleshing in the perspective of its application as on site treatment solution for decentralised tanneries keywords anaerobic digestion tannery waste ammonia inhibition organic load 1 introduction 1 1 tannery wastes tannery industry is among the most polluting activities due to the high production of wastewaters and solid wastes 1 when tannery industries are organized as concentrated district tannery wastewaters are treated in dedicated industrial wastewater treatment plants where the production of tannery primary sludge and secondary sludge is massive leather tanning is a multi step sequential process comprising pre tanning tanning and crusting and refinishing operations 2 therefore tannery solid wastes may vary widely in terms of quantity and quality depending on the process phase they have been generated from most pollutant load is generated in pre tanning and tanning operations 2 pre tanning solid wastes comprise mainly hairs skin trimmings and fleshing tanned solid wastes such as wet blue trimmings and shavings carry the additional polluting load associated to tanning agents i e chrome or tannins tannery fleshing tf is originated by the removal of the tissue adhered to the animal hide usually after liming treatment and before tanning process and is characterized by high proteinaceous organic content low c n ratios and high levels of chemical salts since hides are usually preserved with sodium chloride and undergo liming and pickling treatments tf and tps have been traditionally handled trhough landfill disposal and incineration 3 due to the high content in chemical pollutants and the presence of recalcitrant compounds though in response to new stringent regulations and environmental policies encouraging alternative eco friendly treatments anaerobic digestion ad turned an attractive solution in the perspective of sustainable and integrated management of tannery solid wastes and wastewaters besides ad other alternative treatments have been proposed in order to divert fleshing and other leather wastes from final landfill disposal or incineration in favour of energy and or resource recovery some of the reported bioconversion treatments include production of proteolytic enzymes from fleshing fermentation 18 composting 10 recovery of tanning agents 19 biodiesel production 20 additionally physico chemical treatments have been applied to tf since more than 20 years for fat and protein recovery or glue production generally in centralised industrial contexts where the economy of scale makes it cost effective to collect and treat tf for material recovery for example in the tuscany tannery district fleshing is collected from about 400 tanneries by a single company sgs pisa italy that separates fat and protein fractions and sells them on the market for cosmetic and fertilizer industries respectively nevertheless such a treatment requires a complex and energy consuming processes and the market of final by products is affected by strong price fluctuations thereby the technological application of ad of tf has encountered the interest of medium or large size de centralized tanneries whose solid waste production is high enough to maintain stable process operation enabling the private investors to operate their own treatment solution potentially self sustained in terms of energy saving in waste transportation and disposal costs while allowing virtuous and profitable valorisation for the treated matrices as reported by priebe et al 4 the first attempt to recover energy through anaerobic digestion of tannery wastes was conducted in 1982 by cenni et al 5 since then various authors have investigated the feasibility of anaerobic processes for tannery wastes and sludge especially in those countries where leather industry plays a prominent role within the national economy several available studies refer to tannery districts in india 6 12 china 13 14 latin america 4 15 as well as italy 1 16 as a general conclusion studies regarding ad of leather solid wastes agree on process feasibility while warning against possible operational problems related to unbalanced c n ratios and inhibitory conditions from ammonia long chain fatty acids and sulphide moreover biological treatments and specifically ad proved to perform better for untanned wastes than for tanned ones since tanning operations are aimed to stabilize leather collagen priebe et al 4 tested anaerobic biodegradability of tannery wastes holding different chrome concentrations and concluded that the higher the chrome content the lower the methane yield mainly due to the low hydrolysis of tanned stabilized material the same authors highlighted that proper selection of seed sludge and substrate hydrolysis pre treatments may be crucial to overcome low performance drawbacks similarly dhayalan et al 17 tested biodegradability of untanned chrome tanned and vegetable tanned leather solid wastes the highest methane yield was observed for untanned waste albeit vegetable tanned wastes proved more biodegradable than chrome tanned ones in the same study the effect of detanning pretreatment was also evaluated and resulted in an increase in waste biodegradability though the majority of the reported studies refers to ad of a mixture of tannery wastes and other substrate either originated from tannery industry and not the present work is intended to increase knowledge on the technological application of anaerobic digestion of sole tannery fleshing in the perspective of its application as on site treatment solution for decentralised tanneries particularly critical conditions related to high organic load and ammonia concentrations have been studied in order to define applicability range and system robustness prior to overburden conditions co digestion with tannery primary sludge has also been tested with the only purpose of confirming its feasibility and effect as possible mitigation solution 1 2 ad of protein rich wastes the potential methane yield of a given substrates strongly depends on the relative content in terms of carbohydrates proteins and lipids since the three macro compounds have different degradation kinetics and specific methane yield lipids have the highest stoichiometric methane potential due to the high number of c and h atoms in their molecular structure although long chain fatty acids lcfa accumulation and lipids adsorption onto solids surface may lead to inhibitory conditions and operational problems e g sludge floatation and or washout especially in case of granular sludge 21 23 lipids as fats oil and grease are the main component of some industrial wastewater such as slaughterhouse dairy industry or fat refineries 24 carbohydrates are characterized by high c n ratios conductive for high degradation rate albeit unbalanced acidogenic and methanogenic reactions rates may lead to volatile fatty acids vfa accumulation and system acidification 23 they are the main component of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and in general cellulose is the most abundant in complex organic wastes 22 proteins methane yield is comparable with carbohydrates and protein rich wastes are typically originated from farms agro industrial and meat processing sectors when dealing with solid wastes derived from animal tissues e g tf fibrous proteins are the main building material collagen and elastin are present in connective tissue ligaments and tendons keratin in skin hair feathers horns and hoofs and myosin in muscles 22 despite their high organic content and high biodegradability anaerobic digestion of protein rich wastes has experienced limited application worldwide this is mainly due to the inhibition effect of ammonia accumulation released during protein degradation resulting in process instability or inhibitory steady state and eventual low biogas production according to kovács et al 25 out of the more than 7800 ad plants operating in the eu in 2013 none was processing protein rich waste as primary substrate despite the relevant generation of such wastes at the european level the interest to widen further ad application as sustainable organic waste treatment and the relevant entity of protein rich waste generation have been pushing research and industry to tackle operational limitations due to ammonia inhibition kovács et al 25 challenged the common belief that protein rich feed as mono substrate should be avoided due to process inhibition in their study a preliminary experimental phase regarded two feed batch lab scale reactors fed by pig blood and casein respectively at increasing input loads until process failure took place due to ammonia inhibition results show that ad of protein rich monosubstrates is feasible up to certain weekly protein load of 4 6 g protein vs l and consequent total ammonia nitrogen tan level up to 7 8g l biomass acclimation being crucial 1 3 effect of ammonia and organic load ammonia inhibition is acknowledged as one of the primary causes of ad failure and several studies focused on the actual mechanism of its toxic effect on the microbial activities in the last decades although several technics have been proposed and implemented for efficient and cost effective ammonia control in full scale digesters ad implementation to nitrogen rich substrates is still challenging 26 28 in its review on ad ammonia inhibition rajagopal et al 26 emphasized that research on parameters influencing ammonia inhibition need to go further and that particular focus is now given on the evolution of the methanogenic population at increasing ammonia levels the role of ammonia in anaerobic digesters is multiple optimal levels of ammonia up to 200mg l ensure adequate supply of nitrogen as nutrient substance for anaerobic biomass and increase system s buffer capacity counteracting acidification lead by vfa production 26 on the contrary ammonia concentration exceeding certain critical thresholds is detrimental to the process due to its toxic effect in aqueous systems tan accounts for both the unionized free ammonia fa nh3 and the ionized form nh4 whose equilibrium is governed by ph and temperature according to eq 1 26 27 1 fa tan 1 10 ph 10 0 09018 272 92 t 1 authors widely agree that fa is the actual toxic form the main inhibition mechanisms proposed are ascribed to i direct inhibition on enzyme production by methanogenic biomass and ii effects of passive diffusion into bacterial cells as fa can cross cellular membrane and interfere with internal cell ph leading to proton unbalance and energy requirement increase 28 however the extent of fa diffusion and consequent inhibition depends on the physiology of the methanogenic biomass 14 reported toxic threshold of ammonia concentrations vary widely chen et al 14 reported that values of ammonia concentration causing 50 of methane production reduction range from 1 7 to 14g l such a wide range is due to the differences in substrate inoculum seed sludge environmental conditions temperature and ph and biomass acclimation gallert et al 29 highlighted that many studies reporting critical concentrations does not distinguish between fa and tan levels probably increasing the concentration range further prior to complete system failure an inhibited steady state has been reported as the most commune consequence of severe ammonia inhibition according to chen et al 14 such a steady state condition is characterized by process stability at a lower methane production resulting from the interaction between the concomitant effects of fa vfa and ph numerous strategies have been explored in order to prevent or control ammonia inhibition co digestion is among the most applied and successful solutions allowing for c n optimization and dilution of possible inhibitory compounds shanmugam and horan 30 reported the positive effect of co digesting tannery fleshing with municipal solid waste with respect of ad of sole tannery fleshing due to c n ratio re balance together with ph control table 3 on the other hand in full scale reactors the maximization of biogas production is generally achieved by increasing organic loading rates olr 31 high organic loads allow for high rate kinetics provided sufficient nutrients and buffering conditions and proper inoculum substrate ratios though overload conditions may unbalance kinetic rates in the pathways of ad reactions leading to unstable or inefficient states vfa accumulation is among the first consequence of process overloading in case of low buffer capacity of the system vfa accumulation causes fast drop in ph which in turn inhibits methanogenic microorganisms generally more sensitive to low ph than acid producers leading to further vfa accumulation when dealing with protein rich substrates high organic loads results in high levels of ammonia making it difficult to discriminate between the negative effect of system overload or ammonia inhibition as reported by moestedt et al 31 in the mentioned study authors aimed to separate the effect of these two factors by running two semi continuous reactors fed by protein rich thin stillage one reactor was operated at increasing olr and the other at increasing loading of urea in order to increase ammonia concentration in the reactor the outcomes showed that the critical ammonia concentration for process stability was around 1g l in both reactors irrespective of olr in the present study the role of ammonia and organic load on ad of sole tannery fleshing was investigated through parallel batch tests at increasing initial organic loads co digestion of tf with tannery primary sludge tps was also tested 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up wastes were collected from the tannery district of león guanajuato mexico which represents the largest one in mexico 32 tannery fleshing was provided by a commercial tannery after liming process tannery primary sludge was collected from the chemical primary sedimentation tank in the tannery wwtp of león in the plant polyelectrolytes are added to enhance solid precipitation together with sulfuric acid for ph adjustment all samples were stored at 4 c before the experiment granular seed sludge was collected from a uasb digester treating tequila vinasses casa herradura amatitan jalisco méxico and stored at 4 c prior to its utilization as inoculum in the tests it was re activated at room temperature with the injection of acetate and no nutrient addition the acetate consumption was monitored by analysing the supernatant liquor and the inoculum used after acetate s complete degradation around three days after injection multiple parallel tests were conducted in serum bottle of 120ml volume initial conditions for the seven tests namely test a to g are summarised in table 1 according to previous results 39 the not acclimated inoculum proved suitable for ad of tannery wastes all the tests had the same initial inoculum concentration of 5 gvs l and different initial substrate concentrations such an experimental condition was intended to assess the substrate effect on the given biomass by substrate dependent variation of the i s ratio tests a b and c had increasing initial tf concentration of 5 10 and 20 gvs l respectively test d was performed with tps at initial substrate concentration of 2 gvs l and test e was conducted to assess substrates co digestion with initial fleshing concentration of 10 gvs l and primary sludge of 2 gvs l finally test f was run as positive control with acetate addition and test g as blank control inoculum only seed sludge granules were rinsed in order to remove residual organic matter prior to be placed in the serum bottles size reduction of tf was achieved by mincing it with a commercial meat miller mineral medium was prepared according to 33 and added in order to provide optimum conditions for methanogenic activity yeast extract was added in the proportion of 100mg per liter of final volume solution the serum bottles were filled to obtain a working volume of 70ml sealed with rubber stoppers and crimped with aluminium ring the headspace was flushed with a mixed gas of 80 co2 and 20 n2 for 5min initial ph was adjusted at 7 with addition of 1m hcl solution an incubator with rotating plate ensured continuously stirred conditions and mesophilic temperature of 32 5 c biogas production was measured regularly through water displacement water was saturated with commercial sodium chloride to minimize co2 dissolution the frequency of biogas sampling was decided according to the observed biogas production in order to limit excessive overpressure interference on average gas in the bottle headspace was purged until pressure equilibrium every 12 or 24h in the first exponential production phase and every 2 3 days in the low rate production phase the experiments were run until biogas production rates levelled off to the endogenous levels observed in the blank control biogas production below 1ml per day during the duration of the experiment 2 ml samples were withdrawn from the serum bottles in order to analyse n nh4 vfa and ph process performance was assessed on the base of cumulative methane production specific methane production spm nl ch4 gvs add methane content and vfa accumulation 2 2 analytical methods analysis of cod ts vs were performed according to methods apha standard method 34 n nh4 was measured according to 4500 nh3 f phenate method 34 tannery fleshing was characterized in terms of total proteins 35 total carbohydrates 36 and total lipids 37 representative homogeneous sample of tf was achieved by mincing around 5 kilos of fleshing acetate propionate and butyrate were analysed through capillary electrophoresis agilent g1600a prior to sample dilution filtration and centrifugation at 3000rpm after purging headspace biogas into the inverted burette biogas samples were withdrawn with a lock syringe and analysed though gas chromatography to assess ch4 and co2 content the gas chromatograph agilent 6850 was equipped with thermal conductivity detector tcd and ht plot q packed column using nitrogen as carrier gas the injector oven and detector temperature were 250 70 and 250 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 substrate characteristics results on substrate characterization in terms of ts vs cod and ph are reported in table 2 tannery primary sludge showed moderate solid content of 2 ammonia concentration of 403 5 mgn nh4 l and neutral ph however it should be noted that such a waste is characterized by strong variations in terms of solid and pollutant content due to the relevant fluctuations in tannery wastewater characteristics indeed tanneries industrial activity varies significantly over the week as well as over the year the protein and fat content on a dry weight base of tannery fleshing were 71 3 and 12 7 respectively the remaining 16 was ascribed to inorganic material these values are comparable with those reported by zerdani et al 38 protein 79 fat 7 57 and thangamani et al 8 protein 56 5 fat 4 79 3 2 methane production fig 1 shows the cumulative and specific methane production curves for tests a to e blank control exhibited very low biogas production 2ml d ascribed to endogenous metabolism only whereas the positive control with acetate presented a maximum methane production rate of 9 45 1 42 nml ch4 d during the exponential phase all the tests exhibited an initial lag phase of three days tests a and d at low initial concentrations sole tf and sole tps respectively showed stable behaviour and no detectable inhibition their final smp of 0 44 0 02 nl ch4 gvs add for test a and 0 24 0 04 nl ch4 gvs add for test d are comparable with results obtained in a previous study 39 where two experiments were performed using the same sourced tf and tps as sole substrates at low input concentrations organic loads of 1 2 5 gvs l and different i s ratios in the mentioned work average spm values of 0 47 0 05 and 0 26 0 06 nl ch4 gvs add were obtained for tf and tps respectively and no noticeable inhibition observed it should be noted that in the tannery district of león tannery wastewaters undergo a rough primary sedimentation in a specific tank within each tannery before being discharged in the industrial sewer pipelines thus part of the particulate organic content is removed before reaching the tannery wwtp and this might explain to some extent the moderate methane production obtained from tps methane yield reductions of 20 and 80 were observed for test b and c respectively fig 1b indicating that inhibitory conditions occurred the final smp of co digestion test e almost equals the sum of smp values obtained in test b and d suggesting that the main advantage of waste blending was the additive effect of tps organic load contribution and possibly a dilution effect of inhibitory compounds table 3 reports the main findings available in literature about methane production from tannery solid wastes as sole or mixed substrate under batch laboratory scale conditions our results on smp are in line with those reported by the studies reporting ad of tf as sole or blended substrate on the basis of chemical elemental analysis shanmugam and horan 40 and kameswari et al 12 reported the following empirical formulas for tf c4h11no2 and c172h295n43so132 the corresponding c n ratios ranging from 3 2 and 4 the high methane yield obtained by shanmugam and horan 30 was obtained by optimizing the blend of tf with municipal solid waste in order to obtain optimal c n value of 15 and by ph correction to the optimum value of 6 5 optimal c n values for anaerobic digestion are generally indicated between 20 and 30 23 though some studies reported successful applications at c n ratios far outside the optimal range 41 results from the present study highlight process feasibility even at that very low c n ratios 10 as in the case of sole tannery fleshing in test a although process showed quite sensible to operational conditions such as high organic load and ph although co digestion is widely encouraged in order to re balance c n ratios also the co substrate used in this study tps exhibited a low cod n ratio around 9 nevertheless co digestion test e indicates a no detrimental effect of wastes blending albeit it is likely related to dilution the actual feasibility of tps and tf co digestion was already studied in previous works reported in 16 particularly 150 liter pilot reactors were operated for more than six months testing different mixtures of the two wastes although the tannery primary sludge was kept as the main substrate in terms of vs mass contribution on the contrary and according with the purpose of the present study the fleshing was selected as the main substrate in the co digestion test e other studies 8 12 also confirmed the technological feasibility of co digestiong tf and tannery sludge zupančič et al 3 reports a methane production of 0 552 nl ch4 gvs add higher though comparable than the maximum obtained in test a 0 44 0 02 nl ch4 gvs add this is likely due to the significantly lower input organic load as well as the higher operating temperature to the best of our knowledge there are no studies reporting of batch ad of sole tf at high initial substrate concentration 3 3 organic load and ammonia influence on process performance fig 2 presents data on methane percentage together with ammonia and vfa concentrations throughout the experiment the final ammonia concentrations in tests with sole tf as substrate were 0 76 0 03 1 50 0 08 and 2 42 0 10 gn nh4 l for test a b and c respectively the increasing concentrations observed reflected the increasing proteinaceous input almost proportionally in test d ammonia was 0 22 0 06 gn nh4 l and the co digestion test e showed an additive effect of the two substrates degradation observed value 1 48 0 20 gn nh4 l as can be observed by matching results from tests b and d almost all the tests presented vfa accumulation within the first week of the experiment fig 2b though in test a and d the maximum vfa concentration kept at a minimal concentration below 0 5g l the adverse effect of high ammonia and organic load levels turned visible in tests b and dramatically in test c as mentioned above test b experienced 20 decrease in specific methane yield compared to test a but the overall behaviour throughout the test showed almost stable conditions fig 1 such a behaviour reasonably depicts an inhibited steady state i e the process performed at a lower production rate while enduring stress conditions of 1 50 0 08 gn nh4 l a temporary vfa accumulation of 1 11 0 09g l was observed in the first week conversely test c proved strikingly unstable with a final 80 reduction in specific methane yield the final ammonia concentration reached 2 42 0 10 gn nh4 l process instability is observed on the profile of methane production curve linear production phases followed by almost zero production plateau fig 1 and the behaviour of vfa accumulation throughout the test as presented in figs 2 and 3 at day 7th the highest vfa concentration of 7 07 0 95g l was detected and reflected by a low methane percentage of less than 40 whereas the other tests reached quickly stable level of 60 70 fig 2a at day 15th vfa fell below 1g l whereas increased again up to 7 1 0 33g l at day 30th looking at ammonia fig 2c in all the tests except test c ammonia rose and stabilized from day 7th on suggesting that protein hydrolysis and amino acid breakdown took place within this first time lapse conversely in test c ammonia concentration increased from day 7th to day 15th and then kept stable in day 30th this pattern might indicate that even protein hydrolysis might have been affected and slowed down by severe inhibitory conditions this hypothesis is in line with the study reported in 29 where authors investigated the role of ammonia inhibition at increasing concentrations of peptone as mono substrate and increasing addition of external ammonia source their findings report that under mesophilic conditions the rate of protein deamination i e the release of amine groups due to amino acid molecule breakdown turned slower as ammonia concentration increased tan ranging from less than 1g l up to 6g l however fernandes et al 42 evaluated ammonia inhibition on hydrolysis of carbohydrates as crystalline cellulose and lipids as tributyrin at different induced ammonia concentration and fixed ph of 8 their outcomes showed weak correlation between hydrolysis rates and ammonia concentrations questioning the actual influence of ammonia on hydrolysis the authors highlight that research on hydrolysis inhibition from ammonia are still limited in contrast with the well established knowledge on ammonia inhibition on methanogenesis and despite the fact that hydrolysis is commonly considered the rate limiting step when dealing with solid rich substrates among the different microbial groups involved in ad methanogens are generally considered the most sensitive to ammonia inhibition although conflicting positions are reported in literature several studies have reported hydrogenotrophic methanogens to be more tolerant to high ammonia exposure than acetotrophic ones promoting a shift of methane production pathway towards syntrophic acetate oxidation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis sao hm 13 27 39 43 more in the detail fig 3 reports the observed concentrations of acetic propionic and butyric acids at days 7th 15th and 28th tests b and e exhibited a temporary accumulation of vfa in the first week depleted until not detectable levels in the subsequent analyses moreover no significant reduction of ch4 percentage in the biogas was observed fig 2a suggesting that no strong inhibition occurred for the methanogenic population an unstable behaviour was detected for acetate propionate and butyrate concentrations in test c based on acetate concentration observed in test c it can be suggested that a first acetotrophics inhibition may have occurred by the high acetate concentration of 4 56 0 28g l at day 7th whose corresponding ch4 percentage is around 40 in fact much lower than the other tests a temporal acetoclastic biomass acclimation and or the sao hm might have occurred in the second week prior to further system failure in the last days fig 2b also propionate accumulation was noticeable and reached 1 90 0 26g l suggesting propionate degraders inhibition fig 3 some authors indicate the ratio of propionate and acetate concentration as process stability indicator specifically values higher than 1 4 are reported to be representative of strong instability 44 based on the results observed in test c the ratio was below this critical value though process proved instable gallert et al 29 observed propionate accumulation at ammonia concentration higher than 1g l whereas chen et al 27 at ammonia concentration higher than 2g l but performed under acid ph similarly moestedt et al 31 detected propionate accumulation at tan concentration higher than 1g l reporting that this might be due either to inhibition of propionate oxidizers or to a shift of acidogenesis towards more propionate production as the increase in hydrogen pressure in the system may direct this degradation phase towards the production of acids longer than acetic acid 45 in the present study it seems that propionate accumulation is likely due to propionate degraders inhibition more than other factors according to the results only the lowest organic load of 5 gvs l proved suitable for the experimental conditions tested as already discussed organic load and ammonia accumulation are strictly connected when processing protein rich substrates so that it is not easy to ascribe system failure to one rather than to the other factor especially in this latter case of test c where both organic load and ammonia nitrogen are critically high based on eq 1 a first assessment of fan concentration can be done in order to evaluate its potential inhibitory effect during the experimental time course ph raised at levels around 8 8 5 in all the test treating tf this is likely due to the alkaline ph of limed fleshing as well as to ammonia release despite the significant vfa accumulation exhibited in test c acidification never occurred confirming in fact the strong buffer capacity of the system in this study ph correction was not deemed an option as the aim was to push stressing conditions up to system failure the maximum ammonium concentration of 2 42 0 10 gn nh4 l experienced at the maximum organic load of 20gvs l test c is far below some of the toxic levels reported in literature although toxicity ranges vary widely as already discussed the evident detrimental effect observed is very likely to be caused by fa depending on ph fa might account for less than 1 of total tan at ph 7 to almost 10 at ph 8 and up to 48 at ph 9 according to the calculated values fa ranges from 0 16 p 8 to 0 42g l ph 8 5 in test b and from 0 25g l ph 8 to 0 67g l ph 8 5 in test c these values fall within the concentration range discussed in the review conducted by rajagopal et al 26 the reported fa inhibitory concentrations are 316mg l at ph 8 37 c for ad of swine manure 46 750mg l at ph 8 and 37 c during digestion of swine manure 47 1450mg l at ph 7 6 and 51 c for co digestion of swine manure and other solid organic fractions 48 it has to be noted that results from batch conditions can be far from being representative of methane production under continuous operation on the one hand the long time course of the experiment and optimum initial conditions in terms of nutrient supply is conductive to complete organic matter degradation including slow degradable compounds that might not be degraded in continuous systems unless very long sludge retention time are provided on the other hand batch systems are more sensitive to overload conditions and accumulation of different toxic compounds into a reduced working volume thereby it may be that both overloading and ammonia inhibition adversely contributed to the low performance of test c whereas test b is likely to have been affected mainly by ammonia inhibition as organic load of 10 gvs l have shown to be feasible for ad of tannery wastes at comparable experimental set up table 2 in the perspective of a technological application for onsite treatment of tf in medium or large size de centralised tanneries organic load confirmed to be crucial for successful process stability in the simplest scenario of no ammonia mitigation measures even a low performance stable state as the one indicated in test b can be an attractive solution as it would achieve solids reduction and waste stabilization facilitating final disposal management conversely in case the ad of tf is adopted within an integrated tannery and wastewater treatment train the maximization of biogas production and methane content becomes of prominent interest from an economic point of view in this case high organic loading rates would probably request operational strategies to minimize the toxic effect of high ammonia concentrations and co digestion with the tannery sludge could be a cost effective solution besides co digestion and ph and control biomass acclimation to high ammonia levels is a useful and economic solution even though acclimation periods might last some months 26 gao et al 13 claimed that only few studies have attempted to use bacterial acclimation to attenuate ammonia inhibition in n rich waste ad and their work successfully adopted in situ biomass adaptation under step wise ammonia exposure up to tan concentration higher than 4g l during ad of protein rich kitchen wastes together with ammonia control solutions such as biogas recirculation 49 or struvite precipitation 50 waste pre treatment such as preliminary tf hydrolysation could also be valuable in order to prompt organic matter degradation as well as ease operational reactor management 4 conclusions results of the present work indicate that anaerobic digestion of tf is technically feasible at low organic load of 5 gvs l at higher organic loads of 10 and 20 gvs l the system started to suffer from ammonia inhibition due to tan level of 1 50 0 08 gn nh4 l and 2 42 0 10 gn nh4 l that brought to inhibited steady state and system failure respectively the detrimental effect of ammonia exposure was exacerbated by relatively high ph values that never fell below 8 due to the alkaline ph of limed tf and the increase in buffering capacity brought by ammonia release overloading condition is likely to be occurred at the highest organic load testes contributing to the low performance observed in the perspective of full scale implementation organic loading rate is crucial for successful process stability a steady state process even at a moderate methane production rate such as the one indicated in the test with 10 gvs l could be still attractive as tf treatment solution since it would achieve on site waste stabilization and stable process conditions in order to optimize methane production high organic loading rates would probably require ammonia control strategy and tf pre treatments co digestion with tps proved a suitable solution since no adverse effect was observed and the final methane production accounted for an almost additive effect of the two substrates degradation and might represent a cost effective solution towards an integrated tannery waste and wastewater treatment train acknowledgements the

8839,in this study the air oxidized bamboo charcoal bc was investigated for cesium cs adsorption from aqueous solution the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent were evaluated systematically using the different techniques including bet fesem ftir xps and also the phpzc value batch adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the effect of contact time solution ph initial cs concentrations temperature and also the presence of competitive ions on adsorption the adsorption kinetic parameters confirmed the better fitting of pseudo second order kinetic model the isotherm data could be well described by the langmuir isotherm model and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was 55 25 mg g 1 the high specific surface area and the porous structure with some acidic functional groups on the surface were obviously responsible for high cs adsorption onto oxidized bc thermodynamic parameters such as standard enthalpy entropy and gibbs free energy were evaluated and it had been found that the adsorption process was favorable spontaneous and endothermic in nature in the competitive ions study the presence of na and k with their concentrations up to 12 mm did not strongly affect the removal of cs by oxidized bc therefore the experimental results suggested that the oxidized bc could be used as an effective adsorbent for significant cs removal from aqueous solution considering the high adsorption capacity short adsorption time and selective removal of cs ions keywords bamboo charcoal air oxidation cesium adsorption kinetic isotherm 1 introduction in 2011 the massive nuclear power plant accident at fukushima daiichi in japan was the second worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power generation and infamous for its devastating effect on the biological environment in the surrounding area a large amount of radioactive materials were released into the atmosphere as a result of which the surface water and soil particles were severely contaminated among the several nuclides especially cesium 137cs released due to that nuclear accident is considered one of the precarious elements of the environment moreover the extended half life 30 4 years high solubility in aquatic media and transportability through the food chain has made it much hazardous for the human health cs can be easily assimilated into terrestrial and aquatic creatures because of its chemical properties identical to that of potassium k 1 3 as a result it can easily enter into the human body and causes thyroid cancer through potentially irradiating in living tissues 4 therefore proper treatment and management are critically important before discharging the radioactive cs to the environment the separation and removal of 137cs from the radioactive wastewater are commonly involved with the several approaches such as evaporation solvent extraction co precipitation membrane filtration ion exchange and adsorption 5 7 however the use of the large quantity of chemicals and the associated cost inefficient removal process high energy consumption problems related to the separated cs disposal and management are considered as the fundamental drawbacks of these processes 8 particularly the industrial scale application of the solvent extraction process is restricted due to the costly arrangements 9 moreover in the case of ion exchange process the performance of inorganic ion exchangers are generally superior compared to the organic ion exchangers because of their thermal stability and the specific ion selectivity 10 11 several ion exchangers have been developed for radioactive cesium treatment in the past few years these included zeolites metal hexacyanoferrate polyphenol enrich ion exchange resins and different hybrid adsorbents 12 13 thus from the economical point of view the development of the cost effective cs removal process still deserves strong attention adsorption is one of the attractive methods for the removal of cs in terms of the excellent removal performance in a safe manner operation simplicity suitability for low contaminated wastewater availability of different low cost adsorbents and scope of batch and continuous application processes 14 along with the inorganic organic and hybrid ion exchangers naturally available clay minerals zeolites bentonite and montmorillonite and adsorbents developed from waste materials blast furnace slag and coal fly ash have been used as low cost materials for cs removal however the cs adsorption is seriously obstructed due to the competitive interaction with other monovalent cations especially sodium and potassium 15 16 very few studies have been conducted for the removal of cs using activated carbon in the previous years and the obtained results are not up to the satisfactory level for example caccin et al studied the cs adsorption capacity of coconut shell activated carbon and found very poor adsorption capacity of this adsorbent less than 1 mg g 1 17 almond shell was used as activated carbon for cs sorption by alarifi et al and the removal capacity was 12 63 mg g 1 18 the commercially available activated carbon was employed for the practical radioactive cesium removal operation as reported by vanderheyden et al and they removed only 28 of cs adsorption capacity was 8 5 µg g 1 from radioactive wastewater 19 therefore in the recent years a considerable attention has been employed to develop the low cost activated carbon based adsorbents for the efficient and cost effective removal of cs from wastewater bamboo is a renewable bioresource and abundantly found in different geographic areas of the world bamboo charcoal bc is one of the promising adsorbents enriched with microporous structure and higher surface area the surface area of bamboo charcoal is generally 3 10 times higher than compared to the wood charcoal the surface porous structure and heterogeneity of charcoal materials can be improved by modification process which has significant effects on adsorption performance the physical and chemical modification of bamboo charcoal can enhance its affinity to adsorbate ions which is evidenced by the earlier studies 20 however the application of bamboo charcoal for cesium removal is not still widely explored in the recent years very few studies have been conducted for adsorption of heavy metals using bamboo charcoal 21 22 in this work we investigated the cs removal performance of air oxidized bc under the different experimental conditions such as contact time initial cs solution ph initial cs concentration the presence of competitive ions and temperature in details moreover adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherm and thermodynamic studies were also conducted to understand the adsorption behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials non radioactive cesium chloride cscl fw 168 36 g was purchased from wako pure chemical industries ltd japan for using in this study as substitute of 137cs due to the similar chemical characteristics other chemicals such as sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were obtained from the same supplier all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade purity ultrapure water elix millipore japan was used throughout the experiments all working solutions were freshly prepared before using 2 2 preparation of adsorbent mosso bamboo phyllostachys pubescens was collected from the forest near the ito campus of kyushu university in west japan bamboo was cut into small pieces and dried properly before carbonization process bamboo chips were washed with boiled water in order to remove impurities and dried at 110 c for overnight carbonization was performed at 500 c for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 c min in a muffle furnace yamato fp32 japan under nitrogen n2 atmosphere 0 15 m3 min 1 carbonized bamboo chips were crushed by a ball mills machine mixer mill mm 400 retsch japan to make powder the uniform size 75 µm of the bc particles was confirmed by sieving 2 3 air oxidation for air oxidation the bc was placed into a muffle furnace and heated at 300 c for 2 h under compressed air after cooling down at room temperature into the muffle furnace the bc was collected and preserved for experimental uses the obtained bc was identified as oxidized bc in this study 2 4 characterization of oxidized bc the porous properties of the adsorbent were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 196 c 77 k by using belsorp mini ii japan according to the bet brunauer emmett and teller method 23 prior to the experiment the sample was degassed at 120 c for 6 h to remove scums and water vapor from the surface the morphological images of the adsorbent were observed by using an ultra high resolution field emission scanning electronic microscope uhr fe sem model su 8000 hitachi japan the qualitative analysis for surface functional groups were investigated by using a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer model ft ir 620 jasco japan in potassium bromide kbr pellet method for ftir analysis the sample was prepared by grinding with kbr powder mass ratio of sample to kbr 1 100 the absorbance of ir spectra was recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 the xps analysis was conducted to explore the surface complexes of the sample using an axis ultradld instrument shimadzu japan equipped with monochromatized al kα radiation source hν 1486 6 ev the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent was measured according to the procedure depicted by yang et al 24 2 5 cs adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments were carried out to understand the effect of contact time solution ph initial cs ions concentration in solution presence of competitive ions and temperature at first 1000 mg l 1 of cscl stock solution was prepared prior to the experiments and required concentration of cs solution was made by appropriate dilution experiments were carried out on a reciprocating shaker eyela multi shaker mms 3010 japan at 25 c with a rotating speed of 140 rpm the ph of the adsorbate solution was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh and hcl after the sorption experiments the solution was filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filter by a syringe the concentration of cs infiltrated solution was analyzed by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas aa 7000 shimadzu japan the effect of contact time 0 360 min was investigated by adding 1 5 g of adsorbent into an erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of cs solution 100 mg l 1 without considering the ph the appropriate contact time for equilibrium adsorption was determined and all the subsequent experiments were conducted for the equilibrium contact time for evaluating the effect of ph on adsorption 0 3 g of adsorbent was immersed in 30 ml of cs solution at concentration of 100 mg l 1 for different initial ph ranging from 2 0 to 12 0 the optimum adsorption ph was determined by this experiment and the following experiments were conducted under the optimum adsorption ph the effect of initial cs ions concentration on the adsorption was evaluated in a range of cs solution concentration from 20 to 800 mg l 1 for this 0 3 g of adsorbent immersed into 30 ml cs solution the contact time and ph for this experiment were maintained as obtained from the previous experiments effect of temperature on adsorption was experimented at 288 298 and 308 k with 20 mg l 1 concentrated cs solution for this experiment 0 2 g of oxidized bc added into 20 ml of cs solution the previous experimental conditions were the same for this study the data obtained from this experiment were used for the thermodynamic study in order to understand the effect of competitive ions on cs adsorption na and k was considered in their chloride form nacl kcl in this case na and k concentration were varied from 0 75 mm to 12 0 mm and the cs concentration was fixed 0 15 mm here 0 2 g of oxidized bc was added into 20 ml of cs and na either k mixed solution cs na k 1 1 adsorption operation was conducted under the previous adsorption conditions 2 6 experimental calculation the cs sorption capacity q t at time t was calculated using the following formula 1 q t mg g c 0 c t v m the comparison of adsorption performance was shown by the cs removal efficiency re as below 2 re c 0 c t c 0 100 the distribution coefficient k d was calculated from the following equation 3 k d ml g c 0 c t c t v m here c 0 mg l 1 is the initial concentration of cs and c t mg l 1 is the concentration of the cs in solution at contact time t v ml is the volume of cs solution and m g is the weight of the adsorbent used in experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of oxidized bc adsorption is one kind of surface phenomena which strongly influenced by the physicochemical properties of adsorbents including surface area surface porosity and the surface functional groups 25 according to the bet method the specific surface area and the total pore volume of the oxidized bc were 347 72 m2 g 1 and 0 1817 cm3 g 1 respectively this surface area is also comparable with some recently developed mesoporous conjugate based synthetic adsorbents effectively used for different heavy metals removal from wastewater 26 28 the higher surface area indicated that the oxidized bc was highly porous material moreover the surface properties of the oxidized bc could be understood from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm fig 1 the shape of the isotherms usually provides the qualitative information about the porous materials according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac classification system for porous materials 29 the isotherm shape of oxidized bc can be considered as type 1 which indicates that it is a microporous material the n2 adsorption increased at relatively low pressure and after filling the micropores the curve of the isotherm did not further increase and followed a steady path therefore it could be estimated that the highly porous surface structure of oxidized bc might have favored the physisorption in aqueous solution the morphological structure and the surface characteristics of the adsorbent were observed by fesem fig 2 the well developed pores were clearly seen on the surface that basically focused on the porous surface of oxidized bc this observation clearly coincided the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm results the ir spectra analysis is essential to identify the surface chemical functional groups of activated carbon the functional groups that were identified by the ftir analysis are shown in fig 3 the several spectra in the wide region of 3300 3800 cm 1 3358 43 3627 45 3733 51 and 3821 15 cm 1 were observed for the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl oh groups deposited into interstitial space of oxidized bc 1 moreover the prominent peak was identified at 1213 01 cm 1 due to the same functional groups the specific peak located at 1697 05 cm 1 regions was attributed to the presence of carbonyl c o groups similar observations were reported in several studies for bc 30 31 the sharp peak for the carboxyl groups cooh was determined at the position of 1558 20 cm 1 the peak at 817 67 cm 1 can be associated with the vibration of alkane group c h the cs adsorption performance of oxidized bc could be significantly improved due to the presence of these functional groups characterized by ionic properties the oxygen containing functional groups and their relative abundance in oxidized bc were confirmed by the xps analysis the four different types of functional groups and their relative percentages such as alkane 10 12 hydroxyl groups 12 37 carbonyl groups 4 14 and carboxyl groups 1 27 were identified from the deconvolution spectra obtained from the xps analysis fig 4 moreover the surface elemental compositions such as c 90 53 o 9 02 and n 0 45 were known from this analysis the presence of these acidic functional groups on the oxidized bc might be the results of the air oxidation treatment as reported by several studies 32 33 moreover according to our earlier studies on the physicochemical properties analysis of bc it could be seen that the surface area and oxygen containing functional groups c o significantly improved on oxidized bc compared to the raw bc 34 the ion exchange property of the adsorbents usually depends on its net surface charge therefore the point of the zero charge of the oxidized bc was determined the phpzc of adsorbents specifies the chemical potential of the functional groups of solid surface the phpzc of the oxidized bc was found to be 9 80 fig 5 this result actually suggested that the surface of the adsorbent characterized by the positive charge for the ph under the phpzc value 3 2 cs removal experiments 3 2 1 effect of contact time the equilibrium contact time of adsorbents usually influenced by their physical structure and chemical properties equilibrium contact time of the oxidized bc was determined in order to understand the optimum cs sorption within short possible time fig 6 shows the effect of contact time on adsorption of cs ions onto oxidized bc the result showed that the cs adsorption gradually increased with the increase of contact time and reached to its yield after 180 min the slow adsorption process could be associated with intraparticle diffusion of cs onto oxidized bc as the surface of this adsorbent was enriched with interior pores thus the equilibrium contact time was considered to be 180 min and followed by the subsequent experiments 3 2 2 effect of solution ph a plot of cs adsorption as a function of different initial ph of cs solution ranging from 2 0 to 12 0 is shown in fig 7 it was seen that the higher cs adsorption was achieved in alkali conditions compared to the neutral or acidic conditions the cs adsorption remarkably increased for the increasing of solution ph and finally reached to 4 42 mg g 1 at ph 12 0 hence the optimum solution ph was selected at 12 0 for the following experiments it is assumed that in acidic condition h ions occupy the active sites of the adsorbent for this reason cs ions have to face a repulsive force with the higher concentrated h ions during the adsorption process however when the surface of the adsorbents was deprotonated in alkali conditions then the electrostatic interaction between adsorbents surface and cs ions increased therefore the cs adsorption enhanced at higher ph 1 35 moreover the effect of ph could be explained by the phpzc of the adsorbent the phpzc of the oxidized bc was 9 80 generally the surface charge of the adsorbents is positive when the solution ph phpzc and the surface charge is negative when the solution ph phpzc therefore the negatively charged surface of oxidized bc in alkali condition leads to enhancing the cs adsorption thus it can be concluded that the higher ph alters the surface chemistry of the adsorbent especially cooh groups that present in the oxidized bc which rehabilitated into coo 21 3 2 3 effect of initial cs concentrations the cs adsorption performance onto the oxidized bc for changing the initial cs concentration from 20 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 at 25 c is shown in fig 8 the results exhibit that the cs adsorption increased with the increase of cs initial concentration the removal efficiency reached to 98 for the cs concentration of 20 mg l 1 however for the higher concentration of cs the removal efficiency steadily decreased with the increase of adsorbed cs amount this observation actually indicates that the collision between the cs ions and adsorbent surface which increased at higher cs concentration in solution moreover it could be estimated that initially the active sites of the adsorbent was vacant and gradually occupied by cs ions when the concentration of cs had been increased 36 3 2 4 effect of competitive ions the selective removal of cs from the natural wastewater is one of the challenges in adsorption methods due to the presence of several cations such as na and k therefore cs adsorption was investigated in the presence of na and k at their different concentrations with a fixed concentration of cs ions the results are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the experimental results that the cs removal efficiency was not significantly affected by the presence of na and k for their studied concentrations more than 90 of cs can be removed from 0 75 mm cs solution when the competitive ions na and k concentrations up to 12 mm in the optimum adsorption conditions the cs removal performance by oxidized bc in the presence of competitive ions is much higher than the other hybrid and mesoporous adsorbents 13 30 3 3 kinetic studies in order to investigate the cs adsorption mechanism the data obtained from the effect of contact time on adsorption experiment were evaluated using the two well established kinetic models the simplified forms of the two kinetic models are given below pseudo first order model 37 4 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 pseudo second order model 38 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where q e and q t are the cs adsorption capacity mg g 1 of oxidized bc at equilibrium and at contact time t respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 mg g 1 min 1 are the rate constant for the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic model respectively the value of k 1 can be calculated from the plot of log q e q t versus t data is not shown the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e and the values of k 2 can be determined from the slope of the plot t q t versus t fig 10 among the two applied kinetic models pseudo first order model is not appropriate for the adsorption of cs by oxidized bc data are not shown according to this model the theoretical value of equilibrium adsorption q e exhibits a significant difference with the experimental values however the pseudo second order model shows the higher correlation coefficient value r 2 0 998 for cs adsorption besides the adsorption capacity obtained from this model is close to the experimental values table 1 therefore these results suggesting that the cs adsorption by oxidized bc could be well explained by the pseudo second order sorption mechanism 3 4 adsorption isotherm studies the adsorption isotherm basically explains the diffusion status of the adsorbate molecules in liquid and solid phase during the equilibrium state of the adsorption process it also establishes a correlation between the adsorption capacity of adsorbent and liquid phase concentration of adsorbate ions 39 therefore two well known adsorption isotherm models were studied to fit the experimental data obtained from the effect of cs ions concentration 20 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 on adsorption fig 8 the linear form of these isotherm models are as follow langmuir isotherm 40 6 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 q m k l linear form freundlich isotherm 41 7 log q e log k f 1 n log c e linear form where c e and q e are the equilibrium concentration of cs mg l 1 in solution and solid phase respectively q m is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity mg g 1 and k l is the langmuir constant which indicates the adsorption energy l mg 1 k f l mg 1 and n are the freundlich constants that indicate the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively in langmuir isotherm equation the value of q m and k l can be determined from the linear plot of c e q e versus c e fig 11a the value of 1 n and k f l mg 1 in freundlich isotherm model can be calculated from the intercept and the slope of the straight line with log q e versus log c e fig 11b all these parameters are summarized in table 2 from table 2 the langmuir isotherm model presents a better fit in terms of higher r 2 value as compared to the freundlich isotherm model the justification of langmuir isotherm model by the adsorption experiments data represents the homogenous nature of the oxidized bc surface and adsorption sites contain the uniform adsorption energy this observation also suggests that the monolayer sorption takes place on the adsorbent surface and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was 55 25 mg g 1 according to the langmuir isotherm model the important feature of the langmuir isotherm can be expressed by the dimensionless equilibrium parameter named as separation factor r l which can be defined as below 42 8 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where k l is the langmuir constant and c 0 is the highest initial concentration of cs mg l 1 the values of r l indicates the types of the isotherm are favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 0 in the langmuir isotherm study the value of r l was found to be 0 056 which confirmed that the adsorption process was favorable under the conditions used in this study although the cs adsorption process follows the langmuir isotherm model the sorption process is able to describe the freundlich model the higher value of correlation coefficient 0 90 and the appropriate value of freundlich constant 1 n 0 535 between 0 1 justifying the suitability of the adsorption process for the freundlich isotherm model this result actually indicates the surface heterogeneity of oxidized bc and the adsorption process operated under multilayer adsorption 43 this assumption could be explained by the ftir and xps analysis results for oxidized bc which agreed that the adsorbent was attributed with carbonyl groups c o and carboxyl groups cooh in this case the adsorption could be occurred according to the ion exchange mechanism between cs ions and negatively charged c o and cooh groups on the adsorbent surface 3 5 effect of temperature and thermodynamic studies the cs removal performance for the changing of temperature is plotted in fig 12a it can be observed that the removal efficiency was not significantly influenced due to the change of temperature the marginal drop in cs removal performance with increasing temperature may be resulted in the thermal destabilization which increased the mobility of cs ions and inaugurated the desorption steps 44 the thermodynamic parameters such as standard enthalpy change h and entropy change s were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear line obtained from the plotting of lnkd versus 1 t 5 and shown in fig 12b 6 ln kd h rt s r where kd ml g 1 is the distribution coefficient in cs sorption process r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 and t is absolute temperature k the value of h and s were used to calculate the value of the gibbs free energy g 7 g h t s the obtained values of thermodynamic parameters are presented in table 3 the negative value of δg revealed that the adsorption process was favorable and spontaneous the gradually increase of δg value with increase of temperature indicated that the cs adsorption process was less effective at higher temperature the positive value of h was indicative of endothermic nature of the adsorption process moreover the positive value of s suggested that the adsorbent had good affinity towards cs ions that promoted the randomness at the solid solution interference during adsorption process 3 6 comparison of adsorption capacity the cs adsorption capacity of oxidized bc found in this study is compared with the different activated carbon based adsorbents in table 4 it can be seen that the cs adsorption capacity by this adsorbent is comparable with other studied adsorbents 4 conclusions in this study air oxidized bc was studied for the removal of cs from aqueous solution batch adsorption experiments were carried out under different experimental conditions such as contact time solution ph initial cesium concentrations temperature as well as the presence of competitive ions the experimental results revealed that the alkali condition was suitable for cs adsorption compared to neutral or acidic conditions the adsorption kinetic data showed the better fitting for pseudo second order model rather than the first order model the adsorption isotherm data were followed by the langmuir isotherm model and according to this model the maximum calculated adsorption capacity of the oxidized bc was 55 25 mg g 1 the monolayer adsorption capacity of cs was comparable with the capacity of other activated carbon based adsorbents as reported in previous studies interestingly the changing of temperature did not significantly influence the adsorption performance and the adsorption process was favorable and spontaneous the presence of na and k at their lower concentrations up to 12 mm did not considerably affect the removal efficiency of cs by oxidized bc the removal efficiency about 96 for 20 mg l 1 cs solution in the presence of these competitive ions the outstanding porous structure and well developed pores of oxidized bc as well as oxygen containing functional groups cooh c o enriched surface were the main factors for significant cesium adsorption therefore the high adsorption capacity and high selectivity to cs ions indicated that the oxidized bc could be used as an effective adsorbent for significant cs removal from aqueous solution acknowledgement this work was partly supported by nanotechnology platform

commonly involved with the several approaches such as evaporation solvent extraction co precipitation membrane filtration ion exchange and adsorption 5 7 however the use of the large quantity of chemicals and the associated cost inefficient removal process high energy consumption problems related to the separated cs disposal and management are considered as the fundamental drawbacks of these processes 8 particularly the industrial scale application of the solvent extraction process is restricted due to the costly arrangements 9 moreover in the case of ion exchange process the performance of inorganic ion exchangers are generally superior compared to the organic ion exchangers because of their thermal stability and the specific ion selectivity 10 11 several ion exchangers have been developed for radioactive cesium treatment in the past few years these included zeolites metal hexacyanoferrate polyphenol enrich ion exchange resins and different hybrid adsorbents 12 13 thus from the economical point of view the development of the cost effective cs removal process still deserves strong attention adsorption is one of the attractive methods for the removal of cs in terms of the excellent removal performance in a safe manner operation simplicity suitability for low contaminated wastewater availability of different low cost adsorbents and scope of batch and continuous application processes 14 along with the inorganic organic and hybrid ion exchangers naturally available clay minerals zeolites bentonite and montmorillonite and adsorbents developed from waste materials blast furnace slag and coal fly ash have been used as low cost materials for cs removal however the cs adsorption is seriously obstructed due to the competitive interaction with other monovalent cations especially sodium and potassium 15 16 very few studies have been conducted for the removal of cs using activated carbon in the previous years and the obtained results are not up to the satisfactory level for example caccin et al studied the cs adsorption capacity of coconut shell activated carbon and found very poor adsorption capacity of this adsorbent less than 1 mg g 1 17 almond shell was used as activated carbon for cs sorption by alarifi et al and the removal capacity was 12 63 mg g 1 18 the commercially available activated carbon was employed for the practical radioactive cesium removal operation as reported by vanderheyden et al and they removed only 28 of cs adsorption capacity was 8 5 µg g 1 from radioactive wastewater 19 therefore in the recent years a considerable attention has been employed to develop the low cost activated carbon based adsorbents for the efficient and cost effective removal of cs from wastewater bamboo is a renewable bioresource and abundantly found in different geographic areas of the world bamboo charcoal bc is one of the promising adsorbents enriched with microporous structure and higher surface area the surface area of bamboo charcoal is generally 3 10 times higher than compared to the wood charcoal the surface porous structure and heterogeneity of charcoal materials can be improved by modification process which has significant effects on adsorption performance the physical and chemical modification of bamboo charcoal can enhance its affinity to adsorbate ions which is evidenced by the earlier studies 20 however the application of bamboo charcoal for cesium removal is not still widely explored in the recent years very few studies have been conducted for adsorption of heavy metals using bamboo charcoal 21 22 in this work we investigated the cs removal performance of air oxidized bc under the different experimental conditions such as contact time initial cs solution ph initial cs concentration the presence of competitive ions and temperature in details moreover adsorption kinetics adsorption isotherm and thermodynamic studies were also conducted to understand the adsorption behavior 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials non radioactive cesium chloride cscl fw 168 36 g was purchased from wako pure chemical industries ltd japan for using in this study as substitute of 137cs due to the similar chemical characteristics other chemicals such as sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl were obtained from the same supplier all chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade purity ultrapure water elix millipore japan was used throughout the experiments all working solutions were freshly prepared before using 2 2 preparation of adsorbent mosso bamboo phyllostachys pubescens was collected from the forest near the ito campus of kyushu university in west japan bamboo was cut into small pieces and dried properly before carbonization process bamboo chips were washed with boiled water in order to remove impurities and dried at 110 c for overnight carbonization was performed at 500 c for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 c min in a muffle furnace yamato fp32 japan under nitrogen n2 atmosphere 0 15 m3 min 1 carbonized bamboo chips were crushed by a ball mills machine mixer mill mm 400 retsch japan to make powder the uniform size 75 µm of the bc particles was confirmed by sieving 2 3 air oxidation for air oxidation the bc was placed into a muffle furnace and heated at 300 c for 2 h under compressed air after cooling down at room temperature into the muffle furnace the bc was collected and preserved for experimental uses the obtained bc was identified as oxidized bc in this study 2 4 characterization of oxidized bc the porous properties of the adsorbent were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at 196 c 77 k by using belsorp mini ii japan according to the bet brunauer emmett and teller method 23 prior to the experiment the sample was degassed at 120 c for 6 h to remove scums and water vapor from the surface the morphological images of the adsorbent were observed by using an ultra high resolution field emission scanning electronic microscope uhr fe sem model su 8000 hitachi japan the qualitative analysis for surface functional groups were investigated by using a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer model ft ir 620 jasco japan in potassium bromide kbr pellet method for ftir analysis the sample was prepared by grinding with kbr powder mass ratio of sample to kbr 1 100 the absorbance of ir spectra was recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 the xps analysis was conducted to explore the surface complexes of the sample using an axis ultradld instrument shimadzu japan equipped with monochromatized al kα radiation source hν 1486 6 ev the ph at the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent was measured according to the procedure depicted by yang et al 24 2 5 cs adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments were carried out to understand the effect of contact time solution ph initial cs ions concentration in solution presence of competitive ions and temperature at first 1000 mg l 1 of cscl stock solution was prepared prior to the experiments and required concentration of cs solution was made by appropriate dilution experiments were carried out on a reciprocating shaker eyela multi shaker mms 3010 japan at 25 c with a rotating speed of 140 rpm the ph of the adsorbate solution was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh and hcl after the sorption experiments the solution was filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filter by a syringe the concentration of cs infiltrated solution was analyzed by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas aa 7000 shimadzu japan the effect of contact time 0 360 min was investigated by adding 1 5 g of adsorbent into an erlenmeyer flask containing 150 ml of cs solution 100 mg l 1 without considering the ph the appropriate contact time for equilibrium adsorption was determined and all the subsequent experiments were conducted for the equilibrium contact time for evaluating the effect of ph on adsorption 0 3 g of adsorbent was immersed in 30 ml of cs solution at concentration of 100 mg l 1 for different initial ph ranging from 2 0 to 12 0 the optimum adsorption ph was determined by this experiment and the following experiments were conducted under the optimum adsorption ph the effect of initial cs ions concentration on the adsorption was evaluated in a range of cs solution concentration from 20 to 800 mg l 1 for this 0 3 g of adsorbent immersed into 30 ml cs solution the contact time and ph for this experiment were maintained as obtained from the previous experiments effect of temperature on adsorption was experimented at 288 298 and 308 k with 20 mg l 1 concentrated cs solution for this experiment 0 2 g of oxidized bc added into 20 ml of cs solution the previous experimental conditions were the same for this study the data obtained from this experiment were used for the thermodynamic study in order to understand the effect of competitive ions on cs adsorption na and k was considered in their chloride form nacl kcl in this case na and k concentration were varied from 0 75 mm to 12 0 mm and the cs concentration was fixed 0 15 mm here 0 2 g of oxidized bc was added into 20 ml of cs and na either k mixed solution cs na k 1 1 adsorption operation was conducted under the previous adsorption conditions 2 6 experimental calculation the cs sorption capacity q t at time t was calculated using the following formula 1 q t mg g c 0 c t v m the comparison of adsorption performance was shown by the cs removal efficiency re as below 2 re c 0 c t c 0 100 the distribution coefficient k d was calculated from the following equation 3 k d ml g c 0 c t c t v m here c 0 mg l 1 is the initial concentration of cs and c t mg l 1 is the concentration of the cs in solution at contact time t v ml is the volume of cs solution and m g is the weight of the adsorbent used in experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of oxidized bc adsorption is one kind of surface phenomena which strongly influenced by the physicochemical properties of adsorbents including surface area surface porosity and the surface functional groups 25 according to the bet method the specific surface area and the total pore volume of the oxidized bc were 347 72 m2 g 1 and 0 1817 cm3 g 1 respectively this surface area is also comparable with some recently developed mesoporous conjugate based synthetic adsorbents effectively used for different heavy metals removal from wastewater 26 28 the higher surface area indicated that the oxidized bc was highly porous material moreover the surface properties of the oxidized bc could be understood from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm fig 1 the shape of the isotherms usually provides the qualitative information about the porous materials according to the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac classification system for porous materials 29 the isotherm shape of oxidized bc can be considered as type 1 which indicates that it is a microporous material the n2 adsorption increased at relatively low pressure and after filling the micropores the curve of the isotherm did not further increase and followed a steady path therefore it could be estimated that the highly porous surface structure of oxidized bc might have favored the physisorption in aqueous solution the morphological structure and the surface characteristics of the adsorbent were observed by fesem fig 2 the well developed pores were clearly seen on the surface that basically focused on the porous surface of oxidized bc this observation clearly coincided the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm results the ir spectra analysis is essential to identify the surface chemical functional groups of activated carbon the functional groups that were identified by the ftir analysis are shown in fig 3 the several spectra in the wide region of 3300 3800 cm 1 3358 43 3627 45 3733 51 and 3821 15 cm 1 were observed for the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl oh groups deposited into interstitial space of oxidized bc 1 moreover the prominent peak was identified at 1213 01 cm 1 due to the same functional groups the specific peak located at 1697 05 cm 1 regions was attributed to the presence of carbonyl c o groups similar observations were reported in several studies for bc 30 31 the sharp peak for the carboxyl groups cooh was determined at the position of 1558 20 cm 1 the peak at 817 67 cm 1 can be associated with the vibration of alkane group c h the cs adsorption performance of oxidized bc could be significantly improved due to the presence of these functional groups characterized by ionic properties the oxygen containing functional groups and their relative abundance in oxidized bc were confirmed by the xps analysis the four different types of functional groups and their relative percentages such as alkane 10 12 hydroxyl groups 12 37 carbonyl groups 4 14 and carboxyl groups 1 27 were identified from the deconvolution spectra obtained from the xps analysis fig 4 moreover the surface elemental compositions such as c 90 53 o 9 02 and n 0 45 were known from this analysis the presence of these acidic functional groups on the oxidized bc might be the results of the air oxidation treatment as reported by several studies 32 33 moreover according to our earlier studies on the physicochemical properties analysis of bc it could be seen that the surface area and oxygen containing functional groups c o significantly improved on oxidized bc compared to the raw bc 34 the ion exchange property of the adsorbents usually depends on its net surface charge therefore the point of the zero charge of the oxidized bc was determined the phpzc of adsorbents specifies the chemical potential of the functional groups of solid surface the phpzc of the oxidized bc was found to be 9 80 fig 5 this result actually suggested that the surface of the adsorbent characterized by the positive charge for the ph under the phpzc value 3 2 cs removal experiments 3 2 1 effect of contact time the equilibrium contact time of adsorbents usually influenced by their physical structure and chemical properties equilibrium contact time of the oxidized bc was determined in order to understand the optimum cs sorption within short possible time fig 6 shows the effect of contact time on adsorption of cs ions onto oxidized bc the result showed that the cs adsorption gradually increased with the increase of contact time and reached to its yield after 180 min the slow adsorption process could be associated with intraparticle diffusion of cs onto oxidized bc as the surface of this adsorbent was enriched with interior pores thus the equilibrium contact time was considered to be 180 min and followed by the subsequent experiments 3 2 2 effect of solution ph a plot of cs adsorption as a function of different initial ph of cs solution ranging from 2 0 to 12 0 is shown in fig 7 it was seen that the higher cs adsorption was achieved in alkali conditions compared to the neutral or acidic conditions the cs adsorption remarkably increased for the increasing of solution ph and finally reached to 4 42 mg g 1 at ph 12 0 hence the optimum solution ph was selected at 12 0 for the following experiments it is assumed that in acidic condition h ions occupy the active sites of the adsorbent for this reason cs ions have to face a repulsive force with the higher concentrated h ions during the adsorption process however when the surface of the adsorbents was deprotonated in alkali conditions then the electrostatic interaction between adsorbents surface and cs ions increased therefore the cs adsorption enhanced at higher ph 1 35 moreover the effect of ph could be explained by the phpzc of the adsorbent the phpzc of the oxidized bc was 9 80 generally the surface charge of the adsorbents is positive when the solution ph phpzc and the surface charge is negative when the solution ph phpzc therefore the negatively charged surface of oxidized bc in alkali condition leads to enhancing the cs adsorption thus it can be concluded that the higher ph alters the surface chemistry of the adsorbent especially cooh groups that present in the oxidized bc which rehabilitated into coo 21 3 2 3 effect of initial cs concentrations the cs adsorption performance onto the oxidized bc for changing the initial cs concentration from 20 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 at 25 c is shown in fig 8 the results exhibit that the cs adsorption increased with the increase of cs initial concentration the removal efficiency reached to 98 for the cs concentration of 20 mg l 1 however for the higher concentration of cs the removal efficiency steadily decreased with the increase of adsorbed cs amount this observation actually indicates that the collision between the cs ions and adsorbent surface which increased at higher cs concentration in solution moreover it could be estimated that initially the active sites of the adsorbent was vacant and gradually occupied by cs ions when the concentration of cs had been increased 36 3 2 4 effect of competitive ions the selective removal of cs from the natural wastewater is one of the challenges in adsorption methods due to the presence of several cations such as na and k therefore cs adsorption was investigated in the presence of na and k at their different concentrations with a fixed concentration of cs ions the results are shown in fig 9 it can be seen from the experimental results that the cs removal efficiency was not significantly affected by the presence of na and k for their studied concentrations more than 90 of cs can be removed from 0 75 mm cs solution when the competitive ions na and k concentrations up to 12 mm in the optimum adsorption conditions the cs removal performance by oxidized bc in the presence of competitive ions is much higher than the other hybrid and mesoporous adsorbents 13 30 3 3 kinetic studies in order to investigate the cs adsorption mechanism the data obtained from the effect of contact time on adsorption experiment were evaluated using the two well established kinetic models the simplified forms of the two kinetic models are given below pseudo first order model 37 4 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 pseudo second order model 38 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where q e and q t are the cs adsorption capacity mg g 1 of oxidized bc at equilibrium and at contact time t respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 mg g 1 min 1 are the rate constant for the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic model respectively the value of k 1 can be calculated from the plot of log q e q t versus t data is not shown the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e and the values of k 2 can be determined from the slope of the plot t q t versus t fig 10 among the two applied kinetic models pseudo first order model is not appropriate for the adsorption of cs by oxidized bc data are not shown according to this model the theoretical value of equilibrium adsorption q e exhibits a significant difference with the experimental values however the pseudo second order model shows the higher correlation coefficient value r 2 0 998 for cs adsorption besides the adsorption capacity obtained from this model is close to the experimental values table 1 therefore these results suggesting that the cs adsorption by oxidized bc could be well explained by the pseudo second order sorption mechanism 3 4 adsorption isotherm studies the adsorption isotherm basically explains the diffusion status of the adsorbate molecules in liquid and solid phase during the equilibrium state of the adsorption process it also establishes a correlation between the adsorption capacity of adsorbent and liquid phase concentration of adsorbate ions 39 therefore two well known adsorption isotherm models were studied to fit the experimental data obtained from the effect of cs ions concentration 20 mg l 1 to 1000 mg l 1 on adsorption fig 8 the linear form of these isotherm models are as follow langmuir isotherm 40 6 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 q m k l linear form freundlich isotherm 41 7 log q e log k f 1 n log c e linear form where c e and q e are the equilibrium concentration of cs mg l 1 in solution and solid phase respectively q m is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity mg g 1 and k l is the langmuir constant which indicates the adsorption energy l mg 1 k f l mg 1 and n are the freundlich constants that indicate the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively in langmuir isotherm equation the value of q m and k l can be determined from the linear plot of c e q e versus c e fig 11a the value of 1 n and k f l mg 1 in freundlich isotherm model can be calculated from the intercept and the slope of the straight line with log q e versus log c e fig 11b all these parameters are summarized in table 2 from table 2 the langmuir isotherm model presents a better fit in terms of higher r 2 value as compared to the freundlich isotherm model the justification of langmuir isotherm model by the adsorption experiments data represents the homogenous nature of the oxidized bc surface and adsorption sites contain the uniform adsorption energy this observation also suggests that the monolayer sorption takes place on the adsorbent surface and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity was 55 25 mg g 1 according to the langmuir isotherm model the important feature of the langmuir isotherm can be expressed by the dimensionless equilibrium parameter named as separation factor r l which can be defined as below 42 8 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where k l is the langmuir constant and c 0 is the highest initial concentration of cs mg l 1 the values of r l indicates the types of the isotherm are favorable 0 r l 1 linear r l 1 or unfavorable r l 0 in the langmuir isotherm study the value of r l was found to be 0 056 which confirmed that the adsorption process was favorable under the conditions used in this study although the cs adsorption process follows the langmuir isotherm model the sorption process is able to describe the freundlich model the higher value of correlation coefficient 0 90 and the appropriate value of freundlich constant 1 n 0 535 between 0 1 justifying the suitability of the adsorption process for the freundlich isotherm model this result actually indicates the surface heterogeneity of oxidized bc and the adsorption process operated under multilayer adsorption 43 this assumption could be explained by the ftir and xps analysis results for oxidized bc which agreed that the adsorbent was attributed with carbonyl groups c o and carboxyl groups cooh in this case the adsorption could be occurred according to the ion exchange mechanism between cs ions and negatively charged c o and cooh groups on the adsorbent surface 3 5 effect of temperature and thermodynamic studies the cs removal performance for the changing of temperature is plotted in fig 12a it can be observed that the removal efficiency was not significantly influenced due to the change of temperature the marginal drop in cs removal performance with increasing temperature may be resulted in the thermal destabilization which increased the mobility of cs ions and inaugurated the desorption steps 44 the thermodynamic parameters such as standard enthalpy change h and entropy change s were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear line obtained from the plotting of lnkd versus 1 t 5 and shown in fig 12b 6 ln kd h rt s r where kd ml g 1 is the distribution coefficient in cs sorption process r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 and t is absolute temperature k the value of h and s were used to calculate the value of the gibbs free energy g 7 g h t s the obtained values of thermodynamic parameters are presented in table 3 the negative value of δg revealed that the adsorption process was favorable and spontaneous the gradually increase of δg value with increase of temperature indicated that the cs adsorption process was less effective at higher temperature the positive value of h was indicative of endothermic nature of the adsorption process moreover the positive value of s suggested that the adsorbent had good affinity towards cs ions that promoted the randomness at the solid solution interference during adsorption process 3 6 comparison of adsorption capacity the cs adsorption capacity of oxidized bc found in this study is compared with the different activated carbon based adsorbents in table 4 it can be seen that the cs adsorption capacity by this adsorbent is comparable with other studied adsorbents 4 conclusions in this study air oxidized bc was studied for the removal of cs from aqueous solution batch adsorption experiments were carried out under different experimental conditions such as contact time solution ph initial cesium concentrations temperature as well as the presence of competitive ions the experimental results revealed that the alkali condition was suitable for cs adsorption compared to neutral or acidic conditions the adsorption kinetic data showed the better fitting for pseudo second order model rather than the first order model the adsorption isotherm data were followed by the langmuir isotherm model and according to this model the maximum calculated adsorption capacity of the oxidized bc was 55 25 mg g 1 the monolayer adsorption capacity of cs was comparable with the capacity of other activated carbon based adsorbents as reported in previous studies interestingly the changing of temperature did not significantly influence the adsorption performance and the adsorption process was favorable and spontaneous the presence of na and k at their lower concentrations up to 12 mm did not considerably affect the removal efficiency of cs by oxidized bc the removal efficiency about 96 for 20 mg l 1 cs solution in the presence of these competitive ions the outstanding porous structure and well developed pores of oxidized bc as well as oxygen containing functional groups cooh c o enriched surface were the main factors for significant cesium adsorption therefore the high adsorption capacity and high selectivity to cs ions indicated that the oxidized bc could be used as an effective adsorbent for significant cs removal from aqueous solution acknowledgement this work was partly supported by nanotechnology platform
