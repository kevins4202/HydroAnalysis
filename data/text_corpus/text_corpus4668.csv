on the cofferdam wave gauges and pressure transducers were installed on a real cofferdam for sea crossing bridge to measure the random wave pressure during typhoon dujuan in 2015 the first order

energy near the primary peak frequency keywords wave pressure construction cofferdam sea crossing bridge field measurement diffraction theory tropical cyclone 1 introduction sea crossing bridges have been built all over the world such as the chesapeake bay bridge meisburger 1972 oresund bridge valeur 2004 hongkong zhuhai macao bridge yu et al 2013 when the construction of bridge foundation takes place below the water surface cofferdam is a common facility to create a dry and safe construction environment cho et al 2008 the modern construction cofferdams for sea crossing bridges are always made of thin walled steel structures to withstand both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure the extreme wave induced by tropical cyclones leads to large pressure on the thin walls which may cause severe damages or even collapse of the cofferdams therefore the assessment of random wave pressure can ensure the structural safety of the construction cofferdams the construction cofferdam for bridge is always regarded as large scale structure many researchers alkhalidi et al 2015a b guo et al 2015 houlsby et al 2005 wei et al 2012 have measured the hydrodynamic loads on the large scale offshore structures in the laboratories however the difference between laboratory and actual environment cannot be eliminated due to the limitation of wave maker and the effect of reduced scale although field measurement is the most direct way to evaluate the wave loads on structures few literature studied wave pressure on the cofferdam by field measurement because of its huge cost as one of the most popular numerical approaches diffraction theory has been widely used to calculate wave loads on the large scale structures maccamy and fuchs 1954 presented an exact mathematical approach for linearized wave based on diffraction theory to evaluate the hydrodynamics loads on the large vertical cylinder in regular waves many works ishida and iwagaki 1978 raman and rao 1983 were then carried out using this approach to study the wave loads on cylindrical structures under regular or random waves since diffraction theory is derived based on the linear waves random wave problems can be efficiently solved in frequency domain with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd many researchers investigated the wave loads on the sea crossing bridges under regular waves by cfd approaches chen et al 2016 seiffert et al 2015 xu and cai 2014 xu et al 2015 but the issue relevant to the random wave pressures on the cofferdam under tropical cyclones was still seldom addressed this paper focuses on the assessment of random wave pressures on the wall of the construction cofferdam used for sea crossing bridges through field measurement the following objectives are set 1 to conduct a field measurement program to investigate the random wave pressure on a cofferdam used in sea crossing bridge construction 2 to set up a three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic numerical model of the tested cofferdam based on the first order diffraction theory to simulate the wave pressure on the cofferdam 3 to compare the measured and numerical wave pressure in the frequency domain in terms of pressure spectrum pressure spectral characteristics transfer function and maximum wave pressure and 4 to evaluate the random wave pressure on the cofferdam 2 setup of field measurement 2 1 description of example cofferdam and measurement conditions pingtan strait bridge is taken as the example structure in this study it is a 16 32 km long rail cum road sea crossing bridge connecting fuzhou city to pingtan island across haitan strait in the china east sea as shown in fig 1 the bridge site has limited wave fetches in most directions but directly open to the northeast offshore therefore the waves propagating from northeast offshore caused by tropical cyclones are destructive and threaten the construction the steel thin walled construction cofferdam that locates at 25 72 n 119 61 e was taken as the example structure fig 2 the dimensions of the cofferdam are 23 14 8 12 3 m the cofferdam is supported by 13 steel concrete composite piles of which the diameter is 2 2 m the piles are fully fixed on the seabed rocks the altitudes of the top and the bottom of the cofferdam are 7 9 m and 4 4 m respectively the altitude of the seabed is 10 m the field measurement of a destructive wave event was conducted at 8 00 a m on september 29 2015 when typhoon dujuan begun to decay during the measurement the storm eye located at 119 40 e 25 00 n 80 km south from the tested cofferdam as shown in fig 3 the atmospheric pressure at storm center was 925 kpa and the maximum wind speed of the storm was 35 m s the measurement went on up to 17 min and captured about 100 waves the wave surface elevation and the wave pressure data on the cofferdam were successfully measured 2 2 wave gauges and pressure transducers layout fig 4 illustrates the layout of the field measurement system that was installed to measure the wave conditions at the site and the wave pressure on the cofferdam the incident wave conditions were measured by a sby 2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge of which the measuring accuracy is 0 2 m for wave heights and 0 25 s for wave periods the sampling frequency of the gauge is set to 2 hz which is adequate for most of the waves the wave gauge was supported by a cantilever beam on an isolated electricity platform that is 80 m far from the cofferdam for the convenience of power supply and little impacts from the construction activities the seabed altitude of the platform is 9 3 m which is approximately the same with that of the cofferdam 10 m the effect of wave shoaling can hence be ignored and the wave spectrum at these two locations are considered to be the same the hydrodynamic pressures induced by random waves were measured by fifteen csw560 flush type pressure transducers of which the measuring range is 0 200 kpa and the measuring error is less than 0 5 fig 5 shows the installation setup of all fifteen pressure transducers in order not to alter the roughness of the outer surface of the cofferdam the transducers were embedded into the cofferdam at two different altitudes 4 m and 0 m to investigate the distribution of wave pressure along the height eleven transducers 1 11 were installed at 0 m to capture the wave pressure around the cofferdam near still water level swl four transducers 12 15 were installed at 4 m according to long term historical wave measurements of a data buoy near the bridge site the main wave direction was close to ene east northeast the third marine research institute of national ocean administration 2013 as denoted in fig 4 considering the possible incident wave direction is east northeastern ene at swl five transducers 7 11 were installed on the down wave side to capture the wave diffraction that surrounded the cofferdam 3 measured data analyses 3 1 wave height period and spectrum the wave conditions such as wave height and wave period were drawn using zero up crossing method and listed in table 1 the wave spectrum s Î· f was obtained from the measured time history of wave surface elevation by fast fourier transform techniques according to the analyses the extreme wave height is up to 5 83 m with a period of 11 02s the measured wave spectrum fig 6 has a highly concentrated energy distribution near the peak frequency of 0 094 hz because the fetches are limited and the water depth is finite at the bridge site local winds are difficult to dominate the wave spectrum the low peak frequency and concentrated energy distribution of the spectrum emphasized a wave condition that mainly consists of long period swells propagating from open ocean off the coast 3 2 still water level swl the swl in the field was measured by sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge and found to be 2 37 m at the measured time therefore the water depth d of the cofferdam equals 12 37 m and the sinking depth z for transducers installed at 0 m and 4 m equals 2 37 m and 6 37 m respectively the sinking depth ratio z d is defined here to represent the ratio of sinking depth over water depth z d equals 0 19 for transducers installed at 0 m and 0 51 for transducers installed at 4 m 3 3 wave pressure spectrum because the measured pressure time history consists of wave pressure and hydrostatic pressure the wave pressure history was derived by excluding the hydrostatic pressure from the measured pressure given time history of wave pressure the measured wave pressure spectrum s p f m can then be obtained by fast fourier transformation 3 4 incident wave direction considering the direction of swell is always consistent with the dominate wave direction goda 2010 an assumption that the incident random waves are unidirectional long crest swells is used in this study the dominant wave direction of the incident waves was identified from the phase lags among wave pressure time histories at different transducers a typical plot of wave pressure time histories measured by transducers 1 11 around the cofferdam at z d 0 19 under a high energy wave was illustrated in fig 7 a it can be seen that the pressure at 4 reached the peak at first and then the pressures at 3 2 5 1 reached the peak in sequence and the pressure at 7 reached the peak at last as shown in fig 7 b the authors estimated the wave direction through a geometry analysis by knowing the time sequence of 2 5 and 1 the incident wave direction should lie in the range of 38 47 according to the pressure series under the other high energy waves shown in fig 7 c the same sequence of peak occurring was also found a sensitivity analysis of wave pressure to wave direction was conducted to investigate the influence of wave direction on the wave pressure using the numerical method which will be introduced in section 4 wave pressures on the cofferdam under regular wave with a significant wave height of 3 78 m and a period of 9 34s coming from five different directions 35 40 45 50 55 were calculated numerically the results of wave pressure were demonstrated in fig 8 it can be seen that the wave pressures do not change obviously with the wave direction in the range of 35 55 therefore the incident wave direction used in the following analyses was set to be 42 5 which is the mean value of the measured main wave direction range 38 47 this direction is approximate ene which aligns with the main wave direction in the long term measurement of a data buoy near the bridge site 4 numerical analyses of random wave pressure this section introduces the numerical model to analyze the random wave pressure on the cofferdam in terms of wave pressure spectrum pressure spectral characteristics pressure transfer function and maximum wave pressure 4 1 numerical model the wave pressures on the cofferdam were calculated by the 3d first order wave diffraction method the scopes of the method are given as follows 1 the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the fluid flow is irrotational 2 the incident regular wave train is of small amplitude compared to its length and 3 the high order diffraction effect is neglected thorough description of the first order diffraction theory formulation can be found in the reference literature aqwa 2012 molin 2002 and only a brief review of the approach is given below the fluid flow field surrounding a structure at coordinate x y z can be defined by a velocity potential of linear regular wave as follows 1 Ï x y z t a Ï x y z e i Ï t where a is the wave amplitude Ï is the wave angular frequency and t is the time the total potential of wave acting on the cofferdam body equals the sum of the incident potential and the diffraction potential 2 a Ï x y z e i Ï t a e i Ï t Ï i x y z Ï d x y z where Ï i x y z and Ï d x y z are the first order incident wave potential and diffraction wave potential with unit wave amplitude respectively then the wave potential can be obtained by solving a set of equations including laplace equation and boundary conditions on free surface cofferdam surface seabed surface and the so called sommerfeld condition given the total potentials the first order wave pressure can be calculated using the linearized bernoulli s equation 3 p Ï Ï x y z t t i Ï Ï a Ï x y z e i Ï t where Ï is water density based on wave diffraction theory one can solve linear algebraic equations to obtain the harmonic pressure response on the cofferdam to regular linear waves these responses are commonly referred to as transfer function or response amplitude operator rao transfer function or rao is a function or vector of generalized response e g motions forces moments or pressures under unit wave amplitude against wave frequency and can be used to determine the dynamic behavior of the offshore structure in frequency domain the pressure transfer function t f f can be written as 4 t f f p f 1 p f 2 p f 3 p f n where p f n is the wave pressure induced by a regular linear wave with unit amplitude and a frequency of f n in this study the numerical model of cofferdam was built in the 3d diffraction analysis software aqwa line the cofferdam is discretized into 5874 quadrilateral panel elements as illustrated in fig 9 since the sealing concrete had already been poured into the cofferdam to construct the cap when the measurement was conducted the whole structure had a very large mass and stiffness therefore the structure was assumed to be rigid and fully fixed onto the seabed rock the input range of the wave frequency was set from 0 05 hz to 0 5 hz with an interval of 0 01 hz which covered most of the measured wave frequency the pressure transfer functions t f f at transducer 1 15 were then calculated numerically 4 2 wave pressure spectrum according to molin 2002 the wave pressure spectrum s p Ï can be linearly expressed as 5 s p f t f f 2 s Î· f where s Î· f is the incident wave spectrum the numerical wave pressure spectrum s p f p was obtained according to eq 5 when transfer functions t f f calculated by aqwa line and measured wave surface spectrum s p f m are given 4 3 pressure spectral characteristics zeroth spectral moment peak spectral value and peak frequency are three key characteristics of the spectrums to generate the random waves molin 2002 raman and rao 1983 yu 2000 the zeroth spectral moment which represents the total area under the spectrum curve is defined by 6 m 0 0 s p f d f where s p f is the pressure spectrum peak spectral value and peak frequency are defined as the value and corresponding frequency of the spectrum peak respectively then the zeroth spectral moments peak spectral values and peak frequencies of the numerical and measured pressure spectrums were calculated 4 4 pressure transfer function according to eq 5 the pressure transfer functions can be computed as follow 7 s p f s Î· f t f f the numerical pressure transfer functions t f f p were automatically computed by aqwa line following eq 7 while the measured pressure transfer functions t f f m should be manually computed according to eq 7 using measured wave spectrum s Î· f section 3 1 and measured wave pressure spectrum s p f m section 3 3 4 5 maximum wave pressure according to cartwright and longuet higgins 1956 molin 2002 yu 2000 and vandever et al 2008 the random wave surface elevation can be assumed as a gaussian distribution and the maximum surface value Î· max can be evaluated using wave surface spectrum as 8 Î· max 2 ln 1 Îµ 2 n 1 2 Î³ 2 ln 1 Îµ 2 n 1 2 m 0 where n equals the number of waves Î³ is euler s constant with a value of 0 5722 n is the number of measured waves and set to be 112 here and Îµ is the width of spectra and equals 9 Îµ 1 m 2 2 m 0 m 4 where m i i 0 2 4 is the i t h moment of wave spectrums which can be calculated from the numerical pressure spectrums s p f p respectively according to molin 2002 and yu 2000 the variations which are linearly related with wave surface elevation Î· obey the same distribution law as Î· because wave pressure is assumed to be linearly related with wave surface the numerical maximum wave pressure p max p can be calculated using the numerical pressure spectrums through the same approach as Î· max the measured maximum wave pressure p max m is the maximum value in measured wave pressure time series excluding hydrostatic pressure 5 results and discussions 5 1 wave pressure spectrum fig 10 shows the measured wave pressure spectrums s p Ï m and the numerical wave pressure spectrums s p Ï p predicted at transducers 1 15 taken the transducers 1 10 installed at z d 0 19 as examples the dominant frequency range of pressure spectrums varies significantly with the change of the transducer location the wave energy at transducers 1 6 concentrates in the frequency range of 0 05 0 25 hz while the energy at transducers 7 10 concentrates in the frequency range of 0 05 0 20 hz according to fig 5 transducer 1 6 are installed on the up wave side and transducers 7 10 are on the down wave side of the cofferdam the upper bound of the frequency range of wave energy on the down wave side is smaller than that on the up wave side when z d increases to 0 51 this phenomenon still appears the highest wave energy at transducers 12 and 13 on up wave side concentrates in the range of 0 05 0 20 hz while that at transducers 14 and 15 on down wave side concentrates in the shorter range of 0 05 0 12 hz the difference is mainly caused by the wave diffraction on the cofferdam ishida and iwagaki 1978 sundar et al 1990 when a high frequency wave that has short wave length encounters the cofferdam it can be easily diffracted at the wall on the up wave side and has few contributions on the high frequency of pressure spectrums on down wave side wall it explains why the high frequency energy of transducers on down wave side are reduced moreover the dominant frequency ranges decrease with the increase of the water ratio z d this can be concluded that the influencing depths of waves reduce with the increase of wave frequency secondary peaks with small magnitudes can be observed in the higher and lower frequency zone of the measured pressure spectrums given in fig 10 the secondary peaks have been found to be induced by the second order effect of the wave which is one of the common nonlinear effects in finite water under extreme waves kim 1991 molin 1979 2002 the submerged objects under irregular waves are subjected to not only large amplitude so called first order wave loads but also small amplitude so called second order wave loads the second order wave loads force pressure moment etc in random waves can be expressed according to molin 2002 as 10 f 2 t f 2 t f 2 t re i j a i a j f 2 Ï i Ï j Î² e i Ï i Ï j t Î¸ i Î¸ j re i j a i a j f 2 Ï i Ï j Î² e i Ï i Ï j t Î¸ i Î¸ j where a is wave amplitude Ï is wave frequency Î¸ is wave phase f 2 and f 2 are sum and difference frequency loads f 2 and f 2 are sum and difference frequency quadratic transfer function it can be seen that second order wave loads consist of two kinds of wave frequency namely sum frequency Ï i Ï j and difference frequency Ï i Ï j a typical wave force spectrum including first and second order effects is plotted in fig 11 kim 1991 molin 2002 roald et al 2013 the spectrum of difference frequency wave loads will have a concentrated energy zone around 0 hz while the spectrum of sum frequency wave loads will have a concentrated energy zone around 2f hz where f is the peak frequency of the first order wave loads spectrum it can be easily observed from fig 10 that the measured wave pressure spectrums have obvious secondary peaks and have a very similar pattern to the example spectrum given in fig 11 however the issues about secondary peak have not been reported in previous experimental studies about the wave pressure on structures ishida and iwagaki 1978 sundar et al 1990 some literature aqwa 2012 molin 1979 2002 mention that the nonlinear wave effect are related to wave amplitude and can be more obvious in severe wave conditions compared with moderate wave conditions the measurement points out once again that the nonlinear wave pressure exists in severe wave conditions induced by tropical cyclones compared the measured with the numerical pressure spectrums numerical simulation agrees well with the measurement in spectral shape and energy distribution however the secondary peaks are not observed in numerical results as introduced in section 4 the diffraction theory applied in this study is the first order and does not include nonlinear effects therefore the secondary peaks cannot be calculated in the numerical results therefore the numerical predictions underestimate the wave energy in the lower frequency range of 0 0 02 hz and in the higher frequency range of 0 15 0 20 hz at most of the transducers however the measured spectral energy at transducers 2 3 and 12 are significantly smaller than the predictions it is mainly caused by the blocking and shading effect of the accessory structures used in the construction including trestle piers and jackets as illustrated in fig 5 a transducers 2 3 and 12 are very close to the trestle piers these piers blocked the incident waves and induced flow wakes thus reduced the measured wave pressure at 2 3 and 12 5 2 pressure spectral characteristics the following wave pressure spectral characteristics such as zeroth moment of spectrum peak spectral value and peak frequency are presented and discussed in this subsection zeroth moments of spectrum for both measured and numerical wave pressure spectrums are plotted in fig 12 a the zeroth moments of spectrum at transducers on the up wave side transducer 1 6 for z d 0 19 and 12 13 for z d 0 51 are larger than those on the down wave side transducer 7 11 for z d 0 19 and 14 15 for z d 0 51 the zeroth moments of spectrums at z d 0 19 are generally larger than those at z d 0 51 compared with the measurement numerical prediction gives reasonable patterns and trends of the zeroth moment except for the noticeable deviation at transducers 2 3 and 12 caused by the blocking and shading effect of the trestle pier however numerical prediction slightly overestimates the magnitude of the zeroth moments of wave pressure spectrums peak spectral values are plotted in fig 12 b the trend of the primary peak are similar to that of the zeroth moment as a function of transducer number fig 12 b also gives the secondary peaks low frequency and high frequency peaks that appear in the measured results the magnitude of measured secondary peak spectral values is about 1 6 1 4 of the primary peaks the secondary peaks of transducers on the up wave side wall tend to be larger than those on the down wave side wall however there are not numerical results for the low and high frequency peaks because the numerical simulation adopts the first order diffraction theory and is unable to predict the secondary peaks fig 12 c plots the measured and numerical peak frequencies for different transducers the numerical primary peak frequencies agree well with the measured results the peak frequency does not clearly change with the change of transducers it indicates that the diffraction effect has negligible influence on the frequency for the spectral primary peak the measured low frequency peaks appear at 0 hz and the high frequency peaks appear around 0 185 hz which is twice the frequency of the primary peak 0 094 hz this finding can be well explained by the sum frequency and difference frequency wave load phenomenon introduced in section 5 1 5 3 pressure transfer function fig 13 illustrates the measured and numerical pressure transfer functions there is an obvious bulge in most of the measured curves in the frequency range of 0 15 0 20 hz the sum frequency nonlinear wave pressure that only appears in measured results makes the measured values larger than the numerical values the measured transfer function curve near 0 hz has a sudden rise and becomes much larger than the numerical curve the difference frequency nonlinear wave pressure which concentrates near 0 hz increase the magnitude of the measured transfer function in this frequency range since the spectral values of wave surface spectrum near 0 hz is quite small as is shown in fig 5 the measured transfer functions calculated using eq 7 lead to remarkably large values near 0 hz 5 4 maximum wave pressure the numerical and measured maximum wave pressures at different locations are calculated using eq 8 and eq 9 and demonstrated in fig 14 the agreement between numerical and measured maximum wave pressure is good because transducers 2 3 and 12 are very close to a trestle pier as illustrated in fig 5 a the adjacent trestle pier blocks the incident wave and reduces the maximum wave pressure on these three transducers significantly the following pressure variations can be found through the comparison among the pressures at different transducers firstly wave pressures decrease gradually from the up wave side walls to the down wave side walls due to wave diffraction effect at z d 0 19 the maximum value appears on the up wave side transducer 4 and 5 with a value of 37 kpa and the minimum value appears on the down wave side transducer 9 with a value of about 17 kpa the maximum pressure is up to 2 2 times of the minimum pressure when z d increases to 0 51 the wave pressure obeys the same variation around the cofferdam secondly the maximum wave pressures at z d 0 19 are larger than those at z d 0 51 for example the wave pressure at z d 0 19 transducer 5 is clearly larger than that at z d 0 51 transducer 13 in other words the wave pressure becomes smaller when the measured spot goes down along the height of the cofferdam 6 conclusions wave pressure on an actual construction cofferdam under random wave conditions during typhoon dujuan in 2015 was accessed in frequency domain through field measurement and numerical analyses the measured and numerical wave pressure spectrum pressure spectral characteristics transfer function and maximum wave pressure were carefully compared and discussed the following conclusions are drawn from the results and discussions 1 the effect of wave diffraction changes the dominant frequency range zeroth moment and peak spectral value of the random wave pressure spectrum around the cofferdam but has little effect on the peak frequency of the wave pressure spectrum the width of the dominant frequency range the zeroth moment and the peak spectral value of the wave pressure spectrum on the up wave side of cofferdam are all larger than those on the down wave side 2 the increase of sinking depth ratio decreases the maximum wave pressure the dominant frequency range the zeroth moment and the peak spectral value except the peak frequency of wave pressure spectrums 3 two secondary peaks are observed at 0 hz and twice the primary peak frequency in the measured pressure spectrums secondary peaks may induce obvious bulges and sudden rises in the measured transfer functions its effect on the wave pressure of the cofferdam under tropical cyclones should be noticed in the design 4 compared with the measured results in frequency domain the numerical approach based on the first order diffraction theory gives larger zeroth moments of spectrums and peak spectral values but satisfactory primary peak frequency and maximum wave pressure however it cannot be used to calculate the secondary peaks of wave pressure spectrums it should be noted that there are still many limitations which should be implemented in the further studies the direction of the incident wave is identified through the phase lag among different pressure transducers which is a rough estimation for the multi directional wave conditions advanced field monitoring devices wang et al 2018 such as directional wave buoy and wave hindcast models can be used to have a better measurement of wave direction the 80 m distance between the isolated platform and the cofferdam is not far enough wave reflection by the cofferdam may affect the wave measurement advanced technique for wave measurement such as x band radar should be used to avoid the influence by wave reflection the blocking and shading effect of the accessory construction structures including trestle piers jackets etc influence the wave fields and wave pressure of the cofferdam their influences should be taken into account in the numerical simulation because the diffraction theory could not be applied to the structures that are in morison equation morison et al 1950 range cfd tools should be implemented to investigate the wave pressure around the cofferdam nevertheless considering the study of wave pressure on the cofferdam for sea crossing bridge is still insufficient the field measurement and numerical assessment carried out in this study provides a better understanding of the random wave pressure on the cofferdam and can be helpful for structural safety evaluation of the

fuzhou city to pingtan island across haitan strait in the china east sea as shown in fig 1 the bridge site has limited wave fetches in most directions but directly open to the northeast offshore therefore the waves propagating from northeast offshore caused by tropical cyclones are destructive and threaten the construction the steel thin walled construction cofferdam that locates at 25 72 n

measuring accuracy is 0 2 m for wave heights and 0 25 s for wave periods the sampling frequency of the gauge is set to 2 hz which is adequate for most of the waves the wave gauge was supported by a cantilever beam on an isolated electricity platform that is 80 m far from the cofferdam for the convenience of power supply and little impacts from the construction activities the seabed altitude of the platform is 9 3 m which is approximately the same with that of the cofferdam 10 m the effect of wave shoaling can hence be ignored and the wave spectrum at these two locations are considered to be the same the hydrodynamic pressures induced by random waves were measured by fifteen csw560 flush type pressure transducers of which the measuring range is 0 200 kpa and the measuring error is less than 0 5 fig 5 shows the installation setup of all fifteen pressure transducers in order not to alter the roughness of the outer surface of the cofferdam the transducers were embedded into the cofferdam at two different altitudes 4 m and 0 m to investigate the distribution of wave pressure along the height eleven transducers 1 11 were installed at 0 m to capture the wave pressure around the cofferdam near still water level swl four transducers 12 15 were installed at 4 m according to long term historical wave measurements of a data buoy near the bridge site the main wave direction was close to ene east northeast the third marine research institute of national ocean administration 2013 as denoted in fig 4 considering the possible incident wave direction is east northeastern ene at swl five transducers 7 11 were installed on the down wave side to capture the wave diffraction that surrounded the cofferdam 3 measured data analyses 3 1 wave height period and spectrum the wave conditions such as wave height and wave period were drawn using zero up crossing method and listed in table 1 the wave spectrum s Î· f was obtained from the measured time history of wave surface elevation by fast fourier transform techniques according to the analyses the extreme wave height is up to 5 83 m with a period of 11 02s the measured wave spectrum fig 6 has a highly concentrated energy distribution near the peak frequency of 0 094 hz because the fetches are limited and the water depth is finite at the bridge site local winds are difficult to dominate the wave spectrum the low peak frequency and concentrated energy distribution of the spectrum emphasized a wave condition that mainly consists of long period swells propagating from open ocean off the coast 3 2 still water level swl the swl in the field was measured by sby2 1 ultrasonic wave gauge and found to be 2 37 m at the measured time therefore the water depth d of the cofferdam equals 12 37 m and the sinking depth z for transducers installed at 0 m and 4 m equals 2 37 m and 6 37 m respectively the sinking depth ratio z d is defined here to represent the ratio of sinking depth over water depth z d equals 0 19 for transducers installed at 0 m and 0 51 for transducers installed at 4 m 3 3 wave pressure spectrum because the measured pressure time history consists of wave pressure and hydrostatic pressure the wave pressure history was derived by excluding the hydrostatic pressure from the measured pressure given time history of wave pressure the measured wave pressure spectrum s p f m can then be obtained by fast fourier transformation 3 4 incident wave direction considering the direction of swell is always consistent with the dominate wave direction goda 2010 an assumption that the incident random waves are unidirectional long crest swells is used in this study the dominant wave direction of the incident waves was identified from the phase lags among wave pressure time histories at different transducers a typical plot of wave pressure time histories measured by transducers 1 11 around the cofferdam at z d 0 19 under a high energy wave was illustrated in fig 7 a it can be seen that the pressure at 4 reached the peak at first and then the pressures at 3 2 5 1 reached the peak in sequence and the pressure at 7 reached the peak at last as shown in fig 7 b the authors estimated the wave direction through a geometry analysis by knowing the time sequence of 2 5 and 1 the incident wave direction should lie in the range of 38 47 according to the pressure series under the other high energy waves shown in fig 7 c the same sequence of peak occurring was also found a sensitivity analysis of wave pressure to wave direction was conducted to investigate the influence of wave direction on the wave pressure using the numerical method which will be introduced in section 4 wave pressures on the cofferdam under regular wave with a significant wave height of 3 78 m and a period of 9 34s coming from five different directions 35 40 45 50 55 were calculated numerically the results of wave pressure were demonstrated in fig 8 it can be seen that the wave pressures do not change obviously with the wave direction in the range of 35 55 therefore the incident wave direction used in the following analyses was set to be 42 5 which is the mean value of the measured main wave direction range 38 47 this direction is approximate ene which aligns with the main wave direction in the long term measurement of a data buoy near the bridge site 4 numerical analyses of random wave pressure this section introduces the numerical model to analyze the random wave pressure on the cofferdam in terms of wave pressure spectrum pressure spectral characteristics pressure transfer function and maximum wave pressure 4 1 numerical model the wave pressures on the cofferdam were calculated by the 3d first order wave diffraction method the scopes of the method are given as follows 1 the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the fluid flow is irrotational 2 the incident regular wave train is of small amplitude compared to its length and 3 the high order diffraction effect is neglected thorough description of the first order diffraction theory formulation can be found in the reference literature aqwa 2012 molin 2002 and only a brief review of the approach is given below the fluid flow field surrounding a structure at coordinate x y z can be defined by a velocity potential of linear regular wave as follows 1 Ï x y z t a Ï x y z e i Ï t where a is the wave amplitude Ï is the wave angular frequency and t is the time the total potential of wave acting on the cofferdam body equals the sum of the incident potential and the diffraction potential 2 a Ï x y z e i Ï t a e i Ï t Ï i x y z Ï d x y z where Ï i x y z and Ï d x y z are the first order incident wave potential and diffraction wave potential with unit wave amplitude respectively then the wave potential can be obtained by solving a set of equations including laplace equation and boundary conditions on free surface cofferdam surface seabed surface and the so called sommerfeld condition given the total potentials the first order wave pressure can be calculated using the linearized bernoulli s equation 3 p Ï Ï x y z t t i Ï Ï a Ï x y z e i Ï t where Ï is water density based on wave diffraction theory one can solve linear algebraic equations to obtain the harmonic pressure response on the cofferdam to regular linear waves these responses are commonly referred to as transfer function or response amplitude operator rao transfer function or rao is a function or vector of generalized response e g motions forces moments or pressures under unit wave amplitude against wave frequency and can be used to determine the dynamic behavior of the offshore structure in frequency domain the pressure transfer function t f f can be written as 4 t f f p f 1 p f 2 p f 3 p f n where p f n is the wave pressure induced by a regular linear wave with unit amplitude and a frequency of f n in this study the numerical model of cofferdam was built in the 3d diffraction analysis software aqwa line the cofferdam is discretized into 5874 quadrilateral panel elements as illustrated in fig 9 since the sealing concrete had already been poured into the cofferdam to construct the cap when the measurement was conducted the whole structure had a very large mass and stiffness therefore the structure was assumed to be rigid and fully fixed onto the seabed rock the input range of the wave frequency was set from 0 05 hz to 0 5 hz with an interval of 0 01 hz which covered most of the measured wave frequency the pressure transfer functions t f f at transducer 1 15 were then calculated numerically 4 2 wave pressure spectrum according to molin 2002 the wave pressure spectrum s p Ï can be linearly expressed as 5 s p f t f f 2 s Î· f where s Î· f is the incident wave spectrum the numerical wave pressure spectrum s p f p was obtained according to eq 5 when transfer functions t f f calculated by aqwa line and measured wave surface spectrum s p f m are given 4 3 pressure spectral characteristics zeroth spectral moment peak spectral value and peak frequency are three key characteristics of the spectrums to generate the random waves molin 2002 raman and rao 1983 yu 2000 the zeroth spectral moment which represents the total area under the spectrum curve is defined by 6 m 0 0 s p f d f where s p f is the pressure spectrum peak spectral value and peak frequency are defined as the value and corresponding frequency of the spectrum peak respectively then the zeroth spectral moments peak spectral values and peak frequencies of the numerical and measured pressure spectrums were calculated 4 4 pressure transfer function according to eq 5 the pressure transfer functions can be computed as follow 7 s p f s Î· f t f f the numerical pressure transfer functions t f f p were automatically computed by aqwa line following eq 7 while the measured pressure transfer functions t f f m should be manually computed according to eq 7 using measured wave spectrum s Î· f section 3 1 and measured wave pressure spectrum s p f m section 3 3 4 5 maximum wave pressure according to cartwright and longuet higgins 1956 molin 2002 yu 2000 and vandever et al 2008 the random wave surface elevation can be assumed as a gaussian distribution and the maximum surface value Î· max can be evaluated using wave surface spectrum as 8 Î· max 2 ln 1 Îµ 2 n 1 2 Î³ 2 ln 1 Îµ 2 n 1 2 m 0 where n equals the number of waves Î³ is euler s constant with a value of 0 5722 n is the number of measured waves and set to be 112 here and Îµ is the width of spectra and equals 9 Îµ 1 m 2 2 m 0 m 4 where m i i 0 2 4 is the i t h moment of wave spectrums which can be calculated from the numerical pressure spectrums s p f p respectively according to molin 2002 and yu 2000 the variations which are linearly related with wave surface elevation Î· obey the same distribution law as Î· because wave pressure is assumed to be linearly related with wave surface the numerical maximum wave pressure p max p can be calculated using the numerical pressure spectrums through the same approach as Î· max the measured maximum wave pressure p max m is the maximum value in measured wave pressure time series excluding hydrostatic pressure 5 results and discussions 5 1 wave pressure spectrum fig 10 shows the measured wave pressure spectrums s p Ï m and the numerical wave pressure spectrums s p Ï p predicted at transducers 1 15 taken the transducers 1 10 installed at z d 0 19 as examples the dominant frequency range of pressure spectrums varies significantly with the change of the transducer location the wave energy at transducers 1 6 concentrates in the frequency range of 0 05 0 25 hz while the energy at transducers 7 10 concentrates in the frequency range of 0 05 0 20 hz according to fig 5 transducer 1 6 are installed on the up wave side and transducers 7 10 are on the down wave side of the cofferdam the upper bound of the frequency range of wave energy on the down wave side is smaller than that on the up wave side when z d increases to 0 51 this phenomenon still appears the highest wave energy at transducers 12 and 13 on up wave side concentrates in the range of 0 05 0 20 hz while that at transducers 14 and 15 on down wave side concentrates in the shorter range of 0 05 0 12 hz the difference is mainly caused by the wave diffraction on the cofferdam ishida and iwagaki 1978 sundar et al 1990 when a high frequency wave that has short wave length encounters the cofferdam it can be easily diffracted at the wall on the up wave side and has few contributions on the high frequency of pressure spectrums on down wave side wall it explains why the high frequency energy of transducers on down wave side are reduced moreover the dominant frequency ranges decrease with the increase of the water ratio z d this can be concluded that the influencing depths of waves reduce with the increase of wave frequency secondary peaks with small magnitudes can be observed in the higher and lower frequency zone of the measured pressure spectrums given in fig 10 the secondary peaks have been found to be induced by the second order effect of the wave which is one of the common nonlinear effects in finite water under extreme waves kim 1991 molin 1979 2002 the submerged objects under irregular waves are subjected to not only large amplitude so called first order wave loads but also small amplitude so called second order wave loads the second order wave loads force pressure moment etc in random waves can be expressed according to molin 2002 as 10 f 2 t f 2 t f 2 t re i j a i a j f 2 Ï i Ï j Î² e i Ï i Ï j t Î¸ i Î¸ j re i j a i a j f 2 Ï i Ï j Î² e i Ï i Ï j t Î¸ i Î¸ j where a is wave amplitude Ï is wave frequency Î¸ is wave phase f 2 and f 2 are sum and difference frequency loads f 2 and f 2 are sum and difference frequency quadratic transfer function it can be seen that second order wave loads consist of two kinds of wave frequency namely sum frequency Ï i Ï j and difference frequency Ï i Ï j a typical wave force spectrum including first and second order effects is plotted in fig 11 kim 1991 molin 2002 roald et al 2013 the spectrum of difference frequency wave loads will have a concentrated energy zone around 0 hz while the spectrum of sum frequency wave loads will have a concentrated energy zone around 2f hz where f is the peak frequency of the first order wave loads spectrum it can be easily observed from fig 10 that the measured wave pressure spectrums have obvious secondary peaks and have a very similar pattern to the example spectrum given in fig 11 however the issues about secondary peak have not been reported in previous experimental studies about the wave pressure on structures ishida and iwagaki 1978 sundar et al 1990 some literature aqwa 2012 molin 1979 2002 mention that the nonlinear wave effect are related to wave amplitude and can be more obvious in severe wave conditions compared with moderate wave conditions the measurement points out once again that the nonlinear wave pressure exists in severe wave conditions induced by tropical cyclones compared the measured with the numerical pressure spectrums numerical simulation agrees well with the measurement in spectral shape and energy distribution however the secondary peaks are not observed in numerical results as introduced in section 4 the diffraction theory applied in this study is the first order and does not include nonlinear effects therefore the secondary peaks cannot be calculated in the numerical results therefore the numerical predictions underestimate the wave energy in the lower frequency range of 0 0 02 hz and in the higher frequency range of 0 15 0 20 hz at most of the transducers however the measured spectral energy at transducers 2 3 and 12 are significantly smaller than the predictions it is mainly caused by the blocking and shading effect of the accessory structures used in the construction including trestle piers and jackets as illustrated in fig 5 a transducers 2 3 and 12 are very close to the trestle piers these piers blocked the incident waves and induced flow wakes thus reduced the measured wave pressure at 2 3 and 12 5 2 pressure spectral characteristics the following wave pressure spectral characteristics such as zeroth moment of spectrum peak spectral value and peak frequency are presented and discussed in this subsection zeroth moments of spectrum for both measured and numerical wave pressure spectrums are plotted in fig 12 a the zeroth moments of spectrum at transducers on the up wave side transducer 1 6 for z d 0 19 and 12 13 for z d 0 51 are larger than those on the down wave side transducer 7 11 for z d 0 19 and 14 15 for z d 0 51 the zeroth moments of spectrums at z d 0 19 are generally larger than those at z d 0 51 compared with the measurement numerical prediction gives reasonable patterns and trends of the zeroth moment except for the noticeable deviation at transducers 2 3 and 12 caused by the blocking and shading effect of the trestle pier however numerical prediction slightly overestimates the magnitude of the zeroth moments of wave pressure spectrums peak spectral values are plotted in fig 12 b the trend of the primary peak are similar to that of the zeroth moment as a function of transducer number fig 12 b also gives the secondary peaks low frequency and high frequency peaks that appear in the measured results the magnitude of measured secondary peak spectral values is about 1 6 1 4 of the primary peaks the secondary peaks of transducers on the up wave side wall tend to be larger than those on the down wave side wall however there are not numerical results for the low and high frequency peaks because the numerical simulation adopts the first order diffraction theory and is unable to predict the secondary peaks fig 12 c plots the measured and numerical peak frequencies for different transducers the numerical primary peak frequencies agree well with the measured results the peak frequency does not clearly change with the change of transducers it indicates that the diffraction effect has negligible influence on the frequency for the spectral primary peak the measured low frequency peaks appear at 0 hz and the high frequency peaks appear around 0 185 hz which is twice the frequency of the primary peak 0 094 hz this finding can be well explained by the sum frequency and difference frequency wave load phenomenon introduced in section 5 1 5 3 pressure transfer function fig 13 illustrates the measured and numerical pressure transfer functions there is an obvious bulge in most of the measured curves in the frequency range of 0 15 0 20 hz the sum frequency nonlinear wave pressure that only appears in measured results makes the measured values larger than the numerical values the measured transfer function curve near 0 hz has a sudden rise and becomes much larger than the numerical curve the difference frequency nonlinear wave pressure which concentrates near 0 hz increase the magnitude of the measured transfer function in this frequency range since the spectral values of wave surface spectrum near 0 hz is quite small as is shown in fig 5 the measured transfer functions calculated using eq 7 lead to remarkably large values near 0 hz 5 4 maximum wave pressure the numerical and measured maximum wave pressures at different locations are calculated using eq 8 and eq 9 and demonstrated in fig 14 the agreement between numerical and measured maximum wave pressure is good because transducers 2 3 and 12 are very close to a trestle pier as illustrated in fig 5 a the adjacent trestle pier blocks the incident wave and reduces the maximum wave pressure on these three transducers significantly the following pressure variations can be found through the comparison among the pressures at different transducers firstly wave pressures decrease gradually from the up wave side walls to the down wave side walls due to wave diffraction effect at z d 0 19 the maximum value appears on the up wave side transducer 4 and 5 with a value of 37 kpa and the minimum value appears on the down wave side transducer 9 with a value of about 17 kpa the maximum pressure is up to 2 2 times of the minimum pressure when z d increases to 0 51 the wave pressure obeys the same variation around the cofferdam secondly the maximum wave pressures at z d 0 19 are larger than those at z d 0 51 for example the wave pressure at z d 0 19 transducer 5 is clearly larger than that at z d 0 51 transducer 13 in other words the wave pressure becomes smaller when the measured spot goes down along the height of the cofferdam 6 conclusions wave pressure on an actual construction cofferdam under random wave conditions during typhoon dujuan in 2015 was accessed in frequency domain through field measurement and numerical analyses the measured and numerical wave pressure spectrum pressure spectral characteristics transfer function and maximum wave pressure were carefully compared and discussed the following conclusions are drawn from the results and discussions 1 the effect of wave diffraction changes the dominant frequency range zeroth moment and peak spectral value of the random wave pressure spectrum around the cofferdam but has little effect on the peak frequency of the wave pressure spectrum the width of the dominant frequency range the zeroth moment and the peak spectral value of the wave pressure spectrum on the up wave side of cofferdam are all larger than those on the down wave side 2 the increase of sinking depth ratio decreases the maximum wave pressure the dominant frequency range the zeroth moment and the peak spectral value except the peak frequency of wave pressure spectrums 3 two secondary peaks are observed at 0 hz and twice the primary peak frequency in the measured pressure spectrums secondary peaks may induce obvious bulges and sudden rises in the measured transfer functions its effect on the wave pressure of the cofferdam under tropical cyclones should be noticed in the design 4 compared with the measured results in frequency domain the numerical approach based on the first order diffraction theory gives larger zeroth moments of spectrums and peak spectral values but satisfactory primary peak frequency and maximum wave pressure however it cannot be used to calculate the secondary peaks of wave pressure spectrums it should be noted that there are still many limitations which should be implemented in the further studies the direction of the incident wave is identified through the phase lag among different pressure transducers which is a rough estimation for the multi directional wave conditions advanced field monitoring devices wang et al 2018 such as directional wave buoy and wave hindcast models can be used to have a better measurement of wave direction the 80 m distance between the isolated platform and the cofferdam is not far enough wave reflection by the cofferdam may affect the wave measurement advanced technique for wave measurement such as x band radar should be used to avoid the influence by wave reflection the blocking and shading effect of the accessory construction structures including trestle piers jackets etc influence the wave fields and wave pressure of the cofferdam their influences should be taken into account in the numerical simulation because the diffraction theory could not be applied to the structures that are in morison equation morison et al 1950 range cfd tools should be implemented to investigate the wave pressure around the cofferdam nevertheless considering the study of wave pressure on the cofferdam for sea crossing bridge is still insufficient the field measurement and numerical assessment carried out in this study provides a better understanding of the random wave pressure on the cofferdam and can be helpful for structural safety evaluation of the cofferdam for sea crossing bridge declaration of conflicting interests the author s declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research authorship and or publication of this

engineering often a single material cannot satisfy all the needed requirements and so dissimilar materials have to be used within this context the problem of joining different materials arises traditional welding techniques often do not give good results in terms of reliability and crack free along the interfaces the explosion welding crossland 1971 is one of the most performing solutions to join dissimilar metallic materials one of the most used kinds of explosion welded joints in shipbuilding industries is represented by the aluminium steel type ayob 2010 the explosion welding process uses an explosive detonation as energy source to produce a metallurgical bond between metal components the two most critical parameters which influence the weld strength and the interface morphology are the impact velocity and the impact angle botros and groves 1980 generally due to the difficulty of joining directly aluminium alloy to steel an intermediate layer is placed in between han et al 2003 li et al 2015 an example of connection using explosion welded joint in ships is reported in fig 1 the literature on the recent developments in explosive welding was reviewed in findik 2011 a shipbuilding application of bimetallic joints for the connection of aluminium superstructure to steel deck is shown in young and banker 2004 experimental investigations of explosive welding of aluminium to steel were reported in literature mckenney and banker 1971 acarer and demir 2008 raghukandan 2003 the interfacial toughness of a shipboard al steel structural transition joint was investigated in chao et al 1997 and it was found that the interfacial toughness increases as the mode ii shearing mode increases the aim of this research activity was to develop a procedure to simulate the non linear behavior of aluminium steel welded joints used in shipbuilding when they are subjected to bending loading the need of this procedure arises from the fact that with these kinds of dissimilar joints the virgin material properties cannot always be detected from standard tensile tests for this reason the aim was to build a non linear fe model in which the three different materials properties were considered starting only from hardness tests which are easy to perform and more than everything they are non destructive moreover another advantage of the developed procedure is that it can be applied also to real ship structures where it is not easy to take samples and make destructive experimental tests the developed procedure is extended in the present study to explosion welded joints subjected to three point bending loading and further applied for the same explosion welded joint with an initial notch in the aa5086 side the authors have already applied full

digital image correlation dic technique was applied in order to investigate the influence of the different materials on the mechanical strength of the exploded welded joints during three point bending loading and above all in order to validate the non linear fe model based on hardness measuerements 2 hardness measurements and mechanical properties correlation hardness measurements were performed in order to investigate the material properties and were directly correlated to mechanical properties the investigated explosive welded specimens produced by triclad consist of astm a516 gr55 structural steel clad by explosion welding with aa5086 aluminum alloy and provided with an intermediate layer of aa1050 commercial pure aluminum the measured hardness values for the three metals are 175 hv for astm a516 gr 55 47 hv for aa 1050 interlayer 109 hv for aa 5086 due to the plasticity induced by the welding process the microhardness profiles performed around the interface areas showed an increase of hardness especially at the steel side fig 2 in the present study the following relationships of the static mechanical properties ultimate strength Ïut and yield strength Ïy as a function of the

this relationship is in accordance with the conversion data reported in astm e140 the experimental steel hardness data about 200 hv are in the range 100 500 hb considered in lopez and fatemi 2012 for

terms of r o parameters determination the second one was chosen since it only needs two parameters which were identified by means of hardness measurements the curves obtained for the three materials using eq 8 are shown in fig 3 3 experimental static bending tests static three point bending tests were carried out on explosive welded specimens using a servo hydraulic load machine instron 8854 at a displacement rate of 4 mm min the heights of the layers are 19 mm for the astm a516 gr 55 9 5 mm for the pure aluminium 1050a and 6 mm for the aluminium alloy 5086 the thickness in the transversal direction is 20 mm the experimental setup and the specimen geometry are shown in fig 4 the lower support span has a length of 300 mm the load was applied on the steel side in order to have a tensile stress on the aluminium side bending tests were performed on rectangular specimens with and without an initial notch a notch was introduced in a specimen by means of a disc cutter a bending test on the notched specimen was performed in order to assess the strength reduction fig 5 shows a dic image of the undeformed specimen with the initial notch the notch dimensions are 1 7 mm in the longitudinal direction and 6 5 mm in the thickness direction the notch tip reported in fig 5 is due to the disk cutter and was hard to measure fig 6 reports the load displacement curves of two tests carried out on a specimen without an initial notch and on a specimen with an initial notch the curves show a big reduction in bending strength of the notched specimen the maximum load is 32 kn for the specimen without notch and 19 4 kn for the specimen with the notch the region surrounding the notch is characterized by a mutli axial stress strain state fig 7 reports the evolution of the von mises strain detected by means of the dic technique around the notch region showing the strain concentration in the notched area during the tests except for points too close to notches and edges in fact the dic system cannot measures points very close to the notch and edges results show that the al region starts yielding between 9 kn and 12 kn although the load increases linearly up to about 13 kn with respect to the imposed displacement as shown by fig 6 this means that the load is supported almost totally from the steel layer the ductility of the aluminum is confirmed by fig 8 which reports the specimen after the test showing also the delamination at the interface between al and steel 4 non linear finite element simulation the aim of this research activity was to develop a procedure to simulate the non linear behavior of the explosion welded joint considering the specimen geometry and boundary conditions that were used for experimental tests this procedure was further extended to a specimen with an initial notch as mentioned the virgin material properties cannot always be detected from standard tensile tests and so a non linear fe model was built in which the three different materials properties are considered starting only from hardness tests non linear 3d fea analyses were carried out using a gradual increase of the applied load the chosen element was the solid186 having 20 nodes and three degrees of freedom translation along the x y and z directions this element supports plasticity iperplasticity creep and large deflections in addition to having the ability to allow to simulate deformations of elastoplastic materials the mechanical properties of each material detected from hardness measurements and previously reported in fig 3 were considered as input of the fe model using the ansys software multi linear kinematic hardening models were used in this study for the non linear analyses the load was applied at the upper side of the steel and the lower span length was set to 300 mm ffor th fe analysis according to the experimental tests with these data it was possible to perform properly the simulations with the ansys software and the obtained results were compared to the results obtained during the experimental tests by means of the dic technique at the beginning the fe results needed to be validated for a test where no initial notch was introduced fig 9 and fig 10 show respectively the comparison of the longitudinal strains at 15 kn during the elastic phase and 29 kn during the plastic phase using the same scale the results confirm the good agreement between the experimental measurements and the fe results a quantitative comparison is shown in fig 11 which reports the force strain curve of a point located a 2 2 mm from the external side of the aluminum alloy from the figure it is possible to see that that there is a general good agreement between the two experimental measurements and the fe model predictions in particular it is observed that the strain calculated from fe analysis is in between the experimental strain confirming that the choice of calculating the non linear material properties used for the non linear fea from hardness measurements leads to reliable results once the procedure was validated for three point bending considering no initial notch it was further applied considering an initial notch the notch geometry for the fe analysis was modelled assuming 1 7 mm in the longitudinal direction and 6 5 mm in the thickness direction no notch radii were introduced in the fe analysis as it was difficult to measure and usually can change from one specimen to the other the minimum length size of the elements in the notched region determined through a convergence of the solution of the fe analysis is about 0 1 mm fig 12 shows the fem geometry of the specimen with an initial notch with the adopted input material curves since multi axial stress strain state occurs when dealing with notched specimens the results reported in figs 13 and 14 are expressed in terms of von mises strain at 10 and 13 kn and compared to dic results using the same scales from the figures a general good agreement is depicted except for points very close to the notch the differences are due to a few reasons the dic technique is not able to reach these points the notch geometry of the real specimen slightly differs from the notch of the fe analysis in which the notch was simulated as a square notch furthermore fe results close to the notch are affected from the notch geometry and mesh refinement figs 15 and 16 show a comparison in terms of von mises strain between dic and fe analysis in the notched area using the same scales as mentioned the dic technique was not able to measure strains too close to edges i e the sharp notch the figures show a general good agreement confirming also in this case that the choice of calculating the non linear material properties used for the non linear fea only from hardness measurements leads to reliable results some differences are probably due to the presence of residual stresses during the explosion welding process which were not taken into account in the fe model the difference between the interface profiles between the three layers generally the interface profile can vary from straight to wavy while it was considered smooth for the fea the hardening increase of the interfacial zones furthermore table 5 shows a comparison in terms of von mises strain calculated at 10 kn and 13 kn between dic and fe analysis for a point in proximity of the maximum measured strain by the dic technique highlighted in figs 15 and 16 the point is located at 2 mm in the y direction and 2 mm in the x direction direction from the notch of the fe model the choice of the point location for the comparison is due to the fact that the dic technique cannot reach points too close to edges as mentioned and shown also in figs 13 and 14 and in order to be less influenced by the notch stress strain singularity 5 conclusions a procedure was developed to predict the elastic and plastic response of the investigated explosion welded joint under static loading by means of non linear finite element simulations it is based on the following steps the hardness measurements for the assessment of the different materials constitutive curves the realization of a nonlinear finite element analysis considering the different material properties and finally the validation of the fe model by means of the experimental data obtained by dic technique in this way a non linear fe analysis can be conducted starting only from hardness measurements which were correlated to the mechanical properties of the dissimilar joint the comparison has shown good agreement with respect to experimental results detected by means of the dic images the procedure was further applied to an explosive welded specimen with an initial notch showing good agreement with respect to experimental results detected by means of the dic images it can be assumend that the calculation of the non linear material properties used for the non linear fea from hardness measurements leads to reliable results the applied procedure allows providing useful information for the development of models for the prediction of fracture behavior of explosion welded joints used in shipbuilding under

23341,a procedure to simulate the non linear behavior of explosion welded joints used for shipbuilding applications starting only from hardness measurements was developed the explosion welded joints consist of three different materials astm a516 structural steel aa5086 aluminum alloy and an intermediate layer of pure aluminum three point bending tests were carried out on explosion welded joints with and without an initial notch the digital image correlation which is a non contact full field technique was applied in order to measure the displacement and strain patterns of the different metals during the bending tests non linear finite element analyses were performed the stress strain curves of the materials applied in the finite element model were obtained using ramberg osgood type equations and considering the results of the micro hardness measurements which were correlated to the mechanical properties of the different materials the finite element model was validated experimentally comparing the results with the measurements obtained using the digital image correlation technique furthermore the procedure was extended to a specimen with an initial notch for which

engineering often a single material cannot satisfy all the needed requirements and so dissimilar materials have to be used within this context the problem of joining different materials arises traditional welding techniques often do not give good results in terms of reliability and crack free along the interfaces the explosion welding crossland 1971 is one of the most performing solutions to join dissimilar metallic materials one of the most used kinds of explosion welded joints in shipbuilding industries is represented by the aluminium steel type ayob 2010 the explosion welding process uses an explosive detonation as energy source to produce a metallurgical bond between metal components the two most critical parameters which influence the weld strength and the interface morphology are the impact velocity and the impact angle botros and groves 1980 generally due to the difficulty of joining directly aluminium alloy to steel an intermediate layer is placed in between han et al 2003 li et al 2015 an example of connection using explosion welded joint in ships is reported in fig 1 the literature on the recent developments in explosive welding was reviewed in findik 2011 a shipbuilding application of bimetallic joints for the connection of aluminium superstructure to steel deck is shown in young and banker 2004 experimental investigations of explosive welding of aluminium to steel were reported in literature mckenney and banker 1971 acarer and demir 2008 raghukandan 2003 the interfacial toughness of a shipboard al steel structural transition joint was investigated in chao et al 1997 and it was found that the interfacial toughness increases as the mode ii shearing mode increases the aim of this research activity was to develop a procedure to simulate the non linear behavior of aluminium steel welded joints used in shipbuilding when they are subjected to bending loading the need of this procedure arises from the fact that with these kinds of dissimilar joints the virgin material properties cannot always be detected from standard tensile tests for this reason the aim was to build a non linear fe model in which the three different materials properties were considered starting only from hardness tests which are easy to perform and more than everything they are non destructive moreover another advantage of the developed procedure is that it can be applied also to real ship structures where it is not easy to take samples and make destructive experimental tests the developed procedure is extended in the present study to explosion welded joints subjected to three point bending loading and further applied for the same explosion welded joint with an initial notch in the aa5086 side the authors have already applied full field and non destructive techniques infrared thermography digital image correlation computed tomography for the analysis of different materials and welded joints used for marine structures welded

digital image correlation dic technique was applied in order to investigate the influence of the different materials on the mechanical strength of the exploded welded joints during three point bending loading and above all in order to validate the non linear fe model based on hardness measuerements 2 hardness measurements and mechanical properties correlation hardness measurements were performed in order to investigate the material properties and were directly correlated to mechanical properties the investigated explosive welded specimens produced by triclad consist of astm a516 gr55 structural steel clad by explosion welding with aa5086 aluminum alloy and provided with an intermediate layer of aa1050 commercial pure aluminum the measured hardness values for the three metals are 175 hv for astm a516 gr 55 47 hv for aa 1050 interlayer 109 hv for aa 5086 due to the plasticity induced by the welding process the microhardness profiles performed around the interface areas showed an increase of hardness especially at the steel side fig 2 in the present study the following relationships of the static mechanical properties ultimate strength Ïut and yield strength Ïy as a function of the

static tensile properties were calculated using eq 1 and eq 2 for the steel vickers and brinell hardness values are related by the formula hb 0 95 hv valid for steels as reported in canale et al 2008 this relationship is in accordance with the conversion data reported in astm e140 the experimental steel hardness data about 200 hv are in the range 100 500 hb considered in lopez and fatemi 2012 for the aa1050 and the aa5086 typical relationships used for al alloys shown in equations 3 and 4 were adopted stathers et al 2014 the results of the profiles based on microhardness measurements are

terms of r o parameters determination the second one was chosen since it only needs two parameters which were identified by means of hardness measurements the curves obtained for the three materials using eq 8 are shown in fig 3 3 experimental static bending tests static three point bending tests were carried out on explosive welded specimens using a servo hydraulic load machine instron 8854 at a displacement rate of 4 mm min the heights of the layers are 19 mm for the astm a516 gr 55 9 5 mm for the pure aluminium 1050a and 6 mm for the aluminium alloy 5086 the thickness in the transversal direction is 20 mm the experimental setup and the specimen geometry are shown in fig 4 the lower support span has a length of 300 mm the load was applied on the steel side in order to have a tensile stress on the aluminium side bending tests were performed on rectangular specimens with and without an initial notch a notch was introduced in a specimen by means of a disc cutter a bending test on the notched specimen was performed in order to assess the strength reduction fig 5 shows a dic image of the undeformed specimen with the initial notch the notch dimensions are 1 7 mm in the longitudinal direction and 6 5 mm in the thickness direction the notch tip reported in fig 5 is due to the disk cutter and was hard to measure fig 6 reports the load displacement curves of two tests carried out on a specimen without an initial notch and on a specimen with an initial notch the curves show a big reduction in bending strength of the notched specimen the maximum load is 32 kn for the specimen without notch and 19 4 kn for the specimen with the notch the region surrounding the notch is characterized by a mutli axial stress strain state fig 7 reports the evolution of the von mises strain detected by means of the dic technique around the notch region showing the strain concentration in the notched area during the tests except for points too close to notches and edges in fact the dic system cannot measures points very close to the notch and edges results show that the al region starts yielding between 9 kn and 12 kn although the load increases linearly up to about 13 kn with respect to the imposed displacement as shown by fig 6 this means that the load is supported almost totally from the steel layer the ductility of the aluminum is confirmed by fig 8 which reports the specimen after the test showing also the delamination at the interface between al and steel 4 non linear finite element simulation the aim of this research activity was to develop a procedure to simulate the non linear behavior of the explosion welded joint considering the specimen geometry and boundary conditions that were used for experimental tests this procedure was further extended to a specimen with an initial notch as mentioned the virgin material properties cannot always be detected from standard tensile tests and so a non linear fe model was built in which the three different

23342,the bedding in process of synthetic fiber ropes such as polyester nylon aramid and hmpe is of vital importance to experimental research and engineering application in the present work several important topics are systematically investigated by utilizing an experimental setup for cyclic loading tests of synthetic fiber ropes these topics include the effects of bedding in level on rope properties a quantitative method for determining the bedding in level of ropes and the main factors of influencing the bedding in level first effects of the bedding in level on properties of synthetic fiber ropes are investigated a quantitative method for determining the bedding in level is first proposed by utilizing the tension strain curve of static tensile tests for synthetic fiber ropes based on the concept of bedding in this method is conducive to accurate comparison and evaluation of the elongation data obtained from different guidelines for synthetic fiber mooring ropes second effects of the mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles on the bedding in level of hmpe and polyester ropes are systematically investigated based on measured data the recommended method for determining the bedding in procedure is proposed for synthetic fiber mooring ropes furthermore an empirical expression that takes into account both the mean load loading amplitude and number of loading cycles is proposed which is the only one that can quantitatively evaluate the bedding in level of fiber ropes under previous cyclic loading the present work is of great necessity and benefit to capturing the loading history behavior and failure mechanism of synthetic fiber ropes and also to designing convenient bedding in procedures that are required for the installation of synthetic fiber mooring ropes keywords synthetic fiber rope hmpe polyester mooring rope bedding in experimental investigation 1 introduction synthetic fiber ropes have been proved to be the most suitable substitute for steel wire ropes or chains in deepwater mooring applications over the past two decades due to apparent advantages in terms of cost ease of handling and the ability to reduce peak loadings compared to steel wire ropes or chains banfield and casey 1998 however synthetic fiber ropes show the loading history effect which means that different initial bedding in levels of rope samples have a strong influence on the load strain characteristic the bedding in is the loading process of compaction of internal rope components to reduce the constructional stretch stabilize the rope length and increase rope and termination efficiencies american petroleum institute api 2007 2015 to obtain the representative and reasonable experimental values of synthetic fiber ropes the bedding in procedure is a necessary loading process previous researchers shared their significantly different understandings of the bedding in process del vecchio 1992 used a bedding in loading between 10 and 30 of the breaking load for 1000 cycles before performing experiments on synthetic fiber ropes banfield and casey 1998 concluded that any test procedures should be monitored and recorded to correctly interpret the test results of synthetic fiber ropes because the bedding in effect dramatically changes rope properties bosman and hooker 1999 found that the mean load is the main parameter of determining the dynamic modulus of polyester ropes under the condition that the minimum number of bedding in cycles has to be 10 000 in 1999 researchers of the joint industry project considered that documenting the bedding in process of synthetic fiber ropes is necessary to assure accurate comparison of elongation and stiffness data between ropes and to investigate the failure mechanism of ropes bp 1999 franÃ§ois and davies 2000 found that the permanent elongation of fiber ropes is a combination of rope construction and material elongation they also noted that a range of cyclic loading as small as possible is desirable during the bedding in process casey et al 2000 concluded that once the sample is fully bedded in the dynamic stiffness of ropes remains virtually constant casey and banfield 2002 noticed that almost every cyclic run exhibits a period of bedding in but they did not propose a measurement method for calculating the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes in addition casey and banfield 2003 concluded that many thousands of cycles may be required to achieve full bedding in state of synthetic fiber ropes however due to the high cost of large numbers of cycles in full scale ropes they suggested that 100 cycles may achieve a full bedding in state flory et al 2004 concluded that constructional stretch is caused by the bedding in process davies et al 2006 stated that there is large difference in tension strain curves of static tensile tests between bedded in and new ropes franÃ§ois and davies 2008 held that the bedding in process is a particularly important aspect and quite specific to fiber ropes franÃ§ois et al 2010 concluded that the bedding in process for a mooring line will happen during installation or shortly afterwards for example a bedding in operation of polyester mooring ropes was performed by two anchor handling vessels during installation deandrade and duggal 2010 weller et al 2014 discovered that the bedding in process has a significant effect on the operational performance of synthetic fiber ropes by originally performing harmonic loading tests of nylon ropes with different initial bedding in levels in addition many researchers ghoreishi et al 2007a b vu et al 2015 davies et al 2016 focused on the finite element simulation of complex behaviors of fiber ropes to improve the understanding of rope structures and mechanical elongations these investigations are helpful to understanding the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes it should be pointed out that different guidance notes of synthetic fiber ropes advise different bedding in procedures such as from american petroleum institute api 2007 2015 international standards organization iso 2007 bureau veritas bv 2007 american bureau of shipping abs 2011 and det norske veritas and germanischer lloyd dnvgl 2017 as summarized in table 1 the similarity of these guidelines is that harmonic intervals are proposed to bed in the rope structure stabilize the rope length and increase rope and termination efficiencies note that the loading period of harmonica intervals is not considered as an influential parameter by any guidelines the differences include the initial loading process harmonic interval and creep procedure only bureau veritas bv 2007 and american bureau of shipping abs 2011 require an initial loading process in addition only american bureau of shipping abs 2011 requires a creep procedure after harmonic intervals obviously different guidelines for offshore synthetic fiber ropes define different bedding in processes this means that the bedding in process is indeed not a unified suggestion even though the bedding in process suggested by the international standards organization iso 2007 is now widely adopted the effects of the bedding in process from different guidelines on the behavior of synthetic fiber ropes need to be further explored to sum up the survey of current research reveals that the experimental investigations of the bedding in level are significant not only for installing synthetic fiber ropes in practical engineering but also for capturing the mechanical behavior of synthetic fiber ropes however there are still questions that need to be further clarified a because different guidance notes of synthetic fiber ropes proposed different bedding in procedures accurate comparison of elongation and stiffness between ropes becomes difficult b previous research lacks introducing the measurement of bedding in level and a quantitative equation to describe the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes c the relevance of the lab tests to engineering applications in the aspect of bedding in processes of synthetic fiber ropes is insufficiently established the present study aims to answer the questions above based on the essential concept of bedding in for synthetic fiber ropes experimental investigations of hmpe and polyester ropes are systematically performed utilizing an experimental setup for cyclic loading tests of synthetic fiber ropes to begin with effects of the bedding in level on properties of hmpe ropes are investigated then a method for quantitatively determining the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes is proposed by utilizing the tension strain curve of static tensile tests for synthetic fiber ropes based on the test results the bedding in suggestions of hmpe and polyester ropes are proposed an empirical expression that accounts for the mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles is also proposed to describe the factors upon bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes the present work is of great necessity and benefit to capturing the loading history behavior and failure mechanism of synthetic fiber ropes and also to designing convenient bedding in procedures that are required for the installation of synthetic fiber mooring ropes 2 experimental setup and rope specimens 2 1 experimental setup for synthetic fiber ropes the experimental setup is made up of four parts i e the loading elements the equipment foundation the rope measurement system and the water cycling system as shown in fig 1 the loading elements include the dynamic loading and static loading components the maximum capacity of static loading is 60 kn while the corresponding capacity of dynamic loading is 50 kn the equipment foundation is designed to make the experimental setup be easily installed in the laboratory the rope measurement system includes the rope elongation and the loading measurement systems the rope elongation measurement system consists of a wire transducer and two axletrees as shown in fig 2 these axletrees are installed above the outer water tank there are two sliding blocks on axletrees one serves as the base for the wire transducer and the other is used to fix the wire two specially designed clamps installed under the sliding blocks are used to calibrate the test region these clamps can be reliably fixed on the gauge marks of the rope even if the load is near the breaking load of the rope a loading sensor that can measure the loading value applied on the rope is installed at the termination of the static loading device the accuracy of the load measurement is 5 n and the accuracy of the wire transducer is 0 1 mm the loading cell and wire transducer are all calibrated according to the standard calibration procedure suggested by the manufacturer and other elements and devices of the test machine are also checked and verified following strict and professional processes to simulate the mooring rope more reasonably a water cycling system that consists of two water tanks and water pumps is designed and fabricated to make sure that the tested rope be immersed in water during the tests the inner water tank should hold enough water therefore two water pumps are utilized to draw water from the outer tank to make up the outflow from the inner tank in this way the water inflow balances the water outflow and the water cycling system can be operated effectively at the beginning of loading the static element provides a static force to the rope specimen when the force increases to the target value pre set before the experiment the mechanical wheel begins to roll to provide cyclic loading the static element continues to work and adjust to avoid the mean load decreasing during the whole process the mean load and loading amplitude are nearly constant therefore the designed experimental setup can well simulate the working state of mooring ropes in a real water environment more details of the experimental setup can be found in references liu et al 2014 2015 lian et al 2017 2 2 rope specimens to systematically investigate the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes the hmpe ropes with 12 strand construction and the polyester ropes with 3 strand construction are considered as rope specimens due to that hmpe ropes combined with polyester ropes have potential to be utilized as mooring ropes and polyester ropes have already shown excellent mechanical behaviors in engineering vlasblom and bosman 2006 da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 vlasblom et al 2012 lian et al 2015a 2015b both the hmpe and polyester rope samples were provided by jiuli ropes company limited china the rope samples and their constructions are shown in fig 3 the hmpe fiber is dyneema sk75 which was produced by dsm dyneema and the polyester fiber is polyethylene terephthalate which was produced by jiuli ropes company limited the diameter of both rope samples is 0 006 m for hmpe samples the pitch length p and the twist helix angle Î± of the rope component sub rope are equal to 0 04 m and 20 respectively for polyester samples the pitch length p and the twist helix angle Î± of the rope component sub rope are equal to 0 02 m and 33 respectively the whole length of the specimen is 2 4 m the length of splice is 0 3 m and the gauge length which is in the middle of the specimen is 0 3 m this makes sure that the specimen has sufficiently undisturbed measured length to obtain valid test results the minimum breaking load mbl of the hmpe rope is 27 8 kn while the mbl of the polyester rope is 6 8 kn the values of mbl were measured through static tensile tests which repeated five times for each type of materials 3 quantitative method for determining bedding in levels 3 1 effects of bedding in level on the properties of synthetic fiber ropes the 6 mm hmpe and polyester ropes are used as test samples to investigate the effects of bedding in levels on the properties of synthetic fiber ropes including the tension strain curve creep and dynamic stiffness two bedding in cases corresponding to different cyclic loads are designed for hmpe and polyester ropes as respectively listed in tables 2 and 3 in which l m denotes the mean load and l a denotes the loading amplitude the only difference between cases 1 and 2 is the mean load after performing bedding in on the hmpe samples following cases 1 and 2 in table 2 respectively the test samples with two different bedding in levels are subsequently used to carry out static tensile creep and cyclic loading tests respectively the tension strain curves of the samples are presented in fig 4 the creep curves of the samples under the constant load of 35 mbl can also be obtained as presented in fig 5 the curves of dynamic stiffness of the samples under cyclic loading with the mean load of 30 mbl and the loading amplitude of 17 6 mbl are presented in fig 6 where k r denotes the dynamic stiffness this is a non dimensional parameter and defined as the ratio of rope load to strain between the trough and peak loads imposed during cyclic testing american bureau of shipping abs 2011 typically normalized by minimum breaking load mbl similarly the polyester samples with two different bedding in levels by following the cases in table 3 are used to carry out static tensile creep and cyclic loading tests respectively the results are presented in figs 7 9 obviously the slope of the tension strain curve of case 2 is steeper than that of case 1 as seen from figs 4 and 7 the initial creep value of case 2 is smaller than that of case 1 as observed from figs 5 and 8 while the dynamic stiffness of case 2 is larger than that of case 1 as shown in figs 6 and 9 in terms of stiffness evolution during bedding in the tensile load causes the alignment of molecules in the direction of stress resulting in non recoverable residual strain weller et al 2014 note that vu et al 2015 originally revealed that the axial stiffness of the rope should evolve linearly with the coefficient cos Î± 2 where Î± denotes the helix angle of strands sub ropes figs 4 9 show that the test samples with higher bedding in level will have shorter elongation under the same subsequent loading to sum up different bedding in levels can cause different values of strain initial creep and dynamic stiffness for the same test samples it is then necessary to seek a quantitative method for obtaining bedding in levels for synthetic fiber ropes 3 2 quantitative method for determining bedding in levels as stated earlier different guidelines as well as previous research described different bedding in processes for synthetic fiber ropes adopting different bedding in processes will cause different bedding in levels of synthetic fiber ropes and will affect capturing the properties of the ropes and accurate comparison of elongation between the ropes therefore it is necessary to propose a quantitative method for determining bedding in levels for synthetic fiber ropes the constructional stretch is primarily attributed to the bedding in process of ropes and performing static tensile tests is easier and more convenient than doing cyclic or creep tests therefore the tension strain curve is utilized to describe the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes normally rope samples with different bedding in levels will show different tension strain curves under the subsequent stretching force for samples with different bedding in levels if the sample has a higher bedding in level the elongation will get smaller under the same load of subsequent static tensile tests therefore the new rope sample will have the longest elongation while the rope with full bedding in will have the shortest elongation in the subsequent static tensile tests theoretically the quantitative method for determining bedding in levels for rope samples could be realized by measuring the elongation of samples under the same loading in practical operation to conveniently and accurately measure the bedding in levels of rope samples the secant slope of the tension strain curve between 10 and 60 mbl is applied the method is proposed based on the fact that the minimum tension in service at 10 mbl for higher modulus ropes is set to mitigate the axial compression fatigue issue american petroleum institute api 2001 chi et al 2009 and the samples may endure damage if exceeding 60 mbl franÃ§ois and davies 2000 to clarify this quantitative method for measuring the bedding in levels of rope samples the secant slope equation of the tension strain curve is expressed as 1 b Î´ f Î´ Îµ Î´ f Î´ l l 60 m b l 10 m b l Î´ l c Î´ l m l where b denotes the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes which is defined as the secant slope of the tension strain curve for static tensile tests mbl denotes the minimum breaking load kn Î´ f is the relative increment of force between 10 and 60 mbl Î´ Îµ denotes the relative increment of strain corresponding to Î´ f l is the initial length of the rope m Î´ l is the rope elongation m Î´ l c is the rope elongation due to constructional stretch and Î´ l m is the rope elongation due to fiber materials eq 1 reflects the quantitative method for measuring the bedding in level for synthetic fiber ropes different previous loads cause different bedding in levels of synthetic fiber ropes normally if the sample has a higher bedding in level the constructional elongation of the sample gets smaller under the subsequent stretching force and the slope gets steeper if the sample has a full bedding in level and no damage of materials occurs the secant slope will be the largest due to that the constructional elongation is zero under the subsequent tension if the sample has a full bedding in level and damage of materials occurs the breakage of molecular chains the secant slope will get smaller again due to the damage effects 4 experimental procedure for synthetic fiber ropes the detailed experimental procedure in the present investigation can be demonstrated as follows first install the rope sample to the machine note that the eye splice method is used based on the fact that the eye spliced termination can provide reliable experimental data on the other hand the termination of eye splice is usually employed for mooring ropes in real engineering applications mckenna et al 2004 second perform different cyclic loading tests according to the designed cases in order to obtain different bedding in levels of samples to more effectively understand the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes the hmpe samples are first investigated based on the knowledge of bedding in behavior of hmpe ropes experiments of polyester ropes can also be designed third perform static tensile tests and measure the tension elongation curves of samples after completing the bedding in process based on the measured data the secant slope of tension strain curve between 10 and 60 mbl is calculated according to eq 1 as the current bedding in level of the sample note that each test case is carried out at least twice to ensure the repeatability and reliability of the measured data the data acquisition of the measurement system is 9 hz the measured data can be automatically saved by the computer 5 experimental investigation on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes 5 1 experimental cases to investigate the bedding in behavior of hmpe ropes experimental cases are designed as listed in tables 4 6 and a new rope sample is used for each case the shortest loading period that the experimental setup can provide 1 93sec is selected in all experimental cases in order to speedily complete the bedding in process this period may not be relevant for other scale ropes in other applications table 4 is intended to investigate the effect of loading cycles on the bedding in level of hmpe ropes under the conditions of low medium and high stress levels respectively table 5 is designed to investigate the effect of mean load on the bedding in level of hmpe ropes considering three conditions 1 low levels of loading amplitude and loading cycles 2 medium levels of loading amplitude and loading cycles 3 high levels of loading amplitude and loading cycles table 6 is designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on the bedding in level of hmpe ropes considering three conditions 1 low levels of mean load and loading cycles 2 medium levels of mean load and loading cycles 3 high levels of mean load and loading cycles 5 2 experimental results and discussions according to the experimental procedure and cases described above the results of bedding in levels of hmpe ropes for each case are obtained and presented in tables 4 6 as observed from the tables the influential factors of bedding in levels of hmpe ropes include the loading cycles mean load and loading amplitude which will be interpreted and discussed in detail in the following sub sections 5 2 1 effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels in table 4 cases 1 5 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes under the condition of low stress level and the tension strain curves of the subsequent static tensile tests are presented in fig 10 cases 6 10 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading of medium stress level and the tension strain results are presented in fig 11 cases 11 15 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading of high stress level and the tension strain results are presented in fig 12 as observed from figs 10 12 two conclusions can be drawn one is that the bedding in level increases with increasing loading cycles until arriving at the maximum level of the present cyclic loading and then decreases with increasing loading cycles the other is that the maximum bedding in level of the present cyclic loading may be obtained by exerting different cycles for different loading levels for example the bedding in level of hmpe samples under the condition of low stress level increases with loading cycles this means that the maximum bedding in level may be obtained if loading cycles are higher than 10000 the maximum bedding in level of hmpe samples under the condition of medium stress level with loading cycles of 3000 is 40 68 the bedding in level of hmpe samples under the condition of high stress level decreases with loading cycles this means that the maximum bedding in level may be obtained if the loading cycles are lower than 100 or the hmpe sample reveals damage due to overload note that the bedding in level increases with loading cycles if the cycles are within 3000 and the maximum load is smaller than 60 mbl 5 2 2 effect of mean load on bedding in levels in table 5 cases 1 6 are designed to investigate the effect of mean load on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a loading amplitude of 5 7 mbl and loading cycles of 100 and the tension strain curves of the subsequent static tensile tests are presented in fig 13 the maximum bedding in level of hmpe samples is 38 68 under the condition of case 5 whose mean load equals 60 mbl cases 7 12 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a loading amplitude of 9 5 mbl and loading cycles of 500 and the tension strain results are presented in fig 14 the maximum bedding in level of hmpe samples is 40 22 under the condition of case 10 whose mean load equals 50 mbl cases 13 18 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a loading amplitude of 24 8 mbl and loading cycles of 1500 and the tension strain results are presented in fig 15 the maximum bedding in level of hmpe samples is 39 11 under the condition of case 14 whose mean load equals 30 mbl normally the bedding in level of hmpe ropes increases at first and then decreases with the increase of mean load for given loading amplitude and cycles 5 2 3 effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels in table 6 cases 1 4 are designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a mean load of 20 mbl and loading cycles of 100 and the tension strain curves of the subsequent static tensile tests are presented in fig 16 which shows that bedding in level of hmpe ropes increases with the loading amplitude cases 5 8 are designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a mean load of 30 mbl and loading cycles of 500 and the tension strain results are presented in fig 17 which shows the same effect of loading amplitude on the bedding in level as observed in fig 16 cases 9 12 are designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a mean load of 60 mbl and loading cycles of 1500 and the tension strain results are presented in fig 18 which shows that the bedding in level of hmpe ropes decreases with the loading amplitude this means that the damage occurs if the maximum loading value arrives at the damage condition 5 2 4 suggestion of the bedding in procedure to obtain the range of bedding in levels of hmpe ropes the tension strain curves of hmpe ropes after completing cyclic loading as listed in tables 4 6 are all presented in fig 19 besides the tension strain curve of a new hmpe rope without bedding in is also presented in fig 19 in which new rope means the non bedding in rope that has not yet been applied any loading and bedding in rope means the rope sample that has experienced cyclic loading specially for hmpe ropes that exist in a full bedding in state the secant slope would reach the maximum value based on the quantitative method for determining bedding in levels the measured bedding in level of a new hmpe rope is 19 90 which represents the minimum value of the secant slope while the full bedding in level of hmpe samples is 40 68 which represents the maximum value of the secant slope therefore the range of bedding in levels of hmpe samples should be between 19 90 and 40 68 considering that the concept of bedding in is to reduce the constructional stretch and to stabilize the rope length the full bedding in level of hmpe samples can be considered as the ideal bedding in state the proposed bedding in process is then the loading condition corresponding to the maximum value of the secant slope in particular for the hmpe rope samples in the present work a cyclic loading with a mean load of 30 mbl a loading amplitude of 9 5 mbl and loading cycles of 3000 is suggested as the bedding in process from fig 19 it is interesting to note a significant difference between new and bedded in ropes which reveals that the bedding in level is a non linear function of loading amplitude mean load and loading cycles 6 experimental investigation on bedding in levels of polyester ropes 6 1 experimental cases based on the knowledge of the effects of mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles on the bedding in level of hmpe ropes the experimental cases of polyester ropes are also designed to investigate the bedding in behavior as listed in tables 7 9 6 2 experimental results and discussions according to the experimental procedure and cases described above the bedding in levels of polyester ropes are obtained and presented in tables 7 9 in table 7 15 cases are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of polyester ropes under three different stress levels the tension strain curves of the subsequent static tensile tests are presented in figs 20 22 which show that the bedding in level of polyester ropes increases with increasing loading cycles until arriving at the largest bedding in level of current cyclic loading and then decreases with increasing loading cycles in table 8 18 cases are designed to investigate the effect of mean load on bedding in levels of polyester ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with three different loading conditions l a 1 88 m b l n 100 l a 3 37 m b l n 500 l a 38 76 m b l n 1500 the tension strain curves are presented in figs 23 25 which show that the bedding in level of polyester ropes increases at first and then decreases with the increase of mean load in tables 9 and 12 cases are designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels of polyester ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with three different loading conditions l m 20 m b l n 100 l m 30 m b l n 500 l m 60 m b l n 1500 the tension strain curves are presented in figs 26 28 which show that the bedding in level of polyester ropes increases with increasing loading amplitude as observed from the results above the maximum bedding in level of polyester samples is 8 04 under the condition of case 10 in table 8 normally the influential factors of bedding in levels of polyester ropes also include the loading cycles mean load and loading amplitude in general the polyester ropes show similar bedding in phenomena to hmpe ropes 6 3 suggestion of the bedding in procedure to obtain the range of bedding in levels of polyester ropes the tension strain curves of polyester ropes after completing cyclic loading as listed in tables 7 9 are all presented in fig 29 besides the tension strain curve of a new polyester rope without bedding in is presented in fig 29 for polyester ropes that exist in a full bedding in state the secant slope would reach the maximum value based on the quantitative method for determining bedding in levels the measured bedding in level of the new polyester rope is 3 29 which represents the minimum value of the secant slope while the full bedding in level of the polyester samples is 8 04 which represents the maximum value of the secant slope therefore the range of bedding in levels of polyester samples should be between 3 29 and 8 04 considering the concept of bedding in the full bedding in level of polyester samples can be considered as the ideal bedding in state the proposed bedding in process is then the loading condition corresponding to the maximum value of the secant slope in particular for the polyester rope samples in the present work a cyclic loading with a mean load of 50 mbl a loading amplitude of 3 37 mbl and loading cycles of 500 is suggested as the bedding in process similar to hmpe ropes fig 29 shows a significant difference between new and bedded in polyester ropes which reveals again that the bedding in level is a non linear function of loading amplitude mean load and loading cycles 7 empirical expression of bedding in levels for synthetic fiber ropes to estimate reliably and easily the bedding in levels of synthetic fiber ropes an empirical expression is necessary as observed from tables 4 9 the following phenomena can be summarized 1 the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing loading cycles n on condition that the maximum tension l m a x l m l a is smaller than 60 mbl l m a x 60 mbl and the loading cycles n are smaller than 3000 n 3000 2 the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing mean load l m provided that l m a x 60 mbl and n 3000 3 the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing loading amplitude l a on condition that l m a x 60 mbl and n 3000 according to these findings the corresponding bedding in levels of hmpe ropes are utilized which were previously subjected to the cyclic loading with l m a x 60 mbl and n 3000 as listed in table 10 the corresponding bedding in levels of polyester ropes are also used which were previously subjected to the cyclic loading with l m a x 60 mbl and n 3000 as listed in table 11 moreover compared with the bedding in level of new fiber ropes b 0 the normalized bedding in level of fiber ropes b r which is defined as b b 0 is also listed in tables 10 and 11 considering that the bedding in loads should not cause damage to the rope samples and the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes is a function of loading amplitude mean load and loading cycles an empirical expression of the normalized bedding in level that takes into account the three factors is proposed as 2 b r 1 Î² l m Î³ l a Î´ l m l a e x p Îº n where Î² Î³ Î´ and Îº are coefficients related to the material and structure of synthetic fiber ropes l m is the mean load mbl l a is the loading amplitude mbl and n denotes the loading cycles the items Î² l m and Î³ l a mainly reflect that the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing mean load and loading amplitude respectively the last item in eq 2 reflects that the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing loading cycles on condition that the maximum load is smaller than 60 mbl note that the constant item 1 represents the normalized bedding in level of new ropes the normalized bedding in levels of all experimental cases in tables 10 and 11 are used to calibrate the coefficients in eq 2 by using the matlab function n l i n f i t designed to solve constrained nonlinear least square problems values of the coefficients for hmpe and polyester ropes are obtained and listed in table 12 the correlation coefficients between experimental values and computational results of bedding in levels for hmpe and polyester ropes are 0 95 and 0 97 respectively the error analysis indicates that the average relative errors for hmpe and polyester ropes are 3 85 and 2 51 respectively generally there is a good agreement between the measured data and empirical expression as presented in tables 10 and 11 eq 2 is the only empirical expression that can quantitatively evaluate the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes previously subjected to cyclic loading to some extent it reflects the effects of loading history and time dependent property and may help to improve the understanding of the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes note that eq 1 is the basis of eq 2 which provides a quantitative method for measuring the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes with different sizes and types eq 2 is an empirical expression that takes into account the effects of mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles on the normalized bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes theoretically speaking the general form of eq 2 is applicable to any size and any type of synthetic fiber ropes however the coefficients in eq 2 are indeed related to the type construction and size of synthetic fiber ropes the present values of the coefficients as listed in table 12 are based on the experimental data of synthetic fiber ropes with a diameter of 0 006 m and the applicability to large sizes of synthetic fiber ropes needs to be further examined therefore more comprehensive experiments covering more cases and materials are necessary in future to extract more generally applicable coefficients for the proposed empirical expression 8 concluding remarks the bedding in process of synthetic fiber ropes is a necessary procedure in experimental research and engineering applications however the recommended bedding in processes from different guidelines are not consistent and a quantitative method for evaluating the bedding in level is still lacking for synthetic fiber ropes the investigation of the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes is then of great necessity in the present work an experimental setup that can simulate the practical working condition of mooring ropes is developed by utilizing the experimental setup for cyclic loading tests of synthetic fiber ropes the detailed testing procedure and techniques are proposed for investigating the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes a quantitative method for determining the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes is first proposed by utilizing the tension strain curve for static tensile tests based on the essential concept of bedding in this method assures more accurate comparison of elongation data between the ropes for which different guidelines are adopted effects of the loading cycles mean load and loading amplitude on the bedding in level of hmpe and polyester ropes are systematically investigated based on the present work reasonable and different cyclic loadings can be applied to achieve given bedding in levels for hmpe and polyester ropes suggestions of the bedding in procedure for hmpe and polyester ropes are also proposed an empirical expression that takes into account the mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles is first proposed to describe the effects of the three factors upon the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes the comparison between the measured data and empirical expression shows a generally good agreement the present knowledge of determining the bedding in level may help to capture the effects of loading history and failure mechanism of synthetic fiber ropes and to determine the bedding in procedures that are required for the installation of synthetic fiber mooring ropes acknowledgment financial support from the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

23342,the bedding in process of synthetic fiber ropes such as polyester nylon aramid and hmpe is of vital importance to experimental research and engineering application in the present work several important topics are systematically investigated by utilizing an experimental setup for cyclic loading tests of synthetic fiber ropes these topics include the effects of bedding in level on rope properties a quantitative method for determining the bedding in level of ropes and the main factors of influencing the bedding in level first effects of the bedding in level on properties of synthetic fiber ropes are investigated a quantitative method for determining the bedding in level is first proposed by utilizing the tension strain curve of static tensile tests for synthetic fiber ropes based on the concept of bedding in this method is conducive to accurate comparison and evaluation of the elongation data obtained from different guidelines for synthetic fiber mooring ropes second effects of the mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles on the bedding in level of hmpe and polyester ropes are systematically investigated based on measured data the recommended method for determining the bedding in procedure is proposed for synthetic fiber mooring ropes furthermore an empirical expression that takes into account both the mean load loading amplitude and number of loading cycles is proposed which is the only one that can quantitatively evaluate the bedding in level of fiber ropes under previous cyclic loading the present work is of great necessity and benefit to capturing the loading history behavior and failure mechanism of synthetic fiber ropes and also to designing convenient bedding in procedures that are required for the installation of synthetic fiber mooring ropes keywords synthetic fiber rope hmpe polyester mooring rope bedding in experimental investigation 1 introduction synthetic fiber ropes have been proved to be the most suitable substitute for steel wire ropes or chains in deepwater mooring applications over the past two decades due to apparent advantages in terms of cost ease of handling and the ability to reduce peak loadings compared to steel wire ropes or chains banfield and casey 1998 however synthetic fiber ropes show the loading history effect which means that different initial bedding in levels of rope samples have a strong influence on the load strain characteristic the bedding in is the loading process of compaction of internal rope components to reduce the constructional stretch stabilize the rope length and increase rope and termination efficiencies american petroleum institute api 2007 2015 to obtain the representative and reasonable experimental values of synthetic fiber ropes the bedding in procedure is a necessary loading process previous researchers shared their significantly different understandings of the bedding in process del vecchio 1992 used a bedding in loading between 10 and 30 of the breaking load for 1000 cycles before performing experiments on synthetic fiber ropes banfield and casey 1998 concluded that any test procedures should be monitored and recorded to correctly interpret the test results of synthetic fiber ropes because the bedding in effect dramatically changes rope properties bosman and hooker 1999 found that the mean load is the main parameter of determining the dynamic modulus of polyester ropes under the condition that the minimum number of bedding in cycles has to be 10 000 in 1999 researchers of the joint industry project considered that documenting the bedding in process of synthetic fiber ropes is necessary to assure accurate comparison of elongation and stiffness data between ropes and to investigate the failure mechanism of ropes bp 1999 franÃ§ois and davies 2000 found that the permanent elongation of fiber ropes is a combination of rope construction and material elongation they also noted that a range of cyclic loading as small as possible is desirable during the bedding in process casey et al 2000 concluded that once the sample is fully bedded in the dynamic stiffness of ropes remains virtually constant casey and banfield 2002 noticed that almost every cyclic run exhibits a period of bedding in but they did not propose a measurement method for calculating the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes in addition casey and banfield 2003 concluded that many thousands of cycles may be required to achieve full bedding in state of synthetic fiber ropes however due to the high cost of large numbers of cycles in full scale ropes they suggested that 100 cycles may achieve a full bedding in state flory et al 2004 concluded that constructional stretch is caused by the bedding in process davies et al 2006 stated that there is large difference in tension strain curves of static tensile tests between bedded in and new ropes franÃ§ois and davies 2008 held that the bedding in process is a particularly important aspect and quite specific to fiber ropes franÃ§ois et al 2010 concluded that the bedding in process for a mooring line will happen during installation or shortly afterwards for example a bedding in operation of polyester mooring ropes was performed by two anchor handling vessels during installation deandrade and duggal 2010 weller et al 2014 discovered that the bedding in process has a significant effect on the operational performance of synthetic fiber ropes by originally performing harmonic loading tests of nylon ropes with different initial bedding in levels in addition many researchers ghoreishi et al 2007a b vu et al 2015 davies et al 2016 focused on the finite element simulation of complex behaviors of fiber ropes to improve the understanding of rope structures and mechanical elongations these investigations are helpful to understanding the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes it should be pointed out that different guidance notes of synthetic fiber ropes advise different bedding in procedures such as from american petroleum institute api 2007 2015 international standards organization iso 2007 bureau veritas bv 2007 american bureau of shipping abs 2011 and det norske veritas and germanischer lloyd dnvgl 2017 as summarized in table 1 the similarity of these guidelines is that harmonic intervals are proposed to bed in the rope structure stabilize the rope length and increase rope and termination efficiencies note that the loading period of harmonica intervals is not considered as an influential parameter by any guidelines the differences include the initial loading process harmonic interval and creep procedure only bureau veritas bv 2007 and american bureau of shipping abs 2011 require an initial loading process in addition only american bureau of shipping abs 2011 requires a creep procedure after harmonic intervals obviously different guidelines for offshore synthetic fiber ropes define different bedding in processes this means that the bedding in process is indeed not a unified suggestion even though the bedding in process suggested by the international standards organization iso 2007 is now widely adopted the effects of the bedding in process from different guidelines on the behavior of synthetic fiber ropes need to be further explored to sum up the survey of current research reveals that the experimental investigations of the bedding in level are significant not only for installing synthetic fiber ropes in practical engineering but also for capturing the mechanical behavior of synthetic fiber ropes however there are still questions that need to be further clarified a because different guidance notes of synthetic fiber ropes proposed different bedding in procedures accurate comparison of elongation and stiffness between ropes becomes difficult b previous research lacks introducing the measurement of bedding in level and a quantitative equation to describe the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes c the relevance of the lab tests to engineering applications in the aspect of bedding in processes of synthetic fiber ropes is insufficiently established the present study aims to answer the questions above based on the essential concept of bedding in for synthetic fiber ropes experimental investigations of hmpe and polyester ropes are systematically performed utilizing an experimental setup for cyclic loading tests of synthetic fiber ropes to begin with effects of the bedding in level on properties of hmpe ropes are investigated then a method for quantitatively determining the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes is proposed by utilizing the tension strain curve of static tensile tests for synthetic fiber ropes based on the test results the bedding in suggestions of hmpe and polyester ropes are proposed an empirical expression that accounts for the mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles is also proposed to describe the factors upon bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes the present work is of great necessity and benefit to capturing the loading history behavior and failure mechanism of synthetic fiber ropes and also to designing convenient bedding in procedures that are required for the installation of synthetic fiber mooring ropes 2 experimental setup and rope specimens 2 1 experimental setup for synthetic fiber ropes the experimental setup is made up of four parts i e the loading elements the equipment foundation the rope measurement system and the water cycling system as shown in fig 1 the loading elements include the dynamic loading and static loading components the maximum capacity of static loading is 60 kn while the corresponding capacity of dynamic loading is 50 kn the equipment foundation is designed to make the experimental setup be easily installed in the laboratory the rope measurement system includes the rope elongation and the loading measurement systems the rope elongation measurement system consists of a wire transducer and two axletrees as shown in fig 2 these axletrees are installed above the outer water tank there are two sliding blocks on axletrees one serves as the base for the wire transducer and the other is used to fix the wire two specially designed clamps installed under the sliding blocks are used to calibrate the test region these clamps can be reliably fixed on the gauge marks of the rope even if the load is near the breaking load of the rope a loading sensor that can measure the loading value applied on the rope is installed at the termination of the static loading device the accuracy of the load measurement is 5 n and the accuracy of the wire transducer is 0 1 mm the loading cell and wire transducer are all calibrated according to the standard calibration procedure suggested by the manufacturer and other elements and devices of the test machine are also checked and verified following strict and professional processes to simulate the mooring rope more reasonably a water cycling system that consists of two water tanks and water pumps is designed and fabricated to make sure that the tested rope be immersed in water during the tests the inner water tank should hold enough water therefore two water pumps are utilized to draw water from the outer tank to make up the outflow from the inner tank in this way the water inflow balances the water outflow and the water cycling system can be operated effectively at the beginning of loading the static element provides a static force to the rope specimen when the force increases to the target value pre set before the experiment the mechanical wheel begins to roll to provide cyclic loading the static element continues to work and adjust to avoid the mean load decreasing during the whole process the mean load and loading amplitude are nearly constant therefore the designed experimental setup can well simulate the working state of mooring ropes in a real water environment more details of the experimental setup can be found in references liu et al 2014 2015 lian et al 2017 2 2 rope specimens to systematically investigate the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes the hmpe ropes with 12 strand construction and the polyester ropes with 3 strand construction are considered as rope specimens due to that hmpe ropes combined with polyester ropes have potential to be utilized as mooring ropes and polyester ropes have already shown excellent mechanical behaviors in engineering vlasblom and bosman 2006 da costa mattos and chimisso 2011 vlasblom et al 2012 lian et al 2015a 2015b both the hmpe and polyester rope samples were provided by jiuli ropes company limited china the rope samples and their constructions are shown in fig 3 the hmpe fiber is dyneema sk75 which was produced by dsm dyneema and the polyester fiber is polyethylene terephthalate which was produced by jiuli ropes company limited the diameter of both rope samples is 0 006 m for hmpe samples the pitch length p and the twist helix angle Î± of the rope component sub rope are equal to 0 04 m and 20 respectively for polyester samples the pitch length p and the twist helix angle Î± of the rope component sub rope are equal to 0 02 m and 33 respectively the whole length of the specimen is 2 4 m the length of splice is 0 3 m and the gauge length which is in the middle of the specimen is 0 3 m this makes sure that the specimen has sufficiently undisturbed measured length to obtain valid test results the minimum breaking load mbl of the hmpe rope is 27 8 kn while the mbl of the polyester rope is 6 8 kn the values of mbl were measured through static tensile tests which repeated five times for each type of materials 3 quantitative method for determining bedding in levels 3 1 effects of bedding in level on the properties of synthetic fiber ropes the 6 mm hmpe and polyester ropes are used as test samples to investigate the effects of bedding in levels on the properties of synthetic fiber ropes including the tension strain curve creep and dynamic stiffness two bedding in cases corresponding to different cyclic loads are designed for hmpe and polyester ropes as respectively listed in tables 2 and 3 in which l m denotes the mean load and l a denotes the loading amplitude the only difference between cases 1 and 2 is the mean load after performing bedding in on the hmpe samples following cases 1 and 2 in table 2 respectively the test samples with two different bedding in levels are subsequently used to carry out static tensile creep and cyclic loading tests respectively the tension strain curves of the samples are presented in fig 4 the creep curves of the samples under the constant load of 35 mbl can also be obtained as presented in fig 5 the curves of dynamic stiffness of the samples under cyclic loading with the mean load of 30 mbl and the loading amplitude of 17 6 mbl are presented in fig 6 where k r denotes the dynamic stiffness this is a non dimensional parameter and defined as the ratio of rope load to strain between the trough and peak loads imposed during cyclic testing american bureau of shipping abs 2011 typically normalized by minimum breaking load mbl similarly the polyester samples with two different bedding in levels by following the cases in table 3 are used to carry out static tensile creep and cyclic loading tests respectively the results are presented in figs 7 9 obviously the slope of the tension strain curve of case 2 is steeper than that of case 1 as seen from figs 4 and 7 the initial creep value of case 2 is smaller than that of case 1 as observed from figs 5 and 8 while the dynamic stiffness of case 2 is larger than that of case 1 as shown in figs 6 and 9 in terms of stiffness evolution during bedding in the tensile load causes the alignment of molecules in the direction of stress resulting in non recoverable residual strain weller et al 2014 note that vu et al 2015 originally revealed that the axial stiffness of the rope should evolve linearly with the coefficient cos Î± 2 where Î± denotes the helix angle of strands sub ropes figs 4 9 show that the test samples with higher bedding in level will have shorter elongation under the same subsequent loading to sum up different bedding in levels can cause different values of strain initial creep and dynamic stiffness for the same test samples it is then necessary to seek a quantitative method for obtaining bedding in levels for synthetic fiber ropes 3 2 quantitative method for determining bedding in levels as stated earlier different guidelines as well as previous research described different bedding in processes for synthetic fiber ropes adopting different bedding in processes will cause different bedding in levels of synthetic fiber ropes and will affect capturing the properties of the ropes and accurate comparison of elongation between the ropes therefore it is necessary to propose a quantitative method for determining bedding in levels for synthetic fiber ropes the constructional stretch is primarily attributed to the bedding in process of ropes and performing static tensile tests is easier and more convenient than doing cyclic or creep tests therefore the tension strain curve is utilized to describe the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes normally rope samples with different bedding in levels will show different tension strain curves under the subsequent stretching force for samples with different bedding in levels if the sample has a higher bedding in level the elongation will get smaller under the same load of subsequent static tensile tests therefore the new rope sample will have the longest elongation while the rope with full bedding in will have the shortest elongation in the subsequent static tensile tests theoretically the quantitative method for determining bedding in levels for rope samples could be realized by measuring the elongation of samples under the same loading in practical operation to conveniently and accurately measure the bedding in levels of rope samples the secant slope of the tension strain curve between 10 and 60 mbl is applied the method is proposed based on the fact that the minimum tension in service at 10 mbl for higher modulus ropes is set to mitigate the axial compression fatigue issue american petroleum institute api 2001 chi et al 2009 and the samples may endure damage if exceeding 60 mbl franÃ§ois and davies 2000 to clarify this quantitative method for measuring the bedding in levels of rope samples the secant slope equation of the tension strain curve is expressed as 1 b Î´ f Î´ Îµ Î´ f Î´ l l 60 m b l 10 m b l Î´ l c Î´ l m l where b denotes the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes which is defined as the secant slope of the tension strain curve for static tensile tests mbl denotes the minimum breaking load kn Î´ f is the relative increment of force between 10 and 60 mbl Î´ Îµ denotes the relative increment of strain corresponding to Î´ f l is the initial length of the rope m Î´ l is the rope elongation m Î´ l c is the rope elongation due to constructional stretch and Î´ l m is the rope elongation due to fiber materials eq 1 reflects the quantitative method for measuring the bedding in level for synthetic fiber ropes different previous loads cause different bedding in levels of synthetic fiber ropes normally if the sample has a higher bedding in level the constructional elongation of the sample gets smaller under the subsequent stretching force and the slope gets steeper if the sample has a full bedding in level and no damage of materials occurs the secant slope will be the largest due to that the constructional elongation is zero under the subsequent tension if the sample has a full bedding in level and damage of materials occurs the breakage of molecular chains the secant slope will get smaller again due to the damage effects 4 experimental procedure for synthetic fiber ropes the detailed experimental procedure in the present investigation can be demonstrated as follows first install the rope sample to the machine note that the eye splice method is used based on the fact that the eye spliced termination can provide reliable experimental data on the other hand the termination of eye splice is usually employed for mooring ropes in real engineering applications mckenna et al 2004 second perform different cyclic loading tests according to the designed cases in order to obtain different bedding in levels of samples to more effectively understand the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes the hmpe samples are first investigated based on the knowledge of bedding in behavior of hmpe ropes experiments of polyester ropes can also be designed third perform static tensile tests and measure the tension elongation curves of samples after completing the bedding in process based on the measured data the secant slope of tension strain curve between 10 and 60 mbl is calculated according to eq 1 as the current bedding in level of the sample note that each test case is carried out at least twice to ensure the repeatability and reliability of the measured data the data acquisition of the measurement system is 9 hz the measured data can be automatically saved by the computer 5 experimental investigation on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes 5 1 experimental cases to investigate the bedding in behavior of hmpe ropes experimental cases are designed as listed in tables 4 6 and a new rope sample is used for each case the shortest loading period that the experimental setup can provide 1 93sec is selected in all experimental cases in order to speedily complete the bedding in process this period may not be relevant for other scale ropes in other applications table 4 is intended to investigate the effect of loading cycles on the bedding in level of hmpe ropes under the conditions of low medium and high stress levels respectively table 5 is designed to investigate the effect of mean load on the bedding in level of hmpe ropes considering three conditions 1 low levels of loading amplitude and loading cycles 2 medium levels of loading amplitude and loading cycles 3 high levels of loading amplitude and loading cycles table 6 is designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on the bedding in level of hmpe ropes considering three conditions 1 low levels of mean load and loading cycles 2 medium levels of mean load and loading cycles 3 high levels of mean load and loading cycles 5 2 experimental results and discussions according to the experimental procedure and cases described above the results of bedding in levels of hmpe ropes for each case are obtained and presented in tables 4 6 as observed from the tables the influential factors of bedding in levels of hmpe ropes include the loading cycles mean load and loading amplitude which will be interpreted and discussed in detail in the following sub sections 5 2 1 effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels in table 4 cases 1 5 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes under the condition of low stress level and the tension strain curves of the subsequent static tensile tests are presented in fig 10 cases 6 10 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading of medium stress level and the tension strain results are presented in fig 11 cases 11 15 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading of high stress level and the tension strain results are presented in fig 12 as observed from figs 10 12 two conclusions can be drawn one is that the bedding in level increases with increasing loading cycles until arriving at the maximum level of the present cyclic loading and then decreases with increasing loading cycles the other is that the maximum bedding in level of the present cyclic loading may be obtained by exerting different cycles for different loading levels for example the bedding in level of hmpe samples under the condition of low stress level increases with loading cycles this means that the maximum bedding in level may be obtained if loading cycles are higher than 10000 the maximum bedding in level of hmpe samples under the condition of medium stress level with loading cycles of 3000 is 40 68 the bedding in level of hmpe samples under the condition of high stress level decreases with loading cycles this means that the maximum bedding in level may be obtained if the loading cycles are lower than 100 or the hmpe sample reveals damage due to overload note that the bedding in level increases with loading cycles if the cycles are within 3000 and the maximum load is smaller than 60 mbl 5 2 2 effect of mean load on bedding in levels in table 5 cases 1 6 are designed to investigate the effect of mean load on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a loading amplitude of 5 7 mbl and loading cycles of 100 and the tension strain curves of the subsequent static tensile tests are presented in fig 13 the maximum bedding in level of hmpe samples is 38 68 under the condition of case 5 whose mean load equals 60 mbl cases 7 12 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a loading amplitude of 9 5 mbl and loading cycles of 500 and the tension strain results are presented in fig 14 the maximum bedding in level of hmpe samples is 40 22 under the condition of case 10 whose mean load equals 50 mbl cases 13 18 are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a loading amplitude of 24 8 mbl and loading cycles of 1500 and the tension strain results are presented in fig 15 the maximum bedding in level of hmpe samples is 39 11 under the condition of case 14 whose mean load equals 30 mbl normally the bedding in level of hmpe ropes increases at first and then decreases with the increase of mean load for given loading amplitude and cycles 5 2 3 effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels in table 6 cases 1 4 are designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a mean load of 20 mbl and loading cycles of 100 and the tension strain curves of the subsequent static tensile tests are presented in fig 16 which shows that bedding in level of hmpe ropes increases with the loading amplitude cases 5 8 are designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a mean load of 30 mbl and loading cycles of 500 and the tension strain results are presented in fig 17 which shows the same effect of loading amplitude on the bedding in level as observed in fig 16 cases 9 12 are designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels of hmpe ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with a mean load of 60 mbl and loading cycles of 1500 and the tension strain results are presented in fig 18 which shows that the bedding in level of hmpe ropes decreases with the loading amplitude this means that the damage occurs if the maximum loading value arrives at the damage condition 5 2 4 suggestion of the bedding in procedure to obtain the range of bedding in levels of hmpe ropes the tension strain curves of hmpe ropes after completing cyclic loading as listed in tables 4 6 are all presented in fig 19 besides the tension strain curve of a new hmpe rope without bedding in is also presented in fig 19 in which new rope means the non bedding in rope that has not yet been applied any loading and bedding in rope means the rope sample that has experienced cyclic loading specially for hmpe ropes that exist in a full bedding in state the secant slope would reach the maximum value based on the quantitative method for determining bedding in levels the measured bedding in level of a new hmpe rope is 19 90 which represents the minimum value of the secant slope while the full bedding in level of hmpe samples is 40 68 which represents the maximum value of the secant slope therefore the range of bedding in levels of hmpe samples should be between 19 90 and 40 68 considering that the concept of bedding in is to reduce the constructional stretch and to stabilize the rope length the full bedding in level of hmpe samples can be considered as the ideal bedding in state the proposed bedding in process is then the loading condition corresponding to the maximum value of the secant slope in particular for the hmpe rope samples in the present work a cyclic loading with a mean load of 30 mbl a loading amplitude of 9 5 mbl and loading cycles of 3000 is suggested as the bedding in process from fig 19 it is interesting to note a significant difference between new and bedded in ropes which reveals that the bedding in level is a non linear function of loading amplitude mean load and loading cycles 6 experimental investigation on bedding in levels of polyester ropes 6 1 experimental cases based on the knowledge of the effects of mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles on the bedding in level of hmpe ropes the experimental cases of polyester ropes are also designed to investigate the bedding in behavior as listed in tables 7 9 6 2 experimental results and discussions according to the experimental procedure and cases described above the bedding in levels of polyester ropes are obtained and presented in tables 7 9 in table 7 15 cases are designed to investigate the effect of loading cycles on bedding in levels of polyester ropes under three different stress levels the tension strain curves of the subsequent static tensile tests are presented in figs 20 22 which show that the bedding in level of polyester ropes increases with increasing loading cycles until arriving at the largest bedding in level of current cyclic loading and then decreases with increasing loading cycles in table 8 18 cases are designed to investigate the effect of mean load on bedding in levels of polyester ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with three different loading conditions l a 1 88 m b l n 100 l a 3 37 m b l n 500 l a 38 76 m b l n 1500 the tension strain curves are presented in figs 23 25 which show that the bedding in level of polyester ropes increases at first and then decreases with the increase of mean load in tables 9 and 12 cases are designed to investigate the effect of loading amplitude on bedding in levels of polyester ropes subjected to the cyclic loading with three different loading conditions l m 20 m b l n 100 l m 30 m b l n 500 l m 60 m b l n 1500 the tension strain curves are presented in figs 26 28 which show that the bedding in level of polyester ropes increases with increasing loading amplitude as observed from the results above the maximum bedding in level of polyester samples is 8 04 under the condition of case 10 in table 8 normally the influential factors of bedding in levels of polyester ropes also include the loading cycles mean load and loading amplitude in general the polyester ropes show similar bedding in phenomena to hmpe ropes 6 3 suggestion of the bedding in procedure to obtain the range of bedding in levels of polyester ropes the tension strain curves of polyester ropes after completing cyclic loading as listed in tables 7 9 are all presented in fig 29 besides the tension strain curve of a new polyester rope without bedding in is presented in fig 29 for polyester ropes that exist in a full bedding in state the secant slope would reach the maximum value based on the quantitative method for determining bedding in levels the measured bedding in level of the new polyester rope is 3 29 which represents the minimum value of the secant slope while the full bedding in level of the polyester samples is 8 04 which represents the maximum value of the secant slope therefore the range of bedding in levels of polyester samples should be between 3 29 and 8 04 considering the concept of bedding in the full bedding in level of polyester samples can be considered as the ideal bedding in state the proposed bedding in process is then the loading condition corresponding to the maximum value of the secant slope in particular for the polyester rope samples in the present work a cyclic loading with a mean load of 50 mbl a loading amplitude of 3 37 mbl and loading cycles of 500 is suggested as the bedding in process similar to hmpe ropes fig 29 shows a significant difference between new and bedded in polyester ropes which reveals again that the bedding in level is a non linear function of loading amplitude mean load and loading cycles 7 empirical expression of bedding in levels for synthetic fiber ropes to estimate reliably and easily the bedding in levels of synthetic fiber ropes an empirical expression is necessary as observed from tables 4 9 the following phenomena can be summarized 1 the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing loading cycles n on condition that the maximum tension l m a x l m l a is smaller than 60 mbl l m a x 60 mbl and the loading cycles n are smaller than 3000 n 3000 2 the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing mean load l m provided that l m a x 60 mbl and n 3000 3 the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing loading amplitude l a on condition that l m a x 60 mbl and n 3000 according to these findings the corresponding bedding in levels of hmpe ropes are utilized which were previously subjected to the cyclic loading with l m a x 60 mbl and n 3000 as listed in table 10 the corresponding bedding in levels of polyester ropes are also used which were previously subjected to the cyclic loading with l m a x 60 mbl and n 3000 as listed in table 11 moreover compared with the bedding in level of new fiber ropes b 0 the normalized bedding in level of fiber ropes b r which is defined as b b 0 is also listed in tables 10 and 11 considering that the bedding in loads should not cause damage to the rope samples and the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes is a function of loading amplitude mean load and loading cycles an empirical expression of the normalized bedding in level that takes into account the three factors is proposed as 2 b r 1 Î² l m Î³ l a Î´ l m l a e x p Îº n where Î² Î³ Î´ and Îº are coefficients related to the material and structure of synthetic fiber ropes l m is the mean load mbl l a is the loading amplitude mbl and n denotes the loading cycles the items Î² l m and Î³ l a mainly reflect that the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing mean load and loading amplitude respectively the last item in eq 2 reflects that the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes increases with increasing loading cycles on condition that the maximum load is smaller than 60 mbl note that the constant item 1 represents the normalized bedding in level of new ropes the normalized bedding in levels of all experimental cases in tables 10 and 11 are used to calibrate the coefficients in eq 2 by using the matlab function n l i n f i t designed to solve constrained nonlinear least square problems values of the coefficients for hmpe and polyester ropes are obtained and listed in table 12 the correlation coefficients between experimental values and computational results of bedding in levels for hmpe and polyester ropes are 0 95 and 0 97 respectively the error analysis indicates that the average relative errors for hmpe and polyester ropes are 3 85 and 2 51 respectively generally there is a good agreement between the measured data and empirical expression as presented in tables 10 and 11 eq 2 is the only empirical expression that can quantitatively evaluate the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes previously subjected to cyclic loading to some extent it reflects the effects of loading history and time dependent property and may help to improve the understanding of the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes note that eq 1 is the basis of eq 2 which provides a quantitative method for measuring the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes with different sizes and types eq 2 is an empirical expression that takes into account the effects of mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles on the normalized bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes theoretically speaking the general form of eq 2 is applicable to any size and any type of synthetic fiber ropes however the coefficients in eq 2 are indeed related to the type construction and size of synthetic fiber ropes the present values of the coefficients as listed in table 12 are based on the experimental data of synthetic fiber ropes with a diameter of 0 006 m and the applicability to large sizes of synthetic fiber ropes needs to be further examined therefore more comprehensive experiments covering more cases and materials are necessary in future to extract more generally applicable coefficients for the proposed empirical expression 8 concluding remarks the bedding in process of synthetic fiber ropes is a necessary procedure in experimental research and engineering applications however the recommended bedding in processes from different guidelines are not consistent and a quantitative method for evaluating the bedding in level is still lacking for synthetic fiber ropes the investigation of the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes is then of great necessity in the present work an experimental setup that can simulate the practical working condition of mooring ropes is developed by utilizing the experimental setup for cyclic loading tests of synthetic fiber ropes the detailed testing procedure and techniques are proposed for investigating the bedding in behavior of synthetic fiber ropes a quantitative method for determining the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes is first proposed by utilizing the tension strain curve for static tensile tests based on the essential concept of bedding in this method assures more accurate comparison of elongation data between the ropes for which different guidelines are adopted effects of the loading cycles mean load and loading amplitude on the bedding in level of hmpe and polyester ropes are systematically investigated based on the present work reasonable and different cyclic loadings can be applied to achieve given bedding in levels for hmpe and polyester ropes suggestions of the bedding in procedure for hmpe and polyester ropes are also proposed an empirical expression that takes into account the mean load loading amplitude and loading cycles is first proposed to describe the effects of the three factors upon the bedding in level of synthetic fiber ropes the comparison between the measured data and empirical expression shows a generally good agreement the present knowledge of determining the bedding in level may help to capture the effects of loading history and failure mechanism of synthetic fiber ropes and to determine the bedding in procedures that are required for the installation of synthetic fiber mooring ropes acknowledgment financial support from the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

23343,digital fringe projection profilometry fpp was used to study the mechanical behavior and failure mode of an i shaped stiffened panel of carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp composites subjected to axial compression the fabrication process of the i type stiffened cfrp panel is described in this paper a special fixture was designed and fabricated to apply a compressive load to the cfrp panel furthermore strain gauges and the fpp technique were used to monitor the failure process of the panel when compressed strain measurement results revealed that a bifurcation phenomenon appeared on the panel surface moreover full field deflection results indicate that local skin buckling occurs on the stiffened cfrp panel which can be used to explain the strain bifurcation results from the experiment show that the design and fabrication process of the stiffened panel is reasonable and can be used to study the failure mechanism of stiffened cfrp panel keywords i type stiffened cfrp panel fringe projection profilometry compressive loading buckling 1 introduction demands for high performance lightweight multi functional and low cost modern aircraft ship and automobile have led to the rapid developments of fiber reinforced composite panels reinforced composites are widely used in m i and l shaped stringers and multi walled grid structures the skin of reinforced composites can be made up of multiple layers of fiber reinforced composite laminates or sandwich panels high performance carbon fiber glass fiber and aramid fiber kassapoglou 2013 njuguna 2016 these lightweight grid composite panels are usually found in the vertical tail stabilizer and wing of modern aircraft furthermore they also appear in the deck bottom and surface shells of ships and offshore platforms as well as in the chassis and cockpit of transport cars brooks et al 2017 the use of parts made from fiber reinforced composite is becoming a key factor in high performance aircraft ships automotive and other industrial equipment stiffened cfrp panels found in industrial equipment are often prone to buckling under the influence of compression shearing and thermal load during service different buckling modes will appear at different loading stages vasiliev and morozov 2013 sastry et al 2015 these bucklings appear to be more complex especially for panels found in aircraft due to fatigue and damage resulting from long term flight service furthermore these bucklings will promote local damage such as fiber breakage matrix cracking delamination debonding and other complex interlayer damage wang et al 2015 during the design stage various types of stringers are usually added to increase buckling resistance of composite panels to compression loading however a mismatch in stiffness between the stringers and the skin of composite panels can lead to premature debonding of the stringer skin interface zhu et al 2015 kumar and singh 2010 it is important to ascertain the structural integrity and design of the stiffened cfrp panel because the structural failure load is directly related to the failure mode of the panels abramovich and bisagni 2015 moreover the failure mode is related to the stiffness ratio of stringer skin and the initial defects such as damage and delamination yap et al 2002 orifici et al 2008 axial compression experimental tests and theoretical calculations are important for understanding the failure behavior of composite stiffened panels the failure behavior under axial compression involves structural buckling and post buckling mo et al 2015 in addition there is a growing interest in the complex mechanical behaviors of failure in stiffened panels such as delamination damage extension and buckling due to manufacturing defects or impacts huang et al 2015 jin et al 2015 the process used in producing stiffened panels is important to the type of defect suffered by the panels for example studies have linked different forming processes of stiffened cfrp panels to the likely defect modes of the panels under blasting or impacting process kolanu et al 2016 moreover during the load bearing process the local buckling with the convex concave waves gradually appears in the skin between the longitudinal beams of stiffened panel the local severe buckling of the skin is an important factor that causes the ultimate failure of the panel therefore a detailed buckling behavior monitoring is necessary to examine the stiffened cfrp panel under specific forming process and specific stringers data obtained through experiments are useful for understanding the failure mechanism and process these data can also be used for correcting numerical analysis and design theory of the stiffened cfrp panel ibrahim et al 2016 in this paper the preparation process of an i shaped stiffened cfrp panel is introduced and experiments conducted to examine the different failure modes under compression are described strain gauges were used to monitor the local buckling of the stiffened cfrp panel during compression loading the fpp technique was used to capture the deflection of the cfrp stiffened panel as well as to determine the formation process of buckling this study is important to understand the deformation process and failure behavior of stiffened panel under compression 2 experiments 2 1 specimen preparation as shown in fig 1 the i shaped stiffened cfrp panel is 530 mm length 405 mm width 1 5 mm thickness three i shaped stringers are distributed equally along the longitudinal direction of the panel the stringer height is 41 mm from the skin surface and is composed of the upper edge lower edge and vertical strips the dimensions of the upper edge lower edge and vertical strips are 24 mm width 3 38 mm thickness 52 mm width 1 69 mm thickness and a thickness of 3 38 mm respectively during the preparation of the i shaped stringer the upper edge strip s1 the lower edge strip s2 and the vertical strip s3 were all cut with a carbon fiber prepreg to ensure the size and straightness of the stringer as shown in fig 2 the strips of s1 s2 and s3 were combined and laid in a steel core mold in which the r zone voids were filled with carbon fibers the left and right steel core molds were used to precisely locate the axial position of the stringers on the skin and to control the overall dimensions of the stringers furthermore the sample was compacted in a vacuum environment and before being trimmed to the theoretical dimensions finally the sample was packaged and installed on the skin cover plate for co curing in an autoclave the ends of the stiffened panel were secured with steel frames casting covered with epoxy resin fig 3 to protect the stiffened panel from damage at the ends during the axial compression in the manufacturing process of the i shaped stiffened panel the deviation factors that influence the geometric precision of the panel can be classified into two aspects one aspect involves the overall deviation of the axial position of the stringers the thickness deviation of the skin and stringers and the section deflection of the stringers in addition the other aspect has to do with resin thermal expansion and chemical shrinkage in the curing process which can lead to residual stress and residual deformation due to solidification 2 2 fixture description at present for the compression test of fiber reinforced composite stiffened panel there is no experimental specification for fixture design in this study the compressive experiment on the i shaped stiffened cfrp panel was conducted in a self made fixture as shown in fig 4 a trapezoidal loading head which was fixed to a four column testing machine can gradually transfer the compressive load the specimen was fixed between a pair of rigid blocks in the middle of the fixture to ensure symmetrical compression both sides of the specimen were supported using bolts to simulate simply supported boundary conditions the two sides of the stiffened plate are restrained by lateral bolts during the compressive process which can prevent the small lateral displacement of the panel moreover the loading alignment can be realized easily by adjusting the bottom bolts of the fixture which can also correct little initial deformation due to manufacturing process 2 3 experimental setup the specimen was loaded with a four column testing machine css 100t changchun tester co with a maximum loading capacity of 1000 kn as shown in fig 5 the compressive experiment was carried out along the axial direction force and displacement sensors were used to record the axial load and displacement respectively six pairs of strain gauges were distributed symmetrically on both the front and rear of the skin to monitor the magnitude of surface deformation in the loading history as show in fig 1 the uppercase letters a b c d e f and the lowercase letters a b c d e f represent the strain gauges pasted on the front and back of the panel respectively for example two back to back strain gauges in the same position of panel are denoted as a a the direction strain gauges are aligned in parallel to the stringers in the study the main purposes of the electrical gauge measurement have the following aspects at first during the specimen installation and preloading the loading alignment can be monitored easily by the enough strain data of gauges second the validity of the optical measurement can be verified by comparing with the experimental data furthermore the multi frequency fringe patterns were projected onto the front of the specimen using a projector tlp x2000 3lcd with a projection and shooting rate of 4 fps the resulting images from the projections were sequentially collected by a ccd camera guppy f 080b to measure the full field deflection 2 4 optical measurement furutani et al 1997 proposed a space encoding method using 256 sub spaces by 4 gy level patterns projected onto object for 3d profile measurement but the measurement accuracy is approximately 0 5 mm for a measurement area of 160 mm 130 mm the measurement accuracy can be improved by adopting sinusoidal fringe patterns or phase measuring algorithms feng et al 2015 steffen et al 2015 a multi frequency fpp technique used in our experiment has an accuracy of approximately 0 5 mm for the specimen surface area of 405 mm 530 mm in the ideal case the response function of a camera and projector is linear however when a sine fringe pattern is projected onto an object surface a distorted fringe can be expressed as 1 i n a b cos 2 Ï f Ï Î´ n where the constants a and b represent the background light and the intensity modulation respectively f is the spatial frequency of the fringe pattern projected onto the reference plane Ï is the fringe phase caused by the height h of the corresponding object and Î´ n is the phase shift in a four step phase shifting method ps the phase shift is Î´ n 0 Ï 2 Ï and 3Ï 2 n 1 2 3 4 respectively four sine fringe patterns are projected onto the object surface as shown in fig 6 phase calculation is performed on four adjacent images in a series of acquired images to obtain the wrapped phase Ï w as lei et al 2012 2 Ï w w r a p Ï tan 1 i 4 i 2 i 1 i 3 where the intensity images of i 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 correspond to the phase shifts of 0 Ï 2 Ï and 3Ï 2 respectively wrap is a wrapping function and the wrapped phase Ï w has a value in the range of Ï Ï using atan2 function as shown in eq 2 a linear calibration relationship between the phase and the height is relatively simple but the position relationship between the projector and the camera is strict jia et al 2005 if the layout of the projector and the camera is arbitrary the calibration process is relatively complicated du and wang 2007 zhang 2016 in our experiment a relationship between the phase difference and the object height is a known invariant which can be written in the series of 3 h k 0 a k Î´ Ï k the above relationship can be calibrated from the mapping data between the known height and the measured phase difference the k 1 unknowns a 0 a 1 and a k can be determined by least squares method from a series of height data obtained from a calibrated block with known height in practice a phase unwrapping algorithm is used to obtain the object phase Ï for a discontinuous surface a multi frequency phase unwrapping mpu method can be used to avoid error propagation related to neighboring pixels huntley and saldner 1993 zuo et al 2016 several sets of phase shifted fringe patterns with different fringe frequencies are projected onto the object surface and the wrapped phase Ï i w at the corresponding fringe frequency f i is obtained by the ps method thus the unwrapped phase Ï i at the corresponding fringe frequency f i is written as 4 Ï i Ï i w i n t Ï j f i f j Ï i w 2 Ï 2 Ï where the superscript w represents a wrap operator and int is the rounding function the unwrapped phases of Ï i and Ï j correspond to the fringe frequencies of f i and f j respectively it is noted that the unwrapped phase Ï 1 is equal to the wrapped phase Ï 1 w when the fringe frequency is f 1 1 as such no further phase unwrapping is required as the phase accuracy for the fringe frequency f 1 is insufficient the actual fringe frequency f i needs to be further increased in the dynamic measurement it is the best way to reduce the number of projected patterns according to the ref towers et al 2005 ding et al 2015 three kinds of projection grating frequency were designed and the 3d topography of discontinuities was measured in theory the dual frequency scheme is the minimum number of images used in the fpp ding et al 2012 but the reliability and accuracy are not high in the actual application zuo et al 2012 presented a novel four pattern strategy for recovering absolute phase and measuring spatially isolated objects this method uses two Ï 2 phase shifted sinusoidal patterns and two linear increasing decreasing ramp patterns to reconstruct the 3 d profile for multiply objects in this experiment we designed five sets of phase shifted fringe patterns with different fringe frequencies of f i i 1 4 16 64 and 128 which were projected onto the i shape stiffened cfrp panel in turns the camera collected the distorted fringe images sequentially as shown in fig 6a 6 e then the ps method in eq 2 was used to obtain the wrapped phase for each fringe frequency as shown in fig 6f 6 j when the fringe frequency is f 1 the unwrapping phase Ï 1 fig 6k equals to its corresponding wrapped phase Ï 1 w fig 6f however when the fringe frequency is f 4 the unwrapped phase Ï 4 fig 6l is calculated by the mpu method in eq 4 from the combined wrapped phase Ï 4 w fig 6g with the unwrapped phase Ï 1 fig 6k this is similar to the next higher fringe frequency where only the most accurate unwrapping phase Ï 128 fig 6o is required for the actual measurement 3 results and discussions 3 1 load history fig 7 shows the load time curve the load is shown to increase linearly with time with a loading displacement rate of 0 2 mm min the maximum compression load was approximately 493 kn during the whole loading process 3 2 strain analysis fig 8 describes the strain time curves of the strain gauges affixed to the skin of the stiffened panel importantly a strain bifurcation occurs on the surface of the panel when the experiment was carried out for approximately 5 min the strain at some locations was negative the observed strain bifurcation can be explained by the local buckling convex and or concave exhibited by the stiffened panel at different locations the local buckling can be detected effectively by the observed strain bifurcation moreover the local buckling mode is evolving and the buckling positions are also changing with the increase of the load but the positions of the gauges are fixed so only one certain order of bucking mode can be monitored by the strain changes this shortcoming can be made up by the following optical measurement 3 3 full field deflection the fpp method uses the four step phase shifting technology and multi frequency phase unwrapping technology to improve the accuracy of 3d morphology the unwrapped phase Ï 128 at the highest fringe frequency was obtained as shown in fig 6o the same procedure can be used to obtain the unwrapped phase of the reference plane when there is no object and thus the object phase is obtained by the unwrapped phase Ï 128 subtracting the reference phase as shown in fig 9 although the presence of phase noise was noted at the locations of the strain gauges this does not affect the phase measurement of the i shape stiffened cfrp panel the multi frequency fringe projection method is used to obtain the phase map at different moments phase variation can be obtained by subtracting the object phase of the initial time before being transformed into the deflection as shown in fig 10 from the figure fig 10 it can be seen that the local buckling of the panel showed an obvious deflection evolution an increase in the load causes the local buckling to appear gradually in the skin between the stringers and the convex concave wave which increases in intervals it is important to note that the full field deflection data obtained is more comprehensive for understanding the evolution of local buckling as mentioned before the panel deflection can be converted from the phase difference before and after deformation by the calibration relationship the gamma error can be reduced in solving the phase difference and the measurement results meet the actual needs the nonlinear errors still exist in fig 10 which come from the influence of ambient light object surface reflection and gamma nonlinearity from the actual experiment the error source mainly comes from the gamma error which is caused by the projector itself the following nonlinear error compensation methods can be used to improve the measurement accuracy zhang et al zhang 2015 comprehensively summarized the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of computational methods to eliminate gamma nonlinear errors zheng et al zheng and da 2013 obtained a best gamma value by a semi experimental method which only partially eliminates gamma error but is more practical and simple lei et al 2015 used pre designed inverse phase method to eliminate non linear which was most convenient in the quasi static experiment guo et al 2004 proposed a post processing algorithm to obtain a higher measurement accuracy of fpp based on statistical analysis of the fringe images moreover it is noted that there is a motion distortion in the measurement for compensating this motion distortion some solutions have been proposed in ref lu et al 2014 li et al 2016 but these methods can only be applied to compensate a rigid distortion in this paper the movement of the specimen is not the rigid distortion but the in situ compressive deformation so the above methods can not be adapted in the experiment the camera frame rate is 4 fps so it takes 5s to complete a cycle for 5 fringe frequencies 1 4 16 64 and 128 the displacement loading rate is 0 2 mm min belonging to a quasi static loading the compression test experienced 12 min so there are 240 phase results for different moments during the test during the time interval between the adjacent measured phases the movement distortion is only 0 01 mm which is in a permissible deformation range 3 4 deflection distribution in an effort to better observe the variation in buckling deflection of the i shape stiffened cfrp panel under compression a deflection distribution along a dashed line in fig 10 was taken which is described in fig 11 it can be seen in fig 11 that the buckling phenomenon on the skin begins to appear when the load approaches 50 kn a careful examination of the local buckling mode reveals the following buckling behavior of the stiffened panel skin the local buckling becomes clearer displaying two convex and three concave peaks along the line with an increasing load at the maximum load the deflection variation between the convex and the concave reaches 6 58 mm in addition the local buckling disappeared after fracture failure 3 5 failure mode fig 12 shows the failure of the i shape stiffened cfrp panel following fracture of the skin and stringers combining the optical measurement data and the experimental loading curve the failure process can be summarized as follows initially the local buckling fig 11 appeared on the skin with a corresponding number waves to increase in the load the load time curve fig 7 shows that the local buckling of the skin did not cause a significant reduction in the compression stiffness of the i shape stiffened cfrp panel however when the panel reached its ultimate load the stringers began to bend thereby resulting in fracture of the skin furthermore after the skin fractured the stringers were observed to be broken therefore in the study the total deflection data of the skin obtained by at different moments are more comprehensive for the understanding of the evolution of local buckling the basic experimental data for the buckling mode evolution behavior of the skin are of guiding value to the analysis of the ultimate failure mechanism of the laminates at last it is noted that there was no debonding on the interface of the skin stringer during the loading process this shows that the i shape stiffened cfrp panel has a reasonable rigidity match between the stringers and the skin thus the fabricated panel meets the compressive quality requirement 4 conclusions in this paper the fabrication process of an i shape stiffened cfrp panel was introduced a compression experiment to monitor the loading capacity and failure behavior and the buckling evolution of the reinforced stiffened panel was carried out using strain gauges and fpp technology the strain bifurcation implies that the skin is locally buckled the full field deflection map shows that the skin buckled initially and then evolved with an increasing load which resulted in damage extension the ultimate failure of the panel only occurred after the buckling deformation of the stringers the compressive experiment proved that the structural design and the preparation process of the i shape stiffened cfrp are reasonable for further study to elucidate the failure mechanism

23343,digital fringe projection profilometry fpp was used to study the mechanical behavior and failure mode of an i shaped stiffened panel of carbon fiber reinforced polymer cfrp composites subjected to axial compression the fabrication process of the i type stiffened cfrp panel is described in this paper a special fixture was designed and fabricated to apply a compressive load to the cfrp panel furthermore strain gauges and the fpp technique were used to monitor the failure process of the panel when compressed strain measurement results revealed that a bifurcation phenomenon appeared on the panel surface moreover full field deflection results indicate that local skin buckling occurs on the stiffened cfrp panel which can be used to explain the strain bifurcation results from the experiment show that the design and fabrication process of the stiffened panel is reasonable and can be used to study the failure mechanism of stiffened cfrp panel keywords i type stiffened cfrp panel fringe projection profilometry compressive loading buckling 1 introduction demands for high performance lightweight multi functional and low cost modern aircraft ship and automobile have led to the rapid developments of fiber reinforced composite panels reinforced composites are widely used in m i and l shaped stringers and multi walled grid structures the skin of reinforced composites can be made up of multiple layers of fiber reinforced composite laminates or sandwich panels high performance carbon fiber glass fiber and aramid fiber kassapoglou 2013 njuguna 2016 these lightweight grid composite panels are usually found in the vertical tail stabilizer and wing of modern aircraft furthermore they also appear in the deck bottom and surface shells of ships and offshore platforms as well as in the chassis and cockpit of transport cars brooks et al 2017 the use of parts made from fiber reinforced composite is becoming a key factor in high performance aircraft ships automotive and other industrial equipment stiffened cfrp panels found in industrial equipment are often prone to buckling under the influence of compression shearing and thermal load during service different buckling modes will appear at different loading stages vasiliev and morozov 2013 sastry et al 2015 these bucklings appear to be more complex especially for panels found in aircraft due to fatigue and damage resulting from long term flight service furthermore these bucklings will promote local damage such as fiber breakage matrix cracking delamination debonding and other complex interlayer damage wang et al 2015 during the design stage various types of stringers are usually added to increase buckling resistance of composite panels to compression loading however a mismatch in stiffness between the stringers and the skin of composite panels can lead to premature debonding of the stringer skin interface zhu et al 2015 kumar and singh 2010 it is important to ascertain the structural integrity and design of the stiffened cfrp panel because the structural failure load is directly related to the failure mode of the panels abramovich and bisagni 2015 moreover the failure mode is related to the stiffness ratio of stringer skin and the initial defects such as damage and delamination yap et al 2002 orifici et al 2008 axial compression experimental tests and theoretical calculations are important for understanding the failure behavior of composite stiffened panels the failure behavior under axial compression involves structural buckling and post buckling mo et al 2015 in addition there is a growing interest in the complex mechanical behaviors of failure in stiffened panels such as delamination damage extension and buckling due to manufacturing defects or impacts huang et al 2015 jin et al 2015 the process used in producing stiffened panels is important to the type of defect suffered by the panels for example studies have linked different forming processes of stiffened cfrp panels to the likely defect modes of the panels under blasting or impacting process kolanu et al 2016 moreover during the load bearing process the local buckling with the convex concave waves gradually appears in the skin between the longitudinal beams of stiffened panel the local severe buckling of the skin is an important factor that causes the ultimate failure of the panel therefore a detailed buckling behavior monitoring is necessary to examine the stiffened cfrp panel under specific forming process and specific stringers data obtained through experiments are useful for understanding the failure mechanism and process these data can also be used for correcting numerical analysis and design theory of the stiffened cfrp panel ibrahim et al 2016 in this paper the preparation process of an i shaped stiffened cfrp panel is introduced and experiments conducted to examine the different failure modes under compression are described strain gauges were used to monitor the local buckling of the stiffened cfrp panel during compression loading the fpp technique was used to capture the deflection of the cfrp stiffened panel as well as to determine the formation process of buckling this study is important to understand the deformation process and failure behavior of stiffened panel under compression 2 experiments 2 1 specimen preparation as shown in fig 1 the i shaped stiffened cfrp panel is 530 mm length 405 mm width 1 5 mm thickness three i shaped stringers are distributed equally along the longitudinal direction of the panel the stringer height is 41 mm from the skin surface and is composed of the upper edge lower edge and vertical strips the dimensions of the upper edge lower edge and vertical strips are 24 mm width 3 38 mm thickness 52 mm width 1 69 mm thickness and a thickness of 3 38 mm respectively during the preparation of the i shaped stringer the upper edge strip s1 the lower edge strip s2 and the vertical strip s3 were all cut with a carbon fiber prepreg to ensure the size and straightness of the stringer as shown in fig 2 the strips of s1 s2 and s3 were combined and laid in a steel core mold in which the r zone voids were filled with carbon fibers the left and right steel core molds were used to precisely locate the axial position of the stringers on the skin and to control the overall dimensions of the stringers furthermore the sample was compacted in a vacuum environment and before being trimmed to the theoretical dimensions finally the sample was packaged and installed on the skin cover plate for co curing in an autoclave the ends of the stiffened panel were secured with steel frames casting covered with epoxy resin fig 3 to protect the stiffened panel from damage at the ends during the axial compression in the manufacturing process of the i shaped stiffened panel the deviation factors that influence the geometric precision of the panel can be classified into two aspects one aspect involves the overall deviation of the axial position of the stringers the thickness deviation of the skin and stringers and the section deflection of the stringers in addition the other aspect has to do with resin thermal expansion and chemical shrinkage in the curing process which can lead to residual stress and residual deformation due to solidification 2 2 fixture description at present for the compression test of fiber reinforced composite stiffened panel there is no experimental specification for fixture design in this study the compressive experiment on the i shaped stiffened cfrp panel was conducted in a self made fixture as shown in fig 4 a trapezoidal loading head which was fixed to a four column testing machine can gradually transfer the compressive load the specimen was fixed between a pair of rigid blocks in the middle of the fixture to ensure symmetrical compression both sides of the specimen were supported using bolts to simulate simply supported boundary conditions the two sides of the stiffened plate are restrained by lateral bolts during the compressive process which can prevent the small lateral displacement of the panel moreover the loading alignment can be realized easily by adjusting the bottom bolts of the fixture which can also correct little initial deformation due to manufacturing process 2 3 experimental setup the specimen was loaded with a four column testing machine css 100t changchun tester co with a maximum loading capacity of 1000 kn as shown in fig 5 the compressive experiment was carried out along the axial direction force and displacement sensors were used to record the axial load and displacement respectively six pairs of strain gauges were distributed symmetrically on both the front and rear of the skin to monitor the magnitude of surface deformation in the loading history as show in fig 1 the uppercase letters a b c d e f and the lowercase letters a b c d e f represent the strain gauges pasted on the front and back of the panel respectively for example two back to back strain gauges in the same position of panel are denoted as a a the direction strain gauges are aligned in parallel to the stringers in the study the main purposes of the electrical gauge measurement have the following aspects at first during the specimen installation and preloading the loading alignment can be monitored easily by the enough strain data of gauges second the validity of the optical measurement can be verified by comparing with the experimental data furthermore the multi frequency fringe patterns were projected onto the front of the specimen using a projector tlp x2000 3lcd with a projection and shooting rate of 4 fps the resulting images from the projections were sequentially collected by a ccd camera guppy f 080b to measure the full field deflection 2 4 optical measurement furutani et al 1997 proposed a space encoding method using 256 sub spaces by 4 gy level patterns projected onto object for 3d profile measurement but the measurement accuracy is approximately 0 5 mm for a measurement area of 160 mm 130 mm the measurement accuracy can be improved by adopting sinusoidal fringe patterns or phase measuring algorithms feng et al 2015 steffen et al 2015 a multi frequency fpp technique used in our experiment has an accuracy of approximately 0 5 mm for the specimen surface area of 405 mm 530 mm in the ideal case the response function of a camera and projector is linear however when a sine fringe pattern is projected onto an object surface a distorted fringe can be expressed as 1 i n a b cos 2 Ï f Ï Î´ n where the constants a and b represent the background light and the intensity modulation respectively f is the spatial frequency of the fringe pattern projected onto the reference plane Ï is the fringe phase caused by the height h of the corresponding object and Î´ n is the phase shift in a four step phase shifting method ps the phase shift is Î´ n 0 Ï 2 Ï and 3Ï 2 n 1 2 3 4 respectively four sine fringe patterns are projected onto the object surface as shown in fig 6 phase calculation is performed on four adjacent images in a series of acquired images to obtain the wrapped phase Ï w as lei et al 2012 2 Ï w w r a p Ï tan 1 i 4 i 2 i 1 i 3 where the intensity images of i 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 correspond to the phase shifts of 0 Ï 2 Ï and 3Ï 2 respectively wrap is a wrapping function and the wrapped phase Ï w has a value in the range of Ï Ï using atan2 function as shown in eq 2 a linear calibration relationship between the phase and the height is relatively simple but the position relationship between the projector and the camera is strict jia et al 2005 if the layout of the projector and the camera is arbitrary the calibration process is relatively complicated du and wang 2007 zhang 2016 in our experiment a relationship between the phase difference and the object height is a known invariant which can be written in the series of 3 h k 0 a k Î´ Ï k the above relationship can be calibrated from the mapping data between the known height and the measured phase difference the k 1 unknowns a 0 a 1 and a k can be determined by least squares method from a series of height data obtained from a calibrated block with known height in practice a phase unwrapping algorithm is used to obtain the object phase Ï for a discontinuous surface a multi frequency phase unwrapping mpu method can be used to avoid error propagation related to neighboring pixels huntley and saldner 1993 zuo et al 2016 several sets of phase shifted fringe patterns with different fringe frequencies are projected onto the object surface and the wrapped phase Ï i w at the corresponding fringe frequency f i is obtained by the ps method thus the unwrapped phase Ï i at the corresponding fringe frequency f i is written as 4 Ï i Ï i w i n t Ï j f i f j Ï i w 2 Ï 2 Ï where the superscript w represents a wrap operator and int is the rounding function the unwrapped phases of Ï i and Ï j correspond to the fringe frequencies of f i and f j respectively it is noted that the unwrapped phase Ï 1 is equal to the wrapped phase Ï 1 w when the fringe frequency is f 1 1 as such no further phase unwrapping is required as the phase accuracy for the fringe frequency f 1 is insufficient the actual fringe frequency f i needs to be further increased in the dynamic measurement it is the best way to reduce the number of projected patterns according to the ref towers et al 2005 ding et al 2015 three kinds of projection grating frequency were designed and the 3d topography of discontinuities was measured in theory the dual frequency scheme is the minimum number of images used in the fpp ding et al 2012 but the reliability and accuracy are not high in the actual application zuo et al 2012 presented a novel four pattern strategy for recovering absolute phase and measuring spatially isolated objects this method uses two Ï 2 phase shifted sinusoidal patterns and two linear increasing decreasing ramp patterns to reconstruct the 3 d profile for multiply objects in this experiment we designed five sets of phase shifted fringe patterns with different fringe frequencies of f i i 1 4 16 64 and 128 which were projected onto the i shape stiffened cfrp panel in turns the camera collected the distorted fringe images sequentially as shown in fig 6a 6 e then the ps method in eq 2 was used to obtain the wrapped phase for each fringe frequency as shown in fig 6f 6 j when the fringe frequency is f 1 the unwrapping phase Ï 1 fig 6k equals to its corresponding wrapped phase Ï 1 w fig 6f however when the fringe frequency is f 4 the unwrapped phase Ï 4 fig 6l is calculated by the mpu method in eq 4 from the combined wrapped phase Ï 4 w fig 6g with the unwrapped phase Ï 1 fig 6k this is similar to the next higher fringe frequency where only the most accurate unwrapping phase Ï 128 fig 6o is required for the actual measurement 3 results and discussions 3 1 load history fig 7 shows the load time curve the load is shown to increase linearly with time with a loading displacement rate of 0 2 mm min the maximum compression load was approximately 493 kn during the whole loading process 3 2 strain analysis fig 8 describes the strain time curves of the strain gauges affixed to the skin of the stiffened panel importantly a strain bifurcation occurs on the surface of the panel when the experiment was carried out for approximately 5 min the strain at some locations was negative the observed strain bifurcation can be explained by the local buckling convex and or concave exhibited by the stiffened panel at different locations the local buckling can be detected effectively by the observed strain bifurcation moreover the local buckling mode is evolving and the buckling positions are also changing with the increase of the load but the positions of the gauges are fixed so only one certain order of bucking mode can be monitored by the strain changes this shortcoming can be made up by the following optical measurement 3 3 full field deflection the fpp method uses the four step phase shifting technology and multi frequency phase unwrapping technology to improve the accuracy of 3d morphology the unwrapped phase Ï 128 at the highest fringe frequency was obtained as shown in fig 6o the same procedure can be used to obtain the unwrapped phase of the reference plane when there is no object and thus the object phase is obtained by the unwrapped phase Ï 128 subtracting the reference phase as shown in fig 9 although the presence of phase noise was noted at the locations of the strain gauges this does not affect the phase measurement of the i shape stiffened cfrp panel the multi frequency fringe projection method is used to obtain the phase map at different moments phase variation can be obtained by subtracting the object phase of the initial time before being transformed into the deflection as shown in fig 10 from the figure fig 10 it can be seen that the local buckling of the panel showed an obvious deflection evolution an increase in the load causes the local buckling to appear gradually in the skin between the stringers and the convex concave wave which increases in intervals it is important to note that the full field deflection data obtained is more comprehensive for understanding the evolution of local buckling as mentioned before the panel deflection can be converted from the phase difference before and after deformation by the calibration relationship the gamma error can be reduced in solving the phase difference and the measurement results meet the actual needs the nonlinear errors still exist in fig 10 which come from the influence of ambient light object surface reflection and gamma nonlinearity from the actual experiment the error source mainly comes from the gamma error which is caused by the projector itself the following nonlinear error compensation methods can be used to improve the measurement accuracy zhang et al zhang 2015 comprehensively summarized the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of computational methods to eliminate gamma nonlinear errors zheng et al zheng and da 2013 obtained a best gamma value by a semi experimental method which only partially eliminates gamma error but is more practical and simple lei et al 2015 used pre designed inverse phase method to eliminate non linear which was most convenient in the quasi static experiment guo et al 2004 proposed a post processing algorithm to obtain a higher measurement accuracy of fpp based on statistical analysis of the fringe images moreover it is noted that there is a motion distortion in the measurement for compensating this motion distortion some solutions have been proposed in ref lu et al 2014 li et al 2016 but these methods can only be applied to compensate a rigid distortion in this paper the movement of the specimen is not the rigid distortion but the in situ compressive deformation so the above methods can not be adapted in the experiment the camera frame rate is 4 fps so it takes 5s to complete a cycle for 5 fringe frequencies 1 4 16 64 and 128 the displacement loading rate is 0 2 mm min belonging to a quasi static loading the compression test experienced 12 min so there are 240 phase results for different moments during the test during the time interval between the adjacent measured phases the movement distortion is only 0 01 mm which is in a permissible deformation range 3 4 deflection distribution in an effort to better observe the variation in buckling deflection of the i shape stiffened cfrp panel under compression a deflection distribution along a dashed line in fig 10 was taken which is described in fig 11 it can be seen in fig 11 that the buckling phenomenon on the skin begins to appear when the load approaches 50 kn a careful examination of the local buckling mode reveals the following buckling behavior of the stiffened panel skin the local buckling becomes clearer displaying two convex and three concave peaks along the line with an increasing load at the maximum load the deflection variation between the convex and the concave reaches 6 58 mm in addition the local buckling disappeared after fracture failure 3 5 failure mode fig 12 shows the failure of the i shape stiffened cfrp panel following fracture of the skin and stringers combining the optical measurement data and the experimental loading curve the failure process can be summarized as follows initially the local buckling fig 11 appeared on the skin with a corresponding number waves to increase in the load the load time curve fig 7 shows that the local buckling of the skin did not cause a significant reduction in the compression stiffness of the i shape stiffened cfrp panel however when the panel reached its ultimate load the stringers began to bend thereby resulting in fracture of the skin furthermore after the skin fractured the stringers were observed to be broken therefore in the study the total deflection data of the skin obtained by at different moments are more comprehensive for the understanding of the evolution of local buckling the basic experimental data for the buckling mode evolution behavior of the skin are of guiding value to the analysis of the ultimate failure mechanism of the laminates at last it is noted that there was no debonding on the interface of the skin stringer during the loading process this shows that the i shape stiffened cfrp panel has a reasonable rigidity match between the stringers and the skin thus the fabricated panel meets the compressive quality requirement 4 conclusions in this paper the fabrication process of an i shape stiffened cfrp panel was introduced a compression experiment to monitor the loading capacity and failure behavior and the buckling evolution of the reinforced stiffened panel was carried out using strain gauges and fpp technology the strain bifurcation implies that the skin is locally buckled the full field deflection map shows that the skin buckled initially and then evolved with an increasing load which resulted in damage extension the ultimate failure of the panel only occurred after the buckling deformation of the stringers the compressive experiment proved that the structural design and the preparation process of the i shape stiffened cfrp are reasonable for further study to elucidate the failure mechanism

structures that suffer cyclic loading in service elber 1970 found the plasticity induced crack closure phenomenon and pointed out that the effective driving force for crack growth might be characterized by the effective stress intensity factor range a crack is fully open for only a part of the load cycle even when the loading cycle is fully in tension the crack opening stress cos corresponding to the load at which the contact between the crack surfaces is broken is intimately related with fatigue crack propagation rate therefore cos should be considered in safety assessment involved in crack components until now many researchers have made attempts to the determination of cos in pioneering works budiansky and hutchinson 1978 presented a theoretical model to determine cos of infinite plates under small scale yielding correia et al 2016a and blasÃ³n et al 2016 proposed a theoretical model to estimate the cos intensity factor later based on crack closure and crack growth experiments schijve 1981 de koning 1981 kumar and garg 1989 lang 2000 correia et al 2016b lesiuk et al 2017 proposed empirical models to determine cos of specimens these empirical models obtained from experiments are usually available to the experimental range of material types or load ratios as an alternative finite element method is frequently used in cos assessments previously a great amount of significant studies antunes et al 2015 de matos and nowell 2007 solanki et al 2004a solanki et al 2003 gonzÃ¡lez herrera and zapatero 2005 antunes and rodrigues 2008 singh et al 2008 newman 1976 focused mainly on the optimization of numerical parameters such as mesh refinement crack advancement schemes cos assessment methods and crack opening assessment location the accuracy of the finite element method therefore is heavily dependent on these factors besides these calculations are very time consuming to avoid these problems aguilar et al 2016 utilized mesh optimization and a restart analysis to determine cos of long cracks and other researchers further proposed alternative empirical models based on numerical results to calculate cos these models include various controlling parameters for example newman 1984 presented equations including stress ratios for cos under uniaxial loading solanki et al 2004b calculated cos based on the crack surface nodal force distribution tong and wu 2014 discussed the effect of crack tip element on determining cos antunes et al 2014 proposed empirical models for cos based on maximum stress intensity factor and stress intensity factor range besides an empirical model antunes et al 2016 based on the integration of vertical plastic deformation perpendicularly to crack flank has also been proposed to quantify cos and shi et al 2016 developed a model based on the effective cyclic plastic zone to determine cos most of the above studies are limited to small scale yielding ranges to solve the issue wang et al 2003 used crack tip opening displacement to calculate cos under large scale yielding despite the existence of different procedure to quantify cos issues remain associated with the practical implementation to accurately determine cos one of the significant issues is that most numerical approaches above to determine cos are associated with the calculations of crack tip stress field and displacement field but relevant fracture parameters in crack tip field could not be conveniently obtained in practice besides most analyses are confined to small scale yielding state therefore more convenient fracture parameters that quantify the damage processes occurring at the crack tip are in desperate needed to accurately determine cos in engineering practices in this work a new method is introduced to determine cos based on the variable quantity of maximum crack opening displacement vmcod aimed at the center cracked tension cct specimen the relationship between normalized cos and normalized vmcod is established it is demonstrated that the presented relation here is not affected by crack geometry size yield stress young s modulus stress ratio as well as strain hardening and the correlation is applicable under small scale and large scale yielding besides taking into account of the crack closure effect the relationship between cos and vmcod is applied to predict crack growth rates the predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental crack growth data 2 theoretical considerations elber 1970 has indicated that the permanent tensile plastic deformation left in the wake of the propagating crack results in the crack closure phenomenon the plasticity induced crack closure picc is linked closely with the monotonic and reversed plastic deformation occurring at the crack tip therefore cos has a certain relationship with crack tip plastic zone that is simply expressed as 1 Ï o p f r y where Ï op is crack opening stress r y is crack tip plastic zone in our previous work jingjie et al 2014 yi et al 2010a we proposed the estimation method of monotonic plastic zone size ahead of crack determined by maximum crack opening displacement mcod during loading and the reverse plastic zone size determined by vmcod during unloading hence the crack tip plastic zone is linked to vmcod the relationship can be simply and distinctly expressed as 2 r y f Î´ u where Î´u is the variable quantity of maximum crack opening displacement vmcod according to eq 1 and eq 2 it is clear that cos is related to vmcod during the crack propagation the relationship between cos and vmcod could be simply and markedly written as 3 Ï o p f Î´ u where Î´u denotes vmcod and can be expressed as 4 Î´ u u max u min in eq 4 u max and u min represent the resulting mcod perpendicular to crack surfaces corresponding to the maximum stress Ï max and minimum stress Ï min in the cyclic tensile load respectively which is shown in fig 2 once the expression of the relationship between cos and vmcod is given the cos could be obtained more conveniently by vmcod 3 finite element analysis 3 1 establishment of the fe model eight node quadrilateral elements target elements and contact elements are used

the load increment is 2 5 of the maximum stress the kinematic hardening rule and the von mises criteria are employed in the calculations when the stresses in the tip of the crack change from compressive to tensile the crack is taken to be fully open and the corresponding remote applied stress is defined as the cos this definition for determining the cos has been accepted by many researchers de matos and nowell 2007 gonzÃ¡lez herrera and zapatero 2005 wu and ellyin 1996 moreover node release scheme at the maximum load of a loading cycle is used for modeling crack propagation careful attention has to be given to the mesh density to seek accurately cos the researchers solanki et al 2004a b gonzÃ¡lez herrera and zapatero 2005 mcclung and sehitoglu 1989a agreed that an appropriate mesh density requirement is characterized by crack tip forward plastic zone commonly denoted as r p mcclung and sehitoglu 1989a suggested the criteria that r p had twenty triangle elements or ten four node quadrilateral elements gonzÃ¡lez herrera and zapatero 2005 recommended the minimum element size l e r p 0 03 for linear elements where l e was minimum element size in the present work the smallest element size in the crack tip as shown in fig 3 is 1 10 of the forward plastic zone as for the estimation of the forward plastic zone the quantity is given by the following approximate

attains a stable level fig 5 shows the obtained stable cos corresponding to different stress levels compared with the previous research presented by lugo et al 2011 and newman 1984 the data show a good consistency which give more confidence to the method used in this work 3 3 correlation between cos and vmcod in order to investigate the relationship between cos and vmcod the similar model as shown in fig 3 is selected with a 2 mm w 40 mm l 40 mm the material is assumed to be elastic perfectly plastic with e 72 gpa Ï 0 480 mpa Î½ 0 3 r 0 the uniaxial tension loads Ï max Ï 0 ranging from 0 1 to 0 7 are employed to calculate cos and corresponding vmcod it is observed from fig 6 that cos has a strong correlation with the normalized vmcod thus the data here fit well with a curve which suggests that cos could be presented as the function of normalized vmcod based on least square method an expression of the function is given by 8 Ï o p Ï 0 0 024 Î´ u e a Ï 0 2 0 172 Î´ u e a Ï 0

large scale yielding conditions however the relationship is applied for the model with elastic perfectly plastic material r 0 note that the cos is influenced by crack geometry size material property such as yield stress young s modulus strain hardening and stress ratio in practice particular emphasis is given to the effects of these parameters on the relevance between normalized cos and normalized vmcod 4 results and discussion 4 1 initial crack length effect the crack geometry may be characterized by the nondimensional form a w the model as already stated with unchanged material property e 72 gpa Ï 0 480 mpa Î½ 0 3 w 40 mm subjected to the uniaxial tensile load Ï max Ï 0 varies in the range of 0 1 0 6 had a series of half initial crack lengths a 4 6 10 16 mm from fig 7 it is evident that the relationship between Ï op Ï 0 and Î´ue aÏ 0 is independent of the influence of initial crack length in the case of 0 1 a w 0 4 4 2 young s modulus and yield stress effects here the established model has initial crack length a 4 mm w 40 mm Ï 0 480 mpa Î½ 0 3 uniaxial tensile load Ï max Ï 0 varies in the range of 0 2 0 6 e varies in the range of 28 8 57 6 gpa fig 8 shows the normalized calculated results it is clearly that young s modulus has little effect on the relationship of cos and normalized vmcod then the model just selects e 72 gpa Ï max Ï 0 0 2 Ï 0 varies in the range of 160 600 mpa and other parameters keep unchanged the cos calculated for the model under different yield stresses are shown in fig 9 consequently the correlation between Î´ue aÏ 0 and Ï op Ï 0 has ruled out the effects of yield stress 4 3 stress ratio effect apparently the stress ratio have impacts on cos the cyclic load history presented in the above analysis has a stress ratio of zero to investigate the effect of stress ratio level on the correlation of cos and normalized vmcod different stress ratio levels r 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 are conducted to the models the models keep material and geometry parameters unchanged with e 72 gpa Ï 0 480 mpa Î½ 0 3 w 40 mm a 4 mm the maximum stress Ï max Ï 0 varies in the range of 0 1 0 7 first as for r 0 6 no cos could be acquired a good agreement could be seen with the work of newman and harry 1975 and the experimental results obtained by boyce and ritchie 2001 that at stress ratio larger than 0 5 crack closure could not be detected for ti 6al 4v alloy material second fig 10 shows that cos increases with the growing of stress ratio when r 0 5 to eliminate the effect of stress ratio cos and normalized vmcod is re characterized by Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 and Ï o p Ï 0 1 r 2 as fig 11 shows a relationship seeing eq 9 between normalized cos and normalized vmcod has advantage of eliminating the effect of stress ratio

sehitoglu 1989b rodrigues and antunes 2009 pommier and bompard 1999 have studied the effect of material constitutive relationships on crack closure behavior the material presented in the above work is assumed to be elastic perfectly plastic kinematic power law model Ã¸stby et al 2007 zhang et al 1999 yi et al 2011 relationship between the stress and strain seeing eq 10 has been employed to study the straining hardening effect on cos 10 Ï Ï 0 1 Îµ p Îµ 0 n Ï Ï 0 e Îµ Ï Ï 0 where Ï is the flow stress Ï 0 is yield stress Îµ p is the plastic strain Îµ 0 Ï 0 e is yield strain n is the strain hardening exponent the geometry of model still is a 4 mm w 40 mm the material parameters are Ï 0 480 mpa e 72 gpa Î½ 0 3 and the strain hardening exponent n ranges from 0 1 to 0 5 the applied load Ï max Ï 0 varies in the range of 0 1 0 6 r 0 fig 12 illustrates the normalized cos Ï op 1 r 2 Ï 0 and normalized vmcod Î´ue 1 r aÏ 0 subjected to different n an obvious difference could be seen from fig 12 between the elastic perfectly plastic material and strain hardening material apparently eq 9 does not fit the strain hardening material taking into account of the strain hardening effects 1 1 n 2 is reintroduced to the normalized vmcod thus the expression can be written as Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 by semi empirical and theoretical analysis fig 13 shows the new standardized results of cos and corresponding vmcod it has been detected that the results could be plotted by the same curve which is still represented by the expression of eq 11 namely the relationship between normalized cos and normalized vmcod could remove the effect of strain hardening 11 Ï o p Ï 0 1 r 2 0 024 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 2 0 172 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 0 015 it is known that eq 11 considers the effects of stress r ratio and strain hardening based on eq 8 hence according to the range of application given in eq 8 it can be seen that the argument of eq 11 also varies in the ranges from 0 2 to 3 2 under plane stress condition eq 11 is viable under both small scale and large scale yielding conditions the definite expression of the relationship between normalized cos and vmcod is presented as eq 11 eq 11 is applicable to kinematic power law model however there still are other material constitutive models rodrigues and antunes 2009 such as the swift model the voce model and the non linear model the applicabilities to these models need to be investigated in further study 5 experimental verification in this section the relationship between cos and vmcod is applied to predict crack growth rates and the predicted crack propagation rates are compared with experimental data of two typical engineering materials from the previous literature glinka 1985 the paris fatigue crack propagation expression paris and erdogan 1963 could be written as eq 12 by using elber 1970 crack closure concept 12 d a d n c Î´ k e f f m c k max k o p m where Î´ k e f f is the effective stress intensity factor sif range k max is the maximum sif k op is crack opening sif c and m are modified paris constants in our previous work yi et al 2010b based on the westergaard stress function for a central through crack in an infinite plate under tensile loads the mathematical function relationship between the normal mcod and sif was deduced as eq 13 eq 13 is able to eliminate the influence of plate width in the case of 0 05 a w 0 5 13 k max u max e 4 a Ï where u max is the resulting mcod corresponding to the maximum stress Ï max the crack opening sif could be expressed as 14 k o p y a Ï o p Ï a where y a is geometric correction coefficient and eq 11 gives the relationship between vmcod and cos the relationship has already eliminated the effects of crack geometry size hence the geometric correction coefficient in eq 14 y a 1 according to eq 11 and eq 14 the k op could be written as 15 k o p 0 024 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 2 0 172 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 0 015 Ï 0 1 r 2 Ï a therefore according to eqs 12 13 and 15 crack growth rate could be determined by vmcod under cyclic tensile load as eq 16 16 d a d n c k max k o p m k max u max e 4 a Ï k o p 0 024 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 2 0 172 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 0 015 Ï 0 1 r 2 Ï a figs 14 and 15 shows the fatigue crack growth data da dn Î´k for the 35cd4 steel and 4340 steel material which are found in glinka experiment the material properties are given in table 1 based on the Î´k presented in figs 14 and 15 the vmcod are obtained by eq 17 17 Î´ u 4 a r p 2 Ï e Î´ k where Î´u is vmcod in the cyclic tensile load therefore glinka experimental data da dn Î´k are transformed into forms of da dn Î´u the experimental data da dn Î´u are shown in figs 16 and 17 based on the experimental data Î´k and stress r ratio k max are obtained then according to eq 7 the values of r p can be calculated and then Î´u are determined by eq 17 finally the values of da dn can be obtained by eq 16 which are shown in figs 16 and 17 comparison of the predicted crack propagation rates based on vmcod given by eq 16 vs the experimental data of glinka 1985 is presented from figs 16 and 17 it can be seen from figs 16 and 17 that the predicted results of crack growth rate for 35cd4 steel and 4340 steel based on vmcod are in good agreement with the experimental data over realistic fatigue crack growth rate ranges it is worth noting that since the experimental data of opening stress is difficult to obtain the indirect method is adopted to verify the correctness of the expression of crack opening stress related to vmcod eq 11 based on crack propagation data and effective stress intensity factor eq 16 is proposed in this case it is known that the concept of equivalent stress intensity factor takes into account the influence of plastic zone on the basis of the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics and in eq 16 k op is used to consider the influence of plastic zone and k max is obtained within the linear elastic stage so the relationship between k max and u max is corrected in eq 16 due to the applicability of the equivalent stress intensity factor eq 16 applies only to the small scale range of yield condition according to eq 17 the experimental data in the crack growth rate da dn Î´k can be transformed into forms of da dn Î´u this is the key to verify the accuracy of the expression of crack opening stress eq 11 proposed in the work by eq 16 since the equivalent crack length a r p 2 in eq 17 is valid for the range of small scale yielding the applicable scope for eq 16 and eq 17 is in the range of r p a 1 10 using the experimental data in the crack growth rate and eqs 16 and 17 the accuracy of the expression of crack opening stress eq 11 can only be verified in the small scale range of yield condition for the range of large scale yielding the accuracy of the expression of crack opening stress will be the focus in our further work the crack propagation experiments will be made in the large scale range of yield condition and the experimental data da dn Î´u will be directly obtain the accuracy of eq 11 can be well verified 6 conclusions this work focus on the estimation of cos via vmcod a series of elastic plastic finite element analysis are performed on a cct specimen to quantify cos and vmcod based on the results the following conclusions can be noted 1 a relationship seeing eq 11 between normalized cos Ï o p Ï 0 1 r 2 and normalized vmcod Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 is presented for a cct specimen under plane stress conditions as a result the relationship has the advantages of avoiding adopting fracture parameters around crack tip and eliminating the effects of crack geometry young s modulus yield stress stress r ratio as well as strain hardening 2 the relationship between cos and vmcod is applicable under large scale yielding 3 the relationship could be applied to predict crack growth rates which closely approximate the experimental results and it is believed that this relationship is significant for engineering practices 4 the relationship is only available to cyclic tensile loading further study will be made on the effect of compressive loads

structures that suffer cyclic loading in service elber 1970 found the plasticity induced crack closure phenomenon and pointed out that the effective driving force for crack growth might be characterized by the effective stress intensity factor range a crack is fully open for only a part of the load cycle even when the loading cycle is fully in tension the crack opening stress cos corresponding to the load at which the contact between the crack surfaces is broken is intimately related with fatigue crack propagation rate therefore cos should be considered in safety assessment involved in crack components until now many researchers have made attempts to the determination of cos in pioneering works budiansky and hutchinson 1978 presented a theoretical model to determine cos of infinite plates under small scale yielding correia et al 2016a and blasÃ³n et al 2016 proposed a theoretical model to estimate the cos intensity factor later based on crack closure and crack growth experiments schijve 1981 de koning 1981 kumar and garg 1989 lang 2000 correia et al 2016b lesiuk et al 2017 proposed empirical models to determine cos of specimens these empirical models obtained from experiments are usually available to the experimental range of material types or load ratios as an alternative finite element method is frequently used in cos assessments previously a great amount of significant studies antunes et al 2015 de matos and nowell 2007 solanki et al 2004a solanki et al 2003 gonzÃ¡lez herrera and zapatero 2005 antunes and rodrigues 2008 singh et al 2008 newman 1976 focused mainly on the optimization of numerical parameters such as mesh refinement crack advancement schemes cos assessment methods and crack opening assessment location the accuracy of the finite element method therefore is heavily dependent on these factors besides these calculations are very time consuming to avoid these problems aguilar et al 2016 utilized mesh optimization and a restart analysis to determine cos of long cracks and other researchers further proposed alternative empirical models based on numerical results to calculate cos these models include various controlling parameters for example newman 1984 presented equations including stress ratios for cos under uniaxial loading solanki et al 2004b calculated cos based on the crack surface nodal force distribution tong and wu 2014 discussed the effect of crack tip element on determining cos antunes et al 2014 proposed empirical models for cos based on maximum stress intensity factor and stress intensity factor range besides an empirical model antunes et al 2016 based on the integration of vertical plastic deformation perpendicularly to crack flank has also been proposed to quantify cos and shi et al 2016 developed a model based on the effective cyclic plastic zone to determine cos most of the above studies are limited to small scale yielding ranges to solve the issue wang et al 2003 used crack tip opening displacement to calculate cos under large scale yielding despite the existence of different procedure to quantify cos issues remain associated with the practical implementation to accurately determine cos one of the significant issues is that most numerical approaches above to determine cos are associated with the calculations of crack tip stress field and displacement field but relevant fracture parameters in crack tip field could not be conveniently obtained in practice besides most analyses are confined to small scale yielding state therefore more convenient fracture parameters that quantify the damage processes occurring at the crack tip are in desperate needed to accurately determine cos in engineering practices in this work a new method is introduced to determine cos based on the variable quantity of maximum crack opening displacement vmcod aimed at the center cracked tension cct specimen the relationship between normalized cos and normalized vmcod is established it is demonstrated that the presented relation here is not affected by crack geometry size yield stress young s modulus stress ratio as well as strain hardening and the correlation is applicable under small scale and large scale yielding besides taking into account of the crack closure effect the relationship between cos and vmcod is applied to predict crack growth rates the predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental crack growth data 2 theoretical considerations elber 1970 has indicated that the permanent tensile plastic deformation left in the wake of the propagating crack results in the crack closure phenomenon the plasticity induced crack closure picc is linked closely with the monotonic and reversed plastic deformation occurring at the crack tip therefore cos has a certain relationship with crack tip plastic zone that is simply expressed as 1 Ï o p f r y where Ï op is crack opening stress r y is crack tip plastic zone in our previous work jingjie et al 2014 yi et al 2010a we proposed the estimation method of monotonic plastic zone size ahead of crack determined by maximum crack opening displacement mcod during loading and the reverse plastic zone size determined by vmcod during unloading hence the crack tip plastic zone is linked to vmcod the relationship can be simply and distinctly expressed as 2 r y f Î´ u where Î´u is the variable quantity of maximum crack opening displacement vmcod according to eq 1 and eq 2 it is clear that cos is related to vmcod during the crack propagation the relationship between cos and vmcod could be simply and markedly written as 3 Ï o p f Î´ u where Î´u denotes vmcod and can be expressed as 4 Î´ u u max u min in eq 4 u max and u min represent the resulting mcod perpendicular to crack surfaces corresponding to the maximum stress Ï max and minimum stress Ï min in the cyclic tensile load respectively which is shown in fig 2 once the expression of the relationship between cos and vmcod is given the cos could be obtained more conveniently by vmcod 3 finite element analysis 3 1 establishment of the fe model eight node quadrilateral elements target elements and contact elements are used

sehitoglu 1989b rodrigues and antunes 2009 pommier and bompard 1999 have studied the effect of material constitutive relationships on crack closure behavior the material presented in the above work is assumed to be elastic perfectly plastic kinematic power law model Ã¸stby et al 2007 zhang et al 1999 yi et al 2011 relationship between the stress and strain seeing eq 10 has been employed to study the straining hardening effect on cos 10 Ï Ï 0 1 Îµ p Îµ 0 n Ï Ï 0 e Îµ Ï Ï 0 where Ï is the flow stress Ï 0 is yield stress Îµ p is the plastic strain Îµ 0 Ï 0 e is yield strain n is the strain hardening exponent the geometry of model still is a 4 mm w 40 mm the material parameters are Ï 0 480 mpa e 72 gpa Î½ 0 3 and the strain hardening exponent n ranges from 0 1 to 0 5 the applied load Ï max Ï 0 varies in the range of 0 1 0 6 r 0 fig 12 illustrates the normalized cos Ï op 1 r 2 Ï 0 and normalized vmcod Î´ue 1 r aÏ 0 subjected to different n an obvious difference could be seen from fig 12 between the elastic perfectly plastic material and strain hardening material apparently eq 9 does not fit the strain hardening material taking into account of the strain hardening effects 1 1 n 2 is reintroduced to the normalized vmcod thus the expression can be written as Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 by semi empirical and theoretical analysis fig 13 shows the new standardized results of cos and corresponding vmcod it has been detected that the results could be plotted by the same curve which is still represented by the expression of eq 11 namely the relationship between normalized cos and normalized vmcod could remove the effect of strain hardening 11 Ï o p Ï 0 1 r 2 0 024 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 2 0 172 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 0 015 it is known that eq 11 considers the effects of stress r ratio and strain hardening based on eq 8 hence according to the range of application given in eq 8 it can be seen that the argument of eq 11 also varies in the ranges from 0 2 to 3 2 under plane stress condition eq 11 is viable under both small scale and large scale yielding conditions the definite expression of the relationship between normalized cos and vmcod is presented as eq 11 eq 11 is applicable to kinematic power law model however there still are other material constitutive models rodrigues and antunes 2009 such as the swift model the voce model and the non linear model the applicabilities to these models need to be investigated in further study 5 experimental verification in this section the relationship between cos and vmcod is applied to predict crack growth rates and the predicted crack propagation rates are compared with experimental data of two typical engineering materials from the previous literature glinka 1985 the paris fatigue crack propagation expression paris and erdogan 1963 could be written as eq 12 by using elber 1970 crack closure concept 12 d a d n c Î´ k e f f m c k max k o p m where Î´ k e f f is the effective stress intensity factor sif range k max is the maximum sif k op is crack opening sif c and m are modified paris constants in our previous work yi et al 2010b based on the westergaard stress function for a central through crack in an infinite plate under tensile loads the mathematical function relationship between the normal mcod and sif was deduced as eq 13 eq 13 is able to eliminate the influence of plate width in the case of 0 05 a w 0 5 13 k max u max e 4 a Ï where u max is the resulting mcod corresponding to the maximum stress Ï max the crack opening sif could be expressed as 14 k o p y a Ï o p Ï a where y a is geometric correction coefficient and eq 11 gives the relationship between vmcod and cos the relationship has already eliminated the effects of crack geometry size hence the geometric correction coefficient in eq 14 y a 1 according to eq 11 and eq 14 the k op could be written as 15 k o p 0 024 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 2 0 172 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 0 015 Ï 0 1 r 2 Ï a therefore according to eqs 12 13 and 15 crack growth rate could be determined by vmcod under cyclic tensile load as eq 16 16 d a d n c k max k o p m k max u max e 4 a Ï k o p 0 024 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 2 0 172 Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 0 015 Ï 0 1 r 2 Ï a figs 14 and 15 shows the fatigue crack growth data da dn Î´k for the 35cd4 steel and 4340 steel material which are found in glinka experiment the material properties are given in table 1 based on the Î´k presented in figs 14 and 15 the vmcod are obtained by eq 17 17 Î´ u 4 a r p 2 Ï e Î´ k where Î´u is vmcod in the cyclic tensile load therefore glinka experimental data da dn Î´k are transformed into forms of da dn Î´u the experimental data da dn Î´u are shown in figs 16 and 17 based on the experimental data Î´k and stress r ratio k max are obtained then according to eq 7 the values of r p can be calculated and then Î´u are determined by eq 17 finally the values of da dn can be obtained by eq 16 which are shown in figs 16 and 17 comparison of the predicted crack propagation rates based on vmcod given by eq 16 vs the experimental data of glinka 1985 is presented from figs 16 and 17 it can be seen from figs 16 and 17 that the predicted results of crack growth rate for 35cd4 steel and 4340 steel based on vmcod are in good agreement with the experimental data over realistic fatigue crack growth rate ranges it is worth noting that since the experimental data of opening stress is difficult to obtain the indirect method is adopted to verify the correctness of the expression of crack opening stress related to vmcod eq 11 based on crack propagation data and effective stress intensity factor eq 16 is proposed in this case it is known that the concept of equivalent stress intensity factor takes into account the influence of plastic zone on the basis of the theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics and in eq 16 k op is used to consider the influence of plastic zone and k max is obtained within the linear elastic stage so the relationship between k max and u max is corrected in eq 16 due to the applicability of the equivalent stress intensity factor eq 16 applies only to the small scale range of yield condition according to eq 17 the experimental data in the crack growth rate da dn Î´k can be transformed into forms of da dn Î´u this is the key to verify the accuracy of the expression of crack opening stress eq 11 proposed in the work by eq 16 since the equivalent crack length a r p 2 in eq 17 is valid for the range of small scale yielding the applicable scope for eq 16 and eq 17 is in the range of r p a 1 10 using the experimental data in the crack growth rate and eqs 16 and 17 the accuracy of the expression of crack opening stress eq 11 can only be verified in the small scale range of yield condition for the range of large scale yielding the accuracy of the expression of crack opening stress will be the focus in our further work the crack propagation experiments will be made in the large scale range of yield condition and the experimental data da dn Î´u will be directly obtain the accuracy of eq 11 can be well verified 6 conclusions this work focus on the estimation of cos via vmcod a series of elastic plastic finite element analysis are performed on a cct specimen to quantify cos and vmcod based on the results the following conclusions can be noted 1 a relationship seeing eq 11 between normalized cos Ï o p Ï 0 1 r 2 and normalized vmcod Î´ u e 1 r a Ï 0 1 n 2 is presented for a cct specimen under plane stress conditions as a result the relationship has the advantages of avoiding adopting fracture parameters around crack tip and eliminating the effects of crack geometry young s modulus yield stress stress r ratio as well as strain hardening 2 the relationship between cos and vmcod is applicable under large scale yielding 3 the relationship could be applied to predict crack growth rates which closely approximate the experimental results and it is believed that this relationship is significant for engineering practices 4 the relationship is only available to cyclic tensile loading further study will be made on the effect of compressive loads
