dimension theory and structural risk minimization principle it has a good promotion ability to handle the classification issues and regression issues the procedure of the svm can be viewed in fig 2 k is kernel function which has ability of transforming the input series x to another space roodposhti et al 2017 the classification regression function of high dimension space can be achieved via selecting the appropriate kernel function then the structure of svm can be obtained by training input data and output data svm method includes ε svm ν svm and least square svm lssvm etc suykens and

was developed by the xin she yang of cambridge university and suash deb of c v raman engineering institute in 2009 nadjemi et al 2017 the characteristics of cs algorithm include the parasitic reproduction strategy of the cuckoo population and levy flight behavior rakhshani et al 2016 the cuckoo never brings up eggs in its own nest they will search in an area to find a best bird nest to left its eggs randomly if parasitic eggs were found by other birds the cuckoo would give up this area the next time the path and position of cuckoo s nest can be demonstrated as follows 15 x i t 1 x i t α l μ υ i 1 2 n where x i t denotes the position of the i th bird s nest in the t th iteration α the factor of the step size to control the random walk step l μ υ the random path of step size the mantegna algorithm is utilized to represent levy flight and step size can be calculated as 16 l μ υ μ υ 1 β 17 μ n 0 σ μ 2 υ n 0 σ υ 2 18 σ μ γ 1 β sin π β 2 γ 1 β 2 2 β 1 2 β 1 β 19 σ υ 1 where β was set to 1 5 in order to make full use of the information provided by the current optimal individual wang et al 2019 the random number r is generated which belongs to zero and one if the random number is greater than the probability of discovery the value of the x i t will be updated in cs algorithm the step generated by levy flight is random and lack of adaptability which can not guarantee the converge speed of the results therefore the step size can be adjusted by the following method walton et al 2013 20 s t e p i s t e p min s t e p max s t e p min d i 21 d i n i n b e s t d max where step max and step min denote the largest step size and least step size n i the position of the i th bird s nest n best the best status of bird s nest d max the maximum distance between the best position of the bird s nest and other nests 3 3 regularization parameter selection based on cs the regularization parameter is a vital parameter to ensure that the svm have a perfect performance in parametric identification cs is proposed that is an effective optimization algorithm to converge the global optimal value and obtain the regularization parameter the cs algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameter c of svm the flow chart can be viewed as fig 3 and the procedures can be demonstrated as follow 1 set the initial range of the penalty parameter c the coefficient of kernel function σ the maximum step size s t e p max the minimum step size s t e p min and the maximum numbers of iteration m max by experience 2 the probability of the nest being found p a are set to 0 75 which can randomly generate the n bird s nests n i 0 every nest represents the individual penalty parameter and coefficient of kernel function the error of the fold of k fold cross validation v is calculated and the best current location of bird s nest x b 0 with related error is found 3 calculate step size of the levy flight by eq 21 and eq 22 to update the other location of the bird s nest a new nest is generated and the related error is obtained 4 compare the predicted error in the new location of bird s nest p t and last location of bird s nest p t 1 and choose the better location of the bird s nest k t 5 the probability of the nest being found pa is compared to the random number r nests with less probability of being found will be contained and nests with bigger probability of being found in p t needs to be regenerated calculate the fitness of new nest and compared it with that of the nests in p t then a better position will replace the worse location which cause a group of gorgeous location of bird s nest p t 6 the optimal bird s nest will be obtained in step 5 if the fitness meets the requirement of the end condition stop searching and exporting the global best fitness and the best location of nest if not back to the step 3 to iteration 3 4 construction of samples for identification in the state of straight forward motion with constant speed we have 22 u 0 v v 0 r 0

interval l the length of usv the other hydrodynamic derivatives can be obtained by the same way therefore the set of a b and c are important to identify the unmanned surface vehicle s dynamic 4 identification results 4 1 data processing in this section the usv s experiment is carried out in the qinghuai river in fig 4 the left part of the draw is the real surroundings which is detected by the dw uboats while the right is that the direction of qinghuai river is about 45 from north east it is obvious that the wave and current exist in the river which means the data includes a lot of noises therefore the gaussian filtering method is utilized to move the much noise the data collected by the receiver per 0 25 s and the 1000 s data is adopted to obtain the dynamic model of the usv the zigzag test of usv is designed and the red line represents the trajectory of usv two different parts of trajectory are selected for training and testing fig 5 shows the 1000 s data for part trajectory of the usv this picture demonstrates the regular of the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate in zigzag trajectory the upper sub figure represents the commended yaw and real yaw the middle sub figure denotes the surge velocity and sway velocity of dw uboat and the lower sub figure is the yaw rate it is clear that when the yaw angle changes from the 90 200 and from 200 to 90 the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate will have significant changes in the whole trend the black chain lines denote this phenomenon in addition although the data in fig 5 has been filtered the curves of the surge sway and yaw rate is not smooth since the randomness of external interference is too large it is difficult to ensure the curves become smooth it may be more difficult to identify the usv s dynamics 4 2 identification results based on the procedure of cs lssvm proposed in the section 3 the initial properties of cs sets are p a is 0 75 and n is 20 the best regularization parameter will be determined to svm structure and the regularization parameter is 5 8 10 7 according to the eq 30 eq 35 the input data and output data can be calculated by the data from the zigzag test then the identified parameters are obtained by the lssvm and which can be shown in table 2 the pso and cv algorithm selected to optimize the lssvm are considered in this section in addition back propagation neural network bpnn is always utilized to system identification and shows a well performance fang et al 2017 therefore the cs lssvm is compared to the pso lssvm cv lssvm and bpnn in identification of usv s dynamics fig 6 shows the comparisons of the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate respectively predicted by these methods in training trajectory and table 3 shows the related mean square error mse it can be observed that these methods all can well predict the 3 dof of usv s dynamics however for the prediction of surge velocity and sway velocity it is obvious that the cs lssvm has a better predictive capability than other methods in the real environment and the related values of mse can also support this phenomenon in addition the convergency speed of the cs lssvm is faster than other methods it means that the cuckoo search method can easily find the best parameters of the support vector machine fig 7 shows the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate in test trajectory it can be viewed that cs lssvm pso lssvm and cv lssvm still enjoy good abilities of prediction while the bpnn is not able to predict accurately table 4 shows that the results predicted by cs lssvm are more accuracy and the convergence speed is faster in any freedom cv as trail and error method is a little time consuming to obtain the suitable solution in this problem but this method not get precise optimization results the pso can find the global optimum for svm but sometimes it fails to provide globally optimal solutions instead of locally optimal ones the draws of bpnn is learning time is long and easily falls into the local minimums or overfittings for the cs owing to the cuckoo search based on levy flight is a random walk which is also a markov chain whose next state position only depends on the current state and the transition probability however other methods new parameters should be generated by far field randomization and their positions should be far enough away from the current optimal solution which will ensure that the system will not fall into local optimal the cs lssvm has a better generalization ability and faster convergency speed in this paper the system identification is offline 4000 data were selected to train the dynamic models it is tested that the cs lssvm has a better prediction ability than other mainstream methods therefore for the online system identification in the future this method can be a potential application to build up dynamic models of usv in the different environments wind wave and current etc in terms of computational time and finite samples 5 conclusion in this paper the abkowitz model is adopted to describe the usv s dynamics the zigzag test of usv is carried out in the real environment with wind current and other disturbances for the first time the svm method enhanced cs algorism is firstly proposed to identify the dw uboat s dynamics by utilizing the experimental data the hydrodynamic derivatives of the abkowitz model are also obtained by the cs lssvm the comparison among cs lssvm pso lssvm cv lssvm and bpnn are considered in two trajectories one for training and one for testing the results show that the cs lssvm method has better ability of identification than other methods which enjoy higher accuracy and faster convergence speed in the real environment therefore this new method has a good generalization capability to identify the usv s dynamics in real environment author contributions section peng fei xu supervision and revised the paper chen cheng write the paper and

was developed by the xin she yang of cambridge university and suash deb of c v raman engineering institute in 2009 nadjemi et al 2017 the characteristics of cs algorithm include the parasitic reproduction strategy of the cuckoo population and levy flight behavior rakhshani et al 2016 the cuckoo never brings up eggs in its own nest they will search in an area to find a best bird nest to left its eggs randomly if parasitic eggs were found by other birds the cuckoo would give up this area the next time the path and position of cuckoo s nest can be demonstrated as follows 15 x i t 1 x i

is greater than the probability of discovery the value of the x i t will be updated in cs algorithm the step generated by levy flight is random and lack of adaptability which can not guarantee the converge speed of the results therefore the step size can be adjusted by the following method walton et al 2013 20 s t e p i s t e p min s t e p max s t e p min d i 21 d i n i n b e s t d max where step max and step min denote the largest step size and least step size n i the position of the i th bird s nest n best the best status of bird s nest d max the maximum distance between the best position of the bird s nest and other nests 3 3 regularization parameter selection based on cs the regularization parameter is a vital parameter to ensure that the svm have a perfect performance in parametric identification cs is proposed that is an effective optimization algorithm to converge the global optimal value and obtain the regularization parameter the cs algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameter c of svm the flow chart can be viewed as fig 3 and the procedures can be demonstrated as follow 1 set the initial range of the penalty parameter c the coefficient of kernel

which can randomly generate the n bird s nests n i 0 every nest represents the individual penalty parameter and coefficient of kernel function the error of the fold of k fold cross validation v is calculated and the best current location of bird s nest x b 0 with related error is found 3 calculate step size of the levy flight by eq 21 and eq 22 to update the other location of the bird s nest a new nest is generated and the related error is obtained 4 compare the predicted error in the new location of bird s nest p t and last location of bird s nest p t 1 and choose the better location of the bird s nest k t 5 the probability of the nest being found pa is compared to the random number r nests with less probability of being found will be contained and nests with bigger probability of being found in p t needs to be regenerated calculate the fitness of new nest and compared it with that of the nests in p t then a better position will replace the worse location which cause a group of gorgeous location of bird s nest p t 6 the optimal bird s nest will be obtained in step 5 if the fitness meets the requirement of the end condition stop searching and exporting the global best fitness

interval l the length of usv the other hydrodynamic derivatives can be obtained by the same way therefore the set of a b and c are important to identify the unmanned surface vehicle s dynamic 4 identification results 4 1 data processing in this section the usv s experiment is carried out in the qinghuai river in fig 4 the left part of the draw is the real surroundings which is detected by the dw uboats while the right is that the direction of qinghuai river is about 45 from north east it is obvious that the wave and current exist in the river which means the data includes a lot of noises therefore the gaussian filtering method is utilized to move the much noise the data collected by the receiver per 0 25 s and the 1000 s data is adopted to obtain the dynamic model of the usv the zigzag test of usv is designed and the red line represents the trajectory of usv two different parts of trajectory are selected for training and testing fig 5 shows the 1000 s data for part trajectory of the usv this picture demonstrates the regular of the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate in zigzag trajectory the upper sub figure represents the commended yaw and real yaw the middle sub figure denotes the surge velocity and sway velocity of dw uboat and the lower sub figure is the yaw rate it is clear that when the yaw angle changes from the 90 200 and from 200 to 90 the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate will have significant changes in the whole trend the black chain lines denote this phenomenon in addition although the data in fig 5 has been filtered the curves of the surge sway and yaw rate is not smooth since the randomness of external interference is too large it is difficult to ensure the curves become smooth it may be more difficult to identify the usv s dynamics 4 2 identification results based on the procedure of cs lssvm proposed in the section 3 the initial properties of cs sets are p a is 0 75 and n is 20 the best regularization parameter will be determined to svm structure and the regularization parameter is 5 8 10 7 according to the eq 30 eq 35 the input data and output data can be calculated by the data from the zigzag test then the identified parameters are obtained by the lssvm and which can be shown in table 2 the pso and cv algorithm selected to optimize the lssvm are considered in this section in addition back propagation neural network bpnn is always utilized to system identification and shows a well performance fang et al 2017 therefore the cs lssvm is compared to the pso lssvm cv lssvm and bpnn in identification of usv s dynamics fig 6 shows the comparisons of the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate respectively predicted by these methods in training trajectory and table 3 shows the related mean square error mse it can be observed that these methods all can well predict the 3 dof of usv s dynamics however for the prediction of surge velocity and sway velocity it is obvious that the cs lssvm has a better predictive capability than other methods in the real environment and the related values of mse can also support this phenomenon in addition the convergency speed of the cs lssvm is faster than other methods it means that the cuckoo search method can easily find the best parameters of the support vector machine fig 7 shows the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw rate in test trajectory it can be viewed that cs lssvm pso lssvm and cv lssvm still enjoy good abilities of prediction while the bpnn is not able to predict accurately table 4 shows that the results predicted by cs lssvm are more accuracy and the convergence speed is faster in any freedom cv as trail and error method is a little time consuming to obtain the suitable solution in this problem but this method not get precise optimization results the pso can find the global optimum for svm but sometimes it fails to provide globally optimal solutions instead of locally optimal ones the draws of bpnn is learning time is long and easily falls into the local minimums or overfittings for the cs owing to the cuckoo search based on levy flight is a random walk which is also a markov chain whose next state position only depends on the current state and the transition probability however other methods new parameters should be generated by far field randomization and their positions should be far enough away from the current optimal solution which will ensure that the system will not fall into local optimal the cs lssvm has a better generalization ability and faster convergency speed in this paper the system identification is offline 4000 data were selected to train the dynamic models it is tested that the cs lssvm has a better prediction ability than other mainstream methods therefore for the online system identification in the future this method can be a potential application to build up dynamic models of usv in the different environments wind wave and current etc in terms of computational time and finite samples 5 conclusion in this paper the abkowitz model is adopted to describe the usv s dynamics the zigzag test of usv is carried out in the real environment with wind current and other disturbances for the first time the svm method enhanced cs algorism is firstly proposed to identify the dw uboat s dynamics by utilizing the experimental data the hydrodynamic derivatives of the abkowitz model are also obtained by the cs lssvm the comparison among cs lssvm pso lssvm cv lssvm and bpnn are considered in two trajectories one for training and one for testing the results show that the cs lssvm method has better ability of identification than other methods which enjoy higher accuracy and faster convergence speed in the real environment therefore this new method has a good generalization capability to identify the usv s dynamics in real environment author contributions section peng fei xu supervision and revised the paper chen cheng write the paper and

22156,the berthing or mooring facilities in ports and or harbors are usually in the form of a group of vertical columns these structures are arranged in close proximity to the long vertical harbor wall accurate prediction of wave force on such structures is of importance yet challenging as both interferences among cylinders as well as between cylinders and the wall must be correct in this work a novel analytical model has been developed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of such structures within the framework of linear wave theory the original problem is considered to be equivalent to that of two symmetrical arrays of cylinders in open water both are exposed to the ambient incident waves the original array of cylinders is labelled as real cylinders hereafter and the second array as image cylinders the assumption of full wave reflection on the wall is essential by using this treatment due to the symmetry simple relationships between the diffracted waves from the real and image cylinders are found which reduces the number of unknowns associated with the velocity potential by half after solving the velocity potential the wave forces as well as the surface elevation are evaluated two different solutions have been developed for the calculation of mean drift wave force one is based on the direct pressure integration and the other is based on the application of momentum conservation theorem in a limited fluid volume surrounding a certain cylinder in the array then the systematic analysis is performed for a line array of equally spaced cylinders parallel to a vertical wall largely amplified wave forces are found at specific wave frequencies which occur with the appearance of pronounced wave runup around the cylinders furthermore the relative contribution of the first order and the mean drift wave forces to the total wave force is examined keywords image principle bounded water nonlinear wave force cylinder array wave runup 1 introduction the foundations for many coastal and offshore structures for example bridges oil drilling platforms wind farms and airport are usually groups of cylinders that are arranged in various configurations the berthing or mooring facilities in ports and harbor areas are also exhibited in this form in addition the concept of wave energy converter wec farms have being proposed in which the individual cylindrical wec may be arranged in a certain layout to maximize the total wave energy capturing as the wave interaction with a group of bodies have a wide range of practical applications various works ranging from analytical studies through to model scale testing and numerical modelling have been done on this subject when the incident wave acts upon a group of bodies the presence of a given body will affect the incident wave by producing a scattered wave which will in turn be scattered by adjacent bodies for the problem of waves scattered from an array of vertical cylinders a family of the so called direct matrix method is widely used to take into account the multiple scattering effect see e g spring and monkmeyer 1974 linton and evans 1990 duclos and clément 2004 walker and eatock taylor 2005 and zeng et al 2019 in this method waves scattered from each body are solved simultaneously subject to the boundary conditions of the respective bodies similar to the solution procedure of the direct matrix method solutions of wave scattering by an array of truncated circular cylinders or elliptical cylinders have also been derived by researchers based on the physical idea of multiple scattering in conjunction with the appropriate eigenfunction expansion of the velocity potential examples include iskandarani and liu 1988 chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos 2010 child 2010 and göteman 2017 in these works the unknowns associated with the velocity potential are determined by applying the matching technology or solving the boundary integral equation the waves scattered from each cylinder can then be solved simultaneously alternatively the scattering of water waves by a group of bodies can also be solved based on an iterative procedure incorporating successive reflections between the bodies this method was pioneered by twersky 1952 and then extended to the case of surface waves by ohkusu 1974 by combing the iterative technology in ohkusu 1974 and the feature of direct matrix method in spring and monkmeyer 1974 kagemoto and yue 1986 developed an interaction theory to solve the three dimensional wave scattering by a structure consisting of a number of separate elements based algebraically on the scattering characteristics of each individual element based on the iterative theory extensive studies related to an array of truncated cylinders have been performed by researchers examples include yilmaz and incecik 1998 yilmaz et al 2001 and siddorn and eatock taylor 2008 recently zhang et al 2019 investigated the cloaking phenomenon referring to the condition that there exist no radial outgoing waves for an array of truncated cylinders based on the interaction theory of kagemoto and yue 1986 with the development of computing technology mesh based numerical modelling methods have also been widely used the frequency domain analysis of the multiple scattering effect based on the boundary element and or finite element method can be found in walker et al 2008 grice et al 2013 and cong et al 2014 2015 among others in the frequency domain analysis the nonlinear effect can be considered up to the second order with respect to the wave steepness if the nonlinear effect beyond the second order is important such as multi column structures exposed to the action of extreme waves the fully nonlinear modelling in time domain is then used this method is applicable for steep incident wave conditions and some violent phenomena in the process of wave propagation and deformation can be captured the application of fully nonlinear numerical modelling to an array of vertical columns subject to extreme ocean waves can be found in ma et al 2001b 2001a wang and wu 2010 and bai et al 2014 to date the hydrodynamic properties of structures in open water have been extensively studied as aforementioned the numerical analytical treatment for such structures in open water is inherently different to those in coastal areas where the vertical wall exists the effect of nearby vertical walls on the hydrodynamic properties of structures in bounded water have been assessed by some researchers calisal and sabuncu 1989 developed an efficient computational method to investigate the effect of the parallel side walls of a towing tank on the hydrodynamic coefficients of a heaving cylinder in the tank the total radiation potential is the expressed as a sum of the potentials associated with the real cylinder as well as a series of image cylinders teng et al 2004 developed an exact analytical method to tackle the wave radiation by a vertical column near a wharf represented by a fully reflective infinite vertical wall the original problem was transformed into an equivalent one associated with two symmetrically arranged cylinders in open water by applying the image principle teng et al 2004 s work was later extended to other bounded water cases such as the wave diffraction from a vertical column in front of orthogonal vertical walls ning et al 2005 action of ship waves on a nearby vertical column that is in front of a vertical wall sun et al 2007 and wave interaction with a porous column near a vertical wall cong et al 2019 in addition the assumption of full wave reflection on the wall was also applied to investigate the performance of cylindrical wave energy converters that are installed near a wharf see zheng and zhang 2015 chatjigeorgiou 2019 the wave interaction with an array of vertical cylinders are closely related to the engineering practice to date the hydrodynamics associated with a cylinder array in open water has been extensively studied in the meantime the cylinder array has also been widely installed in front of a vertical wall hence a problem of bounded water in this study we aim to explore the hydrodynamic properties associated with multiple columns near a vertical wall and an analytically based approach to this problem which can provide solutions including the linear and nonlinear wave force as well as the surface elevation distribution has been newly developed in the solution procedure the original problem is equivalent to that of wave interaction with two symmetrical arrays of cylinders in open water simple relationships between the diffracted waves from original real cylinders and the image cylinders are found which reduces the number of unknowns associated with the velocity potential by half the wave elevation distribution as well as the first order and second order mean drift wave force on the cylinders are evaluated in this study in the following sections the underlying mathematical problem and analytical solution are firstly introduced in section 2 the calculation of the first order and the second order mean drift wave force is then presented in section 3 which is followed by the convergence test and validation in section 4 the parametric study is performed in section 5 finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 mathematical problem and analytical solution as shown in fig 1 an arbitrary array of n bottom mounted circular cylinders is placed in front of a vertical wall at a constant water depth d the cylinders are exposed to a plane incident wave of angular frequency ω and wave amplitude a a global cartesian coordinate system oxyz is adopted with an origin located on the still free surface the z axis is defined positive upwards and the oyz plane coincides with the vertical wall the incident wave propagates at an angle of β with respect to the positive x axis it is assumed that the vertical wall is infinite long and fully reflective the original hydrodynamic problem in bounded water is then transformed into an equivalent one in open fluid domain in which the real n cylinders and their image virtual cylinders with respect to the wall are exposed to the action of dual incident waves without the presence of the wall by applying the image principle teng et al 2004 this system is termed imaginary system hereafter there are 2n cylinders in the imaginary system in total as shown in fig 2 the cylinders numbered as j 1 2 n are real cylinders while those numbered as j n 1 n 2 2n are image ones on the still free surface the centre of the jth cylinder at x j y j 0 is taken as the origin of a local polar coordinate system ojr j θ j z j where θ j is measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis and the z j axis directs vertically upwards one of the dual incident waves propagates at an angle of β and the other hence at an angle of π β within the framework of potential flow theory in which the flow is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and irrotational the flow field can be described by a scalar velocity potential φ satisfying the laplace s equation 1 2 φ x t 0 for a linear time harmonic incident wave with an angular frequency of ω the velocity potential can be expressed in a complex spatial form as 2 φ x t re φ r θ z e i ω t where re stands for taking the real part i 1 when considering the wave action with stationary bodies the total velocity potential φ can be written as a summation of the incident potential φ i and the diffraction potential φ d i e 3 φ φ i φ d the incident velocity potential is due to undisturbed dual plane incident waves propagating at angles of β and π β respectively and it is expressed as 4 φ i i a g ω z 0 κ 0 z e i κ 0 y sin β e i κ 0 x cos

sin β for the boundary value problems bvps appropriate boundary conditions on the free surface the impermeable body surface and the sea bed are also required for solving φ d they are given by 9 φ d z

local polar coordinate system and it is positive when pointing out of the fluid domain in addition the following sommerfeld radiation condition at far field has also to be satisfied 12 lim r r φ d r i κ 0 φ d 0 due to the axisymmetric geometry of the cylinders the method of separation of variables can be used to derive the expression of the diffraction potential the solution of φ d can be achieved by associating with each cylinder a general potential that describes the wave diffraction from the cylinder the form of individual wave diffraction potential follows that in maniar and newman 1997 hence we have 13 φ d j 1 2 n m a m j c m j h m κ 0 r j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j in which a m j are the unknown coefficients the coefficients c m j are defined by 14 c m j j m κ 0 a j h m κ 0 a j in which h m x stands for the hankel functions of the first kind of order m c m j is introduced for convenience later when satisfying the body surface boundary condition the developed expression of the diffraction potential inherently satisfies the laplace s equation and the boundary conditions shown in eqs 9 11 and 12 in eq 13 the waves diffracted from different cylinders are expressed in their respective local polar coordinate systems to facilitate the application of eq 10 it is essential to express all terms in eq 13 in the same coordinate system this can be accomplished by using graf s addition theorem for bessel functions 15 h n κ 0 r k e i n θ k m h m n κ 0 r k j j m κ 0 r j e i n α k j m α j k e i m θ j in eq 15 r k j is the distance between the centres of the jth and the kth cylinders α j k is the angle defined positive counterclockwise from the positive x axis to the line joining the centres of the jth and the kth cylinders then the diffraction potential can be expressed in the jth local polar coordinate system as 16 φ d r j θ j z j m a m j c m j h m κ 0 r j k 1 k j 2 n n a n k c n k δ m n j k j m κ 0 r j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j in which 17 δ m n j k h n m κ 0 r k j 1 m

in eq 16 i e a m j the infinite series in eq 16 has to be truncated and only 2m 1 fourier modes from mode m to mode m are kept then applying eq 10 and equating the fourier coefficients with the same harmonic in θ j give 18 a m j k 1 k j 2 n n m m a n k c n k δ m n j k λ m j with 1 j 2n eq 18 provides a finite set of 2n 2m 1 equations to determine the unknowns for m m m as shown in fig 2 on the still free surface the centres of the jth and the n j th cylinders are symmetrical to the y axis i e x j x j n and they own the same radius i e a j a j n due to the symmetrical arrangement of the 2n

lead to the following relationship for δ m n j k 22a δ m n j k δ m n n j n k 22b δ m n j n k δ m n n j k with 1 j k n the set of linear equations in eq 18 can be rewritten as 23a a m j k 1 k j n n m m

are derived based on the boundary condition satisfied on the impermeable surfaces of the real and image cylinders respectively by using eqs 19 20 and 22 eq 23b can be rewritten as 24 a m n j k 1 k j n n m m a n n k c n k δ m n j k k 1 n n m m a n k c n n k δ m n j n k λ m j the system consisting of eqs 23a and 24 owns the same solution as that of eq 18 it is noted that in eqs 23a and 24 except the unknowns all the other coefficients keep the same here we define another set of coefficients b m j as 25a b m n j a m j 25b b m j a m n j with 1 j n the substitution of eq 25 into eqs 23a and 24 respectively can lead to 26a b m j k 1 k j n n m m b n k c n k δ m n j k k 1 n n m m b n n k c n n k δ m n j n k λ m j 26b b m n j k 1 k j n n m m b n n k c n k δ m n j k k 1 n n m m b n k c n n k δ m n j n k λ m j with 1 j k n from the comparison of eqs 26a and 26b with eqs 23a and 24 it is observed that the system of equations for b m j is equivalent to that for a m j and the solutions of a m j and b m j are the same which indicates the following relationship is held for the unknowns related to the real and image cylinders 27 a m j a m n j with 1 j n then based on eqs 23a and 27 a set of n

of algebraic equations in eq 28 can be solved by standard matrix techniques compared with eq 18 eqs 27 and 28 constitute a reduced system in which only n 2m 1 equations need to be solved with the aid of a simple relationship between the unknowns related to the real and image cylinders with the solution of the velocity potential the fluid particle velocity can be obtained by calculating the gradient of the velocity potential then the velocity component of a fluid particle in the x direction i e u can be determined according to 29 u i a g ω z 0 κ 0 z e i κ 0 y sin β i κ 0 cos β e i κ 0 x

27 into eq 30 it is clear that u is zero at this location which demonstrates that the no flow condition along the vertical wall is well respected in the imaginary system 3 calculation of the first order and the second order mean drift wave force the wave forces acting on a body can be computed by integrating the pressure over the body surface with the velocity potential being available the fluid pressure can be obtained from bernoulli s equation according to eqs 3 6 and 16 the velocity potential in the vicinity of the jth cylinder is then expressed as 31 φ r j θ j z j m λ m j j m κ 0 r

eq 31 which is given by 32 φ r j θ j z j m p m j r j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j in which 33 p m j r j a m j c m j h m κ 0 r j j m κ 0 r j when r j a j by using the wronskian relationships for bessel functions p m j r j can be further expressed as 34 p m j a j 2 a m j i π κ 0 a j h m κ 0 a j then the linear hydrodynamic pressure on the jth cylinder i e p j θ j z j can be expressed as 35 p j θ j z j m 2 ω ρ a m j π κ 0 a j h m κ 0 a j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j the first order wave force and moment are due to the linear hydrodynamic pressure and can be obtained by the pressure integration over the body surface then the amplitudes of the first order horizontal wave forces on the jth cylinder f j x and f j y are given by 36 f j x f j y 1 i 2 ω ρ h 1 κ 0 a j tanh κ 0 d κ 0 2 a 1 j a 1 j meanwhile the amplitudes of the first order wave moments on the jth cylinder m j x and m j y can be determined according to 37 m j x m j y i 1 2 ω ρ h 1 κ 0 a j κ 0 d sinh κ 0 d cosh κ 0 d 1 κ 0 3 cosh κ 0 d a 1 j a 1 j hereinafter when calculating the wave moment the rotation centre x c j is located at the centre of the cylinder on the sea bottom i e x j y j d besides the first order wave force the second order mean drift wave force can also be obtained based on the linear wave theory currently many studies have been devoted to derive the general formulation of the mean drift wave force such as newman 1967 pinkster 1980 ogilvie 1983 and chen 2007 the formulation consists of direct pressure integrations on the body surface is called the near field formulation the near field formulation is general as it can be used to obtain all components of the mean drift wave force applied to one individual body in a single or multi body system referring to the established near field formulation such as that in ogilvie 1983 the mean drift wave force and moment on the jth cylinder f j and m j can be computed by 38a f j ρ 4 s b j φ φ n j d s ρ g 4 γ w j η η n j d l 38b m j ρ 4 s b j φ φ x x c j n j d s ρ g 4 γ w j η η x x c j n j d l in which s b j stands for the mean body surface of the jth cylinder γ w j stands for the intersection of s b j with mean free surface z 0 η is the amplitude of the first order wave elevation and can be determined according to 39 η i ω g φ z 0 for vertically axisymmetric bodies the surface integrals in eq 38 can be reduced to line integrals after integrating in the circumferential direction and applying the orthogonality thus by introducing eq 32 into eq 38 the mean drift wave force and moment on the jth cylinder can be further expressed as 40a f j x ρ π a j 2 n

integration the mean drift wave force can also be obtained by applying the momentum conservation theorem to a control fluid volume surrounding the body if the control fluid volume is extended to infinity i e the entire fluid volume the mean drift wave force can be deduced from the quantities at far field and the far field formulation is then derived as the mean drift wave force on a certain cylinder in the array i e the jth cylinder rather than the global mean drift wave force on the whole array is concerned in this study the momentum conservation theorem is then applied to a control fluid volume ω c j surrounding the jth cylinder rather than the entire fluid volume ω c j is limited by the body surface of the jth cylinder a control surface s c j and the free surface and sea bed between them the undisturbed wetted surface ofs c j is defined by r j r j d z 0 and 0 θ j 2π the definition of the control surface surrounding the jth cylinder is given in fig 3 following mei et al 2005 by using the kinematic transport theorem and gauss theorem the wave force on the jth cylinder can be related to the total linear momentum in ω c j that is 43 f j x f j y s c j s d j s f j p n x j n y j ρ u v u n j d s d d t m x j m y j in which f j x and f j y are the horizontal wave force components on the jth cylinder s f j and s d j are the limited free surface and sea bed in ω c j u u v w t is the vector of fluid particle velocity m j x and m j y are the horizontal components of the total linear momentum in ω c j when the time average is taken and the periodicity is invoked the last term on the right hand side of eq 43 gives no contribution then the mean drift wave force components are 44 f j x f j y s c j s d j s f j p n x j n y j ρ u v u n j d s in which an over bar indicates the average over a wave period by making use of the bernoulli s equation and preserving the second order terms with respect to the wave steepness we can get 45a f j x re ρ 4 s c j φ φ cos θ j 2 φ r φ x d s ω 2 g γ c j φ φ cos θ j d l 45b f j y re ρ 4 s c j φ φ sin θ j 2 φ r φ y d s ω 2 g γ c j φ φ sin θ j d l in eq 45 γ c j stands for the intersection of control surface s c j with the mean free surface z 0 thus by introducing eq 32 into eq 45 and making use of orthogonality eq 45 can be further expressed as 46a f j x ρ π r j 2 n 0 κ 0 d re m p m j r j p m 1 j r j m m 1 r j 2 p m j r j p m 1 j r j κ 0 2 q m j r j q m 1 j r j q m 1 j r j p m j r j m r j q m 1 j r j p m j r j m r j 46b f j y ρ π r j 2 n 0 κ 0 d re m i p m j r j p m 1 j r j m m 1 r j 2 p m j r j p m 1 j r j κ 0 2 q m j r j q m 1 j r j q m 1 j r j p m j r j m r j q m 1 j r j p m j r j m r j in which q m j r j is the derivative of p m j r j with respect to r j that is 47 q m j r j κ 0 a m j c m j h m κ 0 r j j m κ 0 r j now an alternative solution is derived for the mean drift wave force on the cylinders placed near a vertical wall based on the conservation principle of momentum then the validity of the present model can be examined by comparing the mean drift wave force results based on the two different solutions 4 convergence test and validation the convergence and validity of the developed model are examined first to ensure that the truncation number selected is optimal an array of three identical cylinders that are located close to a vertical wall is considered here the cylinders are spaced equally and lined up in a row parallel to the wall each cylinder has a radius of a i e a 1 a 2 a 3 a the distance between the centres of adjacent cylinders is b 4a the distance between the wall and the back stagnation point of the cylinder array is e a the layout of the cylinder array is given in fig 4 the wave heading and water depth are fixed at β π 4 and d 5a respectively hereinafter ρ g a j 2 a and ρ g a j 2 a d are used to nondimensionalize the first order wave force and moment respectively ρ g a j a a and ρ g a j a a d are used to nondimensionalize the second order mean drift wave force and moment respectively the accuracy of the calculation of wave force and moment is mainly influenced by the number of fourier modes in the numerical algorithm the fourier modes from the order m to m have been considered the first order wave force and moment on the centre cylinder in the array are shown in fig 5 for various values of m the results for the second order mean drift wave force and moment calculated by the direct pressure integration i e eqs 40 and 41 are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the choices of m 10 15 and 20 give almost the same results which indicates that the present model possesses good convergence characteristics it can also be observed that the first order wave force and moment follow the similar trend with κ 0 a as expected due to the fact that the first order wave moment is proportional to the first order wave force as shown in eqs 36 and 37 as the fluid particle velocity decays in an exponential manner along the gravity direction the mean drift wave force and moment are dominated by the dynamic pressure near the mean free surface around the mean free surface the ratio between the contributions of the dynamic pressure to m j y and f j x is d while that between m j x and f j y is d therefore in fig 5 m j y follows a similar trend to that of f j x while m j x follows an almost opposite trend to that of f j y the proposed analytical model is then verified by cross checking the results of mean drift wave force based on different methods in table 1 and table 2 nf and mc are used to denote the results based on the direct pressure integration eq 40 and the momentum conservation theorem eq 46 respectively four wave frequencies i e κ 0 a 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 have been considered when the calculation is performed based on eq 46 the radius of the control surface is twice of that of the cylinder inside i e r j 2a j it can be seen from tables 1 and 2 that the two different methods give almost the same converged results providing confidence in the use of the model in addition it is obvious that m 15 leads to a convergent solution hence being used hereafter in this study the mean drift wave force on a certain cylinder rather than the global mean drift wave force on the whole array is concerned therefore the momentum conservation theorem is only applied to a control fluid volume surrounding this cylinder rather than the entire fluid volume then the mean drift wave force on the cylinder can be determined by using the quantities on the control surface which is the exterior circular boundary of the control volume the control surface is in the vicinity of the cylinder and cannot intersect other cylinders in the array the waves diffracted from different cylinders in the array can still obviously disturb the quantities distributed on the control surface as a result in tables 1 and 2 the results based on the momentum conservation theorem do not show obvious superiority over those based on the direct pressure integration in the aspect of convergence rate another check that needs to be carried out is the dependence of the results on the size of the control surface associated with the second method fig 7 shows the variation of the second order mean drift wave force with varying m for different cases of control surfaces the radius of the control surface is varied as r j 1 5a j 2a j and 2 5a j respectively noting that r j 2a j was used in the previous convergence test in tables 1 and 2 from fig 7 it is noted that different choices of control surfaces give the same converged results i e the results are independent on the size of the control surface 5 results and discussions a detailed parametric study concerning a straight line array of equally spaced cylinders parallel to a vertical wall is performed all the cylinders in the array are identical and with a radius of a the effect of wave conditions as well as geometric parameters of the cylinder array is then assessed as the main trend of wave moment can be detected from that of wave force as discussed before the results of wave moment are not shown in this section for brevity in addition the constant water depth is fixed at d 5a in the following study the case that a single cylinder is placed close to a wall is firstly investigated and severed as a reference case on the still free surface the centre of the cylinder is located at e a 0 0 the effect of e on the first order and the second order mean drift wave forces on the cylinder is shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively with the wave heading being fixed at β 0 to achieve a better understanding the results of wave forces on a single cylinder in open water have also been included in figs 8 and 9 referred as uw according to kim and yue 1989 and linton and evans 1990 the first order and the second order mean drift wave forces on an isolated cylinder f ˆ x and f ˆ x under normal incidence can be determined according to 48a f ˆ x 4 ρ g a h 1 κ 0 a tanh κ 0 d κ 0 2 48b f ˆ x 4 ρ g a a a π 2 κ 0 a 3 1 2 κ 0 d sinh 2 κ 0 d m 0 n n 1 κ 0 a 2 1 2 1 h m κ 0 a 2 h m 1 κ 0 a 2 it is clearly from figs 8 and 9 that the existence of the wall plays significant roles on the hydrodynamic behaviors of the cylinders for all the gaps considered the first order wave force on an isolated cylinder in open water increases monotonously with κ 0 a to its peak and then decrease as κ 0 a further increases however the force curves experience significant oscillations when the cylinder is located in proximity to a wall as remarked in teng et al 2004 the occurrence of the oscillation is associated with wave reflections from the wall the reflected waves can either be in phase or out of phase with the incident wave in the vicinity of the cylinder hence resulting in constructive or destructive interferences at different wave frequencies similarly these oscillation behaviors are observed for the mean drift wave force whose main trend is different when compared to the first order wave force the mean drift wave force increases firstly with κ 0 a to its peak and then remains at its peak as κ 0 a further increases the first order and the mean drift wave force are dominated by the linear and the quadratic dynamic pressure respectively the wave pressure around the water line contributes significantly to the horizontal wave force along the water line the linear dynamic pressure is directly proportional to the wave elevation meanwhile the quadratic dynamic pressure depends on the square of the fluid velocity in head on seas β 0 the fluid particle around the lee side and the weather side of the cylinder moves only in the vertical direction leading to the quadratic dynamic pressure proportional to the square of the wave elevation however in the regions between the lee side and the weather side the fluid particle moves not only in the vertical direction but also in the circumferential direction then the behavior of the quadratic dynamic pressure in these regions is different from that of the linear dynamic pressure as a result the main trend of the mean drift wave force is different from that of the first order wave force and the frequencies of the obvious peaks in fig 8 do not coincide with those in fig 9 for each value of e the oscillation of the mean drift wave force gets less obvious as κ 0 a increases in addition the mean drift wave force curve oscillates more quickly as the cylinder moves away from wall e increases the effect of wave heading on the first order and the second order mean drift wave force is illustrated in figs 10 and 11 respectively with e a the wave heading increases from 0 to π 4 with an interval of π 12 under oblique incidence the wave force on the cylinder still behaves in an oscillatory manner as β increases gradually the dual incident wave trains in the imaginary system gradually tends to be parallel with each other and their respective contributions to the wave force gradually are becoming to be uniform as a result the wave force curve oscillates less quickly with κ 0 a as wave obliqueness increases it is also noted that the obvious peak of the wave force component in the y direction gradually increases as β increases see figs 10 b and 11 b this can be attributed to the increase of projection area of wave action along the y axis as β increases the wave action with an array of n cylinders close to a wall is then investigated the cases of n 2 3 and 5 are considered in the subsequent study and only head on seas are considered for the jth cylinder in the array the coordinate of its centre on the free surface is e a j 1 b 0 with j 1 2 n the layout of the cylinder array with n 3 has been shown in fig 4 the first order and the second order mean drift wave force component in x direction on the cylinders are presented in figs 12 and 13 respectively with e a equivalent results for e 2a are shown in figs 14 and 15 and those for e 3a are shown in figs 16 and 17 the results for a single cylinder in front of a wall are also included for direct comparisons when a cylinder is placed in an array the existence of adjacent cylinders can make a disturbance on the wave field around it as a result small fluctuation riding on that with n 1 can be observed from the wave force with n 2 3 and 5 the adjacent cylinders obviously affect the movement of the fluid particle not only in the vertical direction but also in the horizontal plane it suggests that its effect on the quadratic dynamic pressure is more significant than that on the linear dynamic pressure therefore it is observed that the fluctuation riding on the mean drift wave force is more obvious after placing a cylinder in an array obvious amplification or diminishment of the peak wave force can be observed a shift of the frequency of peak wave force can also be found such shift generally becomes less obvious as the cylinder array moves away from the wall e increases it is also noted that as the number of cylinders in the array increases the inference effect gets more pronounced and the fluctuation riding on the wave force generally gets more evident and frequent in figs 18 20 the wave field around a row of n vertical stationary cylinders close to a wall is presented for different wave frequencies in fig 18 the wave field is presented for κ 0 a 0 5 0 44 and 0 93 with e a b 4a and n 2 it can be seen that significant peaks and troughs occur alternatively in the upstream region of the cylinder array at κ 0 a 0 5 and 0 44 see fig 18 a and b a large amount of wave is entrapped between the wall and the cylinders generating significant wave elevation in this region significant first order wave force and negative mean drift wave force are then induced respectively at κ 0 a 0 93 obviously amplified wave elevation can be found at the weather side of the cylinders see fig 18 c inducing a significant positive mean drift wave force equivalent results for n 3 and 5 are shown in figs 19 and 20 respectively the wave fields shown in figs 19 and 20 also correspond to the situations where the significant wave force are induced on the cylinders these figures also suggest that the peak wave force occurs in the situation where significant wave runup is generated around the lee side or the weather side of the cylinders the effect of the distance between adjacent cylinders on the wave force is then examined the results of the first order and the second order mean drift wave force on a row of cylinders close to a wall are shown in figs 21 and 22 respectively with e a b 3a and β 0 those for b 5a are shown in figs 23 and 24 meanwhile those for b 4a have been given in figs 12 and 13 not surprisingly the interference effect from adjacent cylinders on the first order wave force gets less obvious as b increases as the cylinders are close to each other i e b 3a the interference effect is pronounced and it can largely amplify the significant peak of the first order wave force see fig 21 a such amplification becomes weaker as b increases and a diminishment of the peak wave force can even be induced when b 5a see fig 23 a the interference effect can also obviously affect the mean drift wave force the fluctuation riding on the mean drift wave force with b 5a is less obvious but more frequent than that with b 3a and 4a it can also be noted that the interference effect can largely amplify the significant negative mean drift wave force in the low frequency region and such amplification becomes progressively less obvious as b increases the relative contribution of the first order and the second order mean drift wave force to the total wave force on cylinders close to a wall is examined a comparison of the first order and the mean drift wave force component in the x direction is presented in fig 25 here all the cylinders have dimensional radii of a 1 m and the spacing between the axes of adjacent cylinders are fixed at b 4a the cylinders are under normal wave incidence and the wave steepness κ 0 a increases from 0 06 to 0 1 in fig 25 a the case of a single cylinder is considered the comparison considering the wave action with a row of 2 3 or 5 cylinders are presented in fig 25 b c and d respectively the wave force gets progressively obvious as the wave steepness increases even though the mean drift wave force can be largely amplified after placing the cylinders close to wall it is still much smaller in magnitude than that of the first order wave force and its contribution to the total wave force is obviously less important 6 conclusion the interaction of water waves with an array of bottom mounted circular cylinders near a vertical wall is studied an analytical model is developed to evaluate the wave force as well as the surface elevation based on the developed model systematic calculations are performed for a straight line array of equally spaced cylinders parallel to a vertical wall hydrodynamic characteristics of structures in bounded water have been explored the main conclusions of the present study are summarized as follows 1 in the imaginary system the relationship between the diffracted waves from real and image cylinders is established and a system of linear equations with reduced number of the unknowns associated with the velocity potential is obtained 2 the good convergence characteristics of the present model are conformed by undertaking a convergence test with respect to the number of fourier modes in addition the results of the mean drift wave force based on the direct integration over the body namely near field formulation agree well with those obtained based on the momentum conservation theorem this suggests that the present model is valid and reliable 3 the first order and the second order mean drift wave force on a certain cylinder in an array close to a wall behave in an oscillatory manner such oscillation becomes more frequent as the cylinder array moves away from the wall by considering the effect of the wall significant amplification of the wave force is observed at certain wave frequencies the pronounced first order wave force and the negative mean drift wave force occur when a large amount of wave is entrapped between the wall and the cylinders 4 when a cylinder is placed in a cylinder array parallel to a vertical wall the inference effect causes obvious fluctuation which is riding on the wave force on a single cylinder close to a wall such fluctuation generally gets more frequent and obvious as the number of the cylinders increases as the spacing between the adjacent cylinders is small the strong inference effect can further amplify the significant first order wave force and the negative mean drift wave force the inference effect can also induce a shift of the peak frequency which gets gradually less obvious as the cylinder array moves away from the wall in addition even though the mean drift wave force can be largely amplified due to the influence of the wall it is still much smaller in magnitude than that of the first order wave force and its contribution to the total wave force is much less important when compared with the first order wave force declaration of

wall accurate prediction of wave force on such structures is of importance yet challenging as both interferences among cylinders as well as between cylinders and the wall must be correct in this work a novel analytical model has been developed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of such structures within the framework of linear wave theory the original problem is considered to be equivalent to that of two symmetrical arrays of cylinders in open water both are exposed to the ambient incident waves the original array of cylinders is labelled as real cylinders hereafter and the second array as image cylinders the assumption of full wave reflection on the wall is essential by using this treatment due to the symmetry simple relationships between the diffracted waves from the real and image cylinders are found which reduces the number of unknowns associated with the velocity potential by half after solving the velocity potential the wave forces as well as the surface elevation are evaluated two different solutions have been developed for the calculation of mean drift wave force one is based on the direct pressure integration and the other is based on the application of momentum conservation theorem in a limited fluid volume surrounding a certain cylinder in the array then the systematic analysis is performed for a line array of equally spaced cylinders parallel to a vertical wall largely amplified wave forces are found at specific wave frequencies which occur with the appearance of pronounced wave runup around the cylinders furthermore the relative contribution of the first order and the mean drift wave forces to the total wave force is examined keywords image principle bounded water nonlinear wave force cylinder array wave runup 1 introduction the foundations for many coastal and offshore structures for example bridges oil drilling platforms wind farms and airport are usually groups of cylinders that are arranged in various configurations the berthing or mooring facilities in ports and harbor areas are also exhibited in this form in addition the concept of wave energy converter wec farms have being proposed in which the individual cylindrical wec may be arranged in a certain layout to maximize the total wave energy capturing as the wave interaction with a group of bodies have a wide range of practical applications various works ranging from analytical studies through to model scale testing and numerical modelling have been done on this subject when the incident wave acts upon a group of bodies the presence of a given body will affect the incident wave by producing a scattered wave which will in turn be scattered by adjacent bodies for the problem of waves scattered from an array of vertical cylinders a family of the so called direct matrix method is widely used to take into account the multiple scattering effect see e g spring and monkmeyer 1974 linton and evans 1990 duclos and clément 2004 walker and eatock taylor 2005 and zeng et al 2019 in this method waves scattered from each body are solved simultaneously subject to the boundary conditions of the respective bodies similar to the solution procedure of the direct matrix method solutions of wave scattering by an array of truncated circular cylinders or elliptical cylinders have also been derived by researchers based on the physical idea of multiple scattering in conjunction with the appropriate eigenfunction expansion of the velocity potential examples include iskandarani and liu 1988 chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos 2010 child 2010 and göteman 2017 in these works the unknowns associated with the velocity potential are determined by applying the matching technology or solving the boundary integral equation the waves scattered from each cylinder can then be solved simultaneously alternatively the scattering of water waves by a group of bodies can also be solved based on an iterative procedure incorporating successive reflections between the bodies this method was pioneered by twersky 1952 and then extended to the case of surface waves by ohkusu 1974 by combing the iterative technology in ohkusu 1974 and the feature of direct matrix method in spring and monkmeyer 1974 kagemoto and yue 1986 developed an interaction theory to solve the three dimensional wave scattering by a structure consisting of a number of separate elements based algebraically on the scattering characteristics of each individual element based on the iterative theory extensive studies related to an array of truncated cylinders have been performed by researchers examples include yilmaz and incecik 1998 yilmaz et al 2001 and siddorn and eatock taylor 2008 recently zhang et al 2019 investigated the cloaking phenomenon referring to the condition that there exist no radial outgoing waves for an array of truncated cylinders based on the interaction theory of kagemoto and yue 1986 with the development of computing technology mesh based numerical modelling methods have also been widely used the frequency domain analysis of the multiple scattering effect based on the boundary element and or finite element method can be found in walker et al 2008 grice et al 2013 and cong et al 2014 2015 among others in the frequency domain analysis the nonlinear effect can be considered up to the second order with respect to the wave steepness if the nonlinear effect beyond the second order is important such as multi column structures exposed to the action of extreme waves the fully nonlinear modelling in time domain is then used this method is applicable for steep incident wave conditions and some violent phenomena in the process of wave propagation and deformation can be captured the application of fully nonlinear numerical modelling to an array of vertical columns subject to extreme ocean waves can be found in ma et al 2001b 2001a wang and wu 2010 and bai et al 2014 to date the hydrodynamic properties of structures in open water have been extensively studied as aforementioned the numerical analytical treatment for such structures in open water is inherently different to those in coastal areas where the vertical wall exists the effect of nearby vertical walls on the hydrodynamic properties of structures in bounded water have been assessed by some researchers calisal and sabuncu 1989 developed an efficient computational method to investigate the effect of the parallel side walls of a towing tank on the hydrodynamic coefficients of a heaving cylinder in the tank the total radiation potential is the expressed as a sum of the potentials associated with the real cylinder as well as a series of image cylinders teng et al 2004 developed an exact analytical method to tackle the wave radiation by a vertical column near a wharf represented by a fully reflective infinite vertical wall the original problem was transformed into an equivalent one associated with two symmetrically arranged cylinders in open water by applying the image principle teng et al 2004 s work was later extended to other bounded water cases such as the wave diffraction from a vertical column in front of orthogonal vertical walls ning et al 2005 action of ship waves on a nearby vertical column that is in front of a vertical wall sun et al 2007 and wave interaction with a porous column near a vertical wall cong et al 2019 in addition the assumption of full wave reflection on the wall was also applied to investigate the performance of cylindrical wave energy converters that are installed near a wharf see zheng and zhang 2015 chatjigeorgiou 2019 the wave interaction with an array of vertical cylinders are closely related to the engineering practice to date the hydrodynamics associated with a cylinder array in open water has been extensively studied in the meantime the cylinder array has also been widely installed in front of a vertical wall hence a problem of bounded water in this study we aim to explore the hydrodynamic properties associated with multiple columns near a vertical wall and an analytically based approach to this problem which can provide solutions including the linear and nonlinear wave force as well as the surface elevation distribution has been newly developed in the solution procedure the original problem is equivalent to that of wave interaction with two symmetrical arrays of cylinders in open water simple relationships between the diffracted waves from original real cylinders and the image cylinders are found which reduces the number of unknowns associated with the velocity potential by half the wave elevation distribution as well as the first order and second order mean drift wave force on the cylinders are evaluated in this study in the following sections the underlying mathematical problem and analytical solution are firstly introduced in section 2 the calculation of the first order and the second order mean drift wave force is then presented in section 3 which is followed by the convergence test and validation in section 4 the parametric study is performed in section 5 finally the conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 mathematical problem and analytical solution as shown in fig 1 an arbitrary array of n bottom mounted circular cylinders is placed in front of a vertical wall at a constant water depth d the cylinders are exposed to a plane incident wave of angular frequency ω and wave amplitude a a global cartesian coordinate system oxyz is adopted with an origin located on the still free surface the z axis is defined positive upwards and the oyz plane coincides with the vertical wall the incident wave propagates at an angle of β with respect to the positive x axis it is assumed that the vertical wall is infinite long and fully reflective the original hydrodynamic problem in bounded water is then transformed into an equivalent one in open fluid domain in which the real n cylinders and their image virtual cylinders with respect to the wall are exposed to the action of dual incident waves without the presence of the wall by applying the image principle teng et al 2004 this system is termed imaginary system hereafter there are 2n cylinders in the imaginary system in total as shown in fig 2 the cylinders numbered as j 1 2 n are real cylinders while those numbered as j n 1 n 2 2n are image ones on the still free surface the centre of the jth cylinder at x j y j 0 is taken as the origin of a local polar coordinate system ojr j θ j z j where θ j is measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis and the z j axis directs vertically upwards one of the dual incident waves propagates at an angle of β and the other hence at an angle of π β within the framework of potential flow theory in which the flow is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and irrotational the flow field can be described by a scalar velocity potential φ satisfying the laplace s equation 1 2 φ x t 0 for a linear time harmonic incident wave with an angular frequency of ω the velocity potential can be expressed in a complex spatial form as 2 φ x t re φ r θ z e i ω t where re stands for taking the real part i 1 when considering the wave action with stationary bodies the total velocity potential φ can be written as a summation of the incident potential φ i and the diffraction potential φ d i e 3 φ φ i φ d the incident velocity potential is due to undisturbed dual plane incident waves propagating at angles of β and π β respectively and it is expressed as 4 φ i i a g ω z 0 κ 0 z e i κ 0 y sin β e i κ 0 x cos β e i κ 0 x cos β in which κ 0 is the wave number which is determined by the dispersion relation ω 2 g κ 0 tanh κ 0 d with g being the acceleration due to gravity z 0 κ 0 z is an orthonormal function in d 0 and is defined by 5 z 0 κ 0 z cosh κ 0 z d cosh κ 0 d in the jth local polar coordinate system φ i is rewritten as 6 φ i r j θ j z j m λ m j j m κ 0 r j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j in which 7 λ m j i a g ω i j β e i m β i j π β e i m π β i m in eq 7 i j β and i j π β are the phase factors associated with the jth cylinder which are 8 i j β e i κ 0 x j cos β y j sin β i j π β e i κ 0 x j cos β y j sin β for the boundary value problems bvps appropriate boundary conditions on the free surface the impermeable body surface and the sea bed are also required for solving φ d they are given by 9 φ d z ω 2 g φ d on z 0 10 φ d n j φ i n j on r j a j and 11 φ d z 0 on z d in eq 10 a j is the radius of the jth cylinder n j n j x n j y n j z t is the normal vector on the boundary expressed in the jth local polar coordinate system and it is positive when pointing out of the fluid domain in addition the following sommerfeld radiation condition at far field has also to be satisfied 12 lim r r φ d r i κ 0 φ d 0 due to the axisymmetric geometry of the cylinders the method of separation of variables can be used to derive the expression of the diffraction potential the solution of φ d can be achieved by associating with each cylinder a general potential that describes the wave diffraction from the cylinder the form of individual wave diffraction potential follows that in maniar and newman 1997 hence we have 13 φ d j 1 2 n m a m j c m j h m κ 0 r j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j in which a m j are the unknown coefficients the coefficients c m j are defined by 14 c m j j m κ 0 a j h m κ 0 a j in which h m x stands for the hankel functions of the first kind of order m c m j is introduced for convenience later when satisfying the body surface boundary condition the developed expression of the diffraction potential inherently satisfies the laplace s equation and the boundary conditions shown in eqs 9 11 and 12 in eq 13 the waves diffracted from different cylinders are expressed in their respective local polar coordinate systems to facilitate the application of eq 10 it is essential to express all terms in eq 13 in the same coordinate system this can be accomplished by using graf s addition theorem for bessel functions 15 h n κ 0 r k e i n θ k m h m n κ 0 r k j j m κ 0 r j e i n α k j m α j k e i m θ j in eq 15 r k j is the distance between the centres of the jth and the kth cylinders α j k is the angle defined positive counterclockwise from the positive x axis to the line joining the centres of the jth and the kth cylinders then the diffraction potential can be expressed in the jth local polar coordinate system as 16 φ d r j θ j z j m a m j c m j h m κ 0 r j k 1 k j 2 n n a n k c n k δ m n j k j m κ 0 r j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j in which 17 δ m n j k h n m κ 0 r k j 1 m e i n α k j m α j k eq 16 is valid in the vicinity of the jth cylinder i e r j r k j this is certainly true on the body surface of each cylinder in order to find a solution to the unknown coefficients in eq 16 i e a m j the infinite series in eq 16 has to be truncated and only 2m 1 fourier modes from mode m to mode m are kept then applying eq 10 and equating the fourier coefficients with the same harmonic in θ j give 18 a m j k 1 k j 2 n n m m a n k c n k δ m n j k λ m j with 1 j 2n eq 18 provides a finite set of 2n 2m 1 equations to determine the unknowns for m m m as shown in fig 2 on the still free surface the centres of the jth and the n j th cylinders are symmetrical to the y axis i e x j x j n and they own the same radius i e a j a j n due to the symmetrical arrangement of the 2n cylinders c n j λ m j and α k j satisfy the following relationship 19 c n j c n n j 20 λ m j λ m n j and 21a α j k α n j n k 2 π π 21b α k n j α n k j 2 π π with 1 j k n the application of eq 21 can lead to the following relationship for δ m n j k 22a δ m n j k δ m n n j n k 22b δ m n j n k δ m n n j k with 1 j k n the set of linear equations in eq 18 can be rewritten as 23a a m j k 1 k j n n m m a n k c n k δ m n j k k 1 n n m m a n n k c n n k δ m n j n k λ m j 23b a m n j k 1 n n m m a n k c n k δ m n n j k k 1 k j n n m m a n n k c n n k δ m n n j n k λ m n j with 1 j k n eqs 23a and 23b are derived based on the boundary condition satisfied on the impermeable surfaces of the real and image cylinders respectively by using eqs 19 20 and 22 eq 23b can be rewritten as 24 a m n j k 1 k j n n m m a n n k c n k δ m n j k k 1 n n m m a n k c n n k δ m n j n k λ m j the system consisting of eqs 23a and 24 owns the same solution as that of eq 18 it is noted that in eqs 23a and 24 except the unknowns all the other coefficients keep the same here we define another set of coefficients b m j as 25a b m n j a m j 25b b m j a m n j with 1 j n the substitution of eq 25 into eqs 23a and 24 respectively can lead to 26a b m j k 1 k j n n m m b n k c n k δ m n j k k 1 n n m m b n n k c n n k δ m n j n k λ m j 26b b m n j k 1 k j n n m m b n n k c n k δ m n j k k 1 n n m m b n k c n n k δ m n j n k λ m j with 1 j k n from the comparison of eqs 26a and 26b with eqs 23a and 24 it is observed that the system of equations for b m j is equivalent to that for a m j and the solutions of a m j and b m j are the same which indicates the following relationship is held for the unknowns related to the real and image cylinders 27 a m j a m n j with 1 j n then based on eqs 23a and 27 a set of n 2m 1 equations for unknowns related to the real cylinders are obtained 28 a m j n m m a n j c n j δ m n j n j k 1 k j n n m m a n k c n k δ m n j k a n k c n k δ m n j n k λ m j with 1 j k n the set of algebraic equations in eq 28 can be solved by standard matrix techniques compared with eq 18 eqs 27 and 28 constitute a reduced system in which only n 2m 1 equations need to be solved with the aid of a simple relationship between the unknowns related to the real and image cylinders with the solution of the velocity potential the fluid particle velocity can be obtained by calculating the gradient of the velocity potential then the velocity component of a fluid particle in the x direction i e u can be determined according to 29 u i a g ω z 0 κ 0 z e i κ 0 y sin β i κ 0 cos β e i κ 0 x cos β e i κ 0 x cos β j 1 2 n m a m j c m j κ 0 h m κ 0 r j cos θ j i m h m κ 0 r j sin θ j r j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j in which the prime appearing in the superscript denotes the derivative with respect to the argument at a location along the vertical wall i e 0 y s z s in the global coordinate system the incident waves make no contribution to u then u at 0 y s z s can be further expressed as 30 u j 1 n m a m j a m n j c m j κ 0 h m κ 0 r s j cos θ s j i m h m κ 0 r s j sin θ s j r s j z 0 κ 0 z s e i m θ s j in which r s j x j 2 y j y s 2 1 2 and θ s j tan 1 y j y s x j after inserting eq 27 into eq 30 it is clear that u is zero at this location which demonstrates that the no flow condition along the vertical wall is well respected in the imaginary system 3 calculation of the first order and the second order mean drift wave force the wave forces acting on a body can be computed by integrating the pressure over the body surface with the velocity potential being available the fluid pressure can be obtained from bernoulli s equation according to eqs 3 6 and 16 the velocity potential in the vicinity of the jth cylinder is then expressed as 31 φ r j θ j z j m λ m j j m κ 0 r

eq 31 which is given by 32 φ r j θ j z j m p m j r j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j in which 33 p m j r j a m j c m j h m κ 0 r j j m κ 0 r j when r j a j by using the wronskian relationships for bessel functions p m j r j can be further expressed as 34 p m j a j 2 a m j i π κ 0 a j h m κ 0 a j then the linear hydrodynamic pressure on the jth cylinder i e p j θ j z j can be expressed as 35 p j θ j z j m 2 ω ρ a m j π κ 0 a j h m κ 0 a j z 0 κ 0 z j e i m θ j the first order wave force and moment are due to the linear hydrodynamic pressure and can be obtained by the pressure integration over the body surface then the amplitudes of the first order horizontal wave forces on the jth cylinder f j x and f j y are given by 36 f j x f j y 1 i 2 ω ρ h 1 κ 0 a j tanh κ 0 d κ 0 2 a 1 j a 1 j meanwhile the amplitudes of the first order wave moments on the jth cylinder m j x and m j y can be determined according to 37 m j x m j y i 1 2 ω ρ h 1 κ 0 a j κ 0 d sinh κ 0 d cosh κ 0 d 1 κ 0 3 cosh κ 0 d a 1 j a 1 j hereinafter when calculating the wave moment the rotation centre x c j is located at the centre of the cylinder on the sea bottom i e x j y j d besides the first order wave force the second order mean drift wave force can also be obtained based on the linear wave theory currently many studies have been devoted to derive the general formulation of the mean drift wave force such as newman 1967 pinkster 1980 ogilvie 1983 and chen 2007 the formulation consists of direct pressure integrations on the body surface is called the near field formulation the near field formulation is general as it can be used to obtain all components of the mean drift wave force applied to one individual body in a single or multi body system referring to the established near field formulation such as that in ogilvie 1983 the mean drift wave force and moment on the jth cylinder f j and m j can be computed by 38a f j ρ 4 s b j φ φ n j d s ρ g 4 γ w j η η n j d l 38b m j ρ 4 s b j φ φ x x c j n j d s ρ g 4 γ w j η η x x c j n j d l in which s b j stands for the mean body surface of the jth cylinder γ w j stands for the intersection of s b j with mean free surface z 0 η is the amplitude of the first order wave elevation and can be determined according to 39 η i ω g φ z 0 for vertically axisymmetric bodies the surface integrals in eq 38 can be reduced to line integrals after integrating in the circumferential direction and applying the orthogonality thus by introducing eq 32 into eq 38 the mean drift wave force and moment on the jth cylinder can be further expressed as 40a f j x ρ π a j 2 n

integration the mean drift wave force can also be obtained by applying the momentum conservation theorem to a control fluid volume surrounding the body if the control fluid volume is extended to infinity i e the entire fluid volume the mean drift wave force can be deduced from the quantities at far field and the far field formulation is then derived as the mean drift wave force on a certain cylinder in the array i e the jth cylinder rather than the global mean drift wave force on the whole array is concerned in this study the momentum conservation theorem is then applied to a control fluid volume ω c j surrounding the jth cylinder rather than the entire fluid volume ω c j is limited by the body surface of the jth cylinder a control surface s c j and the free surface and sea bed between them the undisturbed wetted surface ofs c j is defined by r j r j d z 0 and 0 θ j 2π the definition of the control surface surrounding the jth cylinder is given in fig 3 following mei et al 2005 by using the kinematic transport theorem and gauss theorem the wave force on the jth cylinder can be related to the total linear momentum in ω c j that is 43 f j x f j y s c j s d j s f j p n x j n y j ρ u v u n j d s d d t m x j m y j in which f j x and f j y are the horizontal wave force components on the jth cylinder s f j and s d j are the limited free surface and sea bed in ω c j u u v w t is the vector of fluid particle velocity m j x and m j y are the horizontal components of the total linear momentum in ω c j when the time average is taken and the periodicity is invoked the last term on the right hand side of eq 43 gives no contribution then the mean drift wave force components are 44 f j x f j y s c j s d j s f j p n x j n y j ρ u v u n j d s in which an over bar indicates the average over a wave period by making use of the bernoulli s equation and preserving the second order terms with respect to the wave steepness we can get 45a f j x re ρ 4 s c j φ φ cos θ j 2 φ r φ

surface z 0 thus by introducing eq 32 into eq 45 and making use of orthogonality eq 45 can be further expressed as 46a f j x ρ π r j 2 n 0 κ 0 d re m p m j r j p m 1 j r j m m 1 r j 2 p m j r j p m 1

an alternative solution is derived for the mean drift wave force on the cylinders placed near a vertical wall based on the conservation principle of momentum then the validity of the present model can be examined by comparing the mean drift wave force results based on the two different solutions 4 convergence test and validation the convergence and validity of the developed model are examined first to ensure that the truncation number selected is optimal an array of three identical cylinders that are located close to a vertical wall is considered here the cylinders are spaced equally and lined up in a row parallel to the wall each cylinder has a radius of a i e a 1 a 2 a 3 a the distance between the centres of adjacent cylinders is b 4a the distance between the wall and the back stagnation point of the cylinder array is e a the layout of the cylinder array is given in fig 4 the wave heading and water depth are fixed at β π 4 and d 5a respectively hereinafter ρ g a j 2 a and ρ g a j 2 a d are used to nondimensionalize the first order wave force and moment respectively ρ g a j a a and ρ g a j a a d are used to nondimensionalize the second order mean drift wave force and moment respectively the accuracy of the calculation of wave force and moment is mainly influenced by the number of fourier modes in the numerical algorithm the fourier modes from the order m to m have been considered the first order wave force and moment on the centre cylinder in the array are shown in fig 5 for various values of m the results for the second order mean drift wave force and moment calculated by the direct pressure integration i e eqs 40 and 41 are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the choices of m 10 15 and 20 give almost the same results which indicates that the present model possesses good convergence characteristics it can also be observed that the first order wave force and moment follow the similar trend with κ 0 a as expected due to the fact that the first order wave moment is proportional to the first order wave force as shown in eqs 36 and 37 as the fluid particle velocity decays in an exponential manner along the gravity direction the mean drift wave force and moment are dominated by the dynamic pressure near the mean free surface around the mean free surface the ratio between the contributions of the dynamic pressure to m j y and f j x is d while that between m j x and f j y is d therefore in fig 5 m j y follows a similar trend to that of f j x while m j x follows an almost opposite trend to that of f j y the proposed analytical model is then verified by cross checking the results of mean drift wave force based on different methods in table 1 and table 2 nf and mc are used to denote the results based on the direct pressure integration eq 40 and the momentum conservation theorem eq 46 respectively four wave frequencies i e κ 0 a 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 have been considered when the calculation is performed based on eq 46 the radius of the control surface is twice of that of the cylinder inside i e r j 2a j it can be seen from tables 1 and 2 that the two different methods give almost the same converged results providing confidence in the use of the model in addition it is obvious that m 15 leads to a convergent solution hence being used hereafter in this study the mean drift wave force on a certain cylinder rather than the global mean drift wave force on the whole array is concerned therefore the momentum conservation theorem is only applied to a control fluid volume surrounding this cylinder rather than the entire fluid volume then the mean drift wave force on the cylinder can be determined by using the quantities on the control surface which is the exterior circular boundary of the control volume the control surface is in the vicinity of the cylinder and cannot intersect other cylinders in the array the waves diffracted from different cylinders in the array can still obviously disturb the quantities distributed on the control surface as a result in tables 1 and 2 the results based on the momentum conservation theorem do not show obvious superiority over those based on the direct pressure integration in the aspect of convergence rate another check that needs to be carried out is the dependence of the results on the size of the control surface associated with the second method fig 7 shows the variation of the second order mean drift wave force with varying m for different cases of control surfaces the radius of the control surface is varied as r j 1 5a j 2a j and 2 5a j respectively noting that r j 2a j was used in the previous convergence test in tables 1 and 2 from fig 7 it is noted that different choices of control surfaces give the same converged results i e the results are independent on the size of the control surface 5 results and discussions a detailed parametric study concerning a straight line array of equally spaced cylinders parallel to a vertical wall is performed all the cylinders in the array are identical and with a radius of a the effect of wave conditions as well as geometric parameters of the cylinder array is then assessed as the main trend of wave moment can be detected from that of wave force as discussed before the results of wave moment are not shown in this section for brevity in addition the constant water depth is fixed at d 5a in the following study the case that a single cylinder is placed close to a wall is firstly investigated and severed as a reference case on the still free surface the centre of the cylinder is located at e a 0 0 the effect of e on the first order and the second order mean drift wave forces on the cylinder is shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively with the wave heading being fixed at β 0 to achieve a better understanding the results of wave forces on a single cylinder in open water have also been included in figs 8 and 9 referred as uw according to kim and yue 1989 and linton and evans 1990 the first order and the second order mean drift wave forces on an isolated cylinder f ˆ x and f ˆ x under normal incidence can be determined according to 48a f ˆ x 4 ρ g a h 1 κ 0 a tanh κ 0 d κ 0 2 48b f ˆ x 4 ρ g a a a π 2 κ 0 a 3 1 2 κ 0 d sinh 2 κ 0 d m 0 n n 1 κ 0 a 2 1 2 1 h m κ 0 a 2 h m 1 κ 0 a 2 it is clearly from figs 8 and 9 that the existence of the wall plays significant roles on the hydrodynamic behaviors of the cylinders for all the gaps considered the first order wave force on an isolated cylinder in open water increases monotonously with κ 0 a to its peak and then decrease as κ 0 a further increases however the force curves experience significant oscillations when the cylinder is located in proximity to a wall as remarked in teng et al 2004 the occurrence of the oscillation is associated with wave reflections from the wall the reflected waves can either be in phase or out of phase with the incident wave in the vicinity of the cylinder hence resulting in constructive or destructive interferences at different wave frequencies similarly these oscillation behaviors are observed for the mean drift wave force whose main trend is different when compared to the first order wave force the mean drift wave force increases firstly with κ 0 a to its peak and then remains at its peak as κ 0 a further increases the first order and the mean drift wave force are dominated by the linear and the quadratic dynamic pressure respectively the wave pressure around the water line contributes significantly to the horizontal wave force along the water line the linear dynamic pressure is directly proportional to the wave elevation meanwhile the quadratic dynamic pressure depends on the square of the fluid velocity in head on seas β 0 the fluid particle around the lee side and the weather side of the cylinder moves only in the vertical direction leading to the quadratic dynamic pressure proportional to the square of the wave elevation however in the regions between the lee side and the weather side the fluid particle moves not only in the vertical direction but also in the circumferential direction then the behavior of the quadratic dynamic pressure in these regions is different from that of the linear dynamic pressure as a result the main trend of the mean drift wave force is different from that of the first order wave force and the frequencies of the obvious peaks in fig 8 do not coincide with those in fig 9 for each value of e the oscillation of the mean drift wave force gets less obvious as κ 0 a increases in addition the mean drift wave force curve oscillates more quickly as the cylinder moves away from wall e increases the effect of wave heading on the first order and the second order mean drift wave force is illustrated in figs 10 and 11 respectively with e a the wave heading increases from 0 to π 4 with an interval of π 12 under oblique incidence the wave force on the cylinder still behaves in an oscillatory manner as β increases gradually the dual incident wave trains in the imaginary system gradually tends to be parallel with each other and their respective contributions to the wave force gradually are becoming to be uniform as a result the wave force curve oscillates less quickly with κ 0 a as wave obliqueness increases it is also noted that the obvious peak of the wave force component in the y direction gradually increases as β increases see figs 10 b and 11 b this can be attributed to the increase of projection area of wave action along the y axis as β increases the wave action with an array of n cylinders close to a wall is then investigated the cases of n 2 3 and 5 are considered in the subsequent study and only head on seas are considered for the jth cylinder in the array the coordinate of its centre on the free surface is e a j 1 b 0 with j 1 2 n the layout of the cylinder array with n 3 has been shown in fig 4 the first order and the second order mean drift wave force component in x direction on the cylinders are presented in figs 12 and 13 respectively with e a equivalent results for e 2a are shown in figs 14 and 15 and those for e 3a are shown in figs 16 and 17 the results for a single cylinder in front of a wall are also included for direct comparisons when a cylinder is placed in an array the existence of adjacent cylinders can make a disturbance on the wave field around it as a result small fluctuation riding on that with n 1 can be observed from the wave force with n 2 3 and 5 the adjacent cylinders obviously affect the movement of the fluid particle not only in the vertical direction but also in the horizontal plane it suggests that its effect on the quadratic dynamic pressure is more significant than that on the linear dynamic pressure therefore it is observed that the fluctuation riding on the mean drift wave force is more obvious after placing a cylinder in an array obvious amplification or diminishment of the peak wave force can be observed a shift of the frequency of peak wave force can also be found such shift generally becomes less obvious as the cylinder array moves away from the wall e increases it is also noted that as the number of cylinders in the array increases the inference effect gets more pronounced and the fluctuation riding on the wave force generally gets more evident and frequent in figs 18 20 the wave field around a row of n vertical stationary cylinders close to a wall is presented for different wave frequencies in fig 18 the wave field is presented for κ 0 a 0 5 0 44 and 0 93 with e a b 4a and n 2 it can be seen that significant peaks and troughs occur alternatively in the upstream region of the cylinder array at κ 0 a 0 5 and 0 44 see fig 18 a and b a large amount of wave is entrapped between the wall and the cylinders generating significant wave elevation in this region significant first order wave force and negative mean drift wave force are then induced respectively at κ 0 a 0 93 obviously amplified wave elevation can be found at the weather side of the cylinders see fig 18 c inducing a significant positive mean drift wave force equivalent results for n 3 and 5 are shown in figs 19 and 20 respectively the wave fields shown in figs 19 and 20 also correspond to the situations where the significant wave force are induced on the cylinders these figures also suggest that the peak wave force occurs in the situation where significant wave runup is generated around the lee side or the weather side of the cylinders the effect of the distance between adjacent cylinders on the wave force is then examined the results of the first order and the second order mean drift wave force on a row of cylinders close to a wall are shown in figs 21 and 22 respectively with e a b 3a and β 0 those for b 5a are shown in figs 23 and 24 meanwhile those for b 4a have been given in figs 12 and 13 not surprisingly the interference effect from adjacent cylinders on the first order wave force gets less obvious as b increases as the cylinders are close to each other i e b 3a the interference effect is pronounced and it can largely amplify the significant peak of the first order wave force see fig 21 a such amplification becomes weaker as b increases and a diminishment of the peak wave force can even be induced when b 5a see fig 23 a the interference effect can also obviously affect the mean drift wave force the fluctuation riding on the mean drift wave force with b 5a is less obvious but more frequent than that with b 3a and 4a it can also be noted that the interference effect can largely amplify the significant negative mean drift wave force in the low frequency region and such amplification becomes progressively less obvious as b increases the relative contribution of the first order and the second order mean drift wave force to the total wave force on cylinders close to a wall is examined a comparison of the first order and the mean drift wave force component in the x direction is presented in fig 25 here all the cylinders have dimensional radii of a 1 m and the spacing between the axes of adjacent cylinders are fixed at b 4a the cylinders are under normal wave incidence and the wave steepness κ 0 a increases from 0 06 to 0 1 in fig 25 a the case of a single cylinder is considered the comparison considering the wave action with a row of 2 3 or 5 cylinders are presented in fig 25 b c and d respectively the wave force gets progressively obvious as the wave steepness increases even though the mean drift wave force can be largely amplified after placing the cylinders close to wall it is still much smaller in magnitude than that of the first order wave force and its contribution to the total wave force is obviously less important 6 conclusion the interaction of water waves with an array of bottom mounted circular cylinders near a vertical wall is studied an analytical model is developed to evaluate the wave force as well as the surface elevation based on the developed model systematic calculations are performed for a straight line array of equally spaced cylinders parallel to a vertical wall hydrodynamic characteristics of structures in bounded water have been explored the main conclusions of the present study are summarized as follows 1 in the imaginary system the relationship between the diffracted waves from real and image cylinders is established and a system of linear equations with reduced number of the unknowns associated with the velocity potential is obtained 2 the good convergence characteristics of the present model are conformed by undertaking a convergence test with respect to the number of fourier modes in addition the results of the mean drift wave force based on the direct integration over the body namely near field formulation agree well with those obtained based on the momentum conservation theorem this suggests that the present model is valid and reliable 3 the first order and the second order mean drift wave force on a certain cylinder in an array close to a wall behave in an oscillatory manner such oscillation becomes more frequent as the cylinder array moves away from the wall by considering the effect of the wall significant amplification of the wave force is observed at certain wave frequencies the pronounced first order wave force and the negative mean drift wave force occur when a large amount of wave is entrapped between the wall and the cylinders 4 when a cylinder is placed in a cylinder array parallel to a vertical wall the inference effect causes obvious fluctuation which is riding on the wave force on a single cylinder close to a wall such fluctuation generally gets more frequent and obvious as the number of the cylinders increases as the spacing between the adjacent cylinders is small the strong inference effect can further amplify the significant first order wave force and the negative mean drift wave force the inference effect can also induce a shift of the peak frequency which gets gradually less obvious as the cylinder array moves away from the wall in addition even though the mean drift wave force can be largely amplified due to the influence of the wall it is still much smaller in magnitude than that of the first order wave force and its contribution to the total wave force is much less important when compared with the first order wave force declaration of

22157,the wave crest height plays a vital role in designing both the fixed and floating marine structures the present study examines the measured wave crest data at 18 m water depth off visakhapatnam in the northwestern bay of bengal during the tropical cyclone tc hudhud the maximum significant wave height hs measured during the tc is 7 59 m on 12 october 2014 at 1030 h the maximum wave height is 10 75 m and the crest height is 6 81 m the average ratio of the crest height of the wave to the wave height is 0 4 0 7 during the tc for waves with hs more than 6 m the most extreme wave height is 1 46 1 83 times the hs and the crest height of the wave is 0 81 1 47 times the hs of the same 30 min record the study shows that during the high wave events the weibull distribution agrees with the crest height distribution of observed data better than the rayleigh distribution keywords wind wave tropical cyclone wave crest height rayleigh distribution weibull distribution extreme waves 1 introduction extreme waves are responsible for the most extreme loadings on ocean vessels and offshore structures cuilin et al 2010 the waves grow from absorbing the energy and momentum of the forcing wind when the wave crest is higher than the deck elevation the structure is more likely to get damaged one of the causes of failure of platforms is wave in deck loads and unexpectedly high crest heights mcconnell et al 2004 thus if extreme crest height is generated at the location of marine structures this can be a significant issue in the design of these structures it is therefore important that statistical models describing the crest height distribution are required during the design process of structures the crest height distribution is a function of wave steepness and the water depth when ocean waves are studied as random processes wave location at a fixed point is assumed to be gaussian based on linear wave theory in the case of a gaussian sea where there is zero up crossing the wave height distribution follows rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 a real wave shows a small but distinct departure from a gaussian surface in such a case the wave asymmetry can be described by adding a quadratic correction term to the linear model forristall 1978 the resulting process is non gaussian and referred to as a second order weibull model according to prevosto et al 2000 weibull parameterisations should take both the wave steepness and the dimensionless depth into account the common expectation is that the rayleigh distribution over predicts the probability occurrence of large waves when compared with field data and the crest height distributions based on second order wave theory agree with most high quality measurements forristall 1978 tayfun 1990 massel 1996 mori et al 2002 krogstad and barstow 2004 stansell 2005 muralidharan et al 2007 lian and haver 2015 forristall 2000 established a second order crest distribution based on a large number of simulations and is now commonly being used to describe the short time second order crest distribution as the wave propagates the profile becomes asymmetric with higher crests together with shallower and flatter troughs due to the interaction between individual sine waves butler et al 2009 show that the linear wave model is often simplistic and leads to errors in the predicted crest height of about 10 20 the theoretical derivation of the distribution of crest height is a tricky problem especially when non linearities have to be considered in a given length of time the maximum crest height over an area will be larger than the maximum crest at a single point forristall 2006 lian and haver 2015 compared the second order distribution by forristall 2000 to the measurements at 190 m water depth in the north sea and reported that the second order distribution follows very well the measured data weibull distribution is also more effective for the simulation of maximum wave height distributions and estimating various wave height parameters muralidharan et al 2007 amrutha and kumar 2017 observed that for the high waves in the eastern arabian sea the most extreme wave height is 1 50 1 62 times of the significant wave height whereas the most extreme crest height is 1 23 1 35 times the significant wave height of the same 30 min record the high waves are generated due to the tropical cyclones also described as typhoons or hurricanes depending on global origin in the north indian ocean especially in the bay of bengal the occurrence of tropical cyclones tc is high in the bay of bengal significant wave height up to 7 3 m is measured during the tc phailin amrutha et al 2014 and 8 4 m during the passage of orissa super cyclone rajesh et al 2005 young 2006 reported the influence of the tc on wave parameters numerical modeling of the wave heights during the tropical cyclone hudhud indicates that the numerical model overestimates 5 17 the wave heights during most of the tc period except the peak value which was underestimated by 15 samiksha et al 2017 although the influence of tc on the wave parameters has been an area of active research the distribution of crest height during the tc is not described in the literature hence it is important to know the crest height distribution of waves during the tc and is the aim of the present study the data used in this study and the methods are described in section 2 results and discussion in section 3 and the conclusions are summarised in section 4 2 data and methodology the domain of the present study is the coastal waters of visakhapatnam the annual distribution of the wave characteristics of the study area is presented by anjali nair et al 2019 the wave data measured from 10 to 14 october 2014 at an interval of 30 min at 18 m water depth covering the period of tc hudhud with the datawell directional waverider buoy is used in the study the wave data of 2 october 2014 is used to compare the crest height distribution during the low wave conditions buoy use accelerometers to measure waves with wave heights up to 40 m and wave periods of 1 6 30 s with a vertical resolution of 0 01 m the displacement of the buoy is sampled at a rate of 3 84 hz and the data are transmitted and logged with a sampling frequency of 1 28 hz in the present study the memory card data of the buoy is used to avoid transmission losses an apparent wave is defined as the profile of the sea surface between two consecutive up crossings of the still water level the wave crest height hc i e the height of the crest level above still water level and the wave trough height ht i e the depth of trough below the mean water level for each individual wave are calculated from the heave time series data of 30 min duration the wave height h of the individual wave is the sum of the crest height and trough height the height of the maximum wave in a 30 min duration is hmax the cyclonic storm hudhud originated from a low pressure system in the andaman sea on 6 october 2014 intensified into a severe cyclonic storm on 9 october 2014 imd 2014 severe cyclonic storm hudhud crossed the waverider buoy location within 10 km distance and made landfall about 30 km west northwest of visakhapatnam on 12 october 2014 noon local time fig 1 with maximum sustained wind speeds of 50 m s imd 2014 the track of the cyclone is shown as the red line in

suggested as the short term model for crest heights cuilin et al 2010 the sea surface elevation is generally described by the second order process and this distribution is commonly used in the estimation of extreme crests lian and haver 2015 1 p η exp η α h s β where hs is the significant wave height and η is the crest height the parameters α and β are expressed in terms of two parameters a

of the symmetry of a gaussian sea state according to mori et al 2002 the rayleigh distribution over predicts the probability of occurrence of large waves when compared with models of field data the

results and discussion during 9 to 13 october 2014 the significant wave height hs estimated from the wave spectrum varies from 1 17 to 7 59 m with an average value of 2 74 m fig 2 h1 3 from the zero up crossing method varied from 1 07 to 7 34 m with an average value of 2 58 m as reported in earlier studies the h1 3 from the time series is smaller than the hs from the wave spectrum the hs is high mainly on 12 october 2014 with a daily mean value of 4 03 m whereas on 11 and 13 october daily mean hs is 2 92 and 2 18 m respectively table 1 the maximum sustained wind speed during the cyclone is around 50 m s imd 2014 and the maximum wave height measured is 10 75 m whereas the wind speed from era5 for nearest location 18 50 n 84 50 e indicate that wind speed varied from 6 to 26 1 m s the wind speed during tc is largely underestimated in reanalysis data due to the still too low model resolution and dependence on parameterized processes used in the reanalyses hodges 2017 hence the wind speed reported in fig 2 is to be used with caution the relative change in the wave height 1 2 7 6 m is higher when compared to the relative change in the wind speed 6 26 1 m s fig 2 the time series plots of four records containing the high waves on 12 october 2014 are presented in fig 3 the height of the waves before and after the maximum wave height measured is 55 84 of the maximum value in different records the height of the top 20 waves in a 30 min record containing the highest hs on 12 october 2014 at different times indicates that the second highest wave height is 5 14 less than the highest wave height fig 4 a the maximum wave height measured is 10 75 m and the second highest wave in the same 30 min record is 10 2 m fig 4a hs for the 30 min record containing the highest waves is 7 59 and the ratio of hmax to hs is 1 4 and is lower than the theoretical value of 1 62 1 64 for 190 to 220 waves longuet higgins 1952 during the tc the ratio between hmax and hs for the 30 min record varied from 1 4 to 2 3 with an average value of 1 66 and the average value measured is close to the theoretical value since the wave data during the cyclone has a peak period between 9 1 and 12 5 s with an average value of 10 8 s the available sea states are in a regime of intermediate and shallow water depth the period of a wave can have a major effect on the dynamic response of marine structures the wave period corresponding to the highest wave height is 13 7 s fig 4d the wave period varied from 9 to 15 s for the highest 20 waves on 12 october 2014 in a 30 min record the crest height is 0 81 1 47 times the hs of the same 30 min data table 1 for the highest waves recorded elsewhere such as andrea and new year waves the crest height is 1 63 and 1 55 times the hs bitner gregersen et al 2014 the highest value observed in the present study is less than that reported elsewhere the waves are often referred to as rogue or freak waves when the crest height exceeds 1 25 h or the crest to trough height is above twice the hs haver 2000 sanil kumar et al 2013 and amrutha et al 2014 observed that during the tcs the average ratio of crest height to the corresponding wave height in 30 min record varied from 0 6 to 0 7 in the present study the average ratio of crest height to the corresponding wave height ranged from 0 4 to 0 7 with an average value of 0 58 fig 4b the ratio of the crest height to the trough height of the top 20 waves in 30 min record varied from 0 7 to 2 4 with an average value of 1 46 fig 4c the surface profile containing the extreme wave crests and extreme wave troughs on 12 october 2014 is presented in fig 5 the maximum crest height is 6 81 m and the maximum trough height is 5 m scatter plot of crest and trough heights from the 30 min record for waves with significant wave height more than 3 m from 10 to 13 october 2014 for all the data and for maximum wave height data in a 30 min record is presented in fig 6 wave crest height is greater than the trough height for the maximum wave height data during the growth process waves also become steeper and hence high waves have larger crest heights than the trough height the maximum crest height in a 30 min record is for the highest wave for height more than 8 m whereas for waves with height less than 8 m the maximum crest height is either for the highest wave or for waves with height less than the highest wave fig 7 a in each 30 min records the height of the wave having a maximum trough height is mainly less than the maximum wave height fig 7b during the study period the maximum crest height varied from 1 66 to 6 81 m fig 8 compares the two theoretical distributions with the field data at different times on 12 october 2014 the weibull distribution agrees well with the observed distribution but the rayleigh distribution shows a deviation from the other two distributions for high waves fig 8a e the maximum crest height measured is 8 lower than that obtained following the conventional rayleigh distribution based on data recorded the earlier studies have shown that rayleigh distribution over predicts the probability of occurrence of large waves compared with the observed data massel 1996 from the fig 8a e it is clearly shown that the rayleigh distribution estimates are higher than the observed value for high waves as the wave height increases the period also increases to a certain extent fig 9 a due to the increase in the wave period the wavelength increases and the wave feel the bottom and hence the height can change when the significant wave height is more than 3 m the wave satisfies the intermediate wave regime depth wavelength between 0 05 and 0 5 in intermediate water the highest wave disagrees with theoretical values most of the probability models of wave crest heights considered the effects of non linearities it is seen from fig 8 that for this location the forristall second order model i e the weibull model nearly coincides with observed data for high waves fig 8a e these models yield a significant larger extreme crest height than the rayleigh model the rayleigh distribution appears to be somewhat conservative as compared to the second order model of forristall it should however be stressed that regarding the most extreme waves the higher order effect may have a certain impact and therefore the forristall model can be considered as a lower bound model regarding extreme crest heights the root mean square error rmse and bias between the various distribution functions and field data for all the 30 min records on 12 october 2014 are determined and presented in fig 9a c along with the wave height and wave period for high waves h1 3 3 m the rmse and bias are less for weibull distribution compared to rayleigh distribution on 12 october 2014 the rmse of the rayleigh distribution varies from 0 02 to 3 32 m with a mean value of 1 82 m whereas that of weibull distribution is from 0 7 to 0 98 m with a mean value of 0 57 m the rayleigh distribution is biased 0 08 m higher than the observed distribution and the weibull distribution is biased 0 04 m lower than the observed data fig 9b and c the weibull and rayleigh distributions are also fitted to the data during the low wave conditions h1 3 1 m fig 10 during the low wave conditions both distributions perform well but still the weibull distribution outperforms the rayleigh distribution as evident from the low rmse and bias values fig 9e and f the analysis shows that the weibull distribution has better agreement with the observed data than the rayleigh distribution both during the high and low wave conditions in order to know how the time series generated from the wave spectrum differs from the original measured time series the stochastic wave time series is generated from the given spectrum fig 11shows the measured time series and simulated time series along with the wave spectrum it is important to note that in the process of making spectrum from a wave signal the phase information of the signal is lost hence it is not possible to simulate the original wave time series signal since ε n in equation 4 is a random number between 0 and 2 π simulated time series is not unique the hmax based on zero up crossing method from the simulated time series is 11 7 m whereas that of the measured time series is 10 75 m from the measured time series zero down crossing method resulted in hmax of 11 8 m the maximum crest and trough height from the simulated time series is 6 88 m and 6 45 m whereas it is 6 81 m and 5 m from the measured time series however the spectrum generated from the simulated time series has nearly similar statistical properties of the given spectrum the agreement between the two spectra reveals that the procedure for the generation of time series is valid hence the simulated time series nearly satisfy the expected statistics of the original time series 4 concluding remarks the examination of the time series data on sea surface elevation recorded during the tc hudhud indicates that the highest wave height measured is 10 75 m with a wave period of 13 7 s and the significant wave height of the 30 min record is 7 59 m the second highest wave height in a 30 min record is 5 14 less than the highest wave height the crest height of the wave is 0 81 1 47 times the significant wave height of the same 30 min data and the most extreme wave height is 1 46 1 83 times the significant wave height the crest height distribution agrees with the weibull distribution author contribution vsk conceptualization resources

introduction extreme waves are responsible for the most extreme loadings on ocean vessels and offshore structures cuilin et al 2010 the waves grow from absorbing the energy and momentum of the forcing wind when the wave crest is higher than the deck elevation the structure is more likely to get damaged one of the causes of failure of platforms is wave in deck loads and unexpectedly high crest heights mcconnell et al 2004 thus if extreme crest height is generated at the location of marine structures this can be a significant issue in the design of these structures it is therefore important that statistical models describing the crest height distribution are required during the design process of structures the crest height distribution is a function of wave steepness and the water depth when ocean waves are studied as random processes wave location at a fixed point is assumed to be gaussian based on linear wave theory in the case of a gaussian sea where there is zero up crossing the wave height distribution follows rayleigh distribution longuet higgins 1952 a real wave shows a small but distinct departure from a gaussian surface in such a case the wave asymmetry can be described by adding a quadratic correction term to the linear model forristall 1978 the resulting process is non gaussian and referred to as a second order weibull model according to prevosto et al 2000 weibull parameterisations should take both the wave steepness and the dimensionless depth into account the common expectation is that the rayleigh distribution over predicts the probability occurrence of large waves when compared with field data and the crest height distributions based on second order wave theory agree with most high quality measurements forristall 1978 tayfun 1990 massel 1996 mori et al 2002 krogstad and barstow 2004 stansell 2005 muralidharan et al 2007 lian and haver 2015 forristall 2000 established a second order crest distribution based on a large number of simulations and is now commonly being used to describe the short time second order crest distribution as the wave propagates the profile becomes asymmetric with higher crests together with shallower and flatter troughs due to the interaction between individual sine waves butler et al 2009 show that the linear wave model is often simplistic and leads to errors in the predicted crest height of about 10 20 the theoretical derivation of the distribution of crest height is a tricky problem especially when non linearities have to be considered in a given length of time the maximum crest height over an area will be larger than the maximum crest at a single point forristall 2006 lian and haver 2015 compared the second order distribution by forristall 2000 to the measurements at 190 m water depth in the north sea and reported that the second order distribution follows very well the measured data weibull distribution is also more effective for the simulation of maximum wave height distributions and estimating various wave height parameters muralidharan et al 2007 amrutha and kumar 2017 observed that for the high waves in the eastern arabian sea the most extreme wave height is 1 50 1 62 times of the significant wave height whereas the most extreme crest height is 1 23 1 35 times the significant wave height of the same 30 min record the high waves are generated due to the tropical cyclones also described as typhoons or hurricanes depending on global origin in the north indian ocean especially in the bay of bengal the occurrence of tropical cyclones tc is high in the bay of bengal significant wave height up to 7 3 m is measured during the tc phailin amrutha et al 2014 and 8 4 m during the passage of orissa super cyclone rajesh et al 2005 young 2006 reported the influence of the tc on wave parameters numerical modeling of the wave heights during the tropical cyclone hudhud indicates that the numerical model overestimates 5 17 the wave heights during most of the tc period except the peak value which was underestimated by 15 samiksha et al 2017 although the influence of tc on the wave parameters has been an area of active research the distribution of crest height during the tc is not described in the literature hence it is important to know the crest height distribution of waves during the tc and is the aim of the present study the data used in this study and the methods are described in section 2 results and discussion in section 3 and the conclusions are summarised in section 4 2 data and methodology the domain of the present study is the coastal waters of visakhapatnam the annual distribution of the wave characteristics of the study area is presented by anjali nair et al 2019 the wave data measured from 10 to 14 october 2014 at an interval of 30 min at 18 m water depth covering the period of tc hudhud with the datawell directional waverider buoy is used in the study the wave data of 2 october 2014 is used to compare the crest height distribution during the low wave conditions buoy use accelerometers to measure waves with wave heights up to 40 m and wave periods of 1 6 30 s with a vertical resolution of 0 01 m the displacement of the buoy is sampled at a rate of 3 84 hz and the data are transmitted and logged with a sampling frequency of 1 28 hz in the present study the memory card data of the buoy is used to avoid transmission losses an apparent wave is defined as the profile of the sea surface between two consecutive up crossings of the still water level the wave crest height hc i e the height of the crest level above still water level and the wave trough height ht i e the depth of trough below the mean water level for each individual wave are calculated from the heave time series data of 30 min duration the wave height h of the individual wave is the sum of the crest height and trough height the height of the maximum wave in a 30 min duration is hmax the cyclonic storm hudhud originated from a low pressure system in the andaman sea on 6 october 2014 intensified into a severe cyclonic storm on 9 october 2014 imd 2014 severe cyclonic storm hudhud crossed the waverider buoy location within 10 km distance and made

of the symmetry of a gaussian sea state according to mori et al 2002 the rayleigh distribution over predicts the probability of occurrence of large waves when compared with models of field data the

results and discussion during 9 to 13 october 2014 the significant wave height hs estimated from the wave spectrum varies from 1 17 to 7 59 m with an average value of 2 74 m fig 2 h1 3 from the zero up crossing method varied from 1 07 to 7 34 m with an average value of 2 58 m as reported in earlier studies the h1 3 from the time series is smaller than the hs from the wave spectrum the hs is high mainly on 12 october 2014 with a daily mean value of 4 03 m whereas on 11 and 13 october daily mean hs is 2 92 and 2 18 m respectively table 1 the maximum sustained wind speed during the cyclone is around 50 m s imd 2014 and the maximum wave height measured is 10 75 m whereas the wind speed from era5 for nearest location 18 50 n 84 50 e indicate that wind speed varied from 6 to 26 1 m s the wind speed during tc is largely underestimated in reanalysis data due to the still too low model resolution and dependence on parameterized processes used in the reanalyses hodges 2017 hence the wind speed reported in fig 2 is to be used with caution the relative change in the wave height 1 2 7 6 m is higher when compared to the relative change in the wind speed 6 26 1 m s fig 2 the time series plots of four records containing the high waves on 12 october 2014 are presented in fig 3 the height of the waves before and after the maximum wave height measured is 55 84 of the maximum value in different records the height of the top 20 waves in a 30 min record containing the highest hs on 12 october 2014 at different times indicates that the second highest wave height is 5 14 less than the highest wave height fig 4 a the maximum wave height measured is 10 75 m and the second highest wave in the same 30 min record is 10 2 m fig 4a hs for the 30 min record containing the highest waves is 7 59 and the ratio of hmax to hs is 1 4 and is lower than the theoretical value of 1 62 1 64 for 190 to 220 waves longuet higgins 1952 during the tc the ratio between hmax and hs for the 30 min record varied from 1 4 to 2 3 with an average value of 1 66 and the average value measured is close to the theoretical value since the wave data during the cyclone has a peak period between 9 1 and 12 5 s with an average value of 10 8 s the available sea states are in a regime of intermediate and shallow water depth the period of a wave can have a major effect on the dynamic response of marine structures the wave period corresponding to the highest wave height is 13 7 s fig 4d the wave period varied from 9 to 15 s for the highest 20 waves on 12 october 2014 in a 30 min record the crest height is 0 81 1 47 times the hs of the same 30 min data table 1 for the highest waves recorded elsewhere such as andrea and new year waves the crest height is 1 63 and 1 55 times the hs bitner gregersen et al 2014 the highest value observed in the present study is less than that reported elsewhere the waves are often referred to as rogue or freak waves when the crest height exceeds 1 25 h or the crest to trough height is above twice the hs haver 2000 sanil kumar et al 2013 and amrutha et al 2014 observed that during the tcs the average ratio of crest height to the corresponding wave height in 30 min record varied from 0 6 to 0 7 in the present study the average ratio of crest height to the corresponding wave height ranged from 0 4 to 0 7 with an average value of 0 58 fig 4b the ratio of the crest height to the trough height of the top 20 waves in 30 min record varied from 0 7 to 2 4 with an average value of 1 46 fig 4c the surface profile containing the extreme wave crests and extreme wave troughs on 12 october 2014 is presented in fig 5 the maximum crest height is 6 81 m and the maximum trough height is 5 m scatter plot of crest and trough heights from the 30 min record for waves with significant wave height more than 3 m from 10 to 13 october 2014 for all the data and for maximum wave height data in a 30 min record is presented in fig 6 wave crest height is greater than the trough height for the maximum wave height data during the growth process waves also become steeper and hence high waves have larger crest heights than the trough height the maximum crest height in a 30 min record is for the highest wave for height more than 8 m whereas for waves with height less than 8 m the maximum crest height is either for the highest wave or for waves with height less than the highest wave fig 7 a in each 30 min records the height of the wave having a maximum trough height is mainly less than the maximum wave height fig 7b during the study period the maximum crest height varied from 1 66 to 6 81 m fig 8 compares the two theoretical distributions with the field data at different times on 12 october 2014 the weibull distribution agrees well with the observed distribution but the rayleigh distribution shows a deviation from the other two distributions for high waves fig 8a e the maximum crest height measured is 8 lower than that obtained following the conventional rayleigh distribution based on data recorded the earlier studies have shown that rayleigh distribution over predicts the probability of occurrence of large waves compared with the observed data massel 1996 from the fig 8a e it is clearly shown that the rayleigh distribution estimates are higher than the observed value for high waves as the wave height increases the period also increases to a certain extent fig 9 a due to the increase in the wave period the wavelength increases and the wave feel the bottom and hence the height can change when the significant wave height is more than 3 m the wave satisfies the intermediate wave regime depth wavelength between 0 05 and 0 5 in intermediate water the highest wave disagrees with theoretical values most of the probability models of wave crest heights considered the effects of non linearities it is seen from fig 8 that for this location the forristall second order model i e the weibull model nearly coincides with observed data for high waves fig 8a e these models yield a significant larger extreme crest height than the rayleigh model the rayleigh distribution appears to be somewhat conservative as compared to the second order model of forristall it should however be stressed that regarding the most extreme waves the higher order effect may have a certain impact and therefore the forristall model can be considered as a lower bound model regarding extreme crest heights the root mean square error rmse and bias between the various distribution functions and field data for all the 30 min records on 12 october 2014 are determined and presented in fig 9a c along with the wave height and wave period for high waves h1 3 3 m the rmse and bias are less for weibull distribution compared to rayleigh distribution on 12 october 2014 the rmse of the rayleigh distribution varies from 0 02 to 3 32 m with a mean value of 1 82 m whereas that of weibull distribution is from 0 7 to 0 98 m with a mean value of 0 57 m the rayleigh distribution is biased 0 08 m higher than the observed distribution and the weibull distribution is biased 0 04 m lower than the observed data fig 9b and c the weibull and rayleigh distributions are also fitted to the data during the low wave conditions h1 3 1 m fig 10 during the low wave conditions both distributions perform well but still the weibull distribution outperforms the rayleigh distribution as evident from the low rmse and bias values fig 9e and f the analysis shows that the weibull distribution has better agreement with the observed data than the rayleigh distribution both during the high and low wave conditions in order to know how the time series generated from the wave spectrum differs from the original measured time series the stochastic wave time series is generated from the given spectrum fig 11shows the measured time series and simulated time series along with the wave spectrum it is important to note that in the process of making spectrum from a wave signal the phase information of the signal is lost hence it is not possible to simulate the original wave time series signal since ε n in equation 4 is a random number between 0 and 2 π simulated time series is not unique the hmax based on zero up crossing method from the simulated time series is 11 7 m whereas that of the measured time series is 10 75 m from the measured time series zero down crossing method resulted in hmax of 11 8 m the maximum crest and trough height from the simulated time series is 6 88 m and 6 45 m whereas it is 6 81 m and 5 m from the measured time series however the spectrum generated from the simulated time series has nearly similar statistical properties of the given spectrum the agreement between the two spectra reveals that the procedure for the generation of time series is valid hence the simulated time series nearly satisfy the expected statistics of the original time series 4 concluding remarks the examination of the time series data on sea surface elevation recorded during the tc hudhud indicates that the highest wave height measured is 10 75 m with a wave period of 13 7 s and the significant wave height of the 30 min record is 7 59 m the second highest wave height in a 30 min record is 5 14 less than the highest wave height the crest height of the wave is 0 81 1 47 times the significant wave height of the same 30 min data and the most extreme wave height is 1 46 1 83 times the significant wave height the crest height distribution agrees with the weibull distribution author contribution vsk conceptualization resources

22158,the work explains the rationale and principles behind the hydrodynamic design of a dynamically self stable hybrid platform to host a 10 mw turbine that is a free float capable tension leg platform the centec tlp it forgoes the often studied single column hull form combined with spokes and investigates an alternative closer to the conventional tlps while adhering to a limit hull weight after an overview of the static stability characteristics of ocean platforms an appropriate alternative is selected resulting in a barge tlp hybrid structure in transport it can float on a shallow draft with minimal response to wind and wave forces and it safely functions as a tlp when installed the safety check of the installed state is carried out by ensuring that slack moorings mooring line breaking and excessive surge motion does not occur each of these conditions is studied in rated and above rated operational conditions a 50 year extreme case is also examined to verify that the structure survives keywords wind energy floating wind tension leg platform dynamic stability 10 mw wind turbine 1 introduction offshore wind energy is now a part of a large industry starting with the monopile installations of the vindeby wind farm in 1991 following that development the ongoing years brought the idea of using floaters for waters surpassing certain depths the hywind spar by statoil jonkman 2010 became the first floating platform to be installed offshore others such as the windfloat cermelli et al 2009 roddier et al 2010 continued as demo projects with turbines up to 2 3 mw while other designs were in conceptual stages uzunoglu et al 2016 in terms of energy output these power production numbers are insufficient to provide for the energy needs of an area there are two solutions to this problem using larger turbines and installing them in higher numbers ultimately both must be done simultaneously for this reason in many studies 5 mw turbines became a standard robertson et al 2014a b robertson et al 2017 and 10 mw turbines have been mentioned as early as 2011 crozier 2011 european union projects such as the lifes50 confirmed the continued interest in the matter borg and bredmose 2015 followed by the industry e g udoh and zou 2019 however as the betz limit states it is not possible to increase the power obtained from a turbine without increasing area swept by its blades therefore higher power requires larger turbines that come with their downsides one definite factor is that the thrust caused by the turbine increases significantly e g 800 kn for a 5 mw turbine jonkman et al 2009 vs 1500 kn for a 10 mw turbine bak et al 2013 and poses a problem to be addressed for an onshore or fixed bottom installation this case becomes a structural issue where the support structure needs to resist the bending moments caused by the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces e g yeter et al 2019 for a floater it is a question of dynamics where the platform should provide favourable motions for energy production for instance large pitching angles of the platform cause fluctuations of the power output jeon et al 2014 regarding pitching and heaving motions most floaters are compliant in these modes moving with the waves and the wind however the tension leg platform tlp behaviour resembles a rigid structure due to its tensioned mooring lines brennan et al 2012 this reliance on the lines also poses the main disadvantage as the common tlp is unstable without them this point leads to a case where the structure needs to be moved to the site by other means such as specialised vessels amate et al 2016 alternatively the problem can also be addressed by making it sufficiently stable so that the turbine can be mounted onshore and the assembly later moved offshore by ordinary tugs floatation stability alone does not suffice to cover all necessities if this platform is to be towed from the shore it will benefit from lower transport drafts as ordinary ports and shipyards have depth limits which typically go up to 20 m this problem is not specific to tlps for instance the ideas such as the semisubmersible for a 10 mw wind turbine with a draft of approximately 37 m zhao and wang 2019 will also need special considerations at least in the initial phases of transportation a significant part of this issue is the weight of the tower and the turbine that result in a very high centre of gravity however they still need to be carried by the lightest possible floater for economic reasons accordingly platforms for large turbines benefit from complying with multiple design targets they need to have reasonable drafts and favourable dynamic responses while towing the turbine to the installation area they should also provide safety and satisfactory performance when installed these conditions should be adhered to while keeping a reasonable mass this work investigates the options for a platform that meets these criteria and explains the approach taken for a 10 mw turbine it starts by further detailing the summary above and reviewing the principles behind a floater s static stability then the selected alternative is paired with its installed condition that acts as a common tlp this approach leads to a barge tlp hybrid platform that can be referred to as an ftlp free float capable tlp named the centec tlp the barge mode is examined in its free floating condition for its dynamic behaviour the installed form is then checked to ensure that it complies with the safety requirements of a tlp by ensuring that slack moorings mooring line breaking and excessive surge motion does not occur these checks are done in the turbine s rated and above rated operational conditions a 50 year extreme case is also included to verify that the structure survives 2 design considerations the sections below expand on the introduction and present preliminary information for the design process since floating wind is in its early stages especially for larger turbines statistical data is limited in this field in this case the best option until the industry establishes itself is to examine all available figures to make informed choices in the process therefore also monopiles are discussed when looking into the mass data 2 1 stabilisation methods of ocean platforms butterfield et al 2007 classified the stability principles of floaters on a triangle by naming the vertices as buoyancy stabilised ballast stabilised and mooring stabilised platforms following this convention the tlp is mooring stabilised with the remaining alternatives i e barges spars and semisubmersibles distributed inside the triangle eventually all platform types use a combination of these stabilisation components and altering this naming convention can reduce the ambiguity the spar is the typical example of the ballast stabilised platform however most floaters make use of ballasting for instance the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible uses 9620 tons of ballast and has a hull steel weight of 3850 tons making the ballast to lightweight ratio 2 5 to unity robertson et al 2014a b it is however not classified as a spar or as ballast stabilised a spar relies on the rather deep placement of the added weight to counter the overturning moments therefore the difference is that the countering weight should be located deep inside the water making deep ballast stabilised a more descriptive designation the barge is listed as a buoyancy stabilised structure while buoyancy acts on virtually all bodies inside a fluid the difference between the barge and another body subject to buoyancy is the distribution of the forces that they are subject to for that reason waterplane area stabilised platform better identifies the main contributor the semisubmersible takes a different place in this regard making use of deeper placed ballast at operational conditions they are commonly referred to as column stabilised units det norske veritas dnv 2013 making use of both ballasting and sufficient waterplane area there are also applications in oil and gas that are set out in a manner similar to a barge floating on the pontoons to have a larger waterplane area in transport a necessary clarification for the tlp is that the mooring lines alone do not stabilize the platform the buoyancy force in excess of the structure s weight is the primary factor that keeps the lines in tension hence the tension leg platform is literally stabilised by the magnitude of buoyancy due to its underwater volume in combination with the mooring setup the mooring stabilised definition was accordingly replaced by mooring and buoyancy as an acknowledgement of this balance fig 1 summarises this information by providing a stability triangle for these platform types uzunoglu 2019 accordingly without the moorings there are two options to make a platform self stable either the deep ballast case should be considered or a large enough waterplane area should increase the metacentric height to a safe level in both cases the solution should consider that the 10 mw turbine will be heavy with the centre of gravity located rather high given that the aim is to keep the platform i e the base low in weight the overall centre of gravity will match that height the deep ballast solution is impractical for the same reason that a spar needs to be carried to the installation site by other means the floatation draft is higher than what shores can provide for instance the hywind spar accommodates nrel s 5 mw turbine jonkman 2010 at a 120 m draft while the typical anchorage depth of ports is can be 15 20 m an alternative is to use heavy ballast and to provide sufficient space for it in the hull this option will inevitably increase the draft as well since the overall mass increases finally it is also possible to rely on a large waterplane area alone if the total hull mass can be redistributed favourably returning to a modified version of the conventional tlp hull form can make this possible 2 2 steel mass data of the current offshore turbine installations many factors define the economics of floating wind turbines ranging from mooring line complexity to distance to shore making it a topic that needs to be addressed separately while this point is acknowledged certain studies james and costa ros 2015 list reduced hull mass as the priority in making floating wind turbines feasible it is accordingly useful to have approximate numbers regarding the weight of the platform unfortunately the number of installed floating turbines is limited making statistics unreliable due to the small sample size it is however possible to extract preliminary information for fixed bottom offshore applications that have reached considerable numbers while the structures are different this type of overview will give a general idea of where floater designs stand compared to their fixed bottom counterparts germany s fraunhofer institute reports the distribution of the average depth of installed offshore wind turbines with the values in table 1 fraunhofer iwes 2019 it is seen from these values that approximately 96 of current installations are in depths up to 40 m beyond this number fixed bottom structures seem to present technical challenges and economic difficulties that are not beneficial to address the corresponding average mass for monopiles used in offshore wind platforms can be obtained from damiani et al 2016 by reworking the data into the format in fig 2 the values show that at 40 m the total mass of the support structure reaches 225 tons mw this value can be taken as an initial indicator and evaluated further below 2 3 design considerations on tension leg platforms considering platform types the tlp distinguishes itself as the lightest alternative table 2 gives the mean maximum and minimum masses of steel platform hulls per mw power output james and costa ros 2015 the average tlp is 209 tonnes mw which approximately matches the value discussed above making the average semisubmersible 83 per cent and the spar 33 per cent heavier one reason that the tlp ends up lighter than the alternatives is that most current studies e g bachynski and moan 2012 henderson et al 2010 matha 2010 oguz et al 2018 wang et al 2014 are based on the seastar design kibbee et al 1995 1999 that has its origins on the idea of making a the hull smaller generally the massachusetts institute of technology model serves as the basis for these platforms sclavounos et al 2007 tracy 2007 however the conventional tlp form is the conoco phillips hutton in 1984 it was similar to a floating production system e g lee et al 2007 regarding its use of ring pontoons underwater while the wind industry has invested heavily in the seastar hull form it is not as highly favoured in the oil and gas sector comprising only 5 of the 30 tlps up to date the latest two installations were in 2003 and 2007 souza and aggarwal 2013 in either case for the tlp the advantage gained from steel mass is reduced by other complexities the report of james and costa ros 2015 lists the top three topics to address for the advancement of floating wind as platform weight installation procedures and port side operation and maintenance tlp s disadvantages are mostly associated with the stages up to where it is installed and operational its instability without its mooring lines forces alternative solutions to the problem such as additional barges at this point it should be considered that having specialised vessels for tow out stages may be less detrimental in the oil and gas sector where a single platform is installed in an oil field operating for many years opposingly offshore wind farms are composed of high numbers of turbines therefore the hiring costs of specialised vessels accumulate additionally a low number of barges towing the structures from the shore is time inefficient and high numbers of barges are a loss on the mass advantage if these vessels are specialised to carry a single turbine and platform configuration they will need to be taken off service once the wind farm is operational hence this approach effectively offsets the gains made by tlps given the recent emphasis to improving production speeds using modular structures e g tension leg platforms as explained in yatish 2019 and the parallel production methods devised for semisubmersibles roddier et al 2016 both the transport and manufacturing bottlenecks should be addressed to increase the feasibility of floating wind turbines a viable option for transport would be to have platforms that are self stable and have sufficient dynamic stability in waves in order to be towed out by ordinary tugs however these two examples to such self stable tlp designs yanqing et al 2017 and gicon adam et al 2014 2013 report mass values above the standard tlp design and the average value above i e 209 t mw 335 t mw and 307 t mw respectively in terms of steel weight gicon also incorporates concrete into the design therefore it may merit a different classification in summary to keep its advantages a tlp should be stable enough when free floating responding minimally to environmental forces so that it can be towed to the installation site when installed it should comply with the performance and safety requirements these two conditions should be met while staying below the 225 t mw margin the next section proceeds to describe the design process to match these goals 3 principles for the design process 3 1 relationship between wind and wave loads for larger turbines not considering accidental loads the two prominent forces on floating wind turbines are the hydrodynamic and the aerodynamic ones in operation larger turbines shift the balance of these forces slightly towards aerodynamics for a few reasons one clear factor is the higher thrust forces of the turbine the other change is caused by the height of the tower combined with the turbine s cut out wind speeds consider the nrel 5 mw turbine design jonkman et al 2009 with the cut out and rated wind speeds of 25 m s and 11 4 m s respectively dtu s upscaling of the turbine bak et al 2013 to 10 mw states identical values assume an environment where the wind speed is estimated based on the relationship in michel 1999 shigunov 2018 given for 10 m above the water level 1 h s 0 0248 v w 2 the wind as a function of altitude can be expressed with the following relationship 2 u z u z r z z r α the u z term is the wind speed at height z and the u zr represents the wind speed at height z r the power law exponent is denoted by α with this information the wind and wave relationship in table 3 is obtained relating a set of wave heights and associated wind speeds at 10 m 90 and 129 m assuming that the tower starts 10 m above the water level 90 and 129 correspond to the hub level of the nrel 5 mw and dtu 10 mw turbines in this simplified environment i e disregarding wind turbulence the variability of wave heights and similar factors to illustrate the point a 10 mw turbine will operate up to a 7 m significant wave height while the 5 mw turbine will be functional with waves up to 8 m above these numbers the turbines are parked as the wind at hub level exceed the cut out speeds the approximate value of the maximum thrust provided by the 5 mw turbine is 800 kn vs 1500 kn for the 10 mw turbine both are delivered at the rated wind speed of 11 4 m s this wind leads to smaller waves at the rated speed of the larger turbine in summary considering operational turbines with identical cut out speeds the combined loading under wind and waves shift towards environments with smaller waves as the turbines get larger 3 2 the free floating condition in the free floating condition the structure is assembled as a system with the platform tower nacelle and the hub consider the following equation of static stability 3 g m k b b m k g the following are the related considerations the platform s draft should be shallow enough so that it can be moved without requiring deep ports this port depth limitation implies that the kb distance from the keel to the centre of buoyancy of the platform will need to be a small value e g 5 m the reduction coming from the kg distance from the keel to the centre of gravity of the structure will be a substantial value e g approximately 90 m for the 10 mw dtu turbine discussed here the platform will be kept as light as possible accordingly it will not be lowering the kg on its own lowering the kg with added ballast will increase the overall displacement and the floatation draft these considerations leave the bm value distance from the centre of buoyancy to the metacentre as the remaining option that needs to be large enough e g above 90 m to provide a positive gm distance from the centre of gravity to the metacentre the following is the formulation of the bm value 4 b m i w p the waterplane area inertia and the displacement are i w p and respectively for a free floating structure without ballast the displacement equates to the sum of the masses of the turbine and the platform this case leaves the waterplane moment of inertia as the defining value that needs to be large enough to counteract the reduction of the kg value when floating there are tower drag forces turbine thrust and wave forces that pitch the platform for the tower the heeling caused by the wind can be calculated using the formulation in the dnv guidelines det norske veritas dnv 2012 the geometry of the tower can be sectioned and the forces applied at the centre of each section where the moment arm is taken as a r integrating these values will give the corresponding moments with the pitch restoring coefficient c 55 the resulting heeling angle to due to wind forces ξ 55 w on the tower f w i n d can be found 5 ξ 55 w σ f w i n d i a r i c 55 the feathered blade will also be exposed to wind leading to loads on the parked rotor f r o t o r the drag forces on the blades depend on their position pitching and azimuth angles the aerodynamic load on the rotor due to the wind is then an input which can be obtained from the turbine data it will result in the following heeling response ξ 55 t 6 ξ 55 t σ f r o t o r i a r i c 55 these forces combined with the waves should not cause the platform to heel beyond its stability limits wave resonance should also be avoided in transport 3 3 the installed platform most of a tlp s design concerns relate to the mooring responses in addition to the resonance conditions to avoid consider the following equation that defines the natural frequencies of an undamped single degree of freedom system 7 ω n c h c m m t a i j the restoring terms c h and c m represent the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic components respectively the structure s total mass is m t while the contribution of the added mass is denoted by a i j the areas exposed to waves e g surface piercing columns increase the surge motion therefore it is beneficial to reduce this exposure limiting the waterplane area lowers c h and leaves the mooring lines c m as the primary contributor to stiffness assume that the mooring restoring matrix can be written in the following form from the example of clauss and birk 1996 8 c m f l i n e l m 0 0 0 z l f l i n e l m 0 0 f l i n e l m 0 z l f l i n e l m

elasticity is e a and the length of the mooring lines are l m the coordinates of the fairleads are given with x y and z in the cartesian system the force on each line depends on a relationship between the mass of the structure and the buoyancy 9 f l i n e ρ m t g n t the displacement is represented by and n t is the number of mooring lines the density of the water and the acceleration of gravity and are ρ and g respectively with these definitions it is possible to read the way the platform dynamics will be affected by certain variables the c m 1 1 and c m 2 2 in the mooring line stiffness equation 8 show that tlp installations will become problematic below a certain depth installing the same tlp in a shallower location leads to stiffer structures that eventually place the surge and sway natural periods inside the first order wave excitation range for this reason tension leg platforms are better suited to intermediate and deeper waters while the tlp complies in lateral motions and yaw it resembles a fixed platform in terms of heave pitch and roll resonant responses the diagonal components heave roll pitch and yaw show that the mooring line material changes the responses by altering the overall stiffness even if the platform designs are identical accordingly a tlp s installation depth should surpass a limit value to allow longer natural periods in the surge sway and yaw modes simultaneously correctly tensioned lines made of stiff material should be located at a sufficient distance that provides the moment arm leading to high natural frequencies in the other modes the resonance conditions follow this information by aiming to set the surge sway yaw natural periods above 25 s and the remaining values under 5 s i e wave excitation ranges given in det norske veritas dnv 2013 the rotor and the blade passing frequencies 1p and 3p should also be avoided along with the tower natural frequency after having the resonant characteristics set adequately the platform should also respond to aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces to a level that does not allow slack moorings or cause the mooring lines to break slack moorings are a case where the mooring line loses tension and may go into compression losing tension may not be the main issue if flexible lines are used so there is no buckling however when the line comes back into tension it encounters a significant amount of dynamic loading this factor brings a set of related issues and it is considered an ultimate limit state of a tension leg platform a method to address these considerations in initial design stages in the frequency domain is to calculate the motions at the fairleads given the response amplitude operators due to waves the addition of the forces coming from the turbine will allow estimating the reactions of the structure to the waves and the wind exciting forces assume that the motions at the fairleads are defined by δ z and the stretched length of the mooring lines are defined by l m in this case the loss of mooring line tension due to the platform motions f l o s s can be estimated by 10 f l o s s e a l m δ z for the sake of completeness the increased buoyancy force f b due to the heaving motion and the component of the surge force that applies on the angled mooring line f s m can be added 11 d f m f b f s m f l o s s regarding the breaking of the mooring lines api rp2t api 2010 recommends a safety factor of 1 67 up to twice the initial tension resulting in 12 2 f l i n e f b r e a k 1 67 along with these considerations the surge motion needs to be limited to keep the angles at the anchors below 5 chakrabarti 2005 4 the design process and the numerical model 4 1 summary of the process and the design criteria the design process is carried out with a system that contains three components a 3d modeller parmod a design system that provides the connections and intermediate calculations and a model maker for time domain simulations the parametric 3d modelling tool parmod is explained in detail in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2018a and the design system is described in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2019 time domain model maker is available in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016 fig 3 shows the schematics of the process summarised below parmod makes multi purpose parametric 3d models with quadrilateral meshes that can be used in a potential flow code and reports back the 6x6 mass matrix the mass calculation is done for the entire structure including the tower and the turbine then the submerged geometry is extracted by truncating the model at the waterline and fed to wamit lee and newman 2005 to get the potential flow solution the mooring is designed using a set of given material properties considering the line breaking limits an iterative process is followed by starting with a single mooring line per corner of the platform and testing a given set of physically feasible diameter limits when the maximum diameter is reached the number of mooring lines is increased and the diameter is reduced back to the minimal value this process is repeated until the relationship between mooring line tension in still water and breaking strength in equation 12 is satisfied the setup is then used with the turbine s thrust vs wind speed curve to have an early estimation of motions in the frequency domain by combining this information with the response amplitude operators for the platform this output is used to check a set of environmental conditions and ensure that the mooring lines do not break or go slack the environmental data is the entire scatter diagram of the installation area it also examines the surge limits and resonance conditions additionally a selected 50 year extreme condition is verified after confirming the installed condition the draft without the mooring lines is calculated equalling to the point where the submerged volume matches the mass the hull is then checked in this free floating condition to ensure that it floats on the pontoons its hydrodynamic responses are acceptable and it is designed outside the wave resonance zone the system builds a time domain model in nrel s fast jonkman 2007 for the successful design candidate obtained in the frequency domain and verifies that the platform behaves as intended an overview of the criteria is summarised in table 4 for both the installed structure and the dynamics of the float out condition 4 2 the turbine and the tower the turbine and the tower are dtu s technical university of denmark 10 mw design bak et al 2013 which is an upwind three blade turbine upscaled and revised from the 5 mw nrel version jonkman et al 2009 compared to a direct upscaling it has a shorter tower and a larger hub diameter the tower nacelle and the rotor mass are also reduced table 5 lists the specifications for the frequency domain design stage the tower is modelled as a distributed mass using parmod resulting in the mass and inertial data in table 6 these numbers are reported given that the connection of the tower is 10 m above the water level when the platform is in its installed configuration the nacelle and the rotor are modelled as a point mass with input values in table 7 combining the tower and the rotor nacelle assembly rna sets the mass details provided in table 8 it should be noted that with a 10 m base height the structure s centre of gravity is located at 85 6 m above the water level there is also a small eccentricity in the longitudinal direction coming from the offset centre of mass of the turbine in motion this value will reflect as a difference in the tensions of the mooring lines the frequency domain motion estimations require knowing the thrust forces caused by the running turbine the dtu report referenced above contains these values as calculated with the hawc2 software larsen and hansen 2015 a fast model of the turbine is also made publicly available by dtu and used in this work providing the thrust values in fig 4 this data has an offset compared to hawc2 values being approximately 150 kn higher the reason for this difference is that fast s output contains all loads transmitted across the shaft between the rotor and the gearbox including the applied aerodynamic loads gravitational loads from the rotor mass and shaft tilt tower deflection platform pitch and inertial loads from the rotor mass inertia and acceleration deceleration these gravitational and inertial loads are the deviations from the pure aerodynamic thrust reported by hawc2 4 3 the platform the platform model and the tower shown in fig 5 uses the component names in fig 6 mooring line connections are also numbered for easier referral later the outcome of the mass data will inevitably be influenced by the selected steel thickness for instance there are tlp designs with a steel thickness of 1 5 cm crozier 2011 with a steel density of 7850 kg m3 while this number leads to a light structure it should be reconsidered a mean value for steel thickness of tension leg platforms is discussed in bachynski and moan 2012 using the data given in chakrabarti 2005 originating from that input an approximation of 3 4 cm is given being a structure of similar draft the oc4 semisubmersible s a robertson et al 2014a b mean steel thickness of approximately 5 cm can also be informative to work with as the structure has a similar draft with these numbers the base value for steel thickness was taken as 4 cm for this platform the components above the water have a 3 5 cm thickness the steel density of the platform follows the values in the design of nrel s oc3 hywind turbine s tower jonkman et al 2009 and dtu 10 mw s tower bak et al 2013 and assumes 8500 kg m3 to account for additional structural components these considerations summarised in table 9 the resulting mass properties of the platform are in table 10 where it stays below the 225 t mw limit previously decided as discussed in the design requirements neither the installed platform nor the free floating form requires ballasting therefore this number is the total mass value regarding the geometry the platform is designed using rectangular pontoons as this form has an advantage in keeping a consistent waterplane area as the platform heaves in free float condition in terms of hydrodynamics chakrabarti 2005 states that having a corner radius of d 6 where d is the column diameter has shown better dynamics compared to flat panels the lower and upper columns follow that recommendation for the potential flow solution dnv recommends using 1 6 of the smaller wave frequency of interest as the mesh size det norske veritas dnv 2010 which corresponds to an average panel side length of 4 6 m the document also suggests that the mesh size should be small enough to represent the geometry correctly comparing the volume of the platform with a reference 1 m mesh size a 2 m mesh results in an acceptable volume difference less than 0 8 per cent for this structure this value complies with similar works regarding panel methods where the geometry needs to be discretised jafaryeganeh et al 2015 ko et al 2011 accordingly the 2 m uniform mesh was utilized for the potential flow calculations the resulting nondimensional hydrodynamic coefficients and exciting forces are given in fig 7 for both the free floating and installed conditions in the figures a w stands for the wave amplitude g for the acceleration of gravity ρ for water density and l represents the scaling length which equals unity in this case an interesting aspect is the occurrence of the negative added mass when free floating which is seen in structures that have elements that enclose a portion of the free surface e g moonpool type openings that occur when this platform is on its pontoons mciver and mciver 2016 in addition to radiation damping the platform comes under the influence of hydrodynamic viscous damping a common practice in initial design is to assume a percentage of critical damping as the viscous component e g lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 yan et al 2015 with values ranging from 1 to 3 per cent however overestimating this number may lead to favourable results in simulations that may not match a real life scenario additionally a tlp s motions are dominated by inertial forces unless it is in resonance o kane et al 2002 these cases make it a more reliable and conservative approach to disregard viscous damping at this stage unless its value was obtained with a level of certainty 4 4 mooring lines in the oil and gas sector tension leg platforms use steel pipes of larger diameters however for wind energy platforms using materials such as wire ropes e g yanqing et al 2017 or chains e g moon iii and nordstrom 2010 is also possible these mooring lines have the advantage of being flexible hence they can be used for purposes such as lowering a gravity anchor that is already connected to the structure kausche et al 2018 however their diameters should be set with values that can be realistically obtained the current platform is moored with 6 strand steel wire ropes with a 14 cm diameter resulting in the data in table 11 chakrabarti 2005 the design code considers them as an additional stiffness matrix in the frequency domain design stage in the time domain stage the mooring is remodelled using fast s finite elements module feamooring wendt et al 2016 as the quasi static and lumped mass models underestimate the responses coulling et al 2013 uzunoglu and guedes soares 2018b 2015 4 5 environmental conditions the installation area is taken as galicia spain and the environmental conditions are presented in table 12 silva et al 2015 the wind speeds at the hub height were calculated following the power profile in equation 2 and relating them to the wind speeds with equation 1 in addition to these conditions a 50 year extreme condition is checked defined with a 12 5 m wave height the frequency domain design stage checks all these wind wave combinations to ensure that the platform stays safe the operational above operational and 50 year extreme conditions are further verified with the time domain model 5 evaluation of platform motion dynamics 5 1 responses in the free floating condition when the structure is placed in the water the draft is 3 85 m leaving 1 2 m of the pontoons outside the water table 13 contains the static equilibrium data when free floating without external excitation the static pitching angle is 0 22 caused by the offset in the centre of gravity of the turbine the waterplane area of the platform is provided in fig 8 this area results in a metacentric height of 27 8 m with a stability up to 10 degrees of heeling with the righting arm provided in fig 9 this number is the position where two of the lower columns that have a current freeboard of 3 65 m get submerged and the remaining two start exiting the water as shown in fig 10 accordingly it can be adjusted by altering their height for instance collu et al 2014 yanqing et al 2017 advice reserving a 15 degree angle for positive stability however vanishing angle on its own is not an indicator of a platform s dynamic stability this number needs to be considered conjointly taking the responses of the platform into account in port the structure is in almost still water conditions when being towed favourable weather windows are selected since towing installation procedures are risky in adverse or extreme weather for example the largest studied wave height is 2 m in amate et al 2016 with that information assuming a maximum wave height of 3 m for towing is reasonable consider the wave responses of the platform in its free floating condition given in fig 11 as calculated by a potential flow solver considering the geometry up to the water level the weather conditions in galicia previously given in table 12 lists that most smaller waves up to 3 m are clustered between 5 and 10 s of wave periods the platform s corresponding largest pitch rao is 0 38 in this region while the minimum is 0 09 showing a rather limited response heave motion is larger but does not pose a stability concern there is a peak seen at around 4 8 s which is the heave resonant frequency previously listed in table 13 the pitch natural frequency is 22 3 s given that pitching is more critical for stability reasons this case is more relevant the maximum towing wave height of 3 m corresponds to a wind speed of 11 m s 10 m above the water level detailed in table 12 at this value integrating the drag forces on the tower causes a further heeling angle of 0 36 at the hub level the corresponding wind speed is 15 8 m s the platform pitches further about 0 11 due to the exposed rotor with the feathered blades a secondary effect of the asymmetric geometry of the blades will also lead to rolling motion due to the resulting lateral forces it is important to note that this force is different than the rotor torque at the shaft countered by the shaft brake in this case the resulting roll amplitude is unlikely to match or exceed the pitching caused by the directly applied thrust force considering the hull symmetry it stands to reason that the tilting angles will not surpass 0 1 this factor was neglected as the isolated roll motion is rather small to affect the overall platform dynamics rounding the values up the total pitching motion under a 3 m wave height and 15 8 m s wind at the hub level will reach approximately 1 3 with the contributors listed in table 14 this number does not seem likely to pose a problem for a structure that is stable up to 10 5 2 static equilibrium and natural frequencies in the installed condition when the platform is installed it is lowered to a draft of 20 m with 12 mooring lines installed the related properties are provided in table 15 given the large mass of the turbine and its offset centre of gravity the mooring line tensions change depending on the position of the nacelle this mass does not cause a significant difference under static equilibrium however that case needs to be seen when the platform is responding to excitation forces 5 3 motion dynamics of the installed platform generally the response amplitude operators raos and spectral densities psds contain the necessary information to evaluate the motion dynamics of a structure conversely for a tlp they also mask major indicators of failure modes providing only the spectral densities hides slack moorings mooring line breaking and unwanted surge motion these topics are better addressed by looking into the time domain data where these numbers can be read from alternatively limits and the maxima need to be provided all three options will be presented below time series maxima and spectral densities table 16 can serve as a useful referral list for the natural frequencies while evaluating the psd data three environmental cases are shown here the first one is the rated wind speed and the second case examines above rated winds close to the cut out value the third scenario considers the 50 year extreme values where the turbine is parked the waves are generated with the jonswap spectrum while the wind adheres to the kaimal spectrum to comply with the guidelines in det norske veritas dnv 2013 the summary of the environment used in time domain simulations is given in table 17 each of these conditions is run with 5 different seeds randomizing both wind and waves the runtime of the operational conditions i e rated and above rated are 1200 s per seed and the 50 year extreme case is run for 1800 s per seed time series are discussed in detail for one of the seeds to understand the motions better the maxima and minima attained of all seeds are then provided in tabular format as shown previously in fig 6 the first four mooring lines are numbered as follows to make the discussion easier at the fairlead locations 1 2 3 and 4 the lines 1 4 are located upwind i e closer to the rotor and 2 3 are located downwind the remaining mooring lines keep rotating in the same order each position is examined separately as it is essential to check the mooring line with the lowest tension 5 3 1 isolated responses to wind and waves responses to the linear wind and regular wave isolated loads are provided in table 18 to form a basis of understanding for the stochastic cases linear wind follows the previously described power profile the data was obtained by running the simulations 60 s after the transient stage ends since upwind and downwind lines behave almost identically in this scenario due to symmetry only the first and the second lines are given the turbine thrust s prominence in forcing surge motion is visible however despite the size of the turbine the 50 year extreme wave value results in amplitudes that are 73 higher this case makes it critical to evaluate surging in storms for mooring line anchor angle limits another noticeable condition is the effect of rotor shaft tilting angle i e 5 for the dtu 10 mw turbine in the rated wind speed heaving mode that forces a submersion of 10 cm overall the wave effect on pitching seems to be higher than the wind loading the highest wind caused pitching moment matches the condition where the thrust is the highest the rated wind speed mooring line tensions show that both above rated and 50 year extreme cases are important in verifying their behaviour and the upwind and downwind values can significantly differ 5 3 2 responses in stochastic environments 5 3 2 1 rated operational conditions the spectral densities are provided for all environments under the rated operational conditions section for easier comparison each case is then discussed in detail in their relevant sections it is useful to note that these systems cannot be expected to behave linearly for reasons such as the presence of the active blade pitch controller the motions will change based on the system s operational status e g an assumption of linearity regarding the responses cannot be made when comparing a parked turbine with a running turbine accordingly the results need to be treated as in the case of looking into different setups of the same structure under the rated operational conditions the platform is exposed to 11 4 m s wind speeds at the hub level and a wave height of 3 m responding as given in fig 12 these motions lead to the critical values listed in table 19 the mooring line responses differ depending on their location lines 1 and 4 show the lowest tensions while the pitching motion results in higher maxima in the remaining mooring lines in this case the maximum tension is 5540 kn while the minimum is 1694 kn regarding surge responses the rated speed is where it is likely to become problematic since the turbine provides the highest thrust in this scenario while it is possible to avoid surge forces from waves by reducing the platform s exposure the aerodynamic forces are unavoidable therefore it is also inevitable that the platform surges due to the forces on the rotor that have their maximum value at the rated speed see fig 4 the maximum amplitude reaches 7 10 m but stays under the limit of 13 m that correspond to the 5 degree anchor angle the psds of the motions are presented in fig 13 and mostly serve to examine the resonant responses comparing the mooring responses between themselves clarify why time series is crucial to evaluate the design of a tension leg platform the psds show that the mooring line responses differ however they do not provide any additional information at the same time the time series show significant differences up to 1100 kn between the tensions depending on their location a similar statement can be made for the surge motion as psds do not answer whether the motion is too large to be a problem the heave resonance occurring at 0 48 hz has a significant effect on the mooring line tensions however the amplitude of this high frequency exaction from the waves is small as seen from the wave spectral density repeating the simulations with different seeds does not reveal notable differences apart from showing an 8 m surge maximum value in table 20 that continues to stay within limits over these responses a discussion on design principles can be presented as follows this tlp features four surface piercing columns these columns cause the structure to be exposed to surge forces however they are small enough to limit this motion at the same time they provide additional hydrostatic stiffness in the pitching motion which in turn contributes to reducing the mooring responses having exposed columns is beneficial in adjusting the pitching response while it is not preferred for the surge mode if an optimal point is found they help to obtain a more stable platform 5 3 2 2 above rated operational conditions this condition is defined with waves with a significant height of 8 m and wind speeds of 22 4 m s at hub height when the turbine is running in these above rated conditions there is an exchange of balance between the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces compared to the rated condition the platform is exposed to lower thrust forces from the turbine while the cyclic loads of the waves increase the results reflect this change as shown in table 21 and in the time series of fig 14 the maximum amplitude of the surge motion reduces from 7 10 m to 6 09 m following the thrust reduction this underlines the necessity in checking for maximum surge under operational conditions especially for larger turbines mooring line tensions also exchange places this time giving the maximum values on the fairleads that are located downwind i e 2 3 and minimal values located upwind 1 4 there are no mooring line breaking or slack mooring occurrences the spectral densities show that large mooring line responses that coincide with the heave resonance the heave and pitch motions in the lower frequencies are reduced in this case accordingly in these regions the overall mooring line response is also reduced compared to the rated wind case this reduction in the lower frequencies is related to the platform s response to the wind spectra which happen in lower frequencies than the waves varying the wind and wave time series leads to the values in table 22 with the minimum mooring line tension value occurring on line 4 this finding is consistent with the provided time series the rotating turbine tends to roll the structure prominently to one side leading to this difference between lines one and four despite the centreline symmetry of the platform the minimal value attained throughout the repetitions is 30 lower 5 3 2 3 50 year extreme conditions in a storm the blades feather and the rotor is locked into position to avoid damage to the turbine the high speed shaft brake is the component that is expected to hold the rotor in place this condition was enforced by increasing the maximum high speed shaft brake torque until it was verified that no rotation of the blades occurs with the turbine parked the waves are the prominent force that the platform needs to resist surviving until the end of the storm fig 15 and table 23 prove this to be the case despite having the largest and lowest mooring line tensions of the three test cases the mean value of the standard deviation of all line tensions is 774 kn that keeps 78 per cent of the initial tension in the lines throughout the time series however a significant pitching and heaving motion occurring at approximately 1000 s forces a substantial reduction following a wave height of 17 5 m the lowest number of 652 kn corresponds to the mooring line tension approximately 18 per cent of the static equilibrium value the psds see fig 13 reveal higher pitching motions due to waves that directly relate to the mooring responses increasing the wave height and parking the turbine leads to higher hydrodynamic loading and lower turbine thrust compared to the rated operational conditions accordingly the severity of the platform responses increase inside the wave excitation frequencies at the same time the reactions are reduced in lower frequencies below the wave excitation range altering the wind and wave seeds leads to slightly more severe responses there is no slack mooring occurrence in the result set of table 24 however the tension of line 4 drops to 550 kn in a response highly linked to the instantaneous amplitude and phase of pitch and heave modes the maximum surge motion reaches 12 89 m staying slightly below the 13 m limit overall the values do not surpass the limits defined in the design criteria in table 4 6 conclusions the single column tlp has been extensively studied as a candidate for floating wind however it presents challenges such as relying on specialised vessels for transport instead of ordinary tugs considering that wind farms are planned in higher number of units this approach is impractical revisiting the conventional hull form it is possible to implement a dynamically stable design capable of free floating on a shallow draft i e an ftlp free float capable tlp that also performs well as a tlp in this manner the structure can be towed without being concerned with shore side depth limits the total mass can still be kept sufficiently low if it is redistributed correctly this work explained the hydrodynamic design process of the ftlp the centec tlp as a floater that adheres to the requirements listed above the aim was to see minimal wave responses when floating as a barge and performing safely as a tlp in operation initially a discussion on the stability principles of ocean platforms was given out of these a form that allows carrying the turbine without needing a deeper draft lead to the barge tlp hybrid floater this hull was coupled with a 10 mw turbine to understand how it behaves while free floating and when installed it was confirmed that this form will have restrained responses within its stability limits when free floating the safety check of the installed condition was done by looking into the mooring responses the structure did not encounter any problems regarding slack mooring occurrences mooring line breaking or excessive surge motions that would cause mooring line problems at the anchors it also survived the 50 year extreme condition staying at the average mass of the current tlp designs the hull shape keeps the advantages gained by the single column tlp form and adds benefits in terms of practicality in transport credit author

22158,the work explains the rationale and principles behind the hydrodynamic design of a dynamically self stable hybrid platform to host a 10 mw turbine that is a free float capable tension leg platform the centec tlp it forgoes the often studied single column hull form combined with spokes and investigates an alternative closer to the conventional tlps while adhering to a limit hull weight after an overview of the static stability characteristics of ocean platforms an appropriate alternative is selected resulting in a barge tlp hybrid structure in transport it can float on a shallow draft with minimal response to wind and wave forces and it safely functions as a tlp when installed the safety check of the installed state is carried out by ensuring that slack moorings mooring line breaking and excessive surge motion does not occur each of these conditions is studied in rated and above rated operational conditions a 50 year extreme case is also examined to verify that the structure survives keywords wind energy floating wind tension leg platform dynamic stability 10 mw wind turbine 1 introduction offshore wind energy is now a part of a large industry starting with the monopile installations of the vindeby wind farm in 1991 following that development the ongoing years brought the idea of using floaters for waters surpassing certain depths the hywind spar by statoil jonkman 2010 became the first floating platform to be installed offshore others such as the windfloat cermelli et al 2009 roddier et al 2010 continued as demo projects with turbines up to 2 3 mw while other designs were in conceptual stages uzunoglu et al 2016 in terms of energy output these power production numbers are insufficient to provide for the energy needs of an area there are two solutions to this problem using larger turbines and installing them in higher numbers ultimately both must be done simultaneously for this reason in many studies 5 mw turbines became a standard robertson et al 2014a b robertson et al 2017 and 10 mw turbines have been mentioned as early as 2011 crozier 2011 european union projects such as the lifes50 confirmed the continued interest in the matter borg and bredmose 2015 followed by the industry e g udoh and zou 2019 however as the betz limit states it is not possible to increase the power obtained from a turbine without increasing area swept by its blades therefore higher power requires larger turbines that come with their downsides one definite factor is that the thrust caused by the turbine increases significantly e g 800 kn for a 5 mw turbine jonkman et al 2009 vs 1500 kn for a 10 mw turbine bak et al 2013 and poses a problem to be addressed for an onshore or fixed bottom installation this case becomes a structural issue where the support structure needs to resist the bending moments caused by the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces e g yeter et al 2019 for a floater it is a question of dynamics where the platform should provide favourable motions for energy production for instance large pitching angles of the platform cause fluctuations of the power output jeon et al 2014 regarding pitching and heaving motions most floaters are compliant in these modes moving with the waves and the wind however the tension leg platform tlp behaviour resembles a rigid structure due to its tensioned mooring lines brennan et al 2012 this reliance on the lines also poses the main disadvantage as the common tlp is unstable without them this point leads to a case where the structure needs to be moved to the site by other means such as specialised vessels amate et al 2016 alternatively the problem can also be addressed by making it sufficiently stable so that the turbine can be mounted onshore and the assembly later moved offshore by ordinary tugs floatation stability alone does not suffice to cover all necessities if this platform is to be towed from the shore it will benefit from lower transport drafts as ordinary ports and shipyards have depth limits which typically go up to 20 m this problem is not specific to tlps for instance the ideas such as the semisubmersible for a 10 mw wind turbine with a draft of approximately 37 m zhao and wang 2019 will also need special considerations at least in the initial phases of transportation a significant part of this issue is the weight of the tower and the turbine that result in a very high centre of gravity however they still need to be carried by the lightest possible floater for economic reasons accordingly platforms for large turbines benefit from complying with multiple design targets they need to have reasonable drafts and favourable dynamic responses while towing the turbine to the installation area they should also provide safety and satisfactory performance when installed these conditions should be adhered to while keeping a reasonable mass this work investigates the options for a platform that meets these criteria and explains the approach taken for a 10 mw turbine it starts by further detailing the summary above and reviewing the principles behind a floater s static stability then the selected alternative is paired with its installed condition that acts as a common tlp this approach leads to a barge tlp hybrid platform that can be referred to as an ftlp free float capable tlp named the centec tlp the barge mode is examined in its free floating condition for its dynamic behaviour the installed form is then checked to ensure that it complies with the safety requirements of a tlp by ensuring that slack moorings mooring line breaking and excessive surge motion does not occur these checks are done in the turbine s rated and above rated operational conditions a 50 year extreme case is also included to verify that the structure survives 2 design considerations the sections below expand on the introduction and present preliminary information for the design process since floating wind is in its early stages especially for larger turbines statistical data is limited in this field in this case the best option until the industry establishes itself is to examine all available figures to make informed choices in the process therefore also monopiles are discussed when looking into the mass data 2 1 stabilisation methods of ocean platforms butterfield et al 2007 classified the stability principles of floaters on a triangle by naming the vertices as buoyancy stabilised ballast stabilised and mooring stabilised platforms following this convention the tlp is mooring stabilised with the remaining alternatives i e barges spars and semisubmersibles distributed inside the triangle eventually all platform types use a combination of these stabilisation components and altering this naming convention can reduce the ambiguity the spar is the typical example of the ballast stabilised platform however most floaters make use of ballasting for instance the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible uses 9620 tons of ballast and has a hull steel weight of 3850 tons making the ballast to lightweight ratio 2 5 to unity robertson et al 2014a b it is however not classified as a spar or as ballast stabilised a spar relies on the rather deep placement of the added weight to counter the overturning moments therefore the difference is that the countering weight should be located deep inside the water making deep ballast stabilised a more descriptive designation the barge is listed as a buoyancy stabilised structure while buoyancy acts on virtually all bodies inside a fluid the difference between the barge and another body subject to buoyancy is the distribution of the forces that they are subject to for that reason waterplane area stabilised platform better identifies the main contributor the semisubmersible takes a different place in this regard making use of deeper placed ballast at operational conditions they are commonly referred to as column stabilised units det norske veritas dnv 2013 making use of both ballasting and sufficient waterplane area there are also applications in oil and gas that are set out in a manner similar to a barge floating on the pontoons to have a larger waterplane area in transport a necessary clarification for the tlp is that the mooring lines alone do not stabilize the platform the buoyancy force in excess of the structure s weight is the primary factor that keeps the lines in tension hence the tension leg platform is literally stabilised by the magnitude of buoyancy due to its underwater volume in combination with the mooring setup the mooring stabilised definition was accordingly replaced by mooring and buoyancy as an acknowledgement of this balance fig 1 summarises this information by providing a stability triangle for these platform types uzunoglu 2019 accordingly without the moorings there are two options to make a platform self stable either the deep ballast case should be considered or a large enough waterplane area should increase the metacentric height to a safe level in both cases the solution should consider that the 10 mw turbine will be heavy with the centre of gravity located rather high given that the aim is to keep the platform i e the base low in weight the overall centre of gravity will match that height the deep ballast solution is impractical for the same reason that a spar needs to be carried to the installation site by other means the floatation draft is higher than what shores can provide for instance the hywind spar accommodates nrel s 5 mw turbine jonkman 2010 at a 120 m draft while the typical anchorage depth of ports is can be 15 20 m an alternative is to use heavy ballast and to provide sufficient space for it in the hull this option will inevitably increase the draft as well since the overall mass increases finally it is also possible to rely on a large waterplane area alone if the total hull mass can be redistributed favourably returning to a modified version of the conventional tlp hull form can make this possible 2 2 steel mass data of the current offshore turbine installations many factors define the economics of floating wind turbines ranging from mooring line complexity to distance to shore making it a topic that needs to be addressed separately while this point is acknowledged certain studies james and costa ros 2015 list reduced hull mass as the priority in making floating wind turbines feasible it is accordingly useful to have approximate numbers regarding the weight of the platform unfortunately the number of installed floating turbines is limited making statistics unreliable due to the small sample size it is however possible to extract preliminary information for fixed bottom offshore applications that have reached considerable numbers while the structures are different this type of overview will give a general idea of where floater designs stand compared to their fixed bottom counterparts germany s fraunhofer institute reports the distribution of the average depth of installed offshore wind turbines with the values in table 1 fraunhofer iwes 2019 it is seen from these values that approximately 96 of current installations are in depths up to 40 m beyond this number fixed bottom structures seem to present technical challenges and economic difficulties that are not beneficial to address the corresponding average mass for monopiles used in offshore wind platforms can be obtained from damiani et al 2016 by reworking the data into the format in fig 2 the values show that at 40 m the total mass of the support structure reaches 225 tons mw this value can be taken as an initial indicator and evaluated further below 2 3 design considerations on tension leg platforms considering platform types the tlp distinguishes itself as the lightest alternative table 2 gives the mean maximum and minimum masses of steel platform hulls per mw power output james and costa ros 2015 the average tlp is 209 tonnes mw which approximately matches the value discussed above making the average semisubmersible 83 per cent and the spar 33 per cent heavier one reason that the tlp ends up lighter than the alternatives is that most current studies e g bachynski and moan 2012 henderson et al 2010 matha 2010 oguz et al 2018 wang et al 2014 are based on the seastar design kibbee et al 1995 1999 that has its origins on the idea of making a the hull smaller generally the massachusetts institute of technology model serves as the basis for these platforms sclavounos et al 2007 tracy 2007 however the conventional tlp form is the conoco phillips hutton in 1984 it was similar to a floating production system e g lee et al 2007 regarding its use of ring pontoons underwater while the wind industry has invested heavily in the seastar hull form it is not as highly favoured in the oil and gas sector comprising only 5 of the 30 tlps up to date the latest two installations were in 2003 and 2007 souza and aggarwal 2013 in either case for the tlp the advantage gained from steel mass is reduced by other complexities the report of james and costa ros 2015 lists the top three topics to address for the advancement of floating wind as platform weight installation procedures and port side operation and maintenance tlp s disadvantages are mostly associated with the stages up to where it is installed and operational its instability without its mooring lines forces alternative solutions to the problem such as additional barges at this point it should be considered that having specialised vessels for tow out stages may be less detrimental in the oil and gas sector where a single platform is installed in an oil field operating for many years opposingly offshore wind farms are composed of high numbers of turbines therefore the hiring costs of specialised vessels accumulate additionally a low number of barges towing the structures from the shore is time inefficient and high numbers of barges are a loss on the mass advantage if these vessels are specialised to carry a single turbine and platform configuration they will need to be taken off service once the wind farm is operational hence this approach effectively offsets the gains made by tlps given the recent emphasis to improving production speeds using modular structures e g tension leg platforms as explained in yatish 2019 and the parallel production methods devised for semisubmersibles roddier et al 2016 both the transport and manufacturing bottlenecks should be addressed to increase the feasibility of floating wind turbines a viable option for transport would be to have platforms that are self stable and have sufficient dynamic stability in waves in order to be towed out by ordinary tugs however these two examples to such self stable tlp designs yanqing et al 2017 and gicon adam et al 2014 2013 report mass values above the standard tlp design and the average value above i e 209 t mw 335 t mw and 307 t mw respectively in terms of steel weight gicon also incorporates concrete into the design therefore it may merit a different classification in summary to keep its advantages a tlp should be stable enough when free floating responding minimally to environmental forces so that it can be towed to the installation site when installed it should comply with the performance and safety requirements these two conditions should be met while staying below the 225 t mw margin the next section proceeds to describe the design process to match these goals 3 principles for the design process 3 1 relationship between wind and wave loads for larger turbines not considering accidental loads the two prominent forces on floating wind turbines are the hydrodynamic and the aerodynamic ones in operation larger turbines shift the balance of these forces slightly towards aerodynamics for a few reasons one clear factor is the higher thrust forces of the turbine the other change is caused by the height of the tower combined with the turbine s cut out wind speeds consider the nrel 5 mw turbine design jonkman et al 2009 with the cut out and rated wind speeds of 25 m s and 11 4 m s respectively dtu s upscaling of the turbine bak et al 2013 to 10 mw states identical values assume an environment where the wind speed is estimated based on the relationship in michel 1999 shigunov 2018 given for 10 m above the water level 1 h s 0 0248 v w 2 the wind as a function of altitude can be expressed with the following relationship 2 u z u z r z z r α the u z term is the wind speed at height z and the u zr represents the wind speed at height z r the power law exponent is denoted by α with this information the wind and wave relationship in table 3 is obtained relating a set of wave heights and associated wind speeds at 10 m 90 and 129 m assuming that the tower starts 10 m above the water level 90 and 129 correspond to the hub level of the nrel 5 mw and dtu 10 mw turbines in this simplified environment i e disregarding wind turbulence the variability of wave heights and similar factors to illustrate the point a 10 mw turbine will operate up to a 7 m significant wave height while the 5 mw turbine will be functional with waves up to 8 m above these numbers the turbines are parked as the wind at hub level exceed the cut out speeds the approximate value of the maximum thrust provided by the 5 mw turbine is 800 kn vs 1500 kn for the 10 mw turbine both are delivered at the rated wind speed of 11 4 m s this wind leads to smaller waves at the rated speed of the larger turbine in summary considering operational turbines with identical cut out speeds the combined loading under wind and waves shift towards environments with smaller waves as the turbines get larger 3 2 the free floating condition in the free floating condition the structure is assembled as a system with the platform tower nacelle and the hub consider the following equation of static stability 3 g m k b b m k g the following are the related considerations the platform s draft should be shallow enough so that it can be moved without requiring deep ports this port depth limitation implies that the kb distance from the keel to the centre of buoyancy of the platform will need to be a small value e g 5 m the reduction coming from the kg distance from the keel to the centre of gravity of the structure will be a substantial value e g approximately 90 m for the 10 mw dtu turbine discussed here the platform will be kept as light as possible accordingly it will not be lowering the kg on its own lowering the kg with added ballast will increase the overall displacement and the floatation draft these considerations leave the bm value distance from the centre of buoyancy to the metacentre as the remaining option that needs to be large enough e g above 90 m to provide a positive gm distance from the centre of gravity to the metacentre the following is the formulation of the bm value 4 b m i w p the waterplane area inertia and the displacement are i w p and respectively for a free floating structure without ballast the displacement equates to the sum of the masses of the turbine and the platform this case leaves the waterplane moment of inertia as the defining value that needs to be large enough to counteract the reduction of the kg value when floating there are tower drag forces turbine thrust and wave forces that pitch the platform for the tower the heeling caused by the wind can be calculated using the formulation in the dnv guidelines det norske veritas dnv 2012 the geometry of the tower can be sectioned and the forces applied at the centre of each section where the moment arm is taken as a r integrating these values will give the corresponding moments with the pitch restoring coefficient c 55 the resulting heeling angle to due to wind forces ξ 55 w on the tower f w i n d can be found 5 ξ 55 w σ f w i n d i a r i c 55 the feathered blade will also be exposed to wind leading to loads on the parked rotor f r o t o r the drag forces on the blades depend on their position pitching and azimuth angles the aerodynamic load on the rotor due to the wind is then an input which can be obtained from the turbine data it will result in the following heeling response ξ 55 t 6 ξ 55 t σ f r o t o r i a r i c 55 these forces combined with the waves should not cause the platform to heel beyond its stability limits wave resonance should also be avoided in transport 3 3 the installed platform most of a tlp s design concerns relate to the mooring responses in addition to the resonance conditions to avoid consider the following equation that defines the natural frequencies of an undamped single degree of freedom system 7 ω n c h c m m t a i j the restoring terms c h and c m represent the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic components respectively the structure s total mass is m t while the contribution of the added mass is denoted by a i j the areas exposed to waves e g surface piercing columns increase the surge motion therefore it is beneficial to reduce this exposure limiting the waterplane area lowers c h and leaves the mooring lines c m as the primary contributor to stiffness assume that the mooring restoring matrix can be written in the following form from the example of clauss and birk 1996 8 c m f l i n e l m 0 0 0 z l f l i n e l m 0 0 f l i n e l m 0 z l f l i n e l m 0 0 0 0 e a l m 0 0 0 0 z l f l i n e l m 0 y l 2 e a l m 0 0 z l f l i n e l m 0 0 0 x l 2 e a l m 0 0 0 0 0 0 x l 2 y l 2 e a l m the forces on the mooring lines are f l i n e the modulus of elasticity is e a and the length of the mooring lines are l m the coordinates of the fairleads are given with x y and z in the cartesian system the force on each line depends on a relationship between the mass of the structure and the buoyancy 9 f l i n e ρ m t g n t the displacement is represented by and n t is the number of mooring lines the density of the water and the acceleration of gravity and are ρ and g respectively with these definitions it is possible to read the way the platform dynamics will be affected by certain variables the c m 1 1 and c m 2 2 in the mooring line stiffness equation 8 show that tlp installations will become problematic below a certain depth installing the same tlp in a shallower location leads to stiffer structures that eventually place the surge and sway natural periods inside the first order wave excitation range for this reason tension leg platforms are better suited to intermediate and deeper waters while the tlp complies in lateral motions and yaw it resembles a fixed platform in terms of heave pitch and roll resonant responses the diagonal components heave roll pitch and yaw show that the mooring line material changes the responses by altering the overall stiffness even if the platform designs are identical accordingly a tlp s installation depth should surpass a limit value to allow longer natural periods in the surge sway and yaw modes simultaneously correctly tensioned lines made of stiff material should be located at a sufficient distance that provides the moment arm leading to high natural frequencies in the other modes the resonance conditions follow this information by aiming to set the surge sway yaw natural periods above 25 s and the remaining values under 5 s i e wave excitation ranges given in det norske veritas dnv 2013 the rotor and the blade passing frequencies 1p and 3p should also be avoided along with the tower natural frequency after having the resonant characteristics set adequately the platform should also respond to aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces to a level that does not allow slack moorings or cause the mooring lines to break slack moorings are a case where the mooring line loses tension and may go into compression losing tension may not be the main issue if flexible lines are used so there is no buckling however when the line comes back into tension it encounters a significant amount of dynamic loading this factor brings a set of related issues and it is considered an ultimate limit state of a tension leg platform a method to address these considerations in initial design stages in the frequency domain is to calculate the motions at the fairleads given the response amplitude operators due to waves the addition of the forces coming from the turbine will allow estimating the reactions of the structure to the waves and the wind exciting forces assume that the motions at the fairleads are defined by δ z and the stretched length of the mooring lines are defined by l m in this case the loss of mooring line tension due to the platform motions f l o s s can be estimated by 10 f l o s s e a l m δ z for the sake of completeness the increased buoyancy force f b due to the heaving motion and the component of the surge force that applies on the angled mooring line f s m can be added 11 d f m f b f s m f l o s s regarding the breaking of the mooring lines api rp2t api 2010 recommends a safety factor of 1 67 up to twice the initial tension resulting in 12 2 f l i n e f b r e a k 1 67 along with these considerations the surge motion needs to be limited to keep the angles at the anchors below 5 chakrabarti 2005 4 the design process and the numerical model 4 1 summary of the process and the design criteria the design process is carried out with a system that contains three components a 3d modeller parmod a design system that provides the connections and intermediate calculations and a model maker for time domain simulations the parametric 3d modelling tool parmod is explained in detail in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2018a and the design system is described in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2019 time domain model maker is available in uzunoglu and guedes soares 2016 fig 3 shows the schematics of the process summarised below parmod makes multi purpose parametric 3d models with quadrilateral meshes that can be used in a potential flow code and reports back the 6x6 mass matrix the mass calculation is done for the entire structure including the tower and the turbine then the submerged geometry is extracted by truncating the model at the waterline and fed to wamit lee and newman 2005 to get the potential flow solution the mooring is designed using a set of given material properties considering the line breaking limits an iterative process is followed by starting with a single mooring line per corner of the platform and testing a given set of physically feasible diameter limits when the maximum diameter is reached the number of mooring lines is increased and the diameter is reduced back to the minimal value this process is repeated until the relationship between mooring line tension in still water and breaking strength in equation 12 is satisfied the setup is then used with the turbine s thrust vs wind speed curve to have an early estimation of motions in the frequency domain by combining this information with the response amplitude operators for the platform this output is used to check a set of environmental conditions and ensure that the mooring lines do not break or go slack the environmental data is the entire scatter diagram of the installation area it also examines the surge limits and resonance conditions additionally a selected 50 year extreme condition is verified after confirming the installed condition the draft without the mooring lines is calculated equalling to the point where the submerged volume matches the mass the hull is then checked in this free floating condition to ensure that it floats on the pontoons its hydrodynamic responses are acceptable and it is designed outside the wave resonance zone the system builds a time domain model in nrel s fast jonkman 2007 for the successful design candidate obtained in the frequency domain and verifies that the platform behaves as intended an overview of the criteria is summarised in table 4 for both the installed structure and the dynamics of the float out condition 4 2 the turbine and the tower the turbine and the tower are dtu s technical university of denmark 10 mw design bak et al 2013 which is an upwind three blade turbine upscaled and revised from the 5 mw nrel version jonkman et al 2009 compared to a direct upscaling it has a shorter tower and a larger hub diameter the tower nacelle and the rotor mass are also reduced table 5 lists the specifications for the frequency domain design stage the tower is modelled as a distributed mass using parmod resulting in the mass and inertial data in table 6 these numbers are reported given that the connection of the tower is 10 m above the water level when the platform is in its installed configuration the nacelle and the rotor are modelled as a point mass with input values in table 7 combining the tower and the rotor nacelle assembly rna sets the mass details provided in table 8 it should be noted that with a 10 m base height the structure s centre of gravity is located at 85 6 m above the water level there is also a small eccentricity in the longitudinal direction coming from the offset centre of mass of the turbine in motion this value will reflect as a difference in the tensions of the mooring lines the frequency domain motion estimations require knowing the thrust forces caused by the running turbine the dtu report referenced above contains these values as calculated with the hawc2 software larsen and hansen 2015 a fast model of the turbine is also made publicly available by dtu and used in this work providing the thrust values in fig 4 this data has an offset compared to hawc2 values being approximately 150 kn higher the reason for this difference is that fast s output contains all loads transmitted across the shaft between the rotor and the gearbox including the applied aerodynamic loads gravitational loads from the rotor mass and shaft tilt tower deflection platform pitch and inertial loads from the rotor mass inertia and acceleration deceleration these gravitational and inertial loads are the deviations from the pure aerodynamic thrust reported by hawc2 4 3 the platform the platform model and the tower shown in fig 5 uses the component names in fig 6 mooring line connections are also numbered for easier referral later the outcome of the mass data will inevitably be influenced by the selected steel thickness for instance there are tlp designs with a steel thickness of 1 5 cm crozier 2011 with a steel density of 7850 kg m3 while this number leads to a light structure it should be reconsidered a mean value for steel thickness of tension leg platforms is discussed in bachynski and moan 2012 using the data given in chakrabarti 2005 originating from that input an approximation of 3 4 cm is given being a structure of similar draft the oc4 semisubmersible s a robertson et al 2014a b mean steel thickness of approximately 5 cm can also be informative to work with as the structure has a similar draft with these numbers the base value for steel thickness was taken as 4 cm for this platform the components above the water have a 3 5 cm thickness the steel density of the platform follows the values in the design of nrel s oc3 hywind turbine s tower jonkman et al 2009 and dtu 10 mw s tower bak et al 2013 and assumes 8500 kg m3 to account for additional structural components these considerations summarised in table 9 the resulting mass properties of the platform are in table 10 where it stays below the 225 t mw limit previously decided as discussed in the design requirements neither the installed platform nor the free floating form requires ballasting therefore this number is the total mass value regarding the geometry the platform is designed using rectangular pontoons as this form has an advantage in keeping a consistent waterplane area as the platform heaves in free float condition in terms of hydrodynamics chakrabarti 2005 states that having a corner radius of d 6 where d is the column diameter has shown better dynamics compared to flat panels the lower and upper columns follow that recommendation for the potential flow solution dnv recommends using 1 6 of the smaller wave frequency of interest as the mesh size det norske veritas dnv 2010 which corresponds to an average panel side length of 4 6 m the document also suggests that the mesh size should be small enough to represent the geometry correctly comparing the volume of the platform with a reference 1 m mesh size a 2 m mesh results in an acceptable volume difference less than 0 8 per cent for this structure this value complies with similar works regarding panel methods where the geometry needs to be discretised jafaryeganeh et al 2015 ko et al 2011 accordingly the 2 m uniform mesh was utilized for the potential flow calculations the resulting nondimensional hydrodynamic coefficients and exciting forces are given in fig 7 for both the free floating and installed conditions in the figures a w stands for the wave amplitude g for the acceleration of gravity ρ for water density and l represents the scaling length which equals unity in this case an interesting aspect is the occurrence of the negative added mass when free floating which is seen in structures that have elements that enclose a portion of the free surface e g moonpool type openings that occur when this platform is on its pontoons mciver and mciver 2016 in addition to radiation damping the platform comes under the influence of hydrodynamic viscous damping a common practice in initial design is to assume a percentage of critical damping as the viscous component e g lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 yan et al 2015 with values ranging from 1 to 3 per cent however overestimating this number may lead to favourable results in simulations that may not match a real life scenario additionally a tlp s motions are dominated by inertial forces unless it is in resonance o kane et al 2002 these cases make it a more reliable and conservative approach to disregard viscous damping at this stage unless its value was obtained with a level of certainty 4 4 mooring lines in the oil and gas sector tension leg platforms use steel pipes of larger diameters however for wind energy platforms using materials such as wire ropes e g yanqing et al 2017 or chains e g moon iii and nordstrom 2010 is also possible these mooring lines have the advantage of being flexible hence they can be used for purposes such as lowering a gravity anchor that is already connected to the structure kausche et al 2018 however their diameters should be set with values that can be realistically obtained the current platform is moored with 6 strand steel wire ropes with a 14 cm diameter resulting in the data in table 11 chakrabarti 2005 the design code considers them as an additional stiffness matrix in the frequency domain design stage in the time domain stage the mooring is remodelled using fast s finite elements module feamooring wendt et al 2016 as the quasi static and lumped mass models underestimate the responses coulling et al 2013 uzunoglu and guedes soares 2018b 2015 4 5 environmental conditions the installation area is taken as galicia spain and the environmental conditions are presented in table 12 silva et al 2015 the wind speeds at the hub height were calculated following the power profile in equation 2 and relating them to the wind speeds with equation 1 in addition to these conditions a 50 year extreme condition is checked defined with a 12 5 m wave height the frequency domain design stage checks all these wind wave combinations to ensure that the platform stays safe the operational above operational and 50 year extreme conditions are further verified with the time domain model 5 evaluation of platform motion dynamics 5 1 responses in the free floating condition when the structure is placed in the water the draft is 3 85 m leaving 1 2 m of the pontoons outside the water table 13 contains the static equilibrium data when free floating without external excitation the static pitching angle is 0 22 caused by the offset in the centre of gravity of the turbine the waterplane area of the platform is provided in fig 8 this area results in a metacentric height of 27 8 m with a stability up to 10 degrees of heeling with the righting arm provided in fig 9 this number is the position where two of the lower columns that have a current freeboard of 3 65 m get submerged and the remaining two start exiting the water as shown in fig 10 accordingly it can be adjusted by altering their height for instance collu et al 2014 yanqing et al 2017 advice reserving a 15 degree angle for positive stability however vanishing angle on its own is not an indicator of a platform s dynamic stability this number needs to be considered conjointly taking the responses of the platform into account in port the structure is in almost still water conditions when being towed favourable weather windows are selected since towing installation procedures are risky in adverse or extreme weather for example the largest studied wave height is 2 m in amate et al 2016 with that information assuming a maximum wave height of 3 m for towing is reasonable consider the wave responses of the platform in its free floating condition given in fig 11 as calculated by a potential flow solver considering the geometry up to the water level the weather conditions in galicia previously given in table 12 lists that most smaller waves up to 3 m are clustered between 5 and 10 s of wave periods the platform s corresponding largest pitch rao is 0 38 in this region while the minimum is 0 09 showing a rather limited response heave motion is larger but does not pose a stability concern there is a peak seen at around 4 8 s which is the heave resonant frequency previously listed in table 13 the pitch natural frequency is 22 3 s given that pitching is more critical for stability reasons this case is more relevant the maximum towing wave height of 3 m corresponds to a wind speed of 11 m s 10 m above the water level detailed in table 12 at this value integrating the drag forces on the tower causes a further heeling angle of 0 36 at the hub level the corresponding wind speed is 15 8 m s the platform pitches further about 0 11 due to the exposed rotor with the feathered blades a secondary effect of the asymmetric geometry of the blades will also lead to rolling motion due to the resulting lateral forces it is important to note that this force is different than the rotor torque at the shaft countered by the shaft brake in this case the resulting roll amplitude is unlikely to match or exceed the pitching caused by the directly applied thrust force considering the hull symmetry it stands to reason that the tilting angles will not surpass 0 1 this factor was neglected as the isolated roll motion is rather small to affect the overall platform dynamics rounding the values up the total pitching motion under a 3 m wave height and 15 8 m s wind at the hub level will reach approximately 1 3 with the contributors listed in table 14 this number does not seem likely to pose a problem for a structure that is stable up to 10 5 2 static equilibrium and natural frequencies in the installed condition when the platform is installed it is lowered to a draft of 20 m with 12 mooring lines installed the related properties are provided in table 15 given the large mass of the turbine and its offset centre of gravity the mooring line tensions change depending on the position of the nacelle this mass does not cause a significant difference under static equilibrium however that case needs to be seen when the platform is responding to excitation forces 5 3 motion dynamics of the installed platform generally the response amplitude operators raos and spectral densities psds contain the necessary information to evaluate the motion dynamics of a structure conversely for a tlp they also mask major indicators of failure modes providing only the spectral densities hides slack moorings mooring line breaking and unwanted surge motion these topics are better addressed by looking into the time domain data where these numbers can be read from alternatively limits and the maxima need to be provided all three options will be presented below time series maxima and spectral densities table 16 can serve as a useful referral list for the natural frequencies while evaluating the psd data three environmental cases are shown here the first one is the rated wind speed and the second case examines above rated winds close to the cut out value the third scenario considers the 50 year extreme values where the turbine is parked the waves are generated with the jonswap spectrum while the wind adheres to the kaimal spectrum to comply with the guidelines in det norske veritas dnv 2013 the summary of the environment used in time domain simulations is given in table 17 each of these conditions is run with 5 different seeds randomizing both wind and waves the runtime of the operational conditions i e rated and above rated are 1200 s per seed and the 50 year extreme case is run for 1800 s per seed time series are discussed in detail for one of the seeds to understand the motions better the maxima and minima attained of all seeds are then provided in tabular format as shown previously in fig 6 the first four mooring lines are numbered as follows to make the discussion easier at the fairlead locations 1 2 3 and 4 the lines 1 4 are located upwind i e closer to the rotor and 2 3 are located downwind the remaining mooring lines keep rotating in the same order each position is examined separately as it is essential to check the mooring line with the lowest tension 5 3 1 isolated responses to wind and waves responses to the linear wind and regular wave isolated loads are provided in table 18 to form a basis of understanding for the stochastic cases linear wind follows the previously described power profile the data was obtained by running the simulations 60 s after the transient stage ends since upwind and downwind lines behave almost identically in this scenario due to symmetry only the first and the second lines are given the turbine thrust s prominence in forcing surge motion is visible however despite the size of the turbine the 50 year extreme wave value results in amplitudes that are 73 higher this case makes it critical to evaluate surging in storms for mooring line anchor angle limits another noticeable condition is the effect of rotor shaft tilting angle i e 5 for the dtu 10 mw turbine in the rated wind speed heaving mode that forces a submersion of 10 cm overall the wave effect on pitching seems to be higher than the wind loading the highest wind caused pitching moment matches the condition where the thrust is the highest the rated wind speed mooring line tensions show that both above rated and 50 year extreme cases are important in verifying their behaviour and the upwind and downwind values can significantly differ 5 3 2 responses in stochastic environments 5 3 2 1 rated operational conditions the spectral densities are provided for all environments under the rated operational conditions section for easier comparison each case is then discussed in detail in their relevant sections it is useful to note that these systems cannot be expected to behave linearly for reasons such as the presence of the active blade pitch controller the motions will change based on the system s operational status e g an assumption of linearity regarding the responses cannot be made when comparing a parked turbine with a running turbine accordingly the results need to be treated as in the case of looking into different setups of the same structure under the rated operational conditions the platform is exposed to 11 4 m s wind speeds at the hub level and a wave height of 3 m responding as given in fig 12 these motions lead to the critical values listed in table 19 the mooring line responses differ depending on their location lines 1 and 4 show the lowest tensions while the pitching motion results in higher maxima in the remaining mooring lines in this case the maximum tension is 5540 kn while the minimum is 1694 kn regarding surge responses the rated speed is where it is likely to become problematic since the turbine provides the highest thrust in this scenario while it is possible to avoid surge forces from waves by reducing the platform s exposure the aerodynamic forces are unavoidable therefore it is also inevitable that the platform surges due to the forces on the rotor that have their maximum value at the rated speed see fig 4 the maximum amplitude reaches 7 10 m but stays under the limit of 13 m that correspond to the 5 degree anchor angle the psds of the motions are presented in fig 13 and mostly serve to examine the resonant responses comparing the mooring responses between themselves clarify why time series is crucial to evaluate the design of a tension leg platform the psds show that the mooring line responses differ however they do not provide any additional information at the same time the time series show significant differences up to 1100 kn between the tensions depending on their location a similar statement can be made for the surge motion as psds do not answer whether the motion is too large to be a problem the heave resonance occurring at 0 48 hz has a significant effect on the mooring line tensions however the amplitude of this high frequency exaction from the waves is small as seen from the wave spectral density repeating the simulations with different seeds does not reveal notable differences apart from showing an 8 m surge maximum value in table 20 that continues to stay within limits over these responses a discussion on design principles can be presented as follows this tlp features four surface piercing columns these columns cause the structure to be exposed to surge forces however they are small enough to limit this motion at the same time they provide additional hydrostatic stiffness in the pitching motion which in turn contributes to reducing the mooring responses having exposed columns is beneficial in adjusting the pitching response while it is not preferred for the surge mode if an optimal point is found they help to obtain a more stable platform 5 3 2 2 above rated operational conditions this condition is defined with waves with a significant height of 8 m and wind speeds of 22 4 m s at hub height when the turbine is running in these above rated conditions there is an exchange of balance between the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces compared to the rated condition the platform is exposed to lower thrust forces from the turbine while the cyclic loads of the waves increase the results reflect this change as shown in table 21 and in the time series of fig 14 the maximum amplitude of the surge motion reduces from 7 10 m to 6 09 m following the thrust reduction this underlines the necessity in checking for maximum surge under operational conditions especially for larger turbines mooring line tensions also exchange places this time giving the maximum values on the fairleads that are located downwind i e 2 3 and minimal values located upwind 1 4 there are no mooring line breaking or slack mooring occurrences the spectral densities show that large mooring line responses that coincide with the heave resonance the heave and pitch motions in the lower frequencies are reduced in this case accordingly in these regions the overall mooring line response is also reduced compared to the rated wind case this reduction in the lower frequencies is related to the platform s response to the wind spectra which happen in lower frequencies than the waves varying the wind and wave time series leads to the values in table 22 with the minimum mooring line tension value occurring on line 4 this finding is consistent with the provided time series the rotating turbine tends to roll the structure prominently to one side leading to this difference between lines one and four despite the centreline symmetry of the platform the minimal value attained throughout the repetitions is 30 lower 5 3 2 3 50 year extreme conditions in a storm the blades feather and the rotor is locked into position to avoid damage to the turbine the high speed shaft brake is the component that is expected to hold the rotor in place this condition was enforced by increasing the maximum high speed shaft brake torque until it was verified that no rotation of the blades occurs with the turbine parked the waves are the prominent force that the platform needs to resist surviving until the end of the storm fig 15 and table 23 prove this to be the case despite having the largest and lowest mooring line tensions of the three test cases the mean value of the standard deviation of all line tensions is 774 kn that keeps 78 per cent of the initial tension in the lines throughout the time series however a significant pitching and heaving motion occurring at approximately 1000 s forces a substantial reduction following a wave height of 17 5 m the lowest number of 652 kn corresponds to the mooring line tension approximately 18 per cent of the static equilibrium value the psds see fig 13 reveal higher pitching motions due to waves that directly relate to the mooring responses increasing the wave height and parking the turbine leads to higher hydrodynamic loading and lower turbine thrust compared to the rated operational conditions accordingly the severity of the platform responses increase inside the wave excitation frequencies at the same time the reactions are reduced in lower frequencies below the wave excitation range altering the wind and wave seeds leads to slightly more severe responses there is no slack mooring occurrence in the result set of table 24 however the tension of line 4 drops to 550 kn in a response highly linked to the instantaneous amplitude and phase of pitch and heave modes the maximum surge motion reaches 12 89 m staying slightly below the 13 m limit overall the values do not surpass the limits defined in the design criteria in table 4 6 conclusions the single column tlp has been extensively studied as a candidate for floating wind however it presents challenges such as relying on specialised vessels for transport instead of ordinary tugs considering that wind farms are planned in higher number of units this approach is impractical revisiting the conventional hull form it is possible to implement a dynamically stable design capable of free floating on a shallow draft i e an ftlp free float capable tlp that also performs well as a tlp in this manner the structure can be towed without being concerned with shore side depth limits the total mass can still be kept sufficiently low if it is redistributed correctly this work explained the hydrodynamic design process of the ftlp the centec tlp as a floater that adheres to the requirements listed above the aim was to see minimal wave responses when floating as a barge and performing safely as a tlp in operation initially a discussion on the stability principles of ocean platforms was given out of these a form that allows carrying the turbine without needing a deeper draft lead to the barge tlp hybrid floater this hull was coupled with a 10 mw turbine to understand how it behaves while free floating and when installed it was confirmed that this form will have restrained responses within its stability limits when free floating the safety check of the installed condition was done by looking into the mooring responses the structure did not encounter any problems regarding slack mooring occurrences mooring line breaking or excessive surge motions that would cause mooring line problems at the anchors it also survived the 50 year extreme condition staying at the average mass of the current tlp designs the hull shape keeps the advantages gained by the single column tlp form and adds benefits in terms of practicality in transport credit author

22159,an active motion compensated gangway is important and efficient equipment for personal transferring from a supply vessel to wind turbines or other structures vice versa this paper aims to explore the kinematics and dynamics of a serial motion compensated gangway and to design a controller of it in this paper the prototype of a serial manipulator is taken as the research object the kinematics and dynamics of the system are established respectively and the euler lagrangian equation is adopted the supply vessel is regarded as six degrees of freedom dynamic positioning dp model and motions in seaway are analyzed an improved dynamics controller is adopted in this paper compared with pd controller with gravity simulations are carried out both in situations that the gangway tip moves with desired trajectories and docking situations both simulation results reveal that the controller adopted in this paper perform well and the steady state errors are decreased significantly which are desirable in practice keywords active motion compensation gangway inverse dynamics control serial manipulator 1 introduction offshore turbine and other platforms have been widely used during the past decades while suffering from the ocean waves winds and currents the working environments are usually worse than that of mainland ships or offshore structures will move in six degrees of freedom 6dof under the influences of ocean waves winds and other disturbances namely sway surge heave roll pitch yaw perez and blanke 2012 liang et al 2017b as a consequence it is a tough work for transferring crews or other devices from a supply vessel to the offshore structures and vice versa motion compensation technologies can be used to compensate the vessel motions caused by the ocean disturbances umesh a korde has studied a feasible method for heave compensation of deep water drilling vessel under irregular wave excitation ulrich and kumar 1991 the system makes use of the good interaction of the coupled oscillator to achieve the desired effect and performs well in a large frequency band the dynamic model is used to study the performance of the system under certain operating conditions the frequency domain calculation of simple mathematical parameters and irregular spectrum shows that the heave compensation system is effective within the linear range nonlinearities of a system are common in reality k d do and j pan proposed a method to design a nonlinear controller for active heave compensation system based on lyapunov direct method and disturbance observer to improve the compensation effects and the stability of closed loop system is analyzed in details do and pan 2008b a with the increasing complexity of the work 1dof of heave motion compensation cannot solve the problem very well thus yingguang chu et al presented an effective method of hoisting motion compensation and anti swaying flexible control in offshore crane operation based on the kinematics and energy dissipation principle of manipulator chu et al 2014 they established the integrated multi domain system model and model of accumulator in active heave motion compensation is also given the simulation results show that the algorithm is effective both in the case of motion compensation and anti sway motion chu et al 2015 2016 while recent years personal transferring is becoming more and more popular though the heave motion compensated crane performs well in practice it is not an advisable choice for personal transferring between supply vessel and wind turbines or other platforms researches on multi dof active motion compensated gangways are good solutions for the problem presented above in order to compensate all 6dof motions of a vessel in seaway ampelmann has developed an active motion compensation gangway system with six degrees of freedom motion platform as motion compensator which known as the stewart platform as shown in fig 1 as stated by d j c salzmann in salzmann 2010 the 6dof motions of a vessel caused by ocean waves can be compensated by a 6dof stewart platform and it can be accomplished by adjusting the motion directions of the top platform with respect to the vessel motion namely moving on the contrary directions of vessel motion this is a parallel motion compensation system although it can compensate the motions of a vessel in six degrees of freedom the drawback is that the installation space required is very large since it is a parallel system the workspace is usually small if the ship moves with large amplitude the corresponding 6dof motion platform becomes a larger one which will lead to the increase of the costs and difficulties of maintenance it is well known that a 6dof stewart platform can move in 6dof which has been widely used as flight simulator in flight simulations therefore as stated by d j c salzmann in salzmann 2010 the 6dof motions of a vessel caused by ocean waves can be compensated by a 6dof stewart platform and it is accomplished by adjusting the motion directions of the top platform with respect to the vessel motion namely moving on the contrary direction of vessel motion this is a parallel motion compensation system although it can compensate the motions of a vessel in six degrees of freedom the drawback is that the installation space required is very large since it is a parallel system the workspace is usually small if the ship moves with large amplitude the corresponding 6dof motion platform becomes a larger one which will lead to the increase of the costs and difficulties of maintenance compared with the parallel motion compensation system the serial one is more flexible one of the serial motion compensation systems is as shown in fig 2 raúl guanche michele martini and alfonso jurado et al proposed a feasible method for personnel transferring during offshore operation guanche et al 2016 the numerical analysis of docking operation between a vessel and wind turbine is carried out by wu 2014 the modeling of active motion compensation gangway system and the design of pid controller are studied by yu 2017 however the ship motions due to ocean waves are treated as regular which is not universally applicable therefore the active motion compensation gangway system is taken as the research object in this paper this paper is organized as the following firstly system models are established in section 2 which consist of kinematic and dynamic models then the system jacobian matrix and dynamic equation of motion of the system are derived because the gangway system is installed on the deck of the vessel the 6 dof model of the ship is given and the ittc two parameter spectrum is taken as the wave disturbance in this part the controller based on inverse dynamics is designed in section 3 then the simulation models are built and carried out in matlab simulink and simulation results are given in section 4 according to the simulation results the controller adopted in this paper performs well both in docking and moving situations 2 mathematics models of the active motion compensated gangway system 2 1 reference frames before establishing the kinematics model of the system we need to establish the corresponding reference frames as shown in fig 3 the main frames of the whole systems studied in this paper are as follows inertial frame the inertial frame is presented as n e d x n y n z n usually the origin of inertial frame is fixed on earth of which the x n axis points to the true north y n points to the east according to the right hand rule z n is vertical downwards though the n e d frame is not a static frame to some degree which means it moves with the earth rotation it can be regarded as an inertial frame with respect to maneuver and control of marine craft in limited area fossen 2011 body attached frame the body attached frame can be presented as b o b y x b y b z b it is a moving frame the origin o b is attached at the moving body for a vessel x b is from aft to bow y b points to the starboard and z b is downwards based on the right hand rule link attached frame in order to facilitate the modeling of this gangway system the link attached frame i is established following the rules below z i is along to the joint axis x i is parallel to the common perpendicular in case of intersecting of joint axis i and i 1 then the x i is perpendicular to the plane decided by the joint axis i and i 1 craig 2005 and in this paper the inertial frame is assumed coincide with the body attached frame and the body attached frame is moving with the vessel while the inertial frame not based on the mechanical model shown in fig 3 the whole block scheme of this gangway system with ship motion and sea waves can be described as fig 4 the reference model is to calculate gangway tip position with ship motions due to sea waves in fig 4 the reference model is to calculate the gangway tip position with motions of the vessel 2 2 mathematical model of the mechanical system the study of robot dynamics can be divided into two parts kinematics and dynamics the former focused only on the geometrical of motion while the latter is the analysis of the forces causing the motion a serial active motion compensation gangway is shown in fig 2 according to its structural characteristics there are two revolute joints and one prismatic joint in this gangway system a revolute revolute prismatic rrp spherical type manipulator model can be adopted for the gangway in this paper which is shown in fig 3 under this simplification the kinematics of the gangway system can then be derived four parameters are used to describe the motion compensation gangway system namely denavit hartenberg dh parameters craig 2005 and the joint variables are θ i for revolute joint i and d i for prismatic one respectively and the dh parameters can be obtained with respect to the link attached frames and it can be stated in table 1 where l x and l z are the distances from origin of frame 1 to the origin of b o d y in x b direction and z b direction respectively l 1 and l 4 represent the lengths of link 1 and link 3 respectively θ 1 θ 2 and d 3 are the joint variables of the gangway system thus the homogeneous transformation matrix between two connected links and it can be expressed as the following which is the homogeneous transformation matrix from link i to i 1 1 t i i 1 c θ i s θ i 0 a i 1 s θ i c α i 1 c θ i c α i 1 s α i 1 d i s α i 1 s θ i s α i 1 c θ i s α i 1 c α i 1 c α i 1 d i 0 0 0 1 where θ i α i 1 a i 1 and d i are the four dh parameters of the gangway system thus based on the parameters in table 1 the homogeneous transformation matrix from gangway tip to b o d y frame can be obtained and it can be described as 2 t p b c 1 c 2 c 1 s 2 s 1 l x l 4 d 3 c 1 s 2 s 1 c 2 s 1 s 1 c 1 l 4 d 3 s 1 s 2 s 2 c 2 0 l z l 1 l 4 d 3 c 2 0 0 0 1 where c and s are c o s and s i n respectively therefore the gangway tip position expressed in b o d y is as the following 3 o p b x t i p b y t i p b z t i p b l x l 4 d 3 c 1 s 2 l 4 d 3 s 1 s 2 l z l 1 l 4 d 3 c 2 the relationship of velocities between gangway tip and joints can be obtained by the jacobian matrix for the whole gangway system in this paper joint 1 and joint 2 are revolute joints and joint 3 is prismatic one therefore the gangway tip velocities can be obtained according to the jacobians of the whole gangway system and it can be expressed by 4 ξ j q where ξ ν p b ω p b t and j j ν j ω t and j s 1 s 2 l 4 d 3 c 1 c 2 l 4 d 3 c 1 s 2 c 1 s 2 l 4 d 3 s 1 c 2 l 4 d 3 s 1 s 2 0 s 2 l 4 d 3 c 2 0 s 1 0 0 c 1 0 1 0 0 inverse kinematics is the opposite process of the forward thus according to eq 3 the tip position is derived with forward kinematics thus the joints variables can be obtained by the inverse solutions which can be expressed by 5 θ 1 arctan y t i p b x t i p b l x θ 2 arctan x t i p b l x cos θ 1 z t i p b l z l 1 π d 3 l x x t i p b cos θ 1 sin θ 2 l 4 and the joints velocities can be derived using inverse jacobian and it can be expressed as 6 θ 1 θ 2 d 3 j ν 1 ν t i p x ν t i p y ν t i p z the joints velocities are derived using the inverse jacobian singularity can be encountered thus the pseudo inverse is adopted and it can be described as j j t jj t 1 in this case the joints velocities can be obtained by the following q j ξ i j j b where b is a vector that can be chosen arbitrary lagrange dynamic equation is a method that based on system energy which consist of potential and kinematic energy the lagrange equation and its differential form can be expressed as the following 7 l k p d d t l q l q ξ where l is the lagrangian k is the kinematic energy and p is the potential energy q q 1 q 2 q n t is the joint variables and ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n t is the generalized force for this 3 links gangway system the total kinetic energy is then obtained by the following 8 k 1 2 i 1 3 j 1 3 m i j q q i q j 1 2 q t m q q then the total inertial matrix of this gangway system is obtained by combining the inertial matrix of each link and it is derived as follows 9 m q i 1 3 m q i d i a g m 11 m 22 m 33 where d i a g is the diagonal matrix and the components are as following 10 m 11 i 1 z i 2 y i 3 z c 2 2 i 2 x i 3 x m l 2 y c 2 2 m l 3 z c 3 d 3 2 s 2 2 m 22 i 2 z i 3 y m l 2 y c 2 2 m l 3 z c 3 d 3 2 m 33 m l 3 the whole system potential energy is obtained in the b o d y frame for this 3 links gangway system the whole potential energy can be obtained from the summation of each link and it can be stated as p i 1 3 p l i i 1 3 m l i g 0 t p c i 0 where p c i 0 represents the gravity center of link i expressed in frame i from the differential lagrange equation 7 the system dynamics can be obtained as the following 11 j 1 3 m i j q q j j 1 3 k 1 3 h i j k q q k q j g q i ξ i where h i j k q m i j q k 1 2 m j k q i i j k 1 2 3 which are termed the first type christoffel symbols the system dynamic equation expressed in eq 11 can be rewritten in a common vector form and it can be stated as below 12 m q q c q q q g q f ξ where m q is the system inertial matrix which is positive definite symmetric matrix c q q is the coriolis centripetal matrix g q is the system restoring term f is the disturbance and ξ represents the generalized force in eq 12 the restoring term g q can be acquired by differential equation of system potential energy and it can be described as the following 13 g q i 1 3 p q i 0 g m l 2 y c 2 m l 3 q 3 z c 3 s 2 g m l 3 c 2 as stated in lebret et al 1993 the coriolis centripetal matrix in eq 12 is an n n matrix that can be derived using the following equation 14 c 1 2 m q u m t u m where u m is a matrix that can be obtained by the following equation u m i n q t m t q where represents the kronecker product and satisfied the following equations 15 m t q m q 1 m q 2 m q 3 t r n n n i n q t q t 0 0 0 q t 0 0 0 q t r n n n it is obviously from eq 14 that m 2 c u m u m t while u m u m t is a skew symmetric matrix which implies that m 2 c is a skew symmetric matrix 2 3 ship motions in 6dof in reality the motion compensated gangway system is installed on the deck as shown in fig 2 the motions of the vessel should be studied the vessel in this paper is a surface vessel without considering control forces thus the seakeeping model is adopted here as discussed in fossen 2011 the seakeeping equations of motion are expressed in the following form 16 η j η ν m s ν c s ν ν d s ν ν g s η τ w where ν u v w p q r t is the velocity vector and η x y z ϕ θ ψ t represents the position vector m s m r b m a is the inertial matrix c s c r b c a is the coriolis centripetal matrix d s g s and τ w are the damping coefficient restoring forces and wave forces respectively the homogeneous transformation matrix between b o d y and n e d frame can be expressed as the following 17 t b n c ψ c θ s ψ c θ c ψ s θ s ϕ s ψ s ϕ c ψ c ϕ s θ x s ψ c θ c ψ c θ s θ s ψ s ϕ s θ c ψ s θ s ψ c ϕ y s θ c θ s ϕ c θ c ψ z 0 0 0 1 further in fossen 2011 for an arbitrarily point p in b o d y frame the system s velocity transformation matrix can be derived from 18 ν p b ν ω r p b ν s t r p b ω where s is the skew symmetric matrix and the system transformation matrix is defined as h r p b i 3 3 s t r p b 0 3 3 i 3 3 h 1 r p b i 3 3 s r p b 0 3 3 i 3 3 therefore transformation of linear and angular velocity vectors between two points with respect to in can be expressed by ν p b ω n b b h r p b ν o b ω n b b this is a useful property for computing the gangway tip velocities due to wave disturbances 2 4 random ocean waves the ocean waves are random not only in time but in space and the wave elevation presents irregular characteristics in any particular sea state pérez and blanke 2002 however it is commonly used and convincing to describe sea waves by their power spectral density psd under the assumption that the sea elevation performs as a realization of a stationary and homogeneous zero mean gaussian stochastic process the ittc recommended 2 parameter spectrum is adopted in this paper for fully developed wave the psd can be expressed by 19 s w ω 173 h 1 3 2 t 4 ω 5 e x p 691 t 4 ω 4 where s w is the psd of random wave ω is the angular frequency t is the average period of the wave and h 1 3 is the significant wave height thus a long crested irregular sea wave elevation can be written as the sum of harmonic components fossen 2011 20 ε k 1 n ε k cos ω k ϕ k k 1 n 2 s ω k δ ω cos ω k ϕ k where ε k is the random phase angle of wave component k 3 controller design 3 1 inverse dynamics control the inverse dynamics control has been used in the parallel robot khudher and powell 2016 liao et al 2017 in this work we applied it into the serial manipulator according to eq 12 the gangway system dynamics can be rewritten as following 21 m q q n q q ξ where n q q c q q g q f is an integral term of the system thus the control input can be chosen as 22 ξ m q u n q q by substituting eq 22 into eq 21 we can obtain m q q u 0 since m q above is a diagonal matrix and it is reversible which results in q u here the gangway system input ξ is linear and decoupled under the new input u which implies that each component in u is only influenced by the joint q i therefore with the desired joint variables q d q 1 d q n d t the system control input can be chosen as 23 u q d k d e k p e according to spong and ortega 1990 k p and k d in eq 23 are chosen as positive definite diagonal matrices which ensures that the closed loop system is linear decoupled and exponentially stable and the closed loop damping ratio and natural frequency can be arbitrarily assigned 3 2 improved inverse dynamics control although the inverse dynamics control is easy to guarantee that the closed loop system is linear decoupled and exponentially stable by choosing proper positive definite diagonal matrices k p and k d it is difficult to accomplish since unknown parameters exist in reality which are vital important for system modeling in the real cases these unknown parameters are hard to acquire due to some nonlinear characteristics of the system and as a result the control efficiency will decreased or even becomes worse therefore to avoid these drawbacks above the system control input in eq 22 can be reelected as the following 24 ξ m ˆ q u n ˆ q q where m ˆ and n ˆ are the dynamic estimation terms of m and n of the system respectively and the estimation errors can be expressed as the following m m ˆ m n n ˆ n combining eqs 21 and 24 we can obtain 25 m q q n q q m ˆ q u n ˆ q q it is obviously that m is a reversible diagonal inertial matrix thus eq 25 can be rewritten in the following form 26 q m 1 m ˆ u n n u m 1 m ˆ i u m 1 n u γ where γ i m 1 m ˆ u m 1 n thus the new system control input of q can be chosen as 27 u q d k d e k p e in this case the system error equation is obtained and it can be expressed as 28 e k d e k p e γ in the system error equation γ is nonlinear and coupled the convergence of system errors depends not only on the left part of eq 28 but also the uncertain term γ assuming that the desired joint is q d then the system error can be stated as 29 e q d q e q d e q d q q d u γ for the system error equation 29 assuming that x e e t is the new state variable then the system state space form can be expressed by 30 x ax b q d u γ where a 0 i 0 0 r 2 n 2 n b 0 i r 2 n n though the exact parameters of uncertain term γ are hardly to obtain but of which the estimation range is assumed already known under the assumption the system is asymptotically stable with control input u while γ within the estimation range then the system control input can be expressed by 31 u q d k d e k p e ε where ε is added to ensure the system s robustness under the effect of uncertain term η by substituting eq 31 into eq 30 we can get 32 x a x b γ ε where a a bk 0 i k p k d k k p k d in order to get ε in eq 32 the direct lyapunov method is adopted here take the lyapunov function as the following 33 v x x t q x 0 x 0 where q r 2 n 2 n is a positive definite symmetric matrix as a result the first order differential equation of lyapunov function eq 33 is shown as following 34 v x x t q x x t q x x t a t b γ ε t qx x t q a t x b γ ε x t a t q q a x 2 x t qb γ ε since a is a hurwitz matrix and q is positive definite the following equation holds 35 a t q q a p where p is a positive definite symmetric matrix assuming that z b t qx thus the first order differential equation of lyapunov function can be rewritten as 36 v x x t p x 2 x t qb γ ε x t p x 2 z t γ ε in order to make the differential lyapunov function negative the second term of eq 36 on the right should be set negative since the former is always negative for all x 0 let ε β z z β 0 ε β which implies 37 z t γ ε z t η β z t z z z γ β z z γ β if γ β then the differential lyapunov function v x 0 a way to seek for β is described as the followings 38 γ i m 1 m ˆ u m 1 n i m 1 m ˆ q d kx ε m 1 n α q d α k x α β m 1 n α q m α k x α β m m a x ϕ thus by setting β 1 1 α α q m α k x m m a x ϕ the differential lyapunov function is negative

expressed as fig 5 therefore the whole gangway system block scheme as shown in fig 4 can be expressed as fig 6 with the improved inverse dynamics control derived above 4 simulation results and discussion the aim of the active motion compensation system is to keep the gangway tip still in inertial frame namely n e d frame this implies that the gangway tip motion should be opposite to that caused by the ocean waves while the ocean wave effects directly on the vessel other than gangway tip thus the motions of the vessel in all 6dof should be studied at first while as studied in liang et al 2017a roll motion of a vessel is reduced by the ordinary fin stabilizers when the ship moves at conventional speed and decreased by using zero speed fin stabilizers and magnus rotating roll stabilizer at zero speed liang et al 2018 2017 in this paper a dp model with zero speed is adopted from fossen and perez 2004 the significant wave height is set to 2 5 m with wave spread direction π 4 and the water depth is assumed to be infinity main parameters of the simulation vessel is as shown in table 2 where the parameters are acquired from fossen and perez 2004 thus the sea psd and real time state realization can be obtained the significant wave height is 2 5 m as shown in fig 7 wave psd is displayed and the real time sea state realization is shown in fig 8 ship motions in 6dof can be simulated as shown in fig 9 with different wave directions as can be seen from fig 9 a c the main degrees of freedom that influenced by the ocean waves are surge sway and heave which are the main degrees of freedom to be compensated in this motion compensation gangway system the motions of the vessel can be compensated by driving the gangway tip moves in the opposite directions both in amplitudes and velocities in this paper the base of the motion compensation gangway system is installed on the deck and can be expressed by l x l y l z in b o d y for simplification the origin of base frame is located at the o b x b z b plane of b o d y which implies that l y 0 and it is the same as in table 3 l y vanished therefore the coordinate for the origin of base frame can be expressed by l x 0 l z and in this paper l x 20 l z 3 the motion compensation gangway system is accomplished in both the gangway tip stand still and keep moving and the models are established using matlab simulink for both simulations the gangway initial states are set at q 1 q 2 q 3 0 3 π 2 4 3 to avoid singular values and the parameters of the gangway system is displayed in table 3 therefore the gangway tip position can be obtained using eq 3 and can be expressed as 0 8 30 t in b o d y frame and the parameters of the controller are chosen as the following k p 100 0 0 0 150 0 0 0 400 k d 15 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 15 besides to satisfy eq 35 q can be selected as q 262 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 262 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 262 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 2 525 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 525 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 525 pd control with gravity compensation can easily ensure that the origin system is globally asymptotically stable if k p and k d are positive definite kelly et al 2006 thus in the following parts simulation results of these two controllers are given the motion compensation task is divided into two parts the docking state and moves with desired trajectories case 1 the docking state aims to keep the gangway tip motionless which is also known as regulation kelly et al 2006 for motion compensation purpose the motions of gangway tip should be on the contrary directions against to the vessel motions caused by the ocean disturbances it is obviously from fig 10 12 in the situation of non compensated gangway tip moves far away with time increasing both in x and y directions while in z direction oscillates around its initial state this is mainly caused by the fact that restoring force and moment do exist in ship heave motion while the other two do not simulations of the adopted controller in this paper compared with pd control with gravity compensation are as shown in figs 10 12 where e x r e y r and e z r are gangway tip position error in x y and z direction with the controller adopted here respectively while e x g e y g and e z g are the results of pd controller with gravity compensation according to figs 10 to 12 we can conclude that the vessel motions are compensated with both controllers and the gangway tip keeps its position of the initial state with time passing by while the inverse dynamics controller adopted in the paper performs well in x direction see fig 13 as a consequence the compensated gangway tip positions are as shown in fig 16 where x d y d and z d are the desired positions x u n y u n and z u n are positions without motion compensation while x a c t y a c t and z a c t are the compensated tip position in x y z directions respectively according to figs 10 12 gangway tip position errors decreased in x y and z directions while in y direction the inverse dynamics controller performs better both in tuning time and system overshoot than the pd control with gravity compensation case 2 different from the docking case which is to keep the gangway tip still at an exact point the second situation to be studied in this paper is to keep the gangway tip moves with desired trajectories which are expressed as the following x d 1 s i n 2 π 10 t 30 7 y d 1 2 s i n 2 π 14 t z d 0 8 s i n 2 π 8 t 8 where x d y d and z d are all given in inertial frame it is the same as the first situation that in z direction the restoring force and moment exist which can be obtained from the tip position errors shown in figs 14 16 and with the affections of ocean waves the gangway tip moves in irregular trajectories rather than the desired without motion compensation and the tracking errors of gangway tip with control affections of motion compensation are shown in figs 14 16 in which e x u e y u and e z u are the position errors without motion compensation e x r e y r and e z r are positions without motion compensation while e x g e y g and e z g are the compensated tip position in x y z directions respectively by comparing figs 14 16 we can find out that the tracking errors decreased in significant amplitudes in x y and z directions with the controller adopted in this paper while using the pd controller with gravity compensation the tracking errors decreased the system oscillates as a result the system tends to instability easily the real gangway tip positions in x y and z directions are shown as fig 17 where x d y d and z d are the desired positions x u n y u n and z u n are the positions without motion compensation x a c t y a c t and z a c t are the positions with motion compensation from the simulation results of both cases above we can conclude that in the docking state both controllers are capable in the motion compensation system while in the later case the inverse dynamics controller performs better which is also corresponding to the fact that the pd control with gravity compensation does works in cases that the desired position are constants which has been studied in kelly et al 2006 5 conclusion an active motion compensation gangway system is analyzed in this paper both kinematics and dynamics of the gangway system are derived in order to compensate vessel motions due to the ocean waves a dp model and ittc 2 parameter psd are adopted in this paper different wave directions that effect the ship motions are simulated and based on the inverse dynamics the robust controller is designed and simulated using matlab simulink according to the simulation results of ship motions in 6dof restoring force and moment exist in heave for translational motion as a result compared with the other two directions gangway tip position is periodicity in z direction from the simulations results we can conclude that in docking case both controllers are capable while in the second case the inverse dynamic controller is preferable pd control with gravity is not a optional one besides motions are compensated not only in the dof with restoring forces and moments but also the other two declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

22159,an active motion compensated gangway is important and efficient equipment for personal transferring from a supply vessel to wind turbines or other structures vice versa this paper aims to explore the kinematics and dynamics of a serial motion compensated gangway and to design a controller of it in this paper the prototype of a serial manipulator is taken as the research object the kinematics and dynamics of the system are established respectively and the euler lagrangian equation is adopted the supply vessel is regarded as six degrees of freedom dynamic positioning dp model and motions in seaway are analyzed an improved dynamics controller is adopted in this paper compared with pd controller with gravity simulations are carried out both in situations that the gangway tip moves with desired trajectories and docking situations both simulation results reveal that the controller adopted in this paper perform well and the steady state errors are decreased significantly which are desirable in practice keywords active motion compensation gangway inverse dynamics control serial manipulator 1 introduction offshore turbine and other platforms have been widely used during the past decades while suffering from the ocean waves winds and currents the working environments are usually worse than that of mainland ships or offshore structures will move in six degrees of freedom 6dof under the influences of ocean waves winds and other disturbances namely sway surge heave roll pitch yaw perez and blanke 2012 liang et al 2017b as a consequence it is a tough work for transferring crews or other devices from a supply vessel to the offshore structures and vice versa motion compensation technologies can be used to compensate the vessel motions caused by the ocean disturbances umesh a korde has studied a feasible method for heave compensation of deep water drilling vessel under irregular wave excitation ulrich and kumar 1991 the system makes use of the good interaction of the coupled oscillator to achieve the desired effect and performs well in a large frequency band the dynamic model is used to study the performance of the system under certain operating conditions the frequency domain calculation of simple mathematical parameters and irregular spectrum shows that the heave compensation system is effective within the linear range nonlinearities of a system are common in reality k d do and j pan proposed a method to design a nonlinear controller for active heave compensation system based on lyapunov direct method and disturbance observer to improve the compensation effects and the stability of closed loop system is analyzed in details do and pan 2008b a with the increasing complexity of the work 1dof of heave motion compensation cannot solve the problem very well thus yingguang chu et al presented an effective method of hoisting motion compensation and anti swaying flexible control in offshore crane operation based on the kinematics and energy dissipation principle of manipulator chu et al 2014 they established the integrated multi domain system model and model of accumulator in active heave motion compensation is also given the simulation results show that the algorithm is effective both in the case of motion compensation and anti sway motion chu et al 2015 2016 while recent years personal transferring is becoming more and more popular though the heave motion compensated crane performs well in practice it is not an advisable choice for personal transferring between supply vessel and wind turbines or other platforms researches on multi dof active motion compensated gangways are good solutions for the problem presented above in order to compensate all 6dof motions of a vessel in seaway ampelmann has developed an active motion compensation gangway system with six degrees of freedom motion platform as motion compensator which known as the stewart platform as shown in fig 1 as stated by d j c salzmann in salzmann 2010 the 6dof motions of a vessel caused by ocean waves can be compensated by a 6dof stewart platform and it can be accomplished by adjusting the motion directions of the top platform with respect to the vessel motion namely moving on the contrary directions of vessel motion this is a parallel motion compensation system although it can compensate the motions of a vessel in six degrees of freedom the drawback is that the installation space required is very large since it is a parallel system the workspace is usually small if the ship moves with large amplitude the corresponding 6dof motion platform becomes a larger one which will lead to the increase of the costs and difficulties of maintenance it is well known that a 6dof stewart platform can move in 6dof which has been widely used as flight simulator in flight simulations therefore as stated by d j c salzmann in salzmann 2010 the 6dof motions of a vessel caused by ocean waves can be compensated by a 6dof stewart platform and it is accomplished by adjusting the motion directions of the top platform with respect to the vessel motion namely moving on the contrary direction of vessel motion this is a parallel motion compensation system although it can compensate the motions of a vessel in six degrees of freedom the drawback is that the installation space required is very large since it is a parallel system the workspace is usually small if the ship moves with large amplitude the corresponding 6dof motion platform becomes a larger one which will lead to the increase of the costs and difficulties of maintenance compared with the parallel motion compensation system the serial one is more flexible one of the serial motion compensation systems is as shown in fig 2 raúl guanche michele martini and alfonso jurado et al proposed a feasible method for personnel transferring during offshore operation guanche et al 2016 the numerical analysis of docking operation between a vessel and wind turbine is carried out by wu 2014 the modeling of active motion compensation gangway system and the design of pid controller are studied by yu 2017 however the ship motions due to ocean waves are treated as regular which is not universally applicable therefore the active motion compensation gangway system is taken as the research object in this paper this paper is organized as the following firstly system models are established in section 2 which consist of kinematic and dynamic models then the system jacobian matrix and dynamic equation of motion of the system are derived because the gangway system is installed on the deck of the vessel the 6 dof model of the ship is given and the ittc two parameter spectrum is taken as the wave disturbance in this part the controller based on inverse dynamics is designed in section 3 then the simulation models are built and carried out in matlab simulink and simulation results are given in section 4 according to the simulation results the controller adopted in this paper performs well both in docking and moving situations 2 mathematics models of the active motion compensated gangway system 2 1 reference frames before establishing the kinematics model of the system we need to establish the corresponding reference frames as shown in fig 3 the main frames of the whole systems studied in this paper are as follows inertial frame the inertial frame is presented as n e d x n y n z n usually the origin of inertial frame is fixed on earth of which the x n axis points to the true north y n points to the east according to the right hand rule z n is vertical downwards though the n e d frame is not a static frame to some degree which means it moves with the earth rotation it can be regarded as an inertial frame with respect to maneuver and control of marine craft in limited area fossen 2011 body attached frame the body attached frame can be presented as b o b y x b y b z b it is a moving frame the origin o b is attached at the moving body for a vessel x b is from aft to bow y b points to the starboard and z b is downwards based on the right hand rule link attached frame in order to facilitate the modeling of this gangway system the link attached frame i is established following the rules below z i is along to the joint axis x i is parallel to the common perpendicular in case of intersecting of joint axis i and i 1 then the x i is perpendicular to the plane decided by the joint axis i and i 1 craig 2005 and in this paper the inertial frame is assumed coincide with the body attached frame and the body attached frame is moving with the vessel while the inertial frame not based on the mechanical model shown in fig 3 the whole block scheme of this gangway system with ship motion and sea waves can be described as fig 4 the reference model is to calculate gangway tip position with ship motions due to sea waves in fig 4 the reference model is to calculate the gangway tip position with motions of the vessel 2 2 mathematical model of the mechanical system the study of robot dynamics can be divided into two parts kinematics and dynamics the former focused only on the geometrical of motion while the latter is the analysis of the forces causing the motion a serial active motion compensation gangway is shown in fig 2 according to its structural characteristics there are two revolute joints and one prismatic joint in this gangway system a revolute revolute prismatic rrp spherical type manipulator model can be adopted for the gangway in this paper which is shown in fig 3 under this simplification the kinematics of the gangway system can then be derived four parameters are used to describe the motion compensation gangway system namely denavit hartenberg dh parameters craig 2005 and the joint variables are θ i for revolute joint i and d i for prismatic one respectively and the dh parameters can be obtained with respect to the link attached frames and it can be stated in table 1 where l x and l z are the distances from origin of frame 1 to the origin of b o d y in x b direction and z b direction respectively l 1 and l 4 represent the lengths of link 1 and link 3 respectively θ 1 θ 2 and d 3 are the joint variables of the gangway system thus the homogeneous transformation matrix between two connected links and it can be expressed as the following which is the homogeneous transformation matrix from link i to i 1 1 t i i 1 c θ i s θ i 0 a i 1 s θ i c α i 1 c θ i c α i 1 s α i 1 d i s α i 1 s θ i s α i 1 c θ i s α i 1 c α i 1 c α i 1 d i 0 0 0 1 where θ i α i 1 a i 1 and d i are the four dh parameters of the gangway system thus based on the parameters in table 1 the homogeneous transformation matrix from gangway tip to b o d y frame can be obtained and it can be described as 2 t p b c 1 c 2 c 1 s 2 s 1 l x l 4 d 3 c 1 s 2 s 1 c 2 s 1 s 1 c 1 l 4 d 3 s 1 s 2 s 2 c 2 0 l z l 1 l 4 d 3 c 2 0 0 0 1 where c and s are c o s and s i n respectively therefore the gangway tip position expressed in b o d y is as the following 3 o p b x t i p b y t i p b z t i p b l x l 4 d 3 c 1 s 2 l 4 d 3 s 1 s 2 l z l 1 l 4 d 3 c 2 the relationship of velocities between gangway tip and joints can be obtained by the jacobian matrix for the whole gangway system in this paper joint 1 and joint 2 are revolute joints and joint 3 is prismatic one therefore the gangway tip velocities can be obtained according to the jacobians of the whole gangway system and it can be expressed by 4 ξ j q where ξ ν p b ω p b t and j j ν j ω t and j s 1 s 2 l 4 d 3 c 1 c 2 l 4 d 3 c 1 s 2 c 1 s 2 l 4 d 3 s 1 c 2 l 4 d 3 s 1 s 2 0 s 2 l 4 d 3 c 2 0 s 1 0 0 c 1 0 1 0 0 inverse kinematics is the opposite process of the forward thus according to eq 3 the tip position is derived with forward kinematics thus the joints variables can be obtained by the inverse solutions which can be expressed by 5 θ 1 arctan y t i p b x t i p b l x θ 2 arctan x t i p b l x cos θ 1 z t i p b l z l 1 π d 3 l x x t i p b cos θ 1 sin θ 2 l 4 and the joints velocities can be derived using inverse jacobian and it can be expressed as 6 θ 1 θ 2 d 3 j ν 1 ν t i p x ν t i p y ν t i p z the joints velocities are derived using the inverse jacobian singularity can be encountered thus the pseudo inverse is adopted and it can be described as j j t jj t 1 in this case the joints velocities can be obtained by the following q j ξ i j j b where b is a vector that can be chosen arbitrary lagrange dynamic equation is a method that based on system energy which consist of potential and kinematic energy the lagrange equation and its differential form can be expressed as the following 7 l k p d d t l q l q ξ where l is the lagrangian k is the kinematic energy and p is the potential energy q q 1 q 2 q n t is the joint variables and ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n t is the generalized force for this 3 links gangway system the total kinetic energy is then obtained by the following 8 k 1 2 i 1 3 j 1 3 m i j q q i q j 1 2 q t m q q then the total inertial matrix of this gangway system is obtained by combining the inertial matrix of each link and it is derived as follows 9 m q i 1 3 m q i d i a g m 11 m 22 m 33 where d i a g is the diagonal matrix and the components are as following 10 m 11 i 1 z i 2 y i 3 z c 2 2 i 2 x i 3 x m l 2 y c 2 2 m l 3 z c 3 d 3 2 s 2 2 m 22 i 2 z i 3 y m l 2 y c 2 2 m l 3 z c 3 d 3 2 m 33 m l 3 the whole system potential energy is obtained in the b o d y frame for this 3 links gangway system the whole potential energy can be obtained from the summation of each link and it can be stated as p i 1 3 p l i i 1 3 m l i g 0 t p c i 0 where p c i 0 represents the gravity center of link i expressed in frame i from the differential lagrange equation 7 the system dynamics can be obtained as the following 11 j 1 3 m i j q q j j 1 3 k 1 3 h i j k q q k q j g q i ξ i where h i j k q m i j q k 1 2 m j k q i i j k 1 2 3 which are termed the first type christoffel symbols the system dynamic equation expressed in eq 11 can be rewritten in a common vector form and it can be stated as below 12 m q q c q q q g q f ξ where m q is the system inertial matrix which is positive definite symmetric matrix c q q is the coriolis centripetal matrix g q is the system restoring term f is the disturbance and ξ represents the generalized force in eq 12 the restoring term g q can be acquired by differential equation of system potential energy and it can be described as the following 13 g q i 1 3 p q i 0 g m l 2 y c 2 m l 3 q 3 z c 3 s 2 g m l 3 c 2 as stated in lebret et al 1993 the coriolis centripetal matrix in eq 12 is an n n matrix that can be derived using the following equation 14 c 1 2 m q u m t u m where u m is a matrix that can be obtained by the following equation u m i n q t m t q where represents the kronecker product and satisfied the following equations 15 m t q m q 1 m q 2 m q 3 t r n n n i n q t q t 0 0 0 q t 0 0 0 q t r n n n it is obviously from eq 14 that m 2 c u m u m t while u m u m t is a skew symmetric matrix which implies that m 2 c is a skew symmetric matrix 2 3 ship motions in 6dof in reality the motion compensated gangway system is installed on the deck as shown in fig 2 the motions of the vessel should be studied the vessel in this paper is a surface vessel without considering control forces thus the seakeeping model is adopted here as discussed in fossen 2011 the seakeeping equations of motion are expressed in the following form 16 η j η ν m s ν c s ν ν d s ν ν g s η τ w where ν u v w p q r t is the velocity vector and η x y z ϕ θ ψ t represents the position vector m s m r b m a is the inertial matrix c s c r b c a is the coriolis centripetal matrix d s g s and τ w are the damping coefficient restoring forces and wave forces respectively the homogeneous transformation matrix between b o d y and n e d frame can be expressed as the following 17 t b n c ψ c θ s ψ c θ c ψ s θ s ϕ s ψ s ϕ c ψ c ϕ s θ x s ψ c θ c ψ c θ s θ s ψ s ϕ s θ c ψ s θ s ψ c ϕ y s θ c θ s ϕ c θ c ψ z 0 0 0 1 further in fossen 2011 for an arbitrarily point p in b o d y frame the system s velocity transformation matrix can be derived from 18 ν p b ν ω r p b ν s t r p b ω where s is the skew symmetric matrix and the system transformation matrix is defined as h r p b i 3 3 s t r p b 0 3 3 i 3 3 h 1 r p b i 3 3 s r p b 0 3 3 i 3 3 therefore transformation of linear and angular velocity vectors between two points with respect to in can be expressed by ν p b ω n b b h r p b ν o b ω n b b this is a useful property for computing the gangway tip velocities due to wave disturbances 2 4 random ocean waves the ocean waves are random not only in time but in space and the wave elevation presents irregular characteristics in any particular sea state pérez and blanke 2002 however it is commonly used and convincing to describe sea waves by their power spectral density psd under the assumption that the sea elevation performs as a realization of a stationary and homogeneous zero mean gaussian stochastic process the ittc recommended 2 parameter spectrum is adopted in this paper for fully developed wave the psd can be expressed by 19 s w ω 173 h 1 3 2 t 4 ω 5 e x p 691 t 4 ω 4 where s w is the psd of random wave ω is the angular frequency t is the average period of the wave and h 1 3 is the significant wave height thus a long crested irregular sea wave elevation can be written as the sum of harmonic components fossen 2011 20 ε k 1 n ε k cos ω k ϕ k k 1 n 2 s ω k δ ω cos ω k ϕ k where ε k is the random phase angle of wave component k 3 controller design 3 1 inverse dynamics control the inverse dynamics control has been used in the parallel robot khudher and powell 2016 liao et al 2017 in this work we applied it into the serial manipulator according to eq 12 the gangway system dynamics can be rewritten as following 21 m q q n q q ξ where n q q c q q g q f is an integral term of the system thus the control input can be chosen as 22 ξ m q u n q q by substituting eq 22 into eq 21 we can obtain m q q u 0 since m q above is a diagonal matrix and it is reversible which results in q u here the gangway system input ξ is linear and decoupled under the new input u which implies that each component in u is only influenced by the joint q i therefore with the desired joint variables q d q 1 d q n d t the system control input can be chosen as 23 u q d k d e k p e according to spong and ortega 1990 k p and k d in eq 23 are chosen as positive definite diagonal matrices which ensures that the closed loop system is linear decoupled and exponentially stable and the closed loop damping ratio and natural frequency can be arbitrarily assigned 3 2 improved inverse dynamics control although the inverse dynamics control is easy to guarantee that the closed loop system is linear decoupled and exponentially stable by choosing proper positive definite diagonal matrices k p and k d it is difficult to accomplish since unknown parameters exist in reality which are vital important for system modeling in the real cases these unknown parameters are hard to acquire due to some nonlinear characteristics of the system and as a result the control efficiency will decreased or even becomes worse therefore to avoid these drawbacks above the system control input in eq 22 can be reelected as the following 24 ξ m ˆ q u n ˆ q q where m ˆ and n ˆ are the dynamic estimation terms of m and n of the system respectively and the estimation errors can be expressed as the following m m ˆ m n n ˆ n combining eqs 21 and 24 we can obtain 25 m q q n q q m ˆ q u n ˆ q q it is obviously that m is a reversible diagonal inertial matrix thus eq 25 can be rewritten in the following form 26 q m 1 m ˆ u n n u m 1 m ˆ i u m 1 n u γ where γ i m 1 m ˆ u m 1 n thus the new system control input of q can be chosen as 27 u q d k d e k p e in this case the system error equation is obtained and it can be expressed as 28 e k d e k p e γ in the system error equation γ is nonlinear and coupled the convergence of system errors depends not only on the left part of eq 28 but also the uncertain term γ assuming that the desired joint is q d then the system error can be stated as 29 e q d q e q d e q d q q d u γ for the system error equation 29 assuming that x e e t is the new state variable then the system state space form can be expressed by 30 x ax b q d u γ where a 0 i 0 0 r 2 n 2 n b 0 i r 2 n n though the exact parameters of uncertain term γ are hardly to obtain but of which the estimation range is assumed already known under the assumption the system is asymptotically stable with control input u while γ within the estimation range then the system control input can be expressed by 31 u q d k d e k p e ε where ε is added to ensure the system s robustness under the effect of uncertain term η by substituting eq 31 into eq 30 we can get 32 x a x b γ ε where a a bk 0 i k p k d k k p k d in order to get ε in eq 32 the direct lyapunov method is adopted here take the lyapunov function as the following 33 v x x t q x 0 x 0 where q r 2 n 2 n is a positive definite symmetric matrix as a result the first order differential equation of lyapunov function eq 33 is shown as following 34 v x x t q x x t q x x t a t b γ ε t qx x t q a t x b γ ε x t a t q q a x 2 x t qb γ ε since a is a hurwitz matrix and q is positive definite the following equation holds 35 a t q q a p where p is a positive definite symmetric matrix assuming that z b t qx thus the first order differential equation of lyapunov function can be rewritten as 36 v x x t p x 2 x t qb γ ε x t p x 2 z t γ ε in order to make the differential lyapunov function negative the second term of eq 36 on the right should be set negative since the former is always negative for all x 0 let ε β z z β 0 ε β which implies 37 z t γ ε z t η β z t z z z γ β z z γ β if γ β then the differential lyapunov function v x 0 a way to seek for β is described as the followings 38 γ i m 1 m ˆ u m 1 n i m 1 m ˆ q d kx ε m 1 n α q d α k x α β m 1 n α q m α k x α β m m a x ϕ thus by setting β 1 1 α α q m α k x m m a x ϕ the differential lyapunov function is negative

expressed as fig 5 therefore the whole gangway system block scheme as shown in fig 4 can be expressed as fig 6 with the improved inverse dynamics control derived above 4 simulation results and discussion the aim of the active motion compensation system is to keep the gangway tip still in inertial frame namely n e d frame this implies that the gangway tip motion should be opposite to that caused by the ocean waves while the ocean wave effects directly on the vessel other than gangway tip thus the motions of the vessel in all 6dof should be studied at first while as studied in liang et al 2017a roll motion of a vessel is reduced by the ordinary fin stabilizers when the ship moves at conventional speed and decreased by using zero speed fin stabilizers and magnus rotating roll stabilizer at zero speed liang et al 2018 2017 in this paper a dp model with zero speed is adopted from fossen and perez 2004 the significant wave height is set to 2 5 m with wave spread direction π 4 and the water depth is assumed to be infinity main parameters of the simulation vessel is as shown in table 2 where the parameters are acquired from fossen and perez 2004 thus the sea psd and real time state realization can be obtained the significant wave height is 2 5 m as shown in fig 7 wave psd is displayed and the real time sea state realization is shown in fig 8 ship motions in 6dof can be simulated as shown in fig 9 with different wave directions as can be seen from fig 9 a c the main degrees of freedom that influenced by the ocean waves are surge sway and heave which are the main degrees of freedom to be compensated in this motion compensation gangway system the motions of the vessel can be compensated by driving the gangway tip moves in the opposite directions both in amplitudes and velocities in this paper the base of the motion compensation gangway system is installed on the deck and can be expressed by l x l y l z in b o d y for simplification the origin of base frame is located at the o b x b z b plane of b o d y which implies that l y 0 and it is the same as in table 3 l y vanished therefore the coordinate for the origin of base frame can be expressed by l x 0 l z and in this paper l x 20 l z 3 the motion compensation gangway system is accomplished in both the gangway tip stand still and keep moving and the models are established using matlab simulink for both simulations the gangway initial states are set at q 1 q 2 q 3 0 3 π 2 4 3 to avoid singular values and the parameters of the gangway system is displayed in table 3 therefore the gangway tip position can be obtained using eq 3 and can be expressed as 0 8 30 t in b o d y frame and the parameters of the controller are chosen as the following k p 100 0 0 0 150 0 0 0 400 k d 15 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 15 besides to satisfy eq 35 q can be selected as q 262 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 262 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 262 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 2 525 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 525 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 525 pd control with gravity compensation can easily ensure that the origin system is globally asymptotically stable if k p and k d are positive definite kelly et al 2006 thus in the following parts simulation results of these two controllers are given the motion compensation task is divided into two parts the docking state and moves with desired trajectories case 1 the docking state aims to keep the gangway tip motionless which is also known as regulation kelly et al 2006 for motion compensation purpose the motions of gangway tip should be on the contrary directions against to the vessel motions caused by the ocean disturbances it is obviously from fig 10 12 in the situation of non compensated gangway tip moves far away with time increasing both in x and y directions while in z direction oscillates around its initial state this is mainly caused by the fact that restoring force and moment do exist in ship heave motion while the other two do not simulations of the adopted controller in this paper compared with pd control with gravity compensation are as shown in figs 10 12 where e x r e y r and e z r are gangway tip position error in x y and z direction with the controller adopted here respectively while e x g e y g and e z g are the results of pd controller with gravity compensation according to figs 10 to 12 we can conclude that the vessel motions are compensated with both controllers and the gangway tip keeps its position of the initial state with time passing by while the inverse dynamics controller adopted in the paper performs well in x direction see fig 13 as a consequence the compensated gangway tip positions are as shown in fig 16 where x d y d and z d are the desired positions x u n y u n and z u n are positions without motion compensation while x a c t y a c t and z a c t are the compensated tip position in x y z directions respectively according to figs 10 12 gangway tip position errors decreased in x y and z directions while in y direction the inverse dynamics controller performs better both in tuning time and system overshoot than the pd control with gravity compensation case 2 different from the docking case which is to keep the gangway tip still at an exact point the second situation to be studied in this paper is to keep the gangway tip moves with desired trajectories which are expressed as the following x d 1 s i n 2 π 10 t 30 7 y d 1 2 s i n 2 π 14 t z d 0 8 s i n 2 π 8 t 8 where x d y d and z d are all given in inertial frame it is the same as the first situation that in z direction the restoring force and moment exist which can be obtained from the tip position errors shown in figs 14 16 and with the affections of ocean waves the gangway tip moves in irregular trajectories rather than the desired without motion compensation and the tracking errors of gangway tip with control affections of motion compensation are shown in figs 14 16 in which e x u e y u and e z u are the position errors without motion compensation e x r e y r and e z r are positions without motion compensation while e x g e y g and e z g are the compensated tip position in x y z directions respectively by comparing figs 14 16 we can find out that the tracking errors decreased in significant amplitudes in x y and z directions with the controller adopted in this paper while using the pd controller with gravity compensation the tracking errors decreased the system oscillates as a result the system tends to instability easily the real gangway tip positions in x y and z directions are shown as fig 17 where x d y d and z d are the desired positions x u n y u n and z u n are the positions without motion compensation x a c t y a c t and z a c t are the positions with motion compensation from the simulation results of both cases above we can conclude that in the docking state both controllers are capable in the motion compensation system while in the later case the inverse dynamics controller performs better which is also corresponding to the fact that the pd control with gravity compensation does works in cases that the desired position are constants which has been studied in kelly et al 2006 5 conclusion an active motion compensation gangway system is analyzed in this paper both kinematics and dynamics of the gangway system are derived in order to compensate vessel motions due to the ocean waves a dp model and ittc 2 parameter psd are adopted in this paper different wave directions that effect the ship motions are simulated and based on the inverse dynamics the robust controller is designed and simulated using matlab simulink according to the simulation results of ship motions in 6dof restoring force and moment exist in heave for translational motion as a result compared with the other two directions gangway tip position is periodicity in z direction from the simulations results we can conclude that in docking case both controllers are capable while in the second case the inverse dynamic controller is preferable pd control with gravity is not a optional one besides motions are compensated not only in the dof with restoring forces and moments but also the other two declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
