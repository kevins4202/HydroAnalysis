7115,to better understand the groundwater flow and chemistry in argillaceous formations the dependency of transport parameters such as permeability diffusion coefficient and chemical osmotic efficiency on each of the chemical species dominant in groundwater must also be understood despite its importance however little is known about the dependence of transport parameters on different types of groundwater thus we investigated transport parameters of wakkanai mudstones using three different types of electrolyte solutions here we report the relationship among the solution salt type solute concentration transport parameters and pore structure characteristics wide ranges in osmotic efficiency and intrinsic permeability 0 0035 0 14 and 1 19 10 19 to 4 75 10 18 m2 respectively reflect the difference in the solution composition based on the salt type difference in solute concentration and variation in the pore size distributions of wakkanai mudstones the effective diffusion coefficients with filtration effects at 2 98 10 11 to 5 92 10 11 m2 s 1 vary depending on salt type but remain invariant among samples indicating no difference in fluid flow path associated with small values of osmotic efficiency in contrast the osmotic efficiencies are related to differences in salt concentrations our findings indicate that salt concentration and pore structure characteristics determine not only the semipermeability of the wakkanai mudstones but also the diffusivity and permeability keywords chemical osmosis diffusion permeability pore structure salt concentration salt type 1 introduction the complex hydrogeologic properties of argillite include membrane behavior which affects semipermeability and induces chemical osmosis under a salinity gradient thus the groundwater flow system in an argillaceous formation is governed by not only topography and pressure driven flow but also by flow driven by chemical osmosis and thermo osmosis gonçalvès et al 2004 2010 2012 neuzil 2000 2013 wilson et al 2003 chemical osmosis involves flow from low to high concentration zones essentially this process describes water migration through a semipermeable membrane driven by differences in the chemical potential of the water migrating across the membrane which continues until the difference in potential energy is compensated by other potential differences such as the pressure difference e g mitchell and soga 2005 assuming that a salinity gradient exists in a formation and that the formation behaves as a semipermeable membrane chemical osmosis may generate abnormal pressures and hydraulic head profiles which could persist for tens of millions of years e g neuzil 2000 2015 the occurrence of large erratic pressures has been re examined by neuzil and provost 2009 and was discussed in tremosa et al 2012 therefore the possibility of chemical osmosis in groundwater systems of sedimentary formations should be carefully examined chemical osmosis depends on the clay mineralogy porewater chemistry and pore size distribution of a sedimentary formation e g bresler 1973 gonçalvès et al 2007 leroy and revil 2004 neuzil 2000 rahman et al 2005 takeda et al 2014 for example clay minerals have a negative surface charge and their surfaces generate electrical double layers edls e g appelo and postma 2005 when the pore space between two clay particles is small and the edls overlap repulsion occurs electrical repulsive forces generated by a negative potential field inhibit anions via migration through the pore the passage of anions is restricted when compaction decreases the pore size so that the diffuse double layers of two clay particles overlap to cause anion exclusion the distribution of electrical charges in solution enables transport of water and non charged solutes but restricts the passage of charged species through the pore network which is related to the semi permeable membrane behavior of the clay in such media osmosis can cause fluid to flow from regions of low salt concentration to those of high salt concentration where a fluid pressure build up is induced the solute concentration and ionic composition of the groundwater affect the edls on the surface of clay minerals the groundwater contains solutes with different electric charges and concentrations in addition the solutes may be spatially unevenly distributed owing to the groundwater flow system during sedimentation this means that various porewater solutes can lead to cation exchanges within the edls at the clay mineral surface correspondingly chemical osmosis depends on the porewater chemistry therefore to evaluate chemical osmosis in sedimentary formations it is necessary to determine how the differences in groundwater solutes affect this osmosis apart from the electrical characteristics of clay mineral surfaces the pore size distribution affects chemical osmosis when the dominant interconnected pore space is narrow the pore throats available for fluid flow enhance the semipermeable membrane behavior the effect of semipermeability on rocks has been investigated in several previous studies e g cey et al 2001 horseman et al 2007 neuzil 2000 rousseau gueutin et al 2010 takeda et al 2014 in most of these studies differences in nacl salt concentration were identified as driving forces of chemical osmosis however the effect of the salt type on the chemical osmosis of rocks has been discussed only by al bazali et al 2005 neuzil and person 2017 tremosa et al 2012 and villabona camacho et al 2009 these authors used the same rocks for nacl kcl and cacl2 solutions they observed variation in the osmotic efficiency values which is a parameter of semipermeability ranging from 0 non membrane to 1 perfect membrane and explained this effect by discussing the difference in mobility of these electrolytes monovalent sodium and potassium ions with small ionic radii have a higher mobility than divalent calcium ions in contrast many studies reported the effects of different salts and concentrations on the semipermeability of clay membranes consisting of different clay types such as undisturbed natural clay rocks and remolded pure clays the salts that were used in the previous research include nacl hart et al 2008 noy et al 2004 rousseau gueutin et al 2008 kcl cheng and hendry 2014 kang and shackelford 2011 malusis and shackelford 2002 tang et al 2014 2015 nahco3 garavito et al 2007 nano3 derrington et al 2006 and napo4 derrington et al 2006 these results can be summarized as follows the osmotic efficiency decreases when the solute concentration increases and increases in the concentration cause a progressively greater shrinkage of the edls of the clay particles in addition the charge of the clay surface is equal and opposite to the charge of the double layer which is distributed depending on the solute concentration of the solution cations and anions closer to the surface with increasing solute concentration balance the surface charge thus the double layer becomes thin thick at high low solute concentration a high concentration yields a highly accessible porosity for ionic transport and a leaky membrane corresponding to osmotic efficiency values close to zero moreover the osmotic efficiencies of the cation or anion species differ according to the different interactions between the solutes and the mineral surfaces therefore the salt type and concentration affect the semipermeability of geologic media similarly the type and concentration of the salt and porosity affect the permeability of geologic media e g cey et al 2001 mesri and olson 1971 mesri and olson 1971 reported the variation in permeability values using smectite illite and kaolinite pure clays for nacl or cacl2 solutions with different concentrations and void ratio values they attributed this variation to the tendency of clay to disperse or form aggregates dispersion reduces fluid flow because it creates flow channels with nearly the same size and aggregation tends to increase fluid flow owing to the existence of many small flow channels and a relatively smaller number of main flow channels cey et al 2001 reported that the hydraulic conductivity of a natural clay rock increases with an increase in pore fluid concentration which can be explained by the diffuse double layer theory these studies suggest that the type and concentration of salt in porewater or groundwater and the pore structure of geologic media affect the transport parameters through their influence on the media parameters such as microstructure and edl despite its importance however the relationship between the salt type solute concentration and transport parameters in undisturbed rocks has not been fully examined from an experimental standpoint this study focuses on the effect of different salt types and concentrations on the transport parameters of wakkanai mudstones these mudstones were previously studied by takeda et al 2014 who estimated the semipermeability permeability and diffusion coefficient based on nacl solution in the present study we performed permeability and chemical osmosis experiments on the same mudstone samples by using kcl and khco3 solutions to determine the relationship between the salt type and the transport parameters the use of the same samples is expected to have better results in the comparison of transport parameters as salt types kcl khco3 and nacl were selected based on the sensitivity of chemical osmosis of 1 1 electrolytes compared with solutions of ionic species with different valences the groundwater in this area has a nacl dominated water chemistry at depths below 250 m and an increase in water salinity with depth showing that the second most common cation and anion are k and hco3 respectively and that the content of divalent species is limited hama et al 2007 in addition the selection of divalent species is expected to cause difficulty in the experimental observation of chemical osmosis because it reduces the osmotic efficiency e g tremosa et al 2012 thus this study explores the relationship among the three aforementioned salt types the transport parameters and the pore structures of wakkanai mudstones sequential permeability and chemical osmosis experiments based on the study by takeda et al 2014 are conducted to examine the chemo osmotic hydraulic and diffusion parameters as transport parameters for each rock sample the hydraulic parameters are estimated from the permeability experiments and the chemo osmotic and diffusion parameters were estimated from the chemical osmosis experiments based on the experimental results the effects of salt type and of various kcl concentrations are discussed with respect to these three parameters for each rock sample moreover these transport parameters are discussed with respect to the pore structures of the rock samples 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 materials the samples are argillaceous rocks that were retrieved from boreholes hdb 9 and hdb 11 drilled in the marine wakkanai formation in the horonobe area of japan takeda et al 2014 previously extracted disc shaped rock samples 50 mm in diameter and 10 mm in thickness from the 80 mm diameter cores of these boreholes and performed experiments we used the same samples in the present experiment carefully observation by the unaided eye revealed no fissures or fractures in these samples the average pore radius porosity specific surface area cation exchange capacity and pore structure of the core samples are summarized in table 1 the porosity and average pore radius of the cores differ only slightly although the pore structure characteristics depend on the pore size distribution the pore size distribution revealed the presence of three groups of pore structures in these samples the first group is sample no 2 which has a distinct bimodal distribution with peaks centered at 4 5 nm and 10 30 nm the second group consists of samples nos 1 and 3 which have a slight bimodal distribution with peaks centered at 7 8 nm and 10 20 nm the third group is composed of sample nos 4 and 5 which show a clear peak at 8 nm the pore structures of the cores were characterized on the basis of different pore size distributions of pores with sizes greater than 10 nm 1 nanoscale pores 10 nm accounting for 56 67 of the total pore space 2 10 100 nm accounting for 40 30 of the total pore space bulk rock powders were analyzed by using an x ray powder diffractometer rint2500 rigaku using monochromatic cukα radiation at 40 kv and 100 ma from 2 5 to 70 the step size was 0 02 and the scan speed was 2 min 1 the clay fractions 2 μm of the mudstones were extracted by using a conventional sedimentation method according to stokes law the clay identification and procedures were based on those reported by shirozu 1988 and wada 1966 for oriented aggregate mounts of the clay fraction of the samples the clay mineral identification was confirmed by diagnosing the extent of the d spacing expansion which is indicative of certain clay minerals during subsequent treatments which included air drying and ethylene glycol treatment the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the clay fractions of the samples were obtained by using a rigaku rint2500 instrument operated at 40 kv and 100 ma from 2 to 50 to determine the d spacings of each sample the step size was 0 02 and the scan speed was 1 min 1 the features of the xrd patterns of the bulk rock and clay fractions of the samples summarized in table 2 are consistent with the mineralogy reported in hiraga and ishii 2007 the samples contain mainly opal ct quartz feldspar and layered silicate minerals the layered silicate minerals include illite chlorite and smectite pyrite is also present in the samples interstratified clay minerals were not included the bulk chemical composition of the samples was determined as follows the weight loss on ignition loi was determined for each rock powder using whole rock analysis after determining the loi sample nos 2 and 5 were analyzed for major elements at activation laboratories canada by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes in addition the fe ii content was determined by titration a lithium metaborate tetraborate fusion technique was used for the icp oes analysis the analytical errors were 0 01 that of feo was 0 1 the results show that sio2 al2o3 and loi are dominant the sum of these oxides accounts for more than 90 wt of the samples the mineralogy of the wakkanai mudstones was determined by using normative calculation combined with the xrd patterns and bulk chemical composition table 2 the normative calculation was estimated on the basis of the report by igarashi 1984 in general opal ct including amorphous material opal a is dominant the sum of the clay minerals was estimated to be 17 wt 2 2 transport parameters using nacl solution the relationship between the transport parameters and pore structures of the wakkanai mudstones based on nacl solution is described in takeda et al 2014 the values of the transport parameters obtained from takeda et al 2014 are summarized in table 2 in short variations of the intrinsic permeability k 8 92 10 20 to 1 24 10 17 m2 of the samples were recognized the variations in k values of the samples are attributed primarily to the difference in pore size distribution rather than the small range porosity at 0 29 0 33 the largest k values were observed for sample no 2 which has a bimodal pore size distribution in contrast the smallest k values were observed for sample nos 4 and 5 which show unimodal pore size distributions however the wide range in k values may be caused by the occurrence of naturally occurring internal microfissures or microfractures the wide range in osmotic efficiency at 0 0004 0 046 reflects the variation in pore size distribution of the wakkanai mudstones the largest variations in the osmotic efficiency values were observed for sample nos 4 and 5 having unimodal pore size distribution the regression analysis of the osmotic efficiency and permeability showed inversely proportional behavior in contrast a small range in effective diffusion coefficient at 3 59 4 27 10 11 m2 s 1 was observed with filtration effects an invariant osmotic efficiency with respect to the effective diffusion coefficient was determined for the wakkanai mudstones owing to their small osmotic efficiencies at 0 046 the wide variation in osmotic efficiency and pore structure characteristics of these mudstones indicates that their nanoscale pores enable semipermeability 2 3 methods the experimental methods used in the present study are described in detail in takeda et al 2014 fig 1 shows the flow of the sequential permeability and chemical osmosis experiments two experimental conditions were utilized to measure the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters first the experiments were conducted by using different salt types kcl and khco3 the samples were immersed in 0 1 m kcl or 0 1 m khco3 solutions for at least three months prior to the start of the experiments this long term immersion in the test solution enabled reliable experimental data to be obtained a short immersion could not result in equilibrium between the porewater in the sample and test solution and could cause complications in interpreting the pressure and concentration evolutions the same disc shaped rock sample was used repeatedly to perform the permeability and chemical osmosis experiments with different solutions in the first and second experiments kcl and khco3 solutions were used respectively the experimental conditions of these experiments are summarized in table 3 second experiments using kcl solutions were conducted at different solute concentrations the sample was immersed in 0 01 m and 0 1 m kcl solution the experimental conditions of the permeability and chemical osmosis experiments are summarized in table 3 the electric conductivity was calibrated against kcl or khco3 solutions of 0 01 m to 1 0 m in addition before and after the experiment we confirmed the presence of fissures or fractures by careful observation with the unaided eye the undamaged samples were used for further experiments during both experiments the reservoir solutions were circulated at a constant flow rate of 10 ml min 1 and the temperature of the incubator was set to 40 c during the permeability and chemical osmosis experiments the temperature variations were controlled within a range of 0 2 c the confining pressure was controlled to simulate the effective stress according to the depth from which each sample was retrieved however we exchanged the pressure transducer and tube in this study the pressure transducer has a measurement pressure range of 0 to 500 kpa and a precision of 0 1 fs which improved the stability of the pressure measurement the tube was a polyether ether ketone peek tube which also improved the experimental preparation the sealed volumes of the top and bottom reservoirs were measured and the compressible storage of the top and bottom reservoirs was determined by using the method proposed in song et al 2004 the results are shown in table 3 the analytical models for permeability and chemical osmosis experiments used in this study are described in detail in takeda et al 2014 the analytical solutions for sequential permeability and chemical osmosis experiments need transient state experimental data because the initial conditions for the chemical osmosis experiment must be attained after the permeability experiment the experimental and analytical protocols proposed by takeda et al 2014 are effective because they include interpretation of their experimental data thus for interpretation of the experimental data used in this study transient state analytical solutions were applied to the permeability and chemical osmosis experiments based on takeda et al 2014 the hydraulic parameters were estimated from the permeability experiments using eq 12 in takeda et al 2014 and the chemo osmotic and diffusion parameters were estimated from chemical osmosis experiments using eqs 20 and 21 in takeda et al 2014 3 results 3 1 difference in salt type fig 2 shows the downstream pressure evolution in the permeability experiments when an initial pressure difference between upstream and downstream reservoirs of 50 kpa is prescribed in general the pressure in the downstream reservoir rapidly increased immediately after the start of the experiment then slowly increased and finally reached a steady state within one day however the pressure changes owing to the flow of the nacl kcl or khco3 solution showed different trends the flow of the kcl solution was faster than that of the nacl and khco3 solutions the fitted curves are shown in fig 2 the estimated intrinsic permeability k and the specific storage s s are listed in table 4 the k values ranged from 1 19 10 19 to 4 75 10 18 m2 the estimated values are within the k range reported for wakkanai mudstones in kurikami et al 2008 and takeda et al 2014 however the k values obtained using nacl kcl and khco3 solutions for the same sample differed despite the use of the same concentration at 0 1 m for example the k value obtained using a 0 1 m kcl solution was greater than that obtained using a 0 1 m khco3 solution indicating that the permeability associated with the flow of the former is greater than that associated with the flow of the latter the relative magnitudes of the k values obtained alternatively with the 0 1 m khco3 and 0 1 m nacl solutions also differed indicating that the permeability associated with the flow using these different solutes does not depend on the porosity of the sample but on both the pore size distribution of the sample and the salt type fig 3 dependency of the k values of 0 1 m nacl on the pore size distribution was previously recognized in takeda et al 2014 in addition the variation in k value in sample no 2 was larger than that of other samples indicating that the k value of the 0 1 m khco3 solution in sample no 2 was low this might have been caused by the clogging of clay particles in a broad flow path owing to the dispersion of clay particles affected by the khco3 solution figs 4 and 5 show the downstream pressure and salt concentration evolutions in the chemical osmosis experiments when an initial concentration difference of 0 5 m between upstream and downstream reservoirs is prescribed the pressure in the downstream reservoir increased during the initial stage and then gradually decreased with a decrease in the concentration difference between the reservoir solutions fig 4 the solute concentration decreased in the downstream reservoir whereas that of the upstream reservoir increased fig 5 here we should confirm whether the solute travel is advective or diffusive experimental data using nacl demonstrated that diffusion is the dominant process in solute migration in chemical osmosis experiments takeda et al 2014 similarly based on the pressure data fig 4 and effective diffusion coefficient estimated for the wakkanai mudstones using 125i by tachi et al 2011 the peclet number for kcl and khco3 experiments which is defined as the ratio of advective to diffusive solute transport was calculated using eqs 16 and 27 in takeda et al 2014 as a result not shown in the figure the peclet numbers of the kcl and khco3 experiments were considerably smaller than 1 and were close to 0 at the quasi steady state this shows that diffusion is the dominant process in solute migration in the chemical osmosis experiments different pressure and concentration evolutions owing to chemical osmosis were observed with nacl kcl and khco3 the pressure increase by chemical osmosis using the khco3 solution was higher than that obtained using nacl or kcl solutions in all samples suggesting that the filtration effect of the electrolytes differed the fitted curves are shown in figs 4 and 5 although the fitted curves for the solute concentrations in the upstream and downstream reservoirs generally agreed well with the measured data fig 5 the fitted curves for the downstream reservoir pressure could not capture the pressure fluctuation particularly in the early stages of the experiments fig 4 the causes of this pressure fluctuations may be uneven distribution of osmotic pressure in the sample during the early stage in response to the evolution of the solute concentration in the sample the estimated effective diffusion coefficients d e and osmotic efficiencies σ are summarized in table 4 the value of d e ranged from 2 90 10 11 to 5 89 10 11 m2 s 1 the estimated values are similar to that reported for the wakkanai mudstones in takeda et al 2014 the value of d e includes the filtration effect d e 1 σ d e in the present study the value of d e without the filtration effect was considered because of the small osmotic efficiency the d e values decreased in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 the relationship between the d e values and porosity of the wakkanai mudstone samples is shown in fig 6 a for each of the three solutes the correlation coefficient between the d e value and porosity of the samples was different however the correlation between the d e values and porosity cannot be judged considering a 95 confidence interval as pointed out in takeda et al 2014 in contrast the difference in the average d e value of each salt type was statistically robust and was confirmed at the 95 confidence interval the σ value ranged from 0 00352 to 0 0376 the estimated values are similar to that reported for the wakkanai mudstones in takeda et al 2014 the estimated σ values reflect very small to small semipermeability garavito et al 2006 2007 neuzil 2000 noy et al 2004 rousseau gueutin et al 2008 the average σ value tended to increase in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 a distinct correlation between the σ value and porosity was found for each of the three solutes fig 6b however the correlation of these parameters cannot be judged considering the 95 confidence interval the difference in the average σ value of each salt type was confirmed at the 95 confidence interval when the osmotic efficiency decreased the effective diffusion coefficient increased fig 7 a however σ for khco3 was larger than that for kcl and d e for kcl was larger than that for khco3 suggesting that the transport parameters by their electrolytes differ under the same concentration difference for comparison with the wakkanai mudstone data fig 7 also shows the results of an experiment performed on callovo oxfordian argillite rousseau gueutin et al 2009 using nacl concentrations similar to those used in the experiments performed in takeda et al 2014 however all data except that for the callovo oxfordian argillite rousseau gueutin et al 2009 indicate no clear relationship between d e and σ for the wakkanai mudstones based on the 95 confidence interval this may be explained by a small variation in the effective diffusion coefficient or small solute filtration owing to the semipermeability of the wakkanai mudstones σ 0 05 in addition the relationships between osmotic efficiency and porosity fig 6b and between intrinsic permeability and porosity fig 3 showed an opposite trend suggesting that an increase in osmotic efficiency is associated with a decrease in intrinsic permeability the inverse proportionality between k and σ was previously assumed by takeda et al 2014 who fitted the k σ data for nacl using a power law function their results showed a very good inverse correlation between σ and k with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 the regression curve in fig 7b is very close to the datapoint of the callovo oxfordian argillite rousseau gueutin et al 2009 based on the observation mentioned above concerns are present as to whether the k σ data for kcl and khco3 in the present study follow the relation the k σ data for kcl and khco3 were distributed around the regression curve the data for kcl or khco3 followed the line of inverse proportionality between k and σ the cause of the similarity based on the solutes is described in the section 4 3 2 solute concentration effects fig 8 a shows data obtained from permeability experiments of sample no 4 and the fitted curves the pressure in the downstream reservoir rapidly increased immediately after the start of the experiment then slowly increased and finally reached a steady state after 10 h however the difference in kcl concentrations cannot be attributed to the pressure change for example the maximum pressure difference increased in the order of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 9 m and 0 09 m in concentration difference the values estimated for the intrinsic permeability k and specific storage s s are summarized in table 4 the k values ranged from 3 31 10 19 to 5 45 10 19 m2 and the estimated values are within the above experimental data range fig 9 a shows the relationship between the kcl concentration of the permeability experiments and the k values of the wakkanai mudstone samples indicating that the k value obtained with the 0 01 m kcl solution was smaller than that obtained with the 0 1 m kcl solution fig 8b and c show data measured during the chemical osmosis experiments of sample no 4 and the fitted curves similar to the aforementioned results the pressure in the downstream reservoir increased during the initial stage and then gradually decreased as the concentration difference between reservoir solutions decreased the pressure of the 0 09 m kcl solution or the difference between high and low solute concentrations was the highest except for the result of the 0 09 m kcl solution the pressure increased with an increase in the solute concentration difference the values estimated for the effective diffusion coefficient d e and osmotic efficiency σ are summarized in table 4 the d e values ranged from 3 05 10 11 to 4 67 10 11 m2 s 1 the estimated values are within the aforementioned range of experimental data fig 9b shows the relationships between the average high and low concentrations at the end of the experiment and the d e values of the wakkanai mudstone samples the d e values increased with an increase in average concentration and were constant at 4 7 10 11 m2 s 1 beyond a 0 2 m average concentration the σ values of sample no 4 ranged from 0 0105 to 0 143 the estimated values are within the aforementioned experimental data range fig 9c shows the relationship between the average high and low concentrations at the end of the experiment and the σ values of the wakkanai mudstone samples the σ values decreased with an increase in average concentration and were constant at 0 012 beyond a 0 2 m average concentration the d e increased with an increase in average concentration indicating a positive correlation the k value tended to increase with an increase in average concentration these relationships support the results of previous studies for example revil et al 2005 showed increasing d e with concentration and mesri and olson 1971 showed increasing k with concentration in contrast the σ value increased with a decrease in average concentration indicating a negative correlation this relationship was evidenced by bresler 1973 who showed a decrease with increasing concentration thus the correlation between σ and k or d e is expected to be negative according to these observations and those of previous studies the three parameters are closely related suggesting that they are affected by the solute concentration 4 discussion the experimental results show that chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters vary depending on the salt type solute concentration and pore size distribution for each of the wakkanai mudstone samples the correlation of these parameters is conceptually shown in fig 10 first sample specific pore structure characteristics govern the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters the differences were most pronounced in the pore size distribution for example samples with a bimodal distribution of small and large pore sizes showed low chemo osmotic parameters and high diffusive and hydraulic parameters in contrast samples with a unimodal distribution of small pore sizes showed high chemo osmotic parameters and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters second the difference in salt type affects the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters for example the average σ value increased in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 the d e values decreased in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 the k values generally decreased in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 that is experiments using the kcl solution showed low chemo osmotic parameters and high diffusive and hydraulic parameters in contrast samples using the khco3 solution showed high chemo osmotic parameters and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters third the difference in solute concentration affects the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters for the kcl solution the σ d e values decreased increased exponentially with an increase in kcl concentration the k values were smaller under low kcl concentration than high kcl concentration that is experiments with a low solute concentration showed high chemo osmotic parameters and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters and vice versa based on the aforementioned observations low chemo osmotic parameters and high diffusive and hydraulic parameters were obtained from experiments with samples having a bimodal distribution of small and large pore sizes kcl or nacl as the salt type or high solute concentration in contrast high chemo osmotic parameters and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters were obtained from experiments with samples having a unimodal distribution of small pore sizes khco3 or nacl as the salt type or low solute concentration the relationship of these parameters indicates that chemo osmotic and hydraulic or diffusive parameters are negatively correlated these correlations suggest that chemo osmotic and diffusive and hydraulic parameters are related to the width of the path available for fluid flow in wakkanai mudstone samples this is because a narrow flow path resists fluid flow and a broad flow path is less resistant to fluid flow that is a narrow path leads to a high chemo osmotic parameter and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters and vice versa thus it is easy to understand that the difference in pore size distribution in the wakkanai mudstone samples led to these different observations the observations based on the differences in the salt type and solute concentration will be discussed in the following section the width of the path available for fluid flow may be related to the swelling or shrinking of clay minerals kwon et al 2004 sparks 1995 sposito et al 1999 and overlap or collapse of edls on the surfaces of the minerals e g cey et al 2001 differences in salt type and solute concentration may affect the width of the path controlling the fluid flow in the pore structure if the pore throats available for fluid flow and solute diffusion are modified by local clay swelling or shrinking at the clay fluid interfaces however based on the clay content in table 2 we consider that the possibility of flow path shrinkage owing to swelling is low because of the low amount of clay mineral swelling in the sample thus alteration of the pores and pore throats in the sample caused by swelling cannot be considered in this study alternatively the pore throat width available for fluid flow and solute diffusion can be modified by a change in edl thickness at the clay fluid interface which is altered considerably depending on the salt type and the solute concentration e g cey et al 2001 when the salt type or magnitude of the solute concentration leads to thinner edls the pores and pore throats of the sample widen as a result of the low amount of overlap of these thin edls the shrinkage of edls reduces the anion exclusion effect which repels the anions widens the diffusion path of the solute and leads to a porosity closer to the original value e g rousseau gueutin et al 2008 2009 tang et al 2014 in contrast when the salt type or magnitude of the solute concentration leads to thicker edls the pores and pore throats of the sample narrow owing to the high amount of overlap of the thick edls consequently the thickness of edls affects the fluid flow and solute diffusion which changes the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters based on the k and σ values for solute concentration effects shown in fig 9 and table 4 the edl thickness by kcl is suggested to reduce with an increase in concentration however based on the k d e and σ values at each sample for different salt types in table 4 the edl thickness does not change in the multiple comparisons for each parameter of the k d e and σ values by salt type to determine how the edl thickness varies depending on the salt type and solute concentration we discuss the debye length instead of the edl thickness on the surface of the charged mineral which is a good approximate of the latter e g stumm and morgan 1996 because the charge profiles in the edl depend on the debye length the debye length 1 κ is the classical parameter in the domain of colloid and interface science and provides an estimate of the thickness of the edl 1 1 κ ε r ε 0 k b t 2 n a e 2 i 10 3 where ε r is the dielectric constant of the solution ε 0 is the dielectric constant of

2 indicates that under the same concentration the value of ε r differs depending on the value of δ for each solute therefore the value of δ characterizing each solute can determine the debye length for different electrolyte solutions at the same ionic strength and temperature although the δ values for nacl and kcl were obtained by hasted et al 1948 to our knowledge the δ value for khco3 has not been determined thus far accordingly the δ value for khco3 may be estimated as follows the relation between the constant δ and the free solution salt diffusion coefficient for each solute is shown in fig 11 the figure shows a positive correlation indicating that the constant δ increases with an increase in the free solution salt diffusion coefficient based on the relationship between the constant δ and the salt diffusion coefficient we can estimate the constant δ for khco3 thus we need to obtain the salt diffusion coefficient of khco3 the salt diffusion coefficients can be calculated by using the nernst hartley equation 3 d 0 rt f 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 λ 1 0 λ 2 0 λ 1 0 λ 2 0 where d 0 is the salt diffusion coefficient at infinite dilution r is the gas law constant and f is the faraday constant λ1 0 and λ2 0 are the infinite dilution equivalent conductance of the ions forming the binary electrolyte and z 1 and z 2 are the values of the respective ionic charges shackelford and daniel 1991 reported the free solution salt diffusion coefficients for nacl and kcl as 1 61 10 9 and 1 99 10 9 m2 s 1 respectively similarly estimated the free solution salt diffusion coefficient for khco3 by using the nernst hartley equation based on the relationship between the salt diffusion coefficient and electrolyte conductivity which yielded a value of 1 47 10 9 m2 s 1 once the value of the free solution salt diffusion coefficient for khco3 was calculated we were able to estimate the constant δ for khco3 based on the relationship between the constant δ and the salt diffusion coefficient to be 6 6 therefore the dielectric constants ε r of each solution which are required for this study can be obtained under the same concentration 0 1 m the dielectric constants slightly increased in the order of khco3 nacl and kcl however the debye length of each solute was nearly equal to 0 6 0 7 nm fig 12 suggesting that the similarity in σ for each solute can be explained by that of the debye length of the surface conversely the difference in the aforementioned parameters owing to the solute concentration may be explained by the difference in the dielectric constant for kcl based on eq 2 the dielectric constant of the solution increased with a decrease in concentration owing to the constant value of δ for kcl according to the substitution of the dielectric constants and ionic strengths of the solutions in eq 1 the debye length increased with an increase in dielectric constant of the solution thus σ increases when the debye length increases fig 12 therefore the shrinkage or thickening of edls owing to the dielectric constant of the solution determines the aforementioned parameters the difference in osmotic efficiency based on different solutions with an average concentration of 0 2 m was confirmed from the debye length perspective the results of the present study demonstrate that the effective diffusion coefficients depend on the solute type we focused on the ionic mobility which is the drift of ions owing to external forces such as an electrical potential gradient and we used the sum of the two ionic mobilities of the cation and anion this is because the salt diffusion coefficient is proportional to the sum of the ionic mobilities e g revil et al 1996 which differs for different solutes even at the same concentration the summed ionic mobility is calculated according to the relationship between the electrolyte conductivity and mobility of the ion ec c f u u where ec is the electrolyte conductivity s m 1 c is the electrolyte concentration mol m 3 f is the faraday constant 96485c mol 1 and u is the ionic mobility m2 s 1 v 1 of the cation or anion e g robinson and stokes 2002 based on the summed ionic mobility of experimental solutions the relationship between the effective diffusion coefficient and summed ionic mobility will be discussed below here we used the sum of the average ionic mobilities of the high and low concentration sides at the end of the experiment fig 13 shows the relationship between the average ionic mobility and the effective diffusion coefficient without the filtration effect the effective diffusion coefficient in this case showed a positive correlation with respect to the average ionic mobility indicating a large or small variation of the effective diffusion coefficient without the filtration effect in each solute fig 13 for example the variation in the nacl solution was large and that in the kcl and khco3 solutions was small the values of the effective diffusion coefficient increased in the order of khco3 nacl and kcl as the average ionic mobility increased from a theoretical standpoint the salt diffusion coefficient of the binary electrolyte is a function of the boltzmann constant absolute temperature elementary charge ionic mobility and valences of cations and anions known as the nernst hartley equation e g robinson and stokes 2002 the difference in the effective diffusion coefficient without the filtration effect based on different solutions was confirmed by the nernst hartley equation in addition the salt diffusion coefficient is proportional to the electrolyte conductivity which is a function of the elementary charge valences ionic mobility and ionic concentrations of cations and anions e g revil et al 1996 revil et al 1996 found that the effective diffusion coefficient of a porous medium is a function of the salt diffusion coefficient electrical formation factor porosity and a correction factor owing to electroneutrality requirements in the presence of the edl at the pore surface according to the aforementioned relationship the value of the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous medium is proportional to the electrolyte conductivity of the porewater the effective diffusion coefficients without the filtration effect estimated in this study can be compared with values reported by shackelford and daniel 1991 the ratio of the kcl diffusion coefficient 1 99 10 9 m2 s 1 to the nacl diffusion coefficient 1 61 10 9 m2 s 1 in the free solution was 1 24 the ratio of the average effective kcl diffusion coefficient 5 08 10 11 m2 s 1 to the average effective nacl diffusion coefficient 3 94 10 11 m2 s 1 in this study was 1 29 both values of the ratio of kcl to nacl are equal the ratio of the kcl diffusion coefficient to the khco3 diffusion coefficient in the free solution was 1 35 and its value in this study was 1 45 indicating that both values of the ratio of kcl to khco3 are equal therefore the effective diffusion coefficients of salts in this study are proportional to their diffusion coefficients in the free solution owing to the ionic mobility of the solution this indicates that the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous medium is controlled by the ionic mobility of the salt in the porewater to summarize the discussion the ionic mobility of the salt determines its diffusion rate 5 conclusions the intrinsic permeability k specific storage s s and effective diffusion coefficients d e for kcl and khco3 solutions and the osmotic efficiency σ of the wakkanai mudstones were determined by using sequential permeability and chemical osmosis experiments the pressure and electrical conductivity were continuously monitored during the experiments by using a pressure transducer and electrode respectively after the experiments transient state analytical solutions were derived the important observations and interpretations of this study are summarized as follows 1 the intrinsic permeability k estimated for the wakkanai mudstones ranged from 1 19 10 19 to 4 75 10 18 m2 the variation of the k values depending on the samples mainly reflected the difference in pore size distribution among individual samples and the difference in salt concentration rather than the difference in the salt type of 1 1 electrolytes 2 the osmotic efficiency σ estimated for the wakkanai mudstones ranged from 0 0035 to 0 038 reflecting 0 1 m kcl and 0 1 m khco3 the value of the osmotic efficiency tended to decrease in the order of khco3 nacl and kcl however the average osmotic efficiency of each salt did not differ depending on the salt type and porosity of the samples 3 the effective diffusion coefficients with filtration effect d e estimated for the wakkanai mudstones ranged from 2 90 10 11 to 5 89 10 11 m2 s 1 reflecting 0 1 m kcl and 0 1 m khco3 the value of the effective diffusion coefficient without the filtration effect d e increased in the order of khco3 nacl and kcl as the average ionic mobility increased the effective diffusion coefficients with the filtration effect were almost equal to the effective diffusion coefficients without the filtration effect owing to the low solute filtration caused by the semipermeability of the mudstones 4 according to the regression analysis the osmotic efficiency was inversely proportional to the intrinsic permeability acknowledgements this research project was

7115,to better understand the groundwater flow and chemistry in argillaceous formations the dependency of transport parameters such as permeability diffusion coefficient and chemical osmotic efficiency on each of the chemical species dominant in groundwater must also be understood despite its importance however little is known about the dependence of transport parameters on different types of groundwater thus we investigated transport parameters of wakkanai mudstones using three different types of electrolyte solutions here we report the relationship among the solution salt type solute concentration transport parameters and pore structure characteristics wide ranges in osmotic efficiency and intrinsic permeability 0 0035 0 14 and 1 19 10 19 to 4 75 10 18 m2 respectively reflect the difference in the solution composition based on the salt type difference in solute concentration and variation in the pore size distributions of wakkanai mudstones the effective diffusion coefficients with filtration effects at 2 98 10 11 to 5 92 10 11 m2 s 1 vary depending on salt type but remain invariant among samples indicating no difference in fluid flow path associated with small values of osmotic efficiency in contrast the osmotic efficiencies are related to differences in salt concentrations our findings indicate that salt concentration and pore structure characteristics determine not only the semipermeability of the wakkanai mudstones but also the diffusivity and permeability keywords chemical osmosis diffusion permeability pore structure salt concentration salt type 1 introduction the complex hydrogeologic properties of argillite include membrane behavior which affects semipermeability and induces chemical osmosis under a salinity gradient thus the groundwater flow system in an argillaceous formation is governed by not only topography and pressure driven flow but also by flow driven by chemical osmosis and thermo osmosis gonçalvès et al 2004 2010 2012 neuzil 2000 2013 wilson et al 2003 chemical osmosis involves flow from low to high concentration zones essentially this process describes water migration through a semipermeable membrane driven by differences in the chemical potential of the water migrating across the membrane which continues until the difference in potential energy is compensated by other potential differences such as the pressure difference e g mitchell and soga 2005 assuming that a salinity gradient exists in a formation and that the formation behaves as a semipermeable membrane chemical osmosis may generate abnormal pressures and hydraulic head profiles which could persist for tens of millions of years e g neuzil 2000 2015 the occurrence of large erratic pressures has been re examined by neuzil and provost 2009 and was discussed in tremosa et al 2012 therefore the possibility of chemical osmosis in groundwater systems of sedimentary formations should be carefully examined chemical osmosis depends on the clay mineralogy porewater chemistry and pore size distribution of a sedimentary formation e g bresler 1973 gonçalvès et al 2007 leroy and revil 2004 neuzil 2000 rahman et al 2005 takeda et al 2014 for example clay minerals have a negative surface charge and their surfaces generate electrical double layers edls e g appelo and postma 2005 when the pore space between two clay particles is small and the edls overlap repulsion occurs electrical repulsive forces generated by a negative potential field inhibit anions via migration through the pore the passage of anions is restricted when compaction decreases the pore size so that the diffuse double layers of two clay particles overlap to cause anion exclusion the distribution of electrical charges in solution enables transport of water and non charged solutes but restricts the passage of charged species through the pore network which is related to the semi permeable membrane behavior of the clay in such media osmosis can cause fluid to flow from regions of low salt concentration to those of high salt concentration where a fluid pressure build up is induced the solute concentration and ionic composition of the groundwater affect the edls on the surface of clay minerals the groundwater contains solutes with different electric charges and concentrations in addition the solutes may be spatially unevenly distributed owing to the groundwater flow system during sedimentation this means that various porewater solutes can lead to cation exchanges within the edls at the clay mineral surface correspondingly chemical osmosis depends on the porewater chemistry therefore to evaluate chemical osmosis in sedimentary formations it is necessary to determine how the differences in groundwater solutes affect this osmosis apart from the electrical characteristics of clay mineral surfaces the pore size distribution affects chemical osmosis when the dominant interconnected pore space is narrow the pore throats available for fluid flow enhance the semipermeable membrane behavior the effect of semipermeability on rocks has been investigated in several previous studies e g cey et al 2001 horseman et al 2007 neuzil 2000 rousseau gueutin et al 2010 takeda et al 2014 in most of these studies differences in nacl salt concentration were identified as driving forces of chemical osmosis however the effect of the salt type on the chemical osmosis of rocks has been discussed only by al bazali et al 2005 neuzil and person 2017 tremosa et al 2012 and villabona camacho et al 2009 these authors used the same rocks for nacl kcl and cacl2 solutions they observed variation in the osmotic efficiency values which is a parameter of semipermeability ranging from 0 non membrane to 1 perfect membrane and explained this effect by discussing the difference in mobility of these electrolytes monovalent sodium and potassium ions with small ionic radii have a higher mobility than divalent calcium ions in contrast many studies reported the effects of different salts and concentrations on the semipermeability of clay membranes consisting of different clay types such as undisturbed natural clay rocks and remolded pure clays the salts that were used in the previous research include nacl hart et al 2008 noy et al 2004 rousseau gueutin et al 2008 kcl cheng and hendry 2014 kang and shackelford 2011 malusis and shackelford 2002 tang et al 2014 2015 nahco3 garavito et al 2007 nano3 derrington et al 2006 and napo4 derrington et al 2006 these results can be summarized as follows the osmotic efficiency decreases when the solute concentration increases and increases in the concentration cause a progressively greater shrinkage of the edls of the clay particles in addition the charge of the clay surface is equal and opposite to the charge of the double layer which is distributed depending on the solute concentration of the solution cations and anions closer to the surface with increasing solute concentration balance the surface charge thus the double layer becomes thin thick at high low solute concentration a high concentration yields a highly accessible porosity for ionic transport and a leaky membrane corresponding to osmotic efficiency values close to zero moreover the osmotic efficiencies of the cation or anion species differ according to the different interactions between the solutes and the mineral surfaces therefore the salt type and concentration affect the semipermeability of geologic media similarly the type and concentration of the salt and porosity affect the permeability of geologic media e g cey et al 2001 mesri and olson 1971 mesri and olson 1971 reported the variation in permeability values using smectite illite and kaolinite pure clays for nacl or cacl2 solutions with different concentrations and void ratio values they attributed this variation to the tendency of clay to disperse or form aggregates dispersion reduces fluid flow because it creates flow channels with nearly the same size and aggregation tends to increase fluid flow owing to the existence of many small flow channels and a relatively smaller number of main flow channels cey et al 2001 reported that the hydraulic conductivity of a natural clay rock increases with an increase in pore fluid concentration which can be explained by the diffuse double layer theory these studies suggest that the type and concentration of salt in porewater or groundwater and the pore structure of geologic media affect the transport parameters through their influence on the media parameters such as microstructure and edl despite its importance however the relationship between the salt type solute concentration and transport parameters in undisturbed rocks has not been fully examined from an experimental standpoint this study focuses on the effect of different salt types and concentrations on the transport parameters of wakkanai mudstones these mudstones were previously studied by takeda et al 2014 who estimated the semipermeability permeability and diffusion coefficient based on nacl solution in the present study we performed permeability and chemical osmosis experiments on the same mudstone samples by using kcl and khco3 solutions to determine the relationship between the salt type and the transport parameters the use of the same samples is expected to have better results in the comparison of transport parameters as salt types kcl khco3 and nacl were selected based on the sensitivity of chemical osmosis of 1 1 electrolytes compared with solutions of ionic species with different valences the groundwater in this area has a nacl dominated water chemistry at depths below 250 m and an increase in water salinity with depth showing that the second most common cation and anion are k and hco3 respectively and that the content of divalent species is limited hama et al 2007 in addition the selection of divalent species is expected to cause difficulty in the experimental observation of chemical osmosis because it reduces the osmotic efficiency e g tremosa et al 2012 thus this study explores the relationship among the three aforementioned salt types the transport parameters and the pore structures of wakkanai mudstones sequential permeability and chemical osmosis experiments based on the study by takeda et al 2014 are conducted to examine the chemo osmotic hydraulic and diffusion parameters as transport parameters for each rock sample the hydraulic parameters are estimated from the permeability experiments and the chemo osmotic and diffusion parameters were estimated from the chemical osmosis experiments based on the experimental results the effects of salt type and of various kcl concentrations are discussed with respect to these three parameters for each rock sample moreover these transport parameters are discussed with respect to the pore structures of the rock samples 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 materials the samples are argillaceous rocks that were retrieved from boreholes hdb 9 and hdb 11 drilled in the marine wakkanai formation in the horonobe area of japan takeda et al 2014 previously extracted disc shaped rock samples 50 mm in diameter and 10 mm in thickness from the 80 mm diameter cores of these boreholes and performed experiments we used the same samples in the present experiment carefully observation by the unaided eye revealed no fissures or fractures in these samples the average pore radius porosity specific surface area cation exchange capacity and pore structure of the core samples are summarized in table 1 the porosity and average pore radius of the cores differ only slightly although the pore structure characteristics depend on the pore size distribution the pore size distribution revealed the presence of three groups of pore structures in these samples the first group is sample no 2 which has a distinct bimodal distribution with peaks centered at 4 5 nm and 10 30 nm the second group consists of samples nos 1 and 3 which have a slight bimodal distribution with peaks centered at 7 8 nm and 10 20 nm the third group is composed of sample nos 4 and 5 which show a clear peak at 8 nm the pore structures of the cores were characterized on the basis of different pore size distributions of pores with sizes greater than 10 nm 1 nanoscale pores 10 nm accounting for 56 67 of the total pore space 2 10 100 nm accounting for 40 30 of the total pore space bulk rock powders were analyzed by using an x ray powder diffractometer rint2500 rigaku using monochromatic cukα radiation at 40 kv and 100 ma from 2 5 to 70 the step size was 0 02 and the scan speed was 2 min 1 the clay fractions 2 μm of the mudstones were extracted by using a conventional sedimentation method according to stokes law the clay identification and procedures were based on those reported by shirozu 1988 and wada 1966 for oriented aggregate mounts of the clay fraction of the samples the clay mineral identification was confirmed by diagnosing the extent of the d spacing expansion which is indicative of certain clay minerals during subsequent treatments which included air drying and ethylene glycol treatment the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the clay fractions of the samples were obtained by using a rigaku rint2500 instrument operated at 40 kv and 100 ma from 2 to 50 to determine the d spacings of each sample the step size was 0 02 and the scan speed was 1 min 1 the features of the xrd patterns of the bulk rock and clay fractions of the samples summarized in table 2 are consistent with the mineralogy reported in hiraga and ishii 2007 the samples contain mainly opal ct quartz feldspar and layered silicate minerals the layered silicate minerals include illite chlorite and smectite pyrite is also present in the samples interstratified clay minerals were not included the bulk chemical composition of the samples was determined as follows the weight loss on ignition loi was determined for each rock powder using whole rock analysis after determining the loi sample nos 2 and 5 were analyzed for major elements at activation laboratories canada by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes in addition the fe ii content was determined by titration a lithium metaborate tetraborate fusion technique was used for the icp oes analysis the analytical errors were 0 01 that of feo was 0 1 the results show that sio2 al2o3 and loi are dominant the sum of these oxides accounts for more than 90 wt of the samples the mineralogy of the wakkanai mudstones was determined by using normative calculation combined with the xrd patterns and bulk chemical composition table 2 the normative calculation was estimated on the basis of the report by igarashi 1984 in general opal ct including amorphous material opal a is dominant the sum of the clay minerals was estimated to be 17 wt 2 2 transport parameters using nacl solution the relationship between the transport parameters and pore structures of the wakkanai mudstones based on nacl solution is described in takeda et al 2014 the values of the transport parameters obtained from takeda et al 2014 are summarized in table 2 in short variations of the intrinsic permeability k 8 92 10 20 to 1 24 10 17 m2 of the samples were recognized the variations in k values of the samples are attributed primarily to the difference in pore size distribution rather than the small range porosity at 0 29 0 33 the largest k values were observed for sample no 2 which has a bimodal pore size distribution in contrast the smallest k values were observed for sample nos 4 and 5 which show unimodal pore size distributions however the wide range in k values may be caused by the occurrence of naturally occurring internal microfissures or microfractures the wide range in osmotic efficiency at 0 0004 0 046 reflects the variation in pore size distribution of the wakkanai mudstones the largest variations in the osmotic efficiency values were observed for sample nos 4 and 5 having unimodal pore size distribution the regression analysis of the osmotic efficiency and permeability showed inversely proportional behavior in contrast a small range in effective diffusion coefficient at 3 59 4 27 10 11 m2 s 1 was observed with filtration effects an invariant osmotic efficiency with respect to the effective diffusion coefficient was determined for the wakkanai mudstones owing to their small osmotic efficiencies at 0 046 the wide variation in osmotic efficiency and pore structure characteristics of these mudstones indicates that their nanoscale pores enable semipermeability 2 3 methods the experimental methods used in the present study are described in detail in takeda et al 2014 fig 1 shows the flow of the sequential permeability and chemical osmosis experiments two experimental conditions were utilized to measure the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters first the experiments were conducted by using different salt types kcl and khco3 the samples were immersed in 0 1 m kcl or 0 1 m khco3 solutions for at least three months prior to the start of the experiments this long term immersion in the test solution enabled reliable experimental data to be obtained a short immersion could not result in equilibrium between the porewater in the sample and test solution and could cause complications in interpreting the pressure and concentration evolutions the same disc shaped rock sample was used repeatedly to perform the permeability and chemical osmosis experiments with different solutions in the first and second experiments kcl and khco3 solutions were used respectively the experimental conditions of these experiments are summarized in table 3 second experiments using kcl solutions were conducted at different solute concentrations the sample was immersed in 0 01 m and 0 1 m kcl solution the experimental conditions of the permeability and chemical osmosis experiments are summarized in table 3 the electric conductivity was calibrated against kcl or khco3 solutions of 0 01 m to 1 0 m in addition before and after the experiment we confirmed the presence of fissures or fractures by careful observation with the unaided eye the undamaged samples were used for further experiments during both experiments the reservoir solutions were circulated at a constant flow rate of 10 ml min 1 and the temperature of the incubator was set to 40 c during the permeability and chemical osmosis experiments the temperature variations were controlled within a range of 0 2 c the confining pressure was controlled to simulate the effective stress according to the depth from which each sample was retrieved however we exchanged the pressure transducer and tube in this study the pressure transducer has a measurement pressure range of 0 to 500 kpa and a precision of 0 1 fs which improved the stability of the pressure measurement the tube was a polyether ether ketone peek tube which also improved the experimental preparation the sealed volumes of the top and bottom reservoirs were measured and the compressible storage of the top and bottom reservoirs was determined by using the method proposed in song et al 2004 the results are shown in table 3 the analytical models for permeability and chemical osmosis experiments used in this study are described in detail in takeda et al 2014 the analytical solutions for sequential permeability and chemical osmosis experiments need transient state experimental data because the initial conditions for the chemical osmosis experiment must be attained after the permeability experiment the experimental and analytical protocols proposed by takeda et al 2014 are effective because they include interpretation of their experimental data thus for interpretation of the experimental data used in this study transient state analytical solutions were applied to the permeability and chemical osmosis experiments based on takeda et al 2014 the hydraulic parameters were estimated from the permeability experiments using eq 12 in takeda et al 2014 and the chemo osmotic and diffusion parameters were estimated from chemical osmosis experiments using eqs 20 and 21 in takeda et al 2014 3 results 3 1 difference in salt type fig 2 shows the downstream pressure evolution in the permeability experiments when an initial pressure difference between upstream and downstream reservoirs of 50 kpa is prescribed in general the pressure in the downstream reservoir rapidly increased immediately after the start of the experiment then slowly increased and finally reached a steady state within one day however the pressure changes owing to the flow of the nacl kcl or khco3 solution showed different trends the flow of the kcl solution was faster than that of the nacl and khco3 solutions the fitted curves are shown in fig 2 the estimated intrinsic permeability k and the specific storage s s are listed in table 4 the k values ranged from 1 19 10 19 to 4 75 10 18 m2 the estimated values are within the k range reported for wakkanai mudstones in kurikami et al 2008 and takeda et al 2014 however the k values obtained using nacl kcl and khco3 solutions for the same sample differed despite the use of the same concentration at 0 1 m for example the k value obtained using a 0 1 m kcl solution was greater than that obtained using a 0 1 m khco3 solution indicating that the permeability associated with the flow of the former is greater than that associated with the flow of the latter the relative magnitudes of the k values obtained alternatively with the 0 1 m khco3 and 0 1 m nacl solutions also differed indicating that the permeability associated with the flow using these different solutes does not depend on the porosity of the sample but on both the pore size distribution of the sample and the salt type fig 3 dependency of the k values of 0 1 m nacl on the pore size distribution was previously recognized in takeda et al 2014 in addition the variation in k value in sample no 2 was larger than that of other samples indicating that the k value of the 0 1 m khco3 solution in sample no 2 was low this might have been caused by the clogging of clay particles in a broad flow path owing to the dispersion of clay particles affected by the khco3 solution figs 4 and 5 show the downstream pressure and salt concentration evolutions in the chemical osmosis experiments when an initial concentration difference of 0 5 m between upstream and downstream reservoirs is prescribed the pressure in the downstream reservoir increased during the initial stage and then gradually decreased with a decrease in the concentration difference between the reservoir solutions fig 4 the solute concentration decreased in the downstream reservoir whereas that of the upstream reservoir increased fig 5 here we should confirm whether the solute travel is advective or diffusive experimental data using nacl demonstrated that diffusion is the dominant process in solute migration in chemical osmosis experiments takeda et al 2014 similarly based on the pressure data fig 4 and effective diffusion coefficient estimated for the wakkanai mudstones using 125i by tachi et al 2011 the peclet number for kcl and khco3 experiments which is defined as the ratio of advective to diffusive solute transport was calculated using eqs 16 and 27 in takeda et al 2014 as a result not shown in the figure the peclet numbers of the kcl and khco3 experiments were considerably smaller than 1 and were close to 0 at the quasi steady state this shows that diffusion is the dominant process in solute migration in the chemical osmosis experiments different pressure and concentration evolutions owing to chemical osmosis were observed with nacl kcl and khco3 the pressure increase by chemical osmosis using the khco3 solution was higher than that obtained using nacl or kcl solutions in all samples suggesting that the filtration effect of the electrolytes differed the fitted curves are shown in figs 4 and 5 although the fitted curves for the solute concentrations in the upstream and downstream reservoirs generally agreed well with the measured data fig 5 the fitted curves for the downstream reservoir pressure could not capture the pressure fluctuation particularly in the early stages of the experiments fig 4 the causes of this pressure fluctuations may be uneven distribution of osmotic pressure in the sample during the early stage in response to the evolution of the solute concentration in the sample the estimated effective diffusion coefficients d e and osmotic efficiencies σ are summarized in table 4 the value of d e ranged from 2 90 10 11 to 5 89 10 11 m2 s 1 the estimated values are similar to that reported for the wakkanai mudstones in takeda et al 2014 the value of d e includes the filtration effect d e 1 σ d e in the present study the value of d e without the filtration effect was considered because of the small osmotic efficiency the d e values decreased in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 the relationship between the d e values and porosity of the wakkanai mudstone samples is shown in fig 6 a for each of the three solutes the correlation coefficient between the d e value and porosity of the samples was different however the correlation between the d e values and porosity cannot be judged considering a 95 confidence interval as pointed out in takeda et al 2014 in contrast the difference in the average d e value of each salt type was statistically robust and was confirmed at the 95 confidence interval the σ value ranged from 0 00352 to 0 0376 the estimated values are similar to that reported for the wakkanai mudstones in takeda et al 2014 the estimated σ values reflect very small to small semipermeability garavito et al 2006 2007 neuzil 2000 noy et al 2004 rousseau gueutin et al 2008 the average σ value tended to increase in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 a distinct correlation between the σ value and porosity was found for each of the three solutes fig 6b however the correlation of these parameters cannot be judged considering the 95 confidence interval the difference in the average σ value of each salt type was confirmed at the 95 confidence interval when the osmotic efficiency decreased the effective diffusion coefficient increased fig 7 a however σ for khco3 was larger than that for kcl and d e for kcl was larger than that for khco3 suggesting that the transport parameters by their electrolytes differ under the same concentration difference for comparison with the wakkanai mudstone data fig 7 also shows the results of an experiment performed on callovo oxfordian argillite rousseau gueutin et al 2009 using nacl concentrations similar to those used in the experiments performed in takeda et al 2014 however all data except that for the callovo oxfordian argillite rousseau gueutin et al 2009 indicate no clear relationship between d e and σ for the wakkanai mudstones based on the 95 confidence interval this may be explained by a small variation in the effective diffusion coefficient or small solute filtration owing to the semipermeability of the wakkanai mudstones σ 0 05 in addition the relationships between osmotic efficiency and porosity fig 6b and between intrinsic permeability and porosity fig 3 showed an opposite trend suggesting that an increase in osmotic efficiency is associated with a decrease in intrinsic permeability the inverse proportionality between k and σ was previously assumed by takeda et al 2014 who fitted the k σ data for nacl using a power law function their results showed a very good inverse correlation between σ and k with a correlation coefficient of 0 96 the regression curve in fig 7b is very close to the datapoint of the callovo oxfordian argillite rousseau gueutin et al 2009 based on the observation mentioned above concerns are present as to whether the k σ data for kcl and khco3 in the present study follow the relation the k σ data for kcl and khco3 were distributed around the regression curve the data for kcl or khco3 followed the line of inverse proportionality between k and σ the cause of the similarity based on the solutes is described in the section 4 3 2 solute concentration effects fig 8 a shows data obtained from permeability experiments of sample no 4 and the fitted curves the pressure in the downstream reservoir rapidly increased immediately after the start of the experiment then slowly increased and finally reached a steady state after 10 h however the difference in kcl concentrations cannot be attributed to the pressure change for example the maximum pressure difference increased in the order of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 9 m and 0 09 m in concentration difference the values estimated for the intrinsic permeability k and specific storage s s are summarized in table 4 the k values ranged from 3 31 10 19 to 5 45 10 19 m2 and the estimated values are within the above experimental data range fig 9 a shows the relationship between the kcl concentration of the permeability experiments and the k values of the wakkanai mudstone samples indicating that the k value obtained with the 0 01 m kcl solution was smaller than that obtained with the 0 1 m kcl solution fig 8b and c show data measured during the chemical osmosis experiments of sample no 4 and the fitted curves similar to the aforementioned results the pressure in the downstream reservoir increased during the initial stage and then gradually decreased as the concentration difference between reservoir solutions decreased the pressure of the 0 09 m kcl solution or the difference between high and low solute concentrations was the highest except for the result of the 0 09 m kcl solution the pressure increased with an increase in the solute concentration difference the values estimated for the effective diffusion coefficient d e and osmotic efficiency σ are summarized in table 4 the d e values ranged from 3 05 10 11 to 4 67 10 11 m2 s 1 the estimated values are within the aforementioned range of experimental data fig 9b shows the relationships between the average high and low concentrations at the end of the experiment and the d e values of the wakkanai mudstone samples the d e values increased with an increase in average concentration and were constant at 4 7 10 11 m2 s 1 beyond a 0 2 m average concentration the σ values of sample no 4 ranged from 0 0105 to 0 143 the estimated values are within the aforementioned experimental data range fig 9c shows the relationship between the average high and low concentrations at the end of the experiment and the σ values of the wakkanai mudstone samples the σ values decreased with an increase in average concentration and were constant at 0 012 beyond a 0 2 m average concentration the d e increased with an increase in average concentration indicating a positive correlation the k value tended to increase with an increase in average concentration these relationships support the results of previous studies for example revil et al 2005 showed increasing d e with concentration and mesri and olson 1971 showed increasing k with concentration in contrast the σ value increased with a decrease in average concentration indicating a negative correlation this relationship was evidenced by bresler 1973 who showed a decrease with increasing concentration thus the correlation between σ and k or d e is expected to be negative according to these observations and those of previous studies the three parameters are closely related suggesting that they are affected by the solute concentration 4 discussion the experimental results show that chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters vary depending on the salt type solute concentration and pore size distribution for each of the wakkanai mudstone samples the correlation of these parameters is conceptually shown in fig 10 first sample specific pore structure characteristics govern the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters the differences were most pronounced in the pore size distribution for example samples with a bimodal distribution of small and large pore sizes showed low chemo osmotic parameters and high diffusive and hydraulic parameters in contrast samples with a unimodal distribution of small pore sizes showed high chemo osmotic parameters and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters second the difference in salt type affects the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters for example the average σ value increased in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 the d e values decreased in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 the k values generally decreased in the order of kcl nacl and khco3 that is experiments using the kcl solution showed low chemo osmotic parameters and high diffusive and hydraulic parameters in contrast samples using the khco3 solution showed high chemo osmotic parameters and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters third the difference in solute concentration affects the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters for the kcl solution the σ d e values decreased increased exponentially with an increase in kcl concentration the k values were smaller under low kcl concentration than high kcl concentration that is experiments with a low solute concentration showed high chemo osmotic parameters and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters and vice versa based on the aforementioned observations low chemo osmotic parameters and high diffusive and hydraulic parameters were obtained from experiments with samples having a bimodal distribution of small and large pore sizes kcl or nacl as the salt type or high solute concentration in contrast high chemo osmotic parameters and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters were obtained from experiments with samples having a unimodal distribution of small pore sizes khco3 or nacl as the salt type or low solute concentration the relationship of these parameters indicates that chemo osmotic and hydraulic or diffusive parameters are negatively correlated these correlations suggest that chemo osmotic and diffusive and hydraulic parameters are related to the width of the path available for fluid flow in wakkanai mudstone samples this is because a narrow flow path resists fluid flow and a broad flow path is less resistant to fluid flow that is a narrow path leads to a high chemo osmotic parameter and low diffusive and hydraulic parameters and vice versa thus it is easy to understand that the difference in pore size distribution in the wakkanai mudstone samples led to these different observations the observations based on the differences in the salt type and solute concentration will be discussed in the following section the width of the path available for fluid flow may be related to the swelling or shrinking of clay minerals kwon et al 2004 sparks 1995 sposito et al 1999 and overlap or collapse of edls on the surfaces of the minerals e g cey et al 2001 differences in salt type and solute concentration may affect the width of the path controlling the fluid flow in the pore structure if the pore throats available for fluid flow and solute diffusion are modified by local clay swelling or shrinking at the clay fluid interfaces however based on the clay content in table 2 we consider that the possibility of flow path shrinkage owing to swelling is low because of the low amount of clay mineral swelling in the sample thus alteration of the pores and pore throats in the sample caused by swelling cannot be considered in this study alternatively the pore throat width available for fluid flow and solute diffusion can be modified by a change in edl thickness at the clay fluid interface which is altered considerably depending on the salt type and the solute concentration e g cey et al 2001 when the salt type or magnitude of the solute concentration leads to thinner edls the pores and pore throats of the sample widen as a result of the low amount of overlap of these thin edls the shrinkage of edls reduces the anion exclusion effect which repels the anions widens the diffusion path of the solute and leads to a porosity closer to the original value e g rousseau gueutin et al 2008 2009 tang et al 2014 in contrast when the salt type or magnitude of the solute concentration leads to thicker edls the pores and pore throats of the sample narrow owing to the high amount of overlap of the thick edls consequently the thickness of edls affects the fluid flow and solute diffusion which changes the chemo osmotic diffusive and hydraulic parameters based on the k and σ values for solute concentration effects shown in fig 9 and table 4 the edl thickness by kcl is suggested to reduce with an increase in concentration however based on the k d e and σ values at each sample for different salt types in table 4 the edl thickness does not change in the multiple comparisons for each parameter of the k d e and σ values by salt type to determine how the edl thickness varies depending on the salt type and solute concentration we discuss the debye length instead of the edl thickness on the surface of the charged mineral which is a good approximate of the latter e g stumm and morgan 1996 because the charge profiles in the edl depend on the debye length the debye length 1 κ is the classical parameter in the domain of colloid and interface science and provides an estimate of the thickness of the edl 1 1 κ ε r ε 0 k b t 2 n a e 2 i 10 3 where ε r is the dielectric constant of the solution ε 0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum 8 9 10 12 f m 1 k b is the boltzmann s constant 1 38 10 23 j k 1 t is the temperature in k n a is the avogadro number 6 02 1023 mol 1 e is the elementary charge 1 6 10 23 c and i is the ionic strength of the solution mol l 1 the dielectric constant of the solution linearly decreases as the electrolyte concentration increases hasted et al 1948 which is described by the following relationship of the dielectric constant solution concentration c mol l 1 and a specific constant δ for each solute 2 ε r ε w 2 δ c where ε w is the static dielectric constant of water 78 30 at 25 c eq 2 indicates that under the same concentration the value of ε r differs depending on the value of δ for each solute therefore the value of δ characterizing each solute can determine the debye length for different electrolyte solutions at the same ionic strength and temperature although the δ values for nacl and kcl were obtained by hasted et al 1948 to our knowledge the δ value for khco3 has not been determined thus far accordingly the δ value for khco3 may be estimated as follows the relation between the constant δ and the free solution salt diffusion coefficient for each solute is shown in fig 11 the figure shows a positive correlation indicating that the constant δ increases with an increase in the free solution salt diffusion coefficient based on the relationship between the constant δ and the salt diffusion coefficient we can estimate the constant δ for khco3 thus we need to obtain the salt diffusion coefficient of khco3 the salt diffusion coefficients can be calculated by using the nernst hartley equation 3 d 0 rt f 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 z 2 λ 1 0 λ 2 0 λ 1 0 λ 2 0 where d 0 is the salt diffusion coefficient at infinite dilution r is the gas law constant and f is the faraday constant λ1 0 and λ2 0 are the infinite dilution equivalent conductance of the ions forming the binary electrolyte and z 1 and z 2 are the values of the respective ionic charges shackelford and daniel 1991 reported the free solution salt diffusion coefficients for nacl and kcl as 1 61 10 9 and 1 99 10 9 m2 s 1 respectively similarly estimated the free solution salt diffusion coefficient for khco3 by using the nernst hartley equation based on the relationship between the salt diffusion coefficient and electrolyte conductivity which yielded a value of 1 47 10 9 m2 s 1 once the value of the free solution salt diffusion coefficient for khco3 was calculated we were able to estimate the constant δ for khco3 based on the relationship between the constant δ and the salt diffusion coefficient to be 6 6 therefore the dielectric constants ε r of each solution which are required for this study can be obtained under the same concentration 0 1 m the dielectric constants slightly increased in the order of khco3 nacl and kcl however the debye length of each solute was nearly equal to 0 6 0 7 nm fig 12 suggesting that the similarity in σ for each solute can be explained by that of the debye length of the surface conversely the difference in the aforementioned parameters owing to the solute concentration may be explained by the difference in the dielectric constant for kcl based on eq 2 the dielectric constant of the solution increased with a decrease in concentration owing to the constant value of δ for kcl according to the substitution of the dielectric constants and ionic strengths of the solutions in eq 1 the debye length increased with an increase in dielectric constant of the solution thus σ increases when the debye length increases fig 12 therefore the shrinkage or thickening of edls owing to the dielectric constant of the solution determines the aforementioned parameters the difference in osmotic efficiency based on different solutions with an average concentration of 0 2 m was confirmed from the debye length perspective the results of the present study demonstrate that the effective diffusion coefficients depend on the solute type we focused on the ionic mobility which is the drift of ions owing to external forces such as an electrical potential gradient and we used the sum of the two ionic mobilities of the cation and anion this is because the salt diffusion coefficient is proportional to the sum of the ionic mobilities e g revil et al 1996 which differs for different solutes even at the same concentration the summed ionic mobility is calculated according to the relationship between the electrolyte conductivity and mobility of the ion ec c f u u where ec is the electrolyte conductivity s m 1 c is the electrolyte concentration mol m 3 f is the faraday constant 96485c mol 1 and u is the ionic mobility m2 s 1 v 1 of the cation or anion e g robinson and stokes 2002 based on the summed ionic mobility of experimental solutions the relationship between the effective diffusion coefficient and summed ionic mobility will be discussed below here we used the sum of the average ionic mobilities of the high and low concentration sides at the end of the experiment fig 13 shows the relationship between the average ionic mobility and the effective diffusion coefficient without the filtration effect the effective diffusion coefficient in this case showed a positive correlation with respect to the average ionic mobility indicating a large or small variation of the effective diffusion coefficient without the filtration effect in each solute fig 13 for example the variation in the nacl solution was large and that in the kcl and khco3 solutions was small the values of the effective diffusion coefficient increased in the order of khco3 nacl and kcl as the average ionic mobility increased from a theoretical standpoint the salt diffusion coefficient of the binary electrolyte is a function of the boltzmann constant absolute temperature elementary charge ionic mobility and valences of cations and anions known as the nernst hartley equation e g robinson and stokes 2002 the difference in the effective diffusion coefficient without the filtration effect based on different solutions was confirmed by the nernst hartley equation in addition the salt diffusion coefficient is proportional to the electrolyte conductivity which is a function of the elementary charge valences ionic mobility and ionic concentrations of cations and anions e g revil et al 1996 revil et al 1996 found that the effective diffusion coefficient of a porous medium is a function of the salt diffusion coefficient electrical formation factor porosity and a correction factor owing to electroneutrality requirements in the presence of the edl at the pore surface according to the aforementioned relationship the value of the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous medium is proportional to the electrolyte conductivity of the porewater the effective diffusion coefficients without the filtration effect estimated in this study can be compared with values reported by shackelford and daniel 1991 the ratio of the kcl diffusion coefficient 1 99 10 9 m2 s 1 to the nacl diffusion coefficient 1 61 10 9 m2 s 1 in the free solution was 1 24 the ratio of the average effective kcl diffusion coefficient 5 08 10 11 m2 s 1 to the average effective nacl diffusion coefficient 3 94 10 11 m2 s 1 in this study was 1 29 both values of the ratio of kcl to nacl are equal the ratio of the kcl diffusion coefficient to the khco3 diffusion coefficient in the free solution was 1 35 and its value in this study was 1 45 indicating that both values of the ratio of kcl to khco3 are equal therefore the effective diffusion coefficients of salts in this study are proportional to their diffusion coefficients in the free solution owing to the ionic mobility of the solution this indicates that the effective diffusion coefficient of the porous medium is controlled by the ionic mobility of the salt in the porewater to summarize the discussion the ionic mobility of the salt determines its diffusion rate 5 conclusions the intrinsic permeability k specific storage s s and effective diffusion coefficients d e for kcl and khco3 solutions and the osmotic efficiency σ of the wakkanai mudstones were determined by using sequential permeability and chemical osmosis experiments the pressure and electrical conductivity were continuously monitored during the experiments by using a pressure transducer and electrode respectively after the experiments transient state analytical solutions were derived the important observations and interpretations of this study are summarized as follows 1 the intrinsic permeability k estimated for the wakkanai mudstones ranged from 1 19 10 19 to 4 75 10 18 m2 the variation of the k values depending on the samples mainly reflected the difference in pore size distribution among individual samples and the difference in salt concentration rather than the difference in the salt type of 1 1 electrolytes 2 the osmotic efficiency σ estimated for the wakkanai mudstones ranged from 0 0035 to 0 038 reflecting 0 1 m kcl and 0 1 m khco3 the value of the osmotic efficiency tended to decrease in the order of khco3 nacl and kcl however the average osmotic efficiency of each salt did not differ depending on the salt type and porosity of the samples 3 the effective diffusion coefficients with filtration effect d e estimated for the wakkanai mudstones ranged from 2 90 10 11 to 5 89 10 11 m2 s 1 reflecting 0 1 m kcl and 0 1 m khco3 the value of the effective diffusion coefficient without the filtration effect d e increased in the order of khco3 nacl and kcl as the average ionic mobility increased the effective diffusion coefficients with the filtration effect were almost equal to the effective diffusion coefficients without the filtration effect owing to the low solute filtration caused by the semipermeability of the mudstones 4 according to the regression analysis the osmotic efficiency was inversely proportional to the intrinsic permeability acknowledgements this research project was

7116,colloidal suspension flows in porous media occur in numerous areas of environmental chemical and petroleum engineering the main processes are capture and detachment of particles yielding permeability decline we developed a governing system of transport equations with particle detachment kinetics where the detachment by high velocities is instant due to flow incompressibility and the detachment by decreasing the fluid salinity is delayed due to micro scale diffusion the system allows for a semi analytical solution for axi symmetric low salinity water injection with fines migration the model exhibits instant fines mobilization at the beginning of injection by drag force fines release with delay behind the salinity front by electrostatic force and the interaction of two concentration waves the model can be used for laboratory based injectivity decline prediction during injection of water in aquifers and oilfields where the injected and formation water compositions

reservoir particles can detach and become suspended in the injected fluid the suspended particles strain in pore throats as they are carried through the pore space in the case where the particles have sizes comparable to the pore throats straining results in a significant decline in the permeability of the porous media this process is referred to as fines migration and poses a serious risk to the capability of injection wells to supply fluid to the reservoir fines migration has been shown to have a significant impact on the injectivity of oil wells barkman et al 1975 and of freshwater storage wells prommer et al 2013 any operations involving porous media that contains fine particles that are susceptible to both detachment and straining are potentially prone to fines migration example applications include groundwater flows kaplan and muñoz carpena 2014 and contaminant transport zhang et al 2016 decision making during the injection of foreign water into aquifers and oil fields for displacement storage or disposal purposes is based on numerical and analytical modelling at the reservoir scale hayek 2014 hayek 2015 the rheological relationships used for this modelling are determined by matching laboratory and micro scale modelling mirabolghasemi et al 2015 modelling fines migration required descriptions of the processes of detachment migration and straining which are shown schematically in fig 1 particle detachment in response to changes to the flow conditions is described by the total concentration of detached particles and the rate of particle detachment it is helpful to imagine particles that remain attached under any flow conditions to be in a state of equilibrium certain changes to the flow conditions result in a shift in the equilibrium and a consequent detachment of particles in describing the nature of this equilibrium some authors have adopted empirical equations kuo and matijevic 1979 while others have neglected the equilibrium altogether vardoulakis et al 1996 resulting in the detachment of all in situ particles more recent approaches have focused on the forces acting on particles yuan and shapiro 2011 zeinijahromi and bedrikovetsky 2016 the balance of these forces often assumed to be in the form of a torque balance relates the prediction of particle detachment to state variables such as the fluid velocity or salinity through established relations for the acting forces the two primary forces acting on attached particles are the hydrodynamic drag force fd and the electrostatic force fe additional forces such as the lifting gravitational or brownian forces are neglected from this discussion as they have been shown to be negligible for the conditions of fines detachment in natural reservoirs kalantariasl and bedrikovetsky 2013 the remaining two forces are shown acting on an attached particle alongside their respective lever arms ld and ln in fig 1 the mechanical equilibrium of the attached particle is determined by the balance of the torques generated by these forces bedrikovetsky et al 2011 sasidharan et al 2017 1 f d u l d f e γ p h θ l n where u is the fluid velocity γ is the fluid salinity and θ is the temperature fines detachment occurs when the detaching torque generated by the drag force exceeds the attaching torque generated by the attractive electrostatic force higher fluid velocities result in a higher drag force goldman et al 1967 and hence increase the extent of particle detachment zheng et al 2014 similarly the electrostatic force decreases with decreasing fluid salinity khilar et al 1983 shen et al 2018 or increasing ph kia et al 1986 patil et al 2011 resulting in more particle detachment this explains why low salinity waterflooding operations are particularly prone to formation damage resulting from fines migration higher temperatures have also been shown to decrease the electrostatic force you et al 2015 which is important when injecting into deep reservoirs or during geothermal operations you et al 2016 applying the torque balance condition to all particles within the porous medium allows the derivation of a macro scale equation relating the flow conditions to the attached particle concentration this function is referred to as the critical retention function 2 σ cr u γ p h θ in natural reservoir rocks properties such as pore size particle size and geometry among others will be non uniform thus the properties which determine the condition of mechanical equilibrium 1 will be stochastically distributed the torque balance can determine whether each particle is attached based on their own properties the population of all particles whose mechanical equilibrium favours detachment gives the attached concentration given here as the critical retention function therefore despite the non uniformity of micro scale parameters the function 2 is still valid in most experimental studies of fines migration the flow conditions are controlled to study the effect of changing one variable on the attached concentration however during uni axial flows such as during injection operations the fluid velocity is a decreasing function of the distance from the wellbore as such a continuous relation between the attached concentration and the fluid velocity is required the critical retention function satisfies this requirement previous studies have demonstrated a significant delay in the response of attached oleic particles to changes in the fluid salinity mahani et al 2015 the authors argue that diffusive processes slow the effect of decreasing salinity on altering the salinity between oil particles and the pore surface thus delaying the detachment of these droplets a similar argument will apply to the detachment of fines from the pore surface and therefore a delay in particle detachment should be expected such a delay has been noted in several experimental works gravelle et al 2011 pazmino et al 2014 as a result many authors have adopted a first order kinetics relation to describe particle detachment due to the injection of low salinity water gravelle et al 2011 grolimund and borkovec 2006 russell and bedrikovetski 2018 on the contrary some authors assert that particle detachment by velocity is instantaneous based on the notion that changes to the fluid velocity will instantly affect the drag force acting on particles yang et al 2016 thus the kinetics of particle detachment should be evaluated in conjunction with the cause of the detachment it follows that in scenarios where particle detachment can occur by either salinity or velocity such as during the injection of low salinity water a single expression for detachment kinetics will be inadequate nonetheless existing models for fines migration due to low salinity water injection make use of a single particle detachment kinetics regime the purpose of this work is to present a mathematical model for fines migration in uni axial coordinates that separately describes the kinetics of particle detachment due to changes in both velocity and salinity the structure of the paper is as follows the assumptions and governing equations for the mathematical model are presented in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively a semi analytical solution for this system is derived in section 2 3 section 2 4 presents the equations for calculating injectivity and a specific form of the critical retention is provided in section 2 5 section 3 presents a laboratory study of fines migration the results of which are treated in section 4 section 5 presents predictions of injectivity decline based on the results of the treatment of the laboratory data a discussion of the model is presented in section 6 and section 7 concludes the paper 2 mathematical model in the current section a mathematical model is presented to describe fines migration during single phase uni axial flow 2 1 assumptions of the model both the fluid and particles are assumed to be incompressible in addition particle and fluid volumes are assumed to be additive during detachment and straining suspended particles are assumed to move through the porous space with a velocity smaller than the fluid velocity oliveira et al 2014 3 u p α u where up is the particle velocity u is the fluid velocity and α is drift delay factor which is significantly less than one the discrepancy between the particle and fluid velocities follows from rolling and sliding of the suspended particles along the pore walls particle straining is assumed to be an irreversible process the strained concentration is also assumed to be negligibly small compared to the number of straining vacancies within the rock particle attachment due to electrostatic attraction is ignored as outlined above particle detachment can occur due to an increase in fluid velocity or a decrease in the fluid salinity changes to the fluid salinity are assumed to have a delayed effect on the detachment of particles this assumption follows from the diffusion limited ion transport between the bulk solution and the solution between the particle and the grain mahani et al 2015 the latter governs the electrostatic force and hence the critical retention function changes to the fluid velocity are however assumed to have an instantaneous effect on particle detachment finally both particle and salt diffusion dispersion are ignored as these processes are assumed to be negligible compared to their respective advective fluxes polyanin and dilman 1994 2 2 governing equations following the assumptions outlined in the previous section we now present the system of equation describing fines migration in uni axial flow with delayed particle detachment the uni axial incompressible flow results in a fluid velocity varying with radial distance 4 u q 2 π r where q is the volumetric injection flow rate per unit formation thickness and r is the radial coordinate the mass balance of suspended strained and

the porosity c is the suspended particle concentration σs is the strained particle concentration and σa is the attached particle concentration the straining rate is assumed to be proportional to the incoming suspended particle concentration 6 σ s t α λ c q 2 π r where λ is the filtration coefficient the assumption of a small strained concentration compared to the number of straining sites leads to a constant λ altoe et al 2006 the transport of salt in the reservoir is governed by the mass balance equation for the electrolyte 7 ϕ γ t q 2 π r γ r 0 following the assumptions in section 2 1 any description of the kinetics of particle detachment should satisfy the following statements firstly the attached concentration should be governed by the critical retention function which itself is a function of the fluid salinity and velocity secondly the particle detachment rate should be infinite with respect to changes to velocity and finite with respect to changes to salinity to satisfy these requirements we introduce the pseudo salinity γ such that 8 σ a r t σ cr u γ thus the attached concentration is governed by the velocity and pseudo salinity the pseudo salinity is equal to the fluid salinity after some delay time τ 9 γ x t τ γ x t by assuming a constant delay time we can use a first order taylor s series approximation to obtain the rate equation bernasconi 1976 10 τ γ t γ γ this equation which holds for small delay times τ t describes the rate at which changes to the fluid salinity translate into changes to the pseudo salinity under this formulation abrupt changes to the velocity translate to abrupt changes in the attached concentration however abrupt changes to the salinity have a gradual effect on particle detachment as required finally the relationship between the strained concentration and the rock permeability is given by a first order taylor series approximation 11 k o k σ s 1 β σ s where k0 is the initial permeability and β is the formation damage coefficient substituting this equation into darcy s law yields 12 q 2 π r k 0 μ 1 β σ s p r where μ is the fluid viscosity and p is the fluid pressure the system of eqs 5 8 10 and 12 describes the 6

suspended and strained particles 20 t 0 γ 1 c 0 s s 0 the attached concentration begins at some initial value 21 s a s ai the boundary condition for this problem is applied at the wellbore radius the injected fluid has salinity γinj and contains no suspended particles 22 r r w x x w γ 0 c 0 the boundary condition for the strained particle concentration follows from substituting boundary condition 22 into eq 15 and integrating this yields 23 s s x w t 0 2 3 solution the equation for salt transport de couples from the system 14 16 18 19 and so can be solved separately using the method of characteristics the solution separates for the two regions behind and ahead of the injected salinity front x xw t the final solution is 24 γ x t 1 x x w t 0 x x w t the discontinuity along the salinity front is a consequence of neglecting diffusion the pseudo salinity can then be solved by substituting the solution for the salinity into eq 18 and integrating by separation of variables the initial condition used for the pseudo salinity is the same as that for the salinity ahead of the salinity front the solution is 25 γ 1 eq 18 implies that the pseudo salinity is continuous across the solution space as such eq 25 can be used as the initial condition ahead of the salinity front 26 t x γ 1 using this condition to solve eq 18 yields the solution behind the salinity front 27 γ e x t ε hence an immediate decrease in the salinity along the salinity front x xw t results in an exponential decline in the pseudo salinity from γ 1 to γ 0 next the particle mass balance eq 14 and the straining rate eq 15 are used to solve for the suspended particle concentration the resulting partial differential equation pde is 28 c t α c x α λ c 2 x s a t the solution space is naturally divided into three regions shown in fig 2 ahead of the salinity front x xw t region 0 the intermediate region between the salinity front and the suspended particle front t x xw αt region i and the region behind the suspended particle front αt x xw region ii the method of characteristics can be used to derive the solution for each of these regions polyanin and zaitsev 2011 polyanin and manzhirov 2007 tikhonov and smarskii 2011 in region 0 evaluating the pde 28 along parametric curves given by 29 dt dx 1 α reduces the pde to an ordinary differential equation ode 30 dc dx λ c 2 x 1 α s a t the initial condition for this region is given along the x axis due to the assumptions that the fluid is incompressible and that particle detachment due to velocity occurs instantaneously particle detachment by velocity at the initial salinity must be incorporated into the initial conditions as such on the x axis the attached concentration is 31 s a x t 0 0 s cr γ 1 u x 0 0 s cr γ 1 u x 0 0 s

pseudo salinity and fluid velocity are independent of time within region 0 and so the detachment rate in eq 30 is zero integrating eq 30 subject to initial condition 20 yields the solution for the suspended concentration ahead of the salinity front 33 c e λ x x α t s ai s a x t 0 the solution for region 0 along the salinity front serves as an initial condition for region i it is first necessary to demonstrate that the suspended concentration is continuous along this front to do so we make use of a mass balance condition derived from eq 14 bedrikovetsky 1993 34 c s a s s d α c where the square brackets indicate the change in a variable across the curve with slope d eqs 15 and 25 27 respectively demonstrate that for all positive x t the strained and attached concentrations are continuous therefore along the salinity front we have 35 c α c for α 1 the solution follows 36 c 0 thus the suspended concentration is continuous along the salinity front in region i the characteristic curves are given by 37 dx dt α along these curves the pde 28 reduces to 38 dc dt α λ c 2 x s a t eq 37 can be solved to give the equation for the characteristics 39 x x 0 α t t 0 where the set of points xw x0 t0 define the location where the initial condition is given for this region the initial condition is provided along the salinity front as such we have 40 x w x 0 t 0 so 41 x α

performing the integration and making use of the boundary condition 22 results in 45 c e λ x α x w x e λ x s a x t x t d x equations for the attached and suspended concentrations can be found in table 1 once the suspended concentration is known the strained concentration can be obtained by integrating eq 15 2 4 injectivity given any strained concentration profile the dimensionless pressure drop can be calculated by integrating eq 19 the impedance is then calculated by normalising the dimensionless pressure drop by its initial value 46 j q 0 q δ p δ p 0 δ p δ p 0 where the subscript 0 indicates the initial value prior to any damage in order to calculate a dimensional output of the model it is necessary to impose a boundary condition at the wellbore the simplest case is the condition of constant injection rate under this condition the pressure drop between the wellbore and the reservoir boundary is calculated as 47 r w r e dp q μ 2 π k 0 r w r e 1 β ϕ s s 2 x d x which reduces to 48 p r w p r e δ p t q μ 2 π k 0 ln r e r w β ϕ x r w x r e s s 2 x d x another common constraint on injection conditions is to maintain a constant bottom hole pressure to maximise injection rate it is often maintained at a value just below the formation fracture pressure rose et al 1989 fines migration will then result in a decrease of the injection rate over time the inclusion of a variable rate function q t highlights a key assumption used in the solution procedure in section 2 3 in order to de couple the modified darcy s law eq 19 from the rest of the system it is necessary to assume that particle detachment is governed by a single injection rate for the case of constant injection rate this poses no problem but for constant bottom hole pressure the decrease in injection rate violates this assumption in order to make use of the model to predict a decrease in injection rate we make an additional assumption that particle detachment is determined only by the initial injection rate under this assumption the equations governing the fine particle concentrations and darcy s law can still be separated and the analysis presented in section 2 3 still holds after calculating the strained concentration eq 12 can be integrated and re arranged to obtain the expression for the injection rate 49 q t 2 π k 0 p r w p r e μ ln r e r w β ϕ x r w x r e s s 2 x d x for the case of constant pressure drop the relationship between the time and the dimensionless time given in eq 13 is not known until the injection rate has been determined as such it is easier to perform calculations in dimensionless coordinates to calculate q t and subsequently calculate the relationship t t from eq 13 taking the derivative of this expression with respect to time yields 50 dt dt q t ϕ π r n 2 evaluating the derivative using a first order taylor series approximation yields a simple iterative formula 51 t n t n 1 t n t n 1 ϕ π r n 2 q t n 2 5 example form of the critical retention function all equations thus far have been presented for any form of the critical retention function σcr u γ for the purposes of discussing the model we now present a simple form for this function the dependency of the critical retention function on the fluid velocity has been discussed previously bedrikovetsky et al 2011 the resulting critical retention function takes the form of a parabola 52 σ cr u σ 0 1 u u m 2 where σ0 is the limit of the critical retention function with zero fluid velocity and um is the maximum velocity above which no more fine particles are detached the quadratic form of the critical retention function follows from the velocity dependence of the drag force acting on attached particles goldman et al 1967 the dependency of the critical retention function on the fluid salinity follows from the dependency of the electrostatic force on the salinity a simple and general form for this dependency has not been well developed for the purposes of fines migration as such we propose a simplification in which the maximum velocity um varies linearly with the fluid salinity 53 u m u m γ u m γ γ inj γ u m γ γ i u m γ γ inj u m 0 γ u m 1 u m 0 in dimensionless coordinates the critical retention function then takes the form 54 s cr u γ σ 0 ϕ 1 q 2 π r n 2 x u m 0 u m 1 u m 0 γ 2 the critical retention function is then characterised by the three variables σ0 um0 and um1 a more complex description of the critical retention function may be required for describing particle detachment in some conditions regardless eq 54 is used in the remainder of this work to illustrate the behaviour of the model based on this formulation the parameter set required to characterise fines migration is then α λ β τ σ0 σai um1 um0 3 laboratory study in this section a laboratory study is presented that has been designed to characterise the response of a sample porous media to low salinity water a successful characterisation will result in reliable estimates of the parameters outlined in section 2 5 3 1 materials rock and fluids the rocks used in this study were artificially created sand kaolinite sandpacks the use of artificial cores provides significant confidence in the reproducibility of the cores and hence allows multiple tests to be interpreted as if they were performed on the same core the sand used in the study consisted of more than 99 silica and was sieved prior to use to constrain the particle size distribution a washing procedure outlined in russell et al 2017 was performed to remove impurities on the sand surface and enhance the reproducibility of the sandpacks the kaolinite used in this study was analytical grade kaolinite powder which was dried at 60 c prior to weighing to remove excess water a fixed mass of 85 g was used for the sandpacks and for both cores the kaolinite mass fraction was 10 the sand kaolinite mixture was wet slightly with high salinity water 0 6 mol l nacl before being compacted in the core holder the homogeneous distribution of clay across the core and the reproducibility of the procedure were outlined in russell et al 2017 3 2 apparatus the experimental study on fines migration was carried out using a constant rate coreflooding apparatus with real time pressure measurements a schematic and photograph of the set up used in the study is provided in fig 3 a complete description of each component of the set up is provided in the caption of this figure in brief the injection solutions were provided to the core with constant injection rate by the injection pump while the differential pressure transmitters measured the pressure difference between the core inlet and outlet the pressure difference measurements were recorded in real time using data acquisition software samples were collected at the effluent and then analysed using a particle counter to determine the suspended particle concentration 3 3 laboratory procedure the laboratory procedure began by injecting each core with 0 6 mol l nacl at a low flow rate 0 2 ml min which corresponds to linear velocity u 2 93 10 6 m s to fully saturate the core the high salinity fluid and low flow rate were chosen to promote attachment of the kaolinite to the sand grains and to minimise particle detachment during saturation after 24 h the injected solution was changed to the test salinity which was then maintained for the remainder of each test the two cores were injected with 0 01 mol l and 0 001 mol l nacl these salinities cover the range of slightly brackish water to fresh water that is typical for fresh water aquifers prommer et al 2013 after an additional 24 h the test began by increasing the injection velocity during each stage the velocity was held constant and the pressure drop across the core and effluent suspended particle concentration were measured after 24 h which was sufficient in all cases for complete stabilisation of the pressure drop the velocity was increased and the process repeated the injection rates used in each test were 1 5 10 15 20 30 40 and 50 ml min which have respective superficial velocities 1 47 10 5 7 34 10 5 1 47 10 4 2 2 10 4 2 93 10 4 4 40 10 4 5 87 10 4 and 7 34 10 4 m s the fluid velocity range was designed to encompass velocities that might be encountered in the near wellbore and far field regions during injection operations 4 treatment of laboratory data the data sets obtained from the tests were the pressure drop and outlet concentration curves for each injection stage these were fit with a 1 d model for fines migration with delayed detachment in linear coordinates this model is analogous to the system 5 8 10 12 with a constant fluid velocity along the core the output of this fitting procedure was the model parameters α τ β λ and δσcr the latter describes the difference in the critical retention function at the velocity of the current stage and that of the previous stage the set of these values for each injection stage facilitates the construction of the critical retention function against the injection velocity these curves for both cores have been constructed and fit with the theoretical form given by eq 52 experimental and theoretical curves are presented in fig 4 the experimental points show good agreement with the theoretical form of the critical retention function the parameter values obtained from fitting were σ0 0 01 m 0 01205 σ0 0 001 m 0 01178 um 0 01 m 0 001622 m s and um 0 001 m 0 0008782 m s the effect of salinity is captured in the different values of um where a higher velocity is required to detach all particles in the presence of a higher salinity for the calculation of injectivity decline the value of σ0 was taken as the average of the two obtained from experiments the other model parameters obtained from fitting the experimental data varied between injection cycles so average values were taken from these ranges the parameters which are present in traditional models for fines migration α λ β δσcr lie within ranges of parameters reported in the literature al abduwani et al 2005 bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 oliveira et al 2014 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2015 the complete set of parameters used in the calculations is presented in table 2 5 predictions of wellbore injectivity in this section predictions of wellbore injectivity both for the conditions of constant injection rate and constant bottom hole pressure are presented the calculations for injectivity decline have been performed for three different initial bottom hole pressures pwf this value determines the initial injection rate which for all calculations determines the detachment of particles the three values of pwf 4000 5000 6000 psi correspond to initial injection rates of 2 504 10 4 5 007 10 4 and 7 511 10 4 m2 s equivalent to 136 272 and 408 bbl d m the resulting critical retention profiles as a function of the radial distance r are presented in fig 5 as the velocity is a decreasing function of the radial distance all critical retention curves are increasing functions of this distance for larger values of pwf the pressure gradient pwf pres is larger and hence the flow rate is larger this results in lower values of the critical retention function 5 1 impedance the impedance has been calculated as per the solution derived in section 2 3 the resulting curves are presented in fig 6 higher injection pressures result in strictly higher values of impedance this follows straightforwardly from the higher concentrations of detached particles as explained above the atypically large slope during the initial stages of injection is indicative of the instant detachment caused by the velocity while the more gradual impedance growth which follows is a result of the detachment induced by the injected salinity the stabilisation of the impedance corresponds to the injection of an insignificant fraction of the reservoir pore volume it follows that a majority of the damage occurs in the near wellbore region 5 2 injectivity for constant injection rate fig 7 shows the increase in pressure drop that corresponds to the model parameters derived from the laboratory study as expected from eq 46 these curves follow a similar trend to the impedance curves the curves show that for low salinity water injection at high injection rates more than 3000 psi of additional pressure drawdown would be required to maintain the initial injection rate such an increase is likely to test the capabilities of surface equipment or result in a bottom hole pressure exceeding the formation fracture pressure 5 3 injectivity for constant bottom hole pressure the calculated decrease in injection rate due to fines migration is presented in fig 8 similar to the increase in pressure drop the calculations show that the injection rate can more than halve within only several hours of injection time stabilisation of the injection rate takes longer than for the pressure drop discussed in the previous section as outlined in section 2 4 both variables share the same impedance curve and therefore stabilise after the same number of injected pore volumes however due to the decreasing injection rate when the condition on the wellbore is of constant bottom hole pressure the rate at which pore volumes are injected decreases as per eq 50 the result is that while stabilisation occurs after a fixed number of injected pore volumes a constant bottom hole pressure results in a longer dimensional stabilisation time 5 4 damaged zone another result of the model is how far the formation damage extends from the wellbore fines detachment eq 52 straining eq 6 and the impact of permeability on pressure drawdown eq 12 are all increasing functions of velocity given the velocity distribution in eq 4 it follows that the damage due to fines migration is limited to within a certain distance from the wellbore to that end we calculate the damaged zone radius rd defined by nunes et al 2010 55 x r w x r e s s x t x x r w x r d s s x t x x r w x r e s s x t x δ which simplifies to 56 x r d x r e s s x t x x r w x r e s s x t x δ where δ is a small number indicating the extent to which removal of strained particles within the zone rw rd will remove the effect of fines migration on the well injectivity the damaged zone radius calculated from the laboratory data is presented in fig 9 with δ 0 01 the damaged zone is the same for the two lower values of pwf but increases slightly when pwf is increased to 6000 psi all curves show a non monotonic growth of the damaged zone radius with time this effect is induced by the introduction of the delay factor the initial growth is a result of detachment by the velocity while these particles continue to strain the effect of delay means that particles continue to detach very close to the wellbore where damage is most significant this results in a temporary decrease in rd which is quickly corrected by detachment by salinity further from the wellbore the stabilised value is determined by the form of the critical retention function shown in fig 5 and the filtration coefficient λ the low values of rd relative to the drainage radius re support the notion outlined in section 5 1 that the majority of damage occurs in the near wellbore region information of the damaged zone radius serves to guide re perforation acidizing or backflow operations designed to mitigate injectivity issues caused by fines migration oyeneyin et al 1996 zhu et al 2001 the values calculated for typical fines migration parameters indicates a damaged zone radius of less than 1 metre which suggests that damage due to fines migration is relatively shallow 6 discussion qualitative analysis of the solution analysis of the solution for the suspended concentration shows that the solution can be separated into two solutions accounting for the detachment that occurs initially due to high velocities near the wellbore and the detachment that is further induced by the low salinity water injection the sum of the two solutions provides the complete solution given in table 1 the separation of the two solutions is largely the consequence of the use of a constant filtration coefficient as a result detached particles will be transported and captured independently of each other fig 2 presents profiles for the particle concentrations at different moments profiles of the attached concentration are given in fig 2b at t 0 at three intermediate times t1 t2 t3 and after an infinite duration t immediately after injection has begun particle detachment occurs at any point in the reservoir where the particle concentration lies above the critical retention function of the reservoir fluid scr x γ 1 subsequently for all points behind the salinity front x xw t the attached concentration decreases exponentially towards the critical retention function of the injected salinity sc r x γ 1 this profile is reached only after an infinite injection period fig 2c shows the suspended particle concentration profiles the initial profile corresponds to the immediate detachment at the formation fluid salinity this profile will tend to decrease due to particle straining and migration but additional detachment induced by the injected fluid salinity can result in an increase in this profile at certain points in the reservoir the suspended concentration remains at zero at the wellbore and tends to zero after an infinite injection period the strained concentration profiles are shown in fig 2d the strained concentration begins at zero and tends to a finite profile after a sufficient injection period as straining is modelled as an irreversible process these profiles increase monotonically with time the velocity dependence of the straining process results in profiles skewed towards the wellbore where fluid velocities are higher effect of the delay factor the impedance curves presented in fig 6 are shown for 3 different values of the delay factor τ as expected smaller values of the delay factor result in faster stabilisation of the impedance despite the difference in stabilisation time τ has no effect on the final value of the impedance as it only changes the rate at which particles detach not the total detached particle concentration the sharp slope during the early times is independent of the delay factor which supports the notion outlined in section 5 1 that this atypically sharp increase in the impedance results from the straining of particles detached due to velocity at the beginning of injection these particles detach instantaneously independent of τ applications the developed model can be used for well injectivity prediction during water injection with an ionic composition which is different from that of formation water the system of partial differential eqs 14 19 has been reduced to a set of implicit integral expressions using analytical techniques the semi analytical solution is much easier to implement into commercial software and provides more accurate and less computationally expensive results compared to a numerical solution of the original system 7 conclusions in this paper we have developed an analytical model of well injectivity decline due to fines migration with delayed detachment based on the mathematical modelling and laboratory based injectivity predictions the following conclusions can be drawn 1 introduction of the pseudo salinity into the critical retention function while maintaining the direct dependency of velocity allows capturing physical effects of delayed detachment due to salinity variation and instant detachment due to high velocity 2 the resulting mathematical model allows for a semi analytical solution 3 the solution allows predicting an increase in pressure drawdown or a decrease in the injection rate caused by fines migration 4 particle populations instantly mobilised at the beginning of injection at high velocities and gradually mobilised with delay behind the low salinity front perform deep bed filtration independently the suspended concentration is the total of the suspended concentrations in both waves 5 the delay factor results in an increased time until the well injectivity stabilises but has no effect on the final well injectivity 6 predictions of wellbore injectivity derived from a laboratory study show that high injection rates can result in injectivity index being reduced to less than half of its initial value 7 the size of the formation damage zone due to fines migration as calculated from laboratory data does not exceed 1 metre 
7116,colloidal suspension flows in porous media occur in numerous areas of environmental chemical and petroleum engineering the main processes are capture and detachment of particles yielding permeability decline we developed a governing system of transport equations with particle detachment kinetics where the detachment by high velocities is instant due to flow incompressibility and the detachment by decreasing the fluid salinity is delayed due to micro scale diffusion the system allows for a semi analytical solution for axi symmetric low salinity water injection with fines migration the model exhibits instant fines mobilization at the beginning of injection by drag force fines release with delay behind the salinity front by electrostatic force and the interaction of two concentration waves the model can be used for laboratory based injectivity decline prediction during injection of water in aquifers and oilfields where the injected and formation water compositions

reservoir particles can detach and become suspended in the injected fluid the suspended particles strain in pore throats as they are carried through the pore space in the case where the particles have sizes comparable to the pore throats straining results in a significant decline in the permeability of the porous media this process is referred to as fines migration and poses a serious risk to the capability of injection wells to supply fluid to the reservoir fines migration has been shown to have a significant impact on the injectivity of oil wells barkman et al 1975 and of freshwater storage wells prommer et al 2013 any operations involving porous media that contains fine particles that are susceptible to both detachment and straining are potentially prone to fines migration example applications include groundwater flows kaplan and muñoz carpena 2014 and contaminant transport zhang et al 2016 decision making during the injection of foreign water into aquifers and oil fields for displacement storage or disposal purposes is based on numerical and analytical modelling at the reservoir scale hayek 2014 hayek 2015 the rheological relationships used for this modelling are determined by matching laboratory and micro scale modelling mirabolghasemi et al 2015 modelling fines migration required descriptions of the processes of detachment migration and straining which are shown schematically in fig 1 particle detachment in response to changes to the flow conditions is described by the total concentration of detached particles and the rate of particle detachment it is helpful to imagine particles that remain attached under any flow conditions to be in a state of equilibrium certain changes to the flow conditions result in a shift in the equilibrium and a consequent detachment of particles in describing the nature of this equilibrium some authors have adopted empirical equations kuo and matijevic 1979 while others have neglected the equilibrium altogether vardoulakis et al 1996 resulting in the detachment of all in situ particles more recent approaches have focused on the forces acting on particles yuan and shapiro 2011 zeinijahromi and bedrikovetsky 2016 the balance of these forces often assumed to be in the form of a torque balance relates the prediction of particle detachment to state variables such as the fluid velocity or salinity through established relations for the acting forces the two primary forces acting on attached particles are the hydrodynamic drag force fd and the electrostatic force fe additional forces such as the lifting gravitational or brownian forces are neglected from this discussion as they have been shown to be negligible for the conditions of fines detachment in natural reservoirs kalantariasl and bedrikovetsky 2013 the remaining two forces are shown acting on an attached particle alongside their respective lever arms ld and ln in fig 1 the mechanical equilibrium of the attached particle is determined by the balance of the torques generated by these forces bedrikovetsky et al 2011 sasidharan et al 2017 1 f d u l d f e γ p h θ l n where u is the fluid velocity γ is the fluid salinity and θ is the temperature fines detachment occurs when the detaching torque generated by the drag force exceeds the attaching torque generated by the attractive electrostatic force higher fluid velocities result in a higher drag force goldman et al 1967 and hence increase the extent of particle detachment zheng et al 2014 similarly the electrostatic force decreases with decreasing fluid salinity khilar et al 1983 shen et al 2018 or increasing ph kia et al 1986 patil et al 2011 resulting in more particle detachment this explains why low salinity waterflooding operations are particularly prone to formation damage resulting from fines migration higher temperatures have also been shown to decrease the electrostatic force you et al 2015 which is important when injecting into deep reservoirs or during geothermal operations you et al 2016 applying the torque balance condition to all particles within the porous medium allows the derivation of a macro scale equation relating the flow conditions to the attached particle concentration this function is referred to as the critical retention function 2 σ cr u γ p h θ in natural reservoir rocks properties such as pore size particle size and geometry among others will be non uniform thus the properties which determine the condition of mechanical equilibrium 1 will be stochastically distributed the torque balance can determine whether each particle is attached based on their own properties the population of all particles whose mechanical equilibrium favours detachment gives the attached concentration given here as the critical retention function therefore despite the non uniformity of micro scale parameters the function 2 is still valid in most experimental studies of fines migration the flow conditions are controlled to study the effect of changing one variable on the attached concentration however during uni axial flows such as during injection operations the fluid velocity is a decreasing function of the distance from the wellbore as such a continuous relation between the attached concentration and the fluid velocity is required the critical retention function satisfies this requirement previous studies have demonstrated a significant delay in the response of attached oleic particles to changes in the fluid salinity mahani et al 2015 the authors argue that diffusive processes slow the effect of decreasing salinity on altering the salinity between oil particles and the pore surface thus delaying the detachment of these droplets a similar argument will apply to the detachment of fines from the pore surface and therefore a delay in particle detachment should be expected such a delay has been noted in several experimental works gravelle et al 2011 pazmino et al 2014 as a result many authors have adopted a first order kinetics relation to describe particle detachment due to the injection of low salinity water gravelle et al 2011 grolimund and borkovec 2006 russell and bedrikovetski 2018 on the contrary some authors assert that particle detachment by velocity is instantaneous based on the notion that changes to the fluid velocity will instantly affect the drag force acting on particles yang et al 2016 thus the kinetics of particle detachment should be evaluated in conjunction with the cause of the detachment it follows that in scenarios where particle detachment can occur by either salinity or velocity such as during the injection of low salinity water a single expression for detachment kinetics will be inadequate nonetheless existing models for fines migration due to low salinity water injection make use of a single particle detachment kinetics regime the purpose of this work is to present a mathematical model for fines migration in uni axial coordinates that separately describes the kinetics of particle detachment due to changes in both velocity and salinity the structure of the paper is as follows the assumptions and governing equations for the mathematical model are presented in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively a semi analytical solution for this system is derived in section 2 3 section 2 4 presents the equations for calculating injectivity and a specific form of the critical retention is provided in section 2 5 section 3 presents a laboratory study of fines migration the results of which are treated in section 4 section 5 presents predictions of injectivity decline based on the results of the treatment of the laboratory data a discussion of the model is presented in section 6 and section 7 concludes the paper 2 mathematical model in the current section a mathematical model is presented to describe fines migration during single phase uni axial flow 2 1 assumptions of the model both the fluid and particles are assumed to be incompressible in addition particle and fluid volumes are assumed to be additive during detachment and straining suspended particles are assumed to move through the porous space with a velocity smaller than the fluid velocity oliveira et al 2014 3 u p α u where up is the particle velocity u is the fluid velocity and α is drift delay factor which is significantly less than one the discrepancy between the particle and fluid velocities follows from rolling and sliding of the suspended particles along the pore walls particle straining is assumed to be an irreversible process the strained concentration is also assumed to be negligibly small compared to the number of straining vacancies within the rock particle attachment due to electrostatic attraction is ignored as outlined above particle detachment can occur due to an increase in fluid velocity or a decrease in the fluid salinity changes to the fluid salinity are assumed to have a delayed effect on the detachment of particles this assumption follows from the diffusion limited ion transport between the bulk solution and the solution between the particle and the grain mahani et al 2015 the latter governs the electrostatic force and hence the critical retention function changes to the fluid velocity are however assumed to have an instantaneous effect on particle detachment finally both particle and salt diffusion dispersion are ignored as these processes are assumed to be negligible compared to their respective advective fluxes polyanin and dilman 1994 2 2 governing equations following the assumptions outlined in the previous section we now present the system of equation describing fines migration in uni axial flow with delayed particle detachment the uni axial incompressible flow results in a fluid velocity varying with radial distance 4 u q 2 π r where q is the volumetric injection flow rate per unit formation thickness and r is the radial coordinate the mass balance of suspended strained and attached particles transported by incompressible fluid with velocity given by eq 4 with drift delay factor 3 and neglecting particle dispersion is 5 t ϕ c σ s σ a α q 2 π r c r 0 where t is time ϕ is the porosity c is the suspended particle concentration σs is the strained particle concentration and σa is the attached particle concentration the straining rate is assumed to be proportional to the incoming suspended particle concentration 6 σ s t α λ c q 2 π r where λ is the filtration coefficient the assumption of a small strained concentration compared to the number of straining sites leads to a constant λ altoe et al 2006 the transport of salt in the reservoir is governed by the mass balance equation for the electrolyte 7 ϕ γ t q 2 π r γ r 0 following the assumptions in section 2 1 any description of the kinetics of particle detachment should satisfy the following statements firstly the attached concentration should be governed by the critical retention function which itself is a function of the fluid salinity and velocity secondly the particle detachment rate should be infinite with respect to changes to velocity and finite with respect to changes to salinity to satisfy these requirements we introduce the pseudo salinity γ such that 8 σ a r t σ cr u γ thus the attached concentration is governed by the velocity and pseudo salinity the pseudo salinity is equal to the fluid salinity after some delay time τ 9 γ x t τ γ x t by assuming a constant delay time we can use a first order taylor s series approximation to obtain the rate equation bernasconi 1976 10 τ γ t γ γ this equation which holds for small delay times τ t describes the rate at which changes to the fluid salinity translate into changes to the pseudo salinity under this formulation abrupt changes to the velocity translate to abrupt changes in the attached concentration however abrupt changes to the salinity have a gradual effect on particle detachment as required finally the relationship between the strained concentration and the rock permeability is given by a first order taylor series approximation 11 k o k σ s 1 β σ s where k0 is the initial permeability and β is the formation damage coefficient substituting this equation into darcy s law yields 12 q 2 π r k 0 μ 1 β σ s p r where μ is the fluid viscosity and p is the fluid pressure the system of eqs 5 8 10 and 12 describes the 6

suspended and strained particles 20 t 0 γ 1 c 0 s s 0 the attached concentration begins at some initial value 21 s a s ai the boundary condition for this problem is applied at the wellbore radius the injected fluid has salinity γinj and contains no suspended particles 22 r r w x x w γ 0 c 0 the boundary condition for the strained particle concentration follows from substituting boundary condition 22 into eq 15 and integrating this yields 23 s s x w t 0 2 3 solution the equation for salt transport de couples from the system 14 16 18 19 and so can be solved separately using the method of characteristics the solution separates for the two regions behind and ahead of the injected salinity front x xw t the final solution is 24 γ x t 1 x x w t 0 x x w t the discontinuity along the salinity front is a consequence of neglecting diffusion the pseudo salinity can then be solved by substituting the solution for the salinity into eq 18 and integrating by separation of variables the initial condition used for the pseudo salinity is the same as that for the salinity ahead of the salinity front the solution is 25 γ 1 eq 18 implies that the pseudo salinity is continuous across the solution space as such eq 25 can be used as the initial condition ahead of the salinity front 26 t x γ 1 using this condition to solve eq 18 yields the solution behind the salinity front 27 γ e x t ε hence an immediate decrease in the salinity along the salinity front x xw t results in an exponential decline in the pseudo salinity from γ 1 to γ 0 next the particle mass balance eq 14 and the straining rate eq 15 are used to solve for the suspended particle concentration the resulting partial differential equation pde is 28 c t α c x α λ c 2 x s a t the solution space is naturally divided into three regions shown in fig 2 ahead of the salinity front x xw t region 0 the intermediate region between the salinity front and the suspended particle front t x xw αt region i and the region behind the suspended particle front αt x xw region ii the method of characteristics can be used to derive the solution for each of these regions polyanin and zaitsev 2011 polyanin and manzhirov 2007 tikhonov and smarskii 2011 in region 0 evaluating the pde 28 along parametric curves given by 29 dt dx 1 α reduces the pde to an ordinary differential equation ode 30 dc dx λ c 2 x 1 α s a t the initial condition for this region is given along the x axis due to the assumptions that the fluid is incompressible and that particle detachment due to velocity occurs instantaneously particle detachment by velocity at the initial salinity must be incorporated into the initial conditions as such on the x axis the attached concentration is 31 s a x t 0 0 s cr γ 1 u x 0 0 s cr γ 1 u x 0 0 s cr γ 1 u x 0 s ai s ai s ai s cr γ 1 u x 0 the excess attached particles below sai become suspended in the carrier fluid for brevity we present the initial condition as 32 t 0 c s ai s a x t 0 the pseudo salinity and fluid velocity are independent of time within region 0 and so the detachment rate in eq 30 is zero integrating eq 30 subject to initial condition 20 yields the solution for the suspended concentration ahead of the salinity front 33 c e λ x x α t s ai s a x t 0 the solution for region 0 along the salinity front serves as an initial condition for region i it is first necessary to demonstrate that the suspended concentration is continuous along this front to do so we make use of a mass balance condition derived from eq 14 bedrikovetsky 1993 34 c s a s s d α c where the square brackets indicate the change in a variable across the curve with slope d eqs 15 and 25 27 respectively demonstrate that for all positive x t the strained and attached concentrations are continuous therefore along the salinity front we have 35 c α c for α 1 the solution follows 36 c 0 thus the suspended concentration is continuous along the salinity front in region i the characteristic curves are given by 37 dx dt α along these curves the pde 28 reduces to 38 dc dt α λ c 2 x s a t eq 37 can be solved to give the equation for the characteristics 39 x x 0 α t t 0 where the set of points xw x0 t0 define the location where the initial condition is given for this region the initial condition is provided along the salinity front as such we have 40 x w x 0 t 0 so 41 x α

particle concentration in this region 42 c e λ x x α t s ai s a x t 0 e λ x t 0 t e λ x t s a x t t t d t the dependence of the variable x on t in the integral persists as the integration is performed along the characteristics the solution is presented implicitly here due to the necessity of the form of the critical retention function to be known the equations are presented generally for any form of this function and a specific example is presented in section 2 5 in region ii eq 28 is evaluated along curves given by 43 dt dx 1 α to reduce the pde to the form 44 dc dx λ c 2 x 1 α s a t performing the integration and making use of the boundary condition 22 results in 45 c e λ x α x w x e λ x s a x t x t d x equations for the attached and suspended concentrations can be found in table 1 once the suspended concentration is known the strained concentration can be obtained by integrating eq 15 2 4 injectivity given any strained concentration profile the dimensionless pressure drop can be calculated by integrating eq 19 the impedance is then calculated by normalising the dimensionless pressure drop by its initial value 46 j q 0 q δ p δ p 0 δ p δ p 0 where the subscript 0 indicates the initial value prior to any damage in order to calculate a dimensional output of the model it is necessary to impose a boundary condition at the wellbore the simplest case is the condition of constant injection rate under this condition the pressure drop between the wellbore and the reservoir boundary is calculated as 47 r w r e dp q μ 2 π k 0 r w r e 1 β ϕ s s 2 x d x which reduces to 48 p r w p r e δ p t q μ 2 π k 0 ln r e r w β ϕ x r w x r e s s 2 x d x another common constraint on injection conditions is to maintain a constant bottom hole pressure to maximise injection rate it is often maintained at a value just below the formation fracture pressure rose et al 1989 fines migration will then result in a decrease of the injection rate over time the inclusion of a variable rate function q t highlights a key assumption used in the solution procedure in section 2 3 in order to de couple the modified darcy s law eq 19 from the rest of the system it is necessary to assume that particle detachment is governed by a single injection rate for the case of constant injection rate this poses no problem but for constant bottom hole pressure the decrease in injection rate violates this assumption in order to make use of the model to predict a decrease in injection rate we make an additional assumption that particle detachment is determined only by the initial injection rate under this assumption the equations governing the fine particle concentrations and darcy s law can still be separated and the analysis presented in section 2 3 still holds after calculating the strained concentration eq 12 can be integrated and re arranged to obtain the expression for the injection rate 49 q t 2 π k 0 p r w p r e μ ln r e r w β ϕ x r w x r e s s 2 x d x for the case of constant pressure drop the relationship between the time and the dimensionless time given in eq 13 is not known until the injection rate has been determined as such it is easier to perform calculations in dimensionless coordinates to calculate q t and subsequently calculate the relationship t t from eq 13 taking the derivative of this expression with respect to time yields 50 dt dt q t ϕ π r n 2 evaluating the derivative using a first order taylor series approximation yields a simple iterative formula 51 t n t n 1 t n t n 1 ϕ π r n 2 q t n 2 5 example form of the critical retention function all equations thus far have been presented for any form of the critical retention function σcr u γ for the purposes of discussing the model we now present a simple form for this function the dependency of the critical retention function on the fluid velocity has been discussed previously bedrikovetsky et al 2011 the resulting critical retention function takes the form of a parabola 52 σ cr u σ 0 1 u u m 2 where σ0 is the limit of the critical retention function with zero fluid velocity and um is the maximum velocity above which no more fine particles are detached the quadratic form of the critical retention function follows from the velocity dependence of the drag force acting on attached particles goldman et al 1967 the dependency of the critical retention function on the fluid salinity follows from the dependency of the electrostatic force on the salinity a simple and general form for this dependency has not been well developed for the purposes of fines migration as such we propose a simplification in which the maximum velocity um varies linearly with the fluid salinity 53 u m u m γ u m γ γ inj γ u m γ γ i u m γ γ inj u m 0 γ u m 1 u m 0 in dimensionless coordinates the critical retention function then takes the form 54 s cr u γ σ 0 ϕ 1 q 2 π r n 2 x u m 0 u m 1 u m 0 γ 2 the critical retention function is then characterised by the three variables σ0 um0 and um1 a more complex description of the critical retention function may be required for describing particle detachment in some conditions regardless eq 54 is used in the remainder of this work to illustrate the behaviour of the model based on this formulation the parameter set required to characterise fines migration is then α λ β τ σ0 σai um1 um0 3 laboratory study in this section a laboratory study is presented that has been designed to characterise the response of a sample porous media to low salinity water a successful characterisation will result in reliable estimates of the parameters outlined in section 2 5 3 1 materials rock and fluids the rocks used in this study were artificially created sand kaolinite sandpacks the use of artificial cores provides significant confidence in the reproducibility of the cores and hence allows multiple tests to be interpreted as if they were performed on the same core the sand used in the study consisted of more than 99 silica and was sieved prior to use to constrain the particle size distribution a washing procedure outlined in russell et al 2017 was performed to remove impurities on the sand surface and enhance the reproducibility of the sandpacks the kaolinite used in this study was analytical grade kaolinite powder which was dried at 60 c prior to weighing to remove excess water a fixed mass of 85 g was used for the sandpacks and for both cores the kaolinite mass fraction was 10 the sand kaolinite mixture was wet slightly with high salinity water 0 6 mol l nacl before being compacted in the core holder the homogeneous distribution of clay across the core and the reproducibility of the procedure were outlined in russell et al 2017 3 2 apparatus the experimental study on fines migration was carried out using a constant rate coreflooding apparatus with real time pressure measurements a schematic and photograph of the set up used in the study is provided in fig 3 a complete description of each component of the set up is provided in the caption of this figure in brief the injection solutions were provided to the core with constant injection rate by the injection pump while the differential pressure transmitters measured the pressure difference between the core inlet and outlet the pressure difference measurements were recorded in real time using data acquisition software samples were collected at the effluent and then analysed using a particle counter to determine the suspended particle concentration 3 3 laboratory procedure the laboratory procedure began by injecting each core with 0 6 mol l nacl at a low flow rate 0 2 ml min which corresponds to linear velocity u 2 93 10 6 m s to fully saturate the core the high salinity fluid and low flow rate were chosen to promote attachment of the kaolinite to the sand grains and to minimise particle detachment during saturation after 24 h the injected solution was changed to the test salinity which was then maintained for the remainder of each test the two cores were injected with 0 01 mol l and 0 001 mol l nacl these salinities cover the range of slightly brackish water to fresh water that is typical for fresh water aquifers prommer et al 2013 after an additional 24 h the test began by increasing the injection velocity during each stage the velocity was held constant and the pressure drop across the core and effluent suspended particle concentration were measured after 24 h which was sufficient in all cases for complete stabilisation of the pressure drop the velocity was increased and the process repeated the injection rates used in each test were 1 5 10 15 20 30 40 and 50 ml min which have respective superficial velocities 1 47 10 5 7 34 10 5 1 47 10 4 2 2 10 4 2 93 10 4 4 40 10 4 5 87 10 4 and 7 34 10 4 m s the fluid velocity range was designed to encompass velocities that might be encountered in the near wellbore and far field regions during injection operations 4 treatment of laboratory data the data sets obtained from the tests were the pressure drop and outlet concentration curves for each injection stage these were fit with a 1 d model for fines migration with delayed detachment in linear coordinates this model is analogous to the system 5 8 10 12 with a constant fluid velocity along the core the output of this fitting procedure was the model parameters α τ β λ and δσcr the latter describes the difference in the critical retention function at the velocity of the current stage and that of the previous stage the set of these values for each injection stage facilitates the construction of the critical retention function against the injection velocity these curves for both cores have been constructed and fit with the theoretical form given by eq 52 experimental and theoretical curves are presented in fig 4 the experimental points show good agreement with the theoretical form of the critical retention function the parameter values obtained from fitting were σ0 0 01 m 0 01205 σ0 0 001 m 0 01178 um 0 01 m 0 001622 m s and um 0 001 m 0 0008782 m s the effect of salinity is captured in the different values of um where a higher velocity is required to detach all particles in the presence of a higher salinity for the calculation of injectivity decline the value of σ0 was taken as the average of the two obtained from experiments the other model parameters obtained from fitting the experimental data varied between injection cycles so average values were taken from these ranges the parameters which are present in traditional models for fines migration α λ β δσcr lie within ranges of parameters reported in the literature al abduwani et al 2005 bradford et al 2003 bradford et al 2013 chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 oliveira et al 2014 sotirelis and chrysikopoulos 2015 the complete set of parameters used in the calculations is presented in table 2 5 predictions of wellbore injectivity in this section predictions of wellbore injectivity both for the conditions of constant injection rate and constant bottom hole pressure are presented the calculations for injectivity decline have been performed for three different initial bottom hole pressures pwf this value determines the initial injection rate which for all calculations determines the detachment of particles the three values of pwf 4000 5000 6000 psi correspond to initial injection rates of 2 504 10 4 5 007 10 4 and 7 511 10 4 m2 s equivalent to 136 272 and 408 bbl d m the resulting critical retention profiles as a function of the radial distance r are presented in fig 5 as the velocity is a decreasing function of the radial distance all critical retention curves are increasing functions of this distance for larger values of pwf the pressure gradient pwf pres is larger and hence the flow rate is larger this results in lower values of the critical retention function 5 1 impedance the impedance has been calculated as per the solution derived in section 2 3 the resulting curves are presented in fig 6 higher injection pressures result in strictly higher values of impedance this follows straightforwardly from the higher concentrations of detached particles as explained above the atypically large slope during the initial stages of injection is indicative of the instant detachment caused by the velocity while the more gradual impedance growth which follows is a result of the detachment induced by the injected salinity the stabilisation of the impedance corresponds to the injection of an insignificant fraction of the reservoir pore volume it follows that a majority of the damage occurs in the near wellbore region 5 2 injectivity for constant injection rate fig 7 shows the increase in pressure drop that corresponds to the model parameters derived from the laboratory study as expected from eq 46 these curves follow a similar trend to the impedance curves the curves show that for low salinity water injection at high injection rates more than 3000 psi of additional pressure drawdown would be required to maintain the initial injection rate such an increase is likely to test the capabilities of surface equipment or result in a bottom hole pressure exceeding the formation fracture pressure 5 3 injectivity for constant bottom hole pressure the calculated decrease in injection rate due to fines migration is presented in fig 8 similar to the increase in pressure drop the calculations show that the injection rate can more than halve within only several hours of injection time stabilisation of the injection rate takes longer than for the pressure drop discussed in the previous section as outlined in section 2 4 both variables share the same impedance curve and therefore stabilise after the same number of injected pore volumes however due to the decreasing injection rate when the condition on the wellbore is of constant bottom hole pressure the rate at which pore volumes are injected decreases as per eq 50 the result is that while stabilisation occurs after a fixed number of injected pore volumes a constant bottom hole pressure results in a longer dimensional stabilisation time 5 4 damaged zone another result of the model is how far the formation damage extends from the wellbore fines detachment eq 52 straining eq 6 and the impact of permeability on pressure drawdown eq 12 are all increasing functions of velocity given the velocity distribution in eq 4 it follows that the damage due to fines migration is limited to within a certain distance from the wellbore to that end we calculate the damaged zone radius rd defined by nunes et al 2010 55 x r w x r e s s x t x x r w x r d s s x t x x r w x r e s s x t x δ which simplifies to 56 x r d x r e s s x t x x r w x r e s s x t x δ where δ is a small number indicating the extent to which removal of strained particles within the zone rw rd will remove the effect of fines migration on the well injectivity the damaged zone radius calculated from the laboratory data is presented in fig 9 with δ 0 01 the damaged zone is the same for the two lower values of pwf but increases slightly when pwf is increased to 6000 psi all curves show a non monotonic growth of the damaged zone radius with time this effect is induced by the introduction of the delay factor the initial growth is a result of detachment by the velocity while these particles continue to strain the effect of delay means that particles continue to detach very close to the wellbore where damage is most significant this results in a temporary decrease in rd which is quickly corrected by detachment by salinity further from the wellbore the stabilised value is determined by the form of the critical retention function shown in fig 5 and the filtration coefficient λ the low values of rd relative to the drainage radius re support the notion outlined in section 5 1 that the majority of damage occurs in the near wellbore region information of the damaged zone radius serves to guide re perforation acidizing or backflow operations designed to mitigate injectivity issues caused by fines migration oyeneyin et al 1996 zhu et al 2001 the values calculated for typical fines migration parameters indicates a damaged zone radius of less than 1 metre which suggests that damage due to fines migration is relatively shallow 6 discussion qualitative analysis of the solution analysis of the solution for the suspended concentration shows that the solution can be separated into two solutions accounting for the detachment that occurs initially due to high velocities near the wellbore and the detachment that is further induced by the low salinity water injection the sum of the two solutions provides the complete solution given in table 1 the separation of the two solutions is largely the consequence of the use of a constant filtration coefficient as a result detached particles will be transported and captured independently of each other fig 2 presents profiles for the particle concentrations at different moments profiles of the attached concentration are given in fig 2b at t 0 at three intermediate times t1 t2 t3 and after an infinite duration t immediately after injection has begun particle detachment occurs at any point in the reservoir where the particle concentration lies above the critical retention function of the reservoir fluid scr x γ 1 subsequently for all points behind the salinity front x xw t the attached concentration decreases exponentially towards the critical retention function of the injected salinity sc r x γ 1 this profile is reached only after an infinite injection period fig 2c shows the suspended particle concentration profiles the initial profile corresponds to the immediate detachment at the formation fluid salinity this profile will tend to decrease due to particle straining and migration but additional detachment induced by the injected fluid salinity can result in an increase in this profile at certain points in the reservoir the suspended concentration remains at zero at the wellbore and tends to zero after an infinite injection period the strained concentration profiles are shown in fig 2d the strained concentration begins at zero and tends to a finite profile after a sufficient injection period as straining is modelled as an irreversible process these profiles increase monotonically with time the velocity dependence of the straining process results in profiles skewed towards the wellbore where fluid velocities are higher effect of the delay factor the impedance curves presented in fig 6 are shown for 3 different values of the delay factor τ as expected smaller values of the delay factor result in faster stabilisation of the impedance despite the difference in stabilisation time τ has no effect on the final value of the impedance as it only changes the rate at which particles detach not the total detached particle concentration the sharp slope during the early times is independent of the delay factor which supports the notion outlined in section 5 1 that this atypically sharp increase in the impedance results from the straining of particles detached due to velocity at the beginning of injection these particles detach instantaneously independent of τ applications the developed model can be used for well injectivity prediction during water injection with an ionic composition which is different from that of formation water the system of partial differential eqs 14 19 has been reduced to a set of implicit integral expressions using analytical techniques the semi analytical solution is much easier to implement into commercial software and provides more accurate and less computationally expensive results compared to a numerical solution of the original system 7 conclusions in this paper we have developed an analytical model of well injectivity decline due to fines migration with delayed detachment based on the mathematical modelling and laboratory based injectivity predictions the following conclusions can be drawn 1 introduction of the pseudo salinity into the critical retention function while maintaining the direct dependency of velocity allows capturing physical effects of delayed detachment due to salinity variation and instant detachment due to high velocity 2 the resulting mathematical model allows for a semi analytical solution 3 the solution allows predicting an increase in pressure drawdown or a decrease in the injection rate caused by fines migration 4 particle populations instantly mobilised at the beginning of injection at high velocities and gradually mobilised with delay behind the low salinity front perform deep bed filtration independently the suspended concentration is the total of the suspended concentrations in both waves 5 the delay factor results in an increased time until the well injectivity stabilises but has no effect on the final well injectivity 6 predictions of wellbore injectivity derived from a laboratory study show that high injection rates can result in injectivity index being reduced to less than half of its initial value 7 the size of the formation damage zone due to fines migration as calculated from laboratory data does not exceed 1 metre 
7117,water use efficiency and uncertainty treatment are foci in the modeling of agricultural water management systems to address these challenging issues a robust fractional programming rfp method that coupled fractional programming with robust optimization was developed in this study to improve agricultural water use efficiency under uncertainty rfp improved upon the fractional programming by being able to tackle highly uncertain information without known distributions it also extended the capability of the robust optimization method in addressing ratio optimal problems to demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability rfp was applied to a long term agricultural water resources management problem in arid north west china where water scarcity and low water use efficiency hindered local development it generated benefit and risk explicit plans for crop pattern adjustments vegetables were recommended as the preferred crop a number of scenarios combining different fluctuation and protection levels were analyzed and interpreted with practical implications it was observed that higher water use efficiency could be achieved through reducing parametric uncertainty and risk aversion levels simulation experiments validated that the benefits claimed by the rfp model were sufficiently conservative and could be reliably achieved the comparisons of rfp results against the baseline operations and those from two other alternatives demonstrated that rfp could result in higher resource use efficiency and controllable system violation risks the developed approach is also applicable to other optimization problems aiming at enhancing resource use efficiency under uncertainty keywords agricultural water management fractional programming robust optimization uncertainty resource use efficiency watershed management 1 introduction water scarcity is getting increasingly grim around the world with the growing needs of food production and economic development especially in arid and semi arid areas across all industries agriculture is the largest consumer of water resources taking up about 70 of total water consumption kang 2017 agricultural water pressure will further aggravate due to the increasing food demand and the booming population dai and li 2013 cai et al 2009 enhancing irrigation water use efficiency is necessary especially in water limited regions amini fasakhodi et al 2010 predecessors made great efforts to explore optimal schemes for allocating available surface water and groundwater resources in irrigated agriculture smith et al 2000 plenty of mathematical programming models were developed to deal with various specific problems and deemed effective cai et al 2018 particularly multi objective models providing compromised solutions were extensively applied singh 2012 park and aral 2004 for example wang et al 2012 established a multi objective model for optimizing a water saving crop planting structure su et al 2014 developed a multi objective model to improve the efficiency of agricultural water use with increased utilization proportion of green water allam et al 2016 developed two multi objective models for supporting sustainable reuse of drainage in irrigation tan et al 2017 developed a multi objective fuzzy robust programming method for supporting the optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources although multi objective programming methods could balance conflicting objectives e g economic benefits ecological benefits or water consumption and coordinate the interests of different stakeholders they often encountered difficulties in objectively weighting multiple objectives especially when their units or orders of magnitude were distinct zhu et al 2014 ji 2017 to address the prescribed shortcomings of multi objective programming methods fractional programming fp has attracted more and more attentions in recent years fp optimized the ratio of two objectives with their original magnitudes such as output input benefit volume or benefit time mehra et al 2007 zhou et al 2015 it could thus provide an unprejudiced method for measuring system efficiency and effectively optimize marginal system benefits cui et al 2015 fp could better fit real world problems when the objective function is the quotient of physical and economic quantities emam 2013 charnes and cooper 1962 first developed a classic algorithm for linear fractional programming since then a great deal of work has been carried out the latest progress was reported in a review paper by stancu minasian 2017 in the past five decades fp has been widely used for increasing system efficiency in many fields such as financial and production planning mehra et al 2007 a few reported studies applied the fp method to address agricultural water management problems for instance amini fasakhodi et al 2010 assessed water resources sustainability and optimized cropping patterns through a multi objective fractional programming model mani et al 2016 optimized the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources through a mixed integer linear fractional programming method zhao et al 2017 proposed a linear fractional programming model to coordinate multiple factors and promote agricultural water productivity although fp was proven effective for measuring the efficiency of agricultural water resources system uncertainties that were prevalent in all components of agricultural water management systems could not be realistically reflected in the previous fp studies agricultural water management systems involve plenty of uncertain factors and parameters that can hardly be expressed as deterministic values such as uncertain irrigation water requirements economic revenues and crop yields gui et al 2017 li et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2014 zeng et al 2014 dong et al 2015 uncertain parameters should thus be tackled in the planning models there were a few fp based studies dealing with uncertainty in agricultural water management for example guo et al 2014 tackled multiple uncertainties in agricultural water management problems that were expressed as probability distributions fuzzy sets and their combinations through formulating a fuzzy chance constrained linear fractional programming model cui et al 2015 addressed stochastic uncertainty in irrigation water management systems through the development of a two stage stochastic fractional programming model li et al 2016 handled interval uncertainties and improved irrigation water productivity through the formulation of an interval fractional programming model zhang and guo 2017 dealt with fuzziness existing in irrigation water allocation problems based on a generalized fuzzy credibility constrained linear fractional programming method fu et al 2017 handled stochastic water availability and optimized agricultural water use structure through integrating chance constrained programming conditional value at risk and fractional programming most of them dealt with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and or stochastic variables with unknown possibility and or probabilistic distributions stancu minasian 2017 tan et al 2015 nevertheless these fractional programming studies could not deal with uncertain parameters without detailed distributions nor quantify system violation risks arising from such uncertainties to provide reliable and risk explicit solutions under deep uncertainty without distribution information robust optimization could be a promising way robust optimization focused on solving the worst case with the most unfavorable uncertainty gabrel et al 2014 in its early development stage the algorithms were mostly ultraconservative and difficult to solve naderi and pishvaee 2017 bertsimas and sim 2003 proposed a robust optimization method that allowed controlling the degree of conservatism and was relatively easy for computation robust optimization has been used in the planning of asset inventory finance and energy systems gabrel et al 2014 dong et al 2013 for instance palma and nelson 2010 applied the robust optimization method to support decision making on forest harvest scheduling tan et al 2010 developed a radial interval linear programming to tackle highly uncertain information in waste management problems parisio et al 2012 applied robust optimization methods to address an energy hub operation problem however robust optimization methods were hardly used to address agricultural water management problems under uncertainty especially when multiple objectives were involved therefore this paper aims at developing a robust fractional programming rfp method that not only deals with ratio multi objective problems but also enhances the robustness of optimal plans for supporting agricultural water management under complex uncertainties the applicability of the developed rfp method will be demonstrated through a case study of agricultural water management problems in arid and semi arid region of china the obtained modeling results could provide decision makers with optimal adjustment plans for crop planting structures and inform them with associated water shortage risks this paper is organized as follows the development of the rfp method is explained in section 2 the developed rfp method is applied to a real world case in north west china in section 3 in section 4 the results are interpreted and compared validation and comparisons are discussed in section 5 and section 6 provides concluding remarks of this research 2 development of robust fractional programming method in many real word problems there usually exist multiple hard to coordinate objectives such as maximized economic income and minimized resources input one of the ultimate solutions for coordinating these conflicting objectives is to strengthen system efficiency which can essentially be considered as a ratio optimization problem at the same time uncertainty that is ubiquitous in the processes components and factors of agricultural water management systems cannot be ignored in many cases precise fluctuation information of uncertain parameters is difficult to obtain to overcome the inabilities of existing programming methods in simultaneously tackling ratio optimization problems and complex uncertainties a rfp method is proposed in this paper in rfp the objective function is expressed as the outputs divided by the inputs moreover uncertain parameters without detailed distribution information are coped with in the constraints a general rfp model can be formulated as follows 1a max f j 1 n c j x j α j 1 n d j x j ε subject to 1b j 1 n a ij x j b i i m i k 1c j 1 n a kj x j b k k m k i 1d x j 0 j 1 2 n where a kj b k c j d j x j r a ij b i r α and ε are scalar constants r is the set of real numbers and r donates the set of uncertain variables with known fluctuation ranges but unknown symmetric distributions the values of such uncertain coefficient a ij fall within a fluctuation range a ij a ij a ij a ij where a ij represents the deterministic nominal value of a ij and a ij is the fluctuation radius around the nominal value that determines the size of fluctuation range assume that the objective function 1a is constantly differentiable and the solution set is nonempty and bounded zhu et al 2014 the objective function can be transformed into a linear expression and solved by introducing a new variable r r r under the condition that the denominator is positive and constant in sign zhu et al 2014 charnes and cooper 1962 mani et al 2016 model 1 can thus be transformed to its linear form as follows 2a max g y 1 y 2 y n r j 1 n c j y j α r subject to 2b j 1 n a ij y j b i r i m i k 2c k 1 n a kj y j b k r k m k i 2d j 1 n d j y j ε r 1 2e y j 0 j 1 2 n 2f r 0 where y j is the new decision variable and the original decision variable x j equals to y j r as the uncertain parameters remain unsolved in model 2 robust optimization is introduced in the next step to tackle them bertsimas and sim 2003 palma and nelson 2009 a new parameter γ i named protection level is introduced reflecting the maximal number of uncertain coefficients that are protected against perturbations protection level γ i takes n at most when all coefficients are considered uncertain protection level γ i is not necessarily an integer if γ i 0 constraint i is tantamount to a deterministic one since all uncertain coefficients are forced to take their nominal values if γ i n coefficients are all allowed to take any values within their fluctuation ranges and if 0 γ i n up to γ i coefficients are allowed to take values other than the nominal ones while the feasibility of constraint is guaranteed to transform the constraints with uncertain parameters into deterministic ones a protection function β with a given solution vector y is introduced to constraint 2b 3a j 1 n a ij y j β y γ i b i r i the protection function is formulated as follows 3b β y γ i max s i t i s i j i t i j i s i c a r d s i γ i j s i a ij y j γ i γ i a ij y j where j i denotes the number of uncertain parameters in constraint i the protection function accommodates the variations of a subset s i j i of uncertain coefficients as specified by the protection level when up to γ i uncertain parameters take values within a fluctuation radius of a ij and one extra coefficient take values within a radius of γ i γ i a ij the feasibility of constraint can be guaranteed even if more uncertain parameters take values other than their nominal values the constraint remains feasible with high probability the protection function is then transformed into an optimization model and the linear expression can be obtained through its dual model palma and nelson 2009 the robust

variables can be obtained as x j opt y j opt r opt protection function as a function of γ i can guarantee that the model is feasible if less than γ i parameters change within their fluctuation ranges the probability bound of violation pbv is proposed to approximate the constraint violation risk levels when more than γ i parameters take values other than their nominal ones it can be defined as the maximal chance that constraint i is violated tan et al 2010 pbv can be obtained through the following formula bertsimas and sim 2004 5 pbv n γ i 1 2 n 1 μ l ϑ n n l μ l ϑ 1 n n l 1 2 n 1 μ n ϑ l ϑ 1 n

water management problem in minqin county which lies in the lower reaches of the arid shiyang river basin china 101 49 41 104 12 10 e 38 3 45 39 27 37 n fig 2 being surrounded by two deserts minqin played an important role of ecological barrier to prevent desert intersections in north west china it belongs to one of the driest areas in china facing serious desertification crises minqin has an arid climate feng et al 2011 the annual mean precipitation is as little as 113 mm whereas the annual evaporation is as high as 2624 mm deserts occupies 89 8 of the total area in minqin there are three irrigation districts in the study area namely changing huanhe and hongyashan hongyashan is the largest irrigation district taking up 92 8 of the total irrigation area li and guo 2014 irrigated agriculture was the largest water consumer in the study area accounting for more than 90 of the total water consumption the main water sources include surface water from the shiyang river and groundwater changning and huanhe districts solely depend on groundwater for irrigation hongyashan is a mixed irrigation district a reservoir to the south of the irrigation area makes it possible for hongyashan district to use released surface water economic development and population growth in the upper and middle reaches of shiyang river have reduced the available surface water discharged to hongyashan the utilization rate of surface water in the shiyang river basin reached as high as 172 in 2000 which was ranked as the highest in china kang 2008 insufficiencies of surface water supply and the great demands for irrigation water have led to over exploitation of groundwater the groundwater storage in minqin has been facing a serious crisis feng et al 2011 to alleviate water shortage jingdian water diversion project has been constructed to transfer water to this area minqin is one of the national commodity grain bases where local residents mainly depend on agricultural income gross agricultural production accounted for 63 of the regional total output value the main crops included wheat corn cotton sunflowers and vegetables due to the sharp drop in water flow from the upper reaches and the over exploitation of groundwater there has been a severe shortage of agricultural irrigation water it is thus of great significance to improve the utilization efficiency of irrigation water and make the most economic benefits from the limited water resources adjusting crop planting structure has been viewed as an effective way to optimize the use of water resources in the meantime coefficients such as gross irrigation water requirements are usually uncertain which requires treatment in the modelling process to make reliable decisions gross irrigation water requirements can be calculated according to the net irrigation water requirements and utilization efficiency coefficient of irrigation water to solve this problem an agricultural water management model was established based on the developed rfp method the planning horizon was 15 years from 2016 to 2030 which was further divided into three periods with five years in each period the data were gathered from field surveys and a comprehensive review of literatures such as local statistical yearbooks as well as governmental reports and documents for future planning periods parameters related to crop yields prices costs and utilization efficiencies of irrigation water were considered to steadily increase irrigation water prices for crop cultivation were acquired from the governmental documents the basic crop related data including yields prices costs and irrigation water requirements over the planning horizon are presented in table 1 3 2 robust fractional model for supporting agricultural water management in this study the objective was to improve agricultural water use efficiency which represented the economic returns obtained from the consumption of each cubic meter of water resources in irrigated agriculture the objective function is expressed as follows 6a max f max i 1 5 t 1 3 j 1 2 k 1 3 a ijkt y it b it c ijt i 1 5 j 1 2 t 1 3 k 1 3 a ijkt i q ijt where f is the objective function value

water consumption would not exceed the regulated limit since surface water was not available for changning and huanhe districts the area irrigated by surface water was set to be zero in these two districts food demand constraints considered the basic food requirements for feeding residents planting area constraints limited that the total planting land would be no more than the available cultivation area proportional planting area constraints guaranteed that the planting area of each crop at a certain irrigation district and in a certain planning period occupied a proper proportion of the cultivated land such percentages were deprived from the historical cultivation area data the detailed constraints are presented below water availability constraints 6b i 1 5 j 1 2 k 1 3 g i q ijt

and scenario analyses the optimal plans of agricultural water management at minqin county were obtained from solving the above rfp model either deterministic values or precise distributions of g i q

ijk fig 3 through consultation with local stakeholders two fluctuation radii for g i q ijk corresponding to lower and higher degrees of data uncertainty were considered which were 0 1 g i q ijk and 0 2 g i q ijk they are respectively referred to as the low and high fluctuation levels hereinafter for simplicity in this study the rfp model was solved under a number of scenarios combining different fluctuation and pbv levels three of which were identified as the main scenarios for the interpretation and comparisons of results a low pbv level at 10 and a high pbv level at 20 were examined among the three main scenarios these main scenarios included scenario r1 with the high fluctuation level but low pbv level r2 with the high fluctuation and pbv levels and r3 with the low fluctuation level but high pbv level in the following results from scenario r1 are interpreted in detail which are then compared against those obtained from scenarios r2 and r3 crop planting patterns obtained from scenario r1 are shown in fig 4 in changning district vegetables would have the largest planting area followed by sunflowers corn and wheat sunflowers and vegetables would occupy as much as 66 of the total planting area over the planning horizon except that vegetables cultivation areas would remain unchanged planting areas of other crops would decrease from period 1 to period 3 cotton would not be planted in changning in line with the current planting practices planting areas of corn would account for the largest portion in huanhe district over the planning horizon which would be in alignment with the historic preference over corn cultivation in this district planting areas of corn would slightly decrease in period 2 and remain unchanged in period 3 decreased areas of corn in the next two planning periods suggest that corn would not be the most economical planting choice sunflowers would be the second popular crop and its planting areas would remain unchanged during the planning horizon planting areas of vegetables would be less than sunflowers at first but notably increase in the following periods indicating that vegetables would be a better choice for economic benefits and water saving requirements wheat would have the smallest planting areas satisfying the basic production requirements cotton would not be planted in huanhe in hongyashan district vegetables would be the most popular crop taking up about 26 of the total planting area on average in the three planning periods cultivation areas of vegetables would gradually expand over the planning horizon this was probably because of the high economic return from vegetables cultivation corn would be ranked as the second popular crop in the first period but overtaken by sunflowers in the following two periods cotton would only be planted in this district with a minimum area to meet the basic production requirements this was due to the higher water consumption and lower economic return of cotton cultivation cultivation areas of both corn and cotton would markedly decrease in periods 2 and 3 wheat would have the least planting areas and keep the same cultivation scale throughout the planning horizon in terms of irrigation water sources both surface water and groundwater are available in hongyashan district sunflowers would only rely on surface water for irrigation in the three periods and this would also be the case for corn in periods 1 and 2 all other crops would be irrigated by both groundwater and surface water surface water would irrigate more than 50 of the land planted with wheat and cotton groundwater would respectively irrigate 18 30 and 30 of the planting area for vegetables in the three periods in general surface water would be the main water source in hongyashan district irrigating about 82 of the total cultivate land over the planning horizon under scenario r1 the planting areas of changning and hongyashan districts would decrease gradually over the planning horizon in contrast the total planting area of huanhe district would increase from periods 1 2 and then drop in period 3 the total planting areas of crops over the planning horizon is shown in fig 5 vegetables would occupy the largest planting area sequentially followed by sunflowers corn cotton and wheat as shown in fig 6 the total planting area in the entire study area would decline over the planning horizon dropping from 28 220 ha to 26 206 ha averagely the total planting area would take up 66 of all the arable land over the planning horizon correspondingly the total water consumption would reduce from 1 09 108 to 1 02 108 m3 over the planning horizon the maximized benefit from every cubic meter of water would be 18 35 yuan the saved cultivation land and water resources could be used for other economic activities or environmental purposes the saved area could be used for afforestation to prevent the desert invasion and the saved water resources could be used as supplementary water of local lakes for ecological restoration solutions from scenario r2 were also obtained for comparisons with r1 figs 4 6 in terms of planting patterns the differences between the two scenarios would be minor in changning district compared to r1 only the planting area of sunflowers in period 3 would slightly decrease under r2 planting areas of vegetables would increase in huanhe and hongyashan districts compared to scenario r1 this is mainly because that higher water availability under r2 would make it possible to grow more vegetables which have the highest economic benefits but relatively high water requirements meanwhile irrigation water sources would change dramatically sunflowers would still choose surface water for irrigation instead of utilizing mixed sources under r1 both wheat and corn would select surface water under r2 both cotton and vegetables would still rely on mixed water sources for irrigation under r2 but the preferences would shift from surface water under r1 to groundwater compared to r1 groundwater irrigated areas of vegetables under r2 would increase by 2 167 1 367 and 211 ha respectively cotton would utilize more groundwater under r2 gradually shifting from two water sources in the first two periods to groundwater only in the last period the share of surface water irrigated area would reduce from 82 under r1 to 78 under r2 in spite of the slight changes in the cultivation areas of sunflowers and vegetables the priority order of the five crops would remain to the same as r1 in terms of the total cultivation land 489 more hectares of land would be cultivated under r2 compared to r1 correspondingly water consumption under r2 would increase by 1 64 106 m3 although the total water consumption would increase the economic benefit gained from every cubic meter of water under r2 would be 0 88 higher than that of r1 such an increase in water use efficiency under r2 would be associated with additional 10 chance of system violation compared to r1 solutions from scenario r3 were also compared to those under r1 figs 4 6 in changning district there would be no obvious differences between these two sets of results in huanhe district the planting areas of vegetables in the three periods under r3 would respectively be 28 24 and 23 higher than those under r1 similarly more vegetables would be planted in hongyashan district under r3 the cultivation areas of vegetables would increase 357 ha planting areas of other crops in hongyashan would remain unchanged compared to r1 surface water would still be the main source servicing 73 of the total irrigated area over the planning horizon similar to r1 solutions sunflowers would solely be irrigated with surface water in periods 1 3 irrigation water for corn fields in period 1 would turn from mixed sources under r1 to surface water only under r3 wheat would turn to rely on surface water under r3 rather than mixed sources under r1 although cotton and vegetables would still use mixed water sources for irrigation groundwater would play a more important role for them under r3 compared to r1 2 432 more hectares of cotton would be irrigated by groundwater in period 1 and groundwater would gradually become the single water source for cotton in the last two periods under r3 as well additional 2 167 983 1 325 ha of vegetables would be irrigated by groundwater over the planning horizon under r3 the order of the planting areas of crops would be the same as r1 as shown in fig 5 the planting areas in the entire study area under r3 would respectively be 28 771 27 525 and 26 399 ha in the three periods compared to r1 the total planting area under r3 would increase 937 ha and the total water consumption would be 2 90 106 m3 more over the planning horizon the economic benefit per cubic meter of water would be 2 16 higher than that under r1 such an increase in water use efficiency could be attributed to less rigid protection against data perturbations with smaller fluctuation ranges and lower protection levels being considered schemes for crop planting areas and irrigation water utilization would vary significantly with the three scenarios under all of the three scenarios vegetables would be the most preferred which could be attributed to its higher economic gains the comparisons of results from these three scenarios suggest that economic benefits per cubic meter of water i e the objective function value would increase with higher pbv levels or lower fluctuation levels although higher objective function values could be achieved under higher pbv levels system violation risks would also be inevitably raised due to lower protection levels and relaxed constraints lower fluctuation levels could also lead to higher objective function values which could be attributed to narrower ranges of fluctuations and lower values of protection functions meanwhile the system violation risks under lower fluctuation levels would increase due to the weakened capability of the model to accommodate a wider range of data perturbations understanding such tradeoffs would be helpful for decision makers to choose optimal schemes according to their expectations over water use efficiency and tolerance attitudes toward water shortage risks besides the above three main scenarios more scenarios were examined in this study through gradually increasing pbv from 5 to 55 under the low and high fluctuation levels fig 7 illustrates how the objective function value i e economic benefit per cubic meter of water would vary along with the changes in the pbv reversely protection level and uncertainty level of parameters higher pbvs indicate lower protection levels and higher risks for irrigation water shortage as pbv increases the benefits gained from consuming one cubic meter of water would climb such an increase would be more notably under the higher level of uncertainty it can be observed that under the same pbv the objective function value would increase as the level of parameter uncertainty decreases this implies that reducing the level of parameter uncertainty would help gain higher agricultural water use efficiency and enhance system efficiency this could be achieved through investing more resources in the process of data collection and analysis for the sake of irrigation water requirement with less uncertainty 5 validation and discussions simulation experiments were run to validate the proposed rfp approach in addition the results from the rfp model were compared with status quo conditions and those from two alternative models to assess its performance and merits in the monte carlo simulations two hundred sets of simulated model inputs in other words two hundred simulated scenarios of uncertain coefficients were used to test the performance of the developed approach in the face of uncertain water demands for crop cultivation in each set a set of deterministic values were used to simulate one combination of uncertain parameter realizations to be in line with the scenario analyses in section 4 the low and high fluctuation levels were respectively examined with one hundred sets of inputs sampled for each fig 7 compares the objective function value e g economic benefit per cubic meter of water obtained from the rfp model and the simulated runs under the low fluctuation level the objective function value obtained from the deterministic simulated runs ranged from 18 85 to 18 88 yuan m3 in comparison the lowest unit benefit from the rfp model would be 18 74 yuan m3 when pbv was set to be as low as 5 being merely 0 6 lower than the average of the simulated results the unit benefit from the rfp would be almost the same as the average from the simulated runs while pbv reached 64 under the high fluctuation level inputs with higher level of uncertainty would lead to results fluctuating within wider ranges which varied from 18 79 to 18 89 yuan m3 similarly the results from the rfp model under the high fluctuation level would be mostly lower than those from the simulated runs but became very close to the simulated average when pbv climbed to 60 it could thus be observed that the objective function value from the rfp model would be mostly a bit lower than those from the simulated runs for the sake of high probabilities of constraint feasibility this validates that the benefits claimed by the rfp model are sufficiently conservative and can be reliably achieved moreover optimal plans obtained from the rfp model were compared with three others which included the benchmark agricultural practices in the base year of 2015 the plans from a deterministic fractional programming model without uncertain parameters and the plans from a conventional robust optimization model with a single linear objective according to the data recorded in the local statistical yearbooks table 2 the economic benefit gained from the consumption of one cubic meter of water was 10 92 yuan in real world practices for the base year of 2015 in contrast the optimal planting structures recommended by the rfp method would provide significantly higher unit economic benefits from each cubic meter of water taking r1 the most conservative one among the three main scenarios as an example the unit economic gain could have been raised by 7 43 yuan m3 if the optimal plans generated from the rfp model were adopted with regard to the total economic benefit although the total economic benefit under scenario r1 would be 18 lower than that in the base year 23 of irrigation water resources and 24 of planting area would be saved this suggests that the planting patterns from the developed method would be helpful for boosting regional agricultural water use efficiency from the perspective of economic productivity a deterministic fractional programming model dfp was formulated to solve the same problem differing from the rfp model uncertainty in parameters was not considered assuming that all of the parameters would take the nominal values only one set of simplified deterministic values were used as inputs in dfp in fact the dfp model represents a single special case among the numerous ones considered in the rfp model unlike rfp that would protect the model from sub optimality or infeasibility associated with data perturbations the dfp solutions would be far from reliable when any of the input parameters take values other than the given deterministic ones in real world problems taking scenario r1 as an example the economic benefit per cubic meter of water from the rfp model would be 2 7 lower compared to the dfp results this minor reduction in the objective function value would be acceptable since the rfp model could sharply reduce the system violation risk by 49 assuming that the protection level in model 5 equals to zero through taking the complex uncertainty into consideration under scenarios r2 and r3 such a reduction in unit economic gain would be even more negligible this implies that the rfp model could significantly enhance the system reliability inversely system violation risks with a trivial compromise in terms of system optimality to demonstrate the advantages of optimizing the water use efficiency in fractional forms a conventional robust optimization ro model was also formulated for comparison the ro model aimed at maximizing the total net economic benefits acquired from irrigated agriculture in other words the original objective function in model 6 was replaced by the following formula 6a max f max i 1 5 t 1 3 j 1 2 k 1 3 a ijkt y it b it c ijt this non fractional model shared the same constraints with the developed rfp model and was solved through the conventional ro algorithm the ro results were obtained under the same combinations of fluctuation and pbv levels i e scenarios r1 r2 and r3 with the rfp results it can be observed that such changes in the model structure would lead to significant variations in the solutions for decision variables and objective function values the comparisons between rfp and ro results with regard to the planting areas of different crops are shown in fig 5 in ro sunflowers would replace vegetables to be the dominant crop occupying the largest area fig 8 illustrates the variations in the total economic benefits total water consumption total planting area economic benefits per cubic meter of water and economic benefits per hectare of land when comparing the ro results against the rfp solutions as a result of its sole interest in economic gains the ro model could achieve slightly higher total economic benefits than rfp which would come at the cost of increased water consumption and land use from the perspective of economic benefits per cubic meter of water rfp outperforms ro under all of the three scenarios with higher water and land use efficiency for instance compared to the ro model the rfp model would respectively gain 6 and 7 more economic benefits from each cubic meter of water and each hectare of land while consuming 11 less water and occupying 12 less cultivation land under r3 therefore rfp outweighs ro through effectively tackling interrelationships among various factors and analyzing tradeoffs between economic gains and resources consumption in real world applications rfp method could help decision makers make overarching master plans of crop planting pattern compared with the baseline condition rfp results would substantially improve water use efficiency generating in higher economic benefits from each cubic meter of water rfp also demonstrates advantages over the existing alternative programming methods the rfp method could improve over the dfp method in terms of uncertainty treatment and system violation risk management compared with the ro method rfp method could effectively balance conflicting interests e g benefits gain and resources consumption and provide compromised solutions with relatively high resource use efficiency through integrating fp and ro into a general framework the developed rfp method could provide an unprejudiced measure for system efficiency expressed as ratio optimal problems moreover rfp could tackle complex uncertainties without precise distribution information through directly communicating numerous combinations of uncertain inputs into the modeling process and providing results with explicit benefit and risk tradeoffs the robust formulation of rfp could significantly reduce the efforts of sensitivity analyses that aimed at investigating the impacts of uncertain inputs in previous studies it could be capable of protecting the solutions from infeasibilities and controlling system violation risks while remaining to be computationally tractable rfp model could provide decision makers with compromised results among economic gain water resources consumption and solution reliability decision makers could thus choose the optimal results based on desired objective values e g economic benefit per cubic meter of water and their tolerance levels for unforeseeable system violation risks 6 conclusions modeling of agricultural water resources management problems is complicated with uncertainties a rfp method along with its solving algorithm has been introduced in this study and was applied to improve water use efficiency in agricultural production through integrating the fractional programming and robust optimization methods into a general framework the developed rfp method could simultaneously tackle ratio optimization problems and complex uncertainty uncertain parameters with known ranges but unknown symmetric distributions could be tackled by virtue of adjustable protection levels rfp method could provide optimal solutions that compromise between desired objective values and potential system violation risks in general the rfp method demonstrated the following advantages i it improved upon the fractional programming by being able to tackle highly uncertain information without known distributions ii it extended the capability of the robust optimization method in addressing ratio optimal problems such as output input benefit volume or benefit time iii it could provide decision makers with risk explicit results and iv it was computationally tractable with a linearizing algorithm the proposed rfp method was applied to an agricultural water resources management problem in north west china where limited irrigation water resources and low economic benefit efficiency were the main constraints of local agriculture development the objective was to maximize water use efficiency expressed as the economic benefits per cubic meter of water with a multitude of physical limitations in water and land resources the model tackled uncertain crop irrigation requirements with known nominal values and fluctuation ranges the developed model was solved under a number of combinations of fluctuation and pbv levels resulting in different sets of solutions the objective function value would increase with higher pbv levels or lower fluctuation levels higher pbv levels indicated lower protection levels and higher risks of irrigation water shortage lower fluctuation levels associated with narrower perturbation ranges of uncertain parameters could be achieved through meticulous investigation of data collection and analysis optimal plans generated from the rfp model implied that vegetables would be the preferred crop with the highest water use efficiency the order of the planting areas would be vegetables sunflowers corn cotton and wheat the developed rfp model was tested and validated through simulation experiments and comparisons against alternative models monte carlo simulations validated that the benefits claimed by the rfp model were sufficiently conservative and could be reliably achieved compared to local baseline conditions the rfp model substantially improved water use efficiency generating higher economic benefits from each cubic meter of water comparisons with other alternatives verified that the rfp model could provide unprejudiced measure of system efficiency ensure constraint feasibility at the expenses of a minor reduction in the objective function value and enhance the efficiency of water and land use in real word applications the rfp model results could provide a set of optimal crop planting patterns with quantified system violation risks based on these solutions decision makers could make plans according to their attitudes toward system profits and risk avoidance the developed approach is also applicable to other optimization problems that emphasize resource use efficiency under complex uncertainty the model formulation can be customized based on the site specific conditions without losses

7117,water use efficiency and uncertainty treatment are foci in the modeling of agricultural water management systems to address these challenging issues a robust fractional programming rfp method that coupled fractional programming with robust optimization was developed in this study to improve agricultural water use efficiency under uncertainty rfp improved upon the fractional programming by being able to tackle highly uncertain information without known distributions it also extended the capability of the robust optimization method in addressing ratio optimal problems to demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability rfp was applied to a long term agricultural water resources management problem in arid north west china where water scarcity and low water use efficiency hindered local development it generated benefit and risk explicit plans for crop pattern adjustments vegetables were recommended as the preferred crop a number of scenarios combining different fluctuation and protection levels were analyzed and interpreted with practical implications it was observed that higher water use efficiency could be achieved through reducing parametric uncertainty and risk aversion levels simulation experiments validated that the benefits claimed by the rfp model were sufficiently conservative and could be reliably achieved the comparisons of rfp results against the baseline operations and those from two other alternatives demonstrated that rfp could result in higher resource use efficiency and controllable system violation risks the developed approach is also applicable

semi arid areas across all industries agriculture is the largest consumer of water resources taking up about 70 of total water consumption kang 2017 agricultural water pressure will further aggravate

multi objective programming methods fractional programming fp has attracted more and more attentions in recent years fp optimized the ratio of two objectives with their original magnitudes such as output input benefit volume or benefit time mehra et al 2007 zhou et al 2015 it could thus provide an unprejudiced method for measuring system efficiency and effectively optimize marginal system benefits cui et al 2015 fp could better fit real world problems when the objective function is the quotient of physical and economic quantities emam 2013 charnes and cooper 1962 first developed a classic algorithm for linear fractional programming since then a great deal of work has been carried out the latest progress was reported in a review paper by stancu minasian 2017 in the past five decades fp has been widely used for increasing system efficiency in many fields such as financial and production planning mehra et al 2007 a few reported studies applied the fp method to address agricultural water management problems for instance amini fasakhodi et al 2010 assessed water resources sustainability and optimized cropping patterns through a multi objective fractional programming model mani et al 2016 optimized the conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources through a mixed integer linear fractional programming method zhao et al 2017 proposed a linear fractional programming model to coordinate multiple factors and promote agricultural water productivity although fp was proven effective for measuring the efficiency of agricultural water resources system uncertainties that were prevalent in all components of agricultural water management systems could not be realistically reflected in the previous fp studies agricultural water management systems involve plenty of uncertain factors and parameters that can hardly be expressed as deterministic values such as uncertain irrigation water requirements economic revenues and crop yields gui et al 2017 li et al 2013 2015 liu et al 2014 zeng et al 2014 dong et al 2015 uncertain parameters should thus be tackled in the planning models there were a few fp based studies dealing with uncertainty in agricultural water management for example guo et al 2014 tackled multiple uncertainties in agricultural water management problems that were expressed as probability distributions fuzzy sets and their combinations through formulating a fuzzy chance constrained linear fractional programming model cui et al 2015 addressed stochastic uncertainty in irrigation water management systems through the development of a two stage stochastic fractional programming model li et al 2016 handled interval uncertainties and improved irrigation water productivity through the formulation of an interval fractional programming model zhang and guo 2017 dealt with fuzziness existing in irrigation water allocation problems based on a generalized fuzzy credibility constrained linear fractional programming method fu et al 2017 handled stochastic water availability and optimized agricultural water use structure through integrating chance constrained programming conditional value at risk and fractional programming most of them dealt with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and or stochastic variables with unknown possibility and or probabilistic distributions stancu minasian 2017 tan et al 2015 nevertheless these fractional programming studies could not deal with uncertain parameters without detailed distributions nor quantify system violation risks arising from such uncertainties to provide reliable and risk explicit solutions under deep uncertainty without distribution information robust optimization could be a promising way robust optimization focused on solving the worst case with the most unfavorable uncertainty gabrel et al 2014 in its early development stage the algorithms were mostly ultraconservative and difficult to solve naderi and pishvaee 2017 bertsimas and sim 2003 proposed a robust optimization method that allowed controlling the degree of conservatism and was relatively easy for computation robust optimization has been used in the planning of asset inventory finance and energy systems gabrel et al 2014 dong et al 2013 for instance palma and nelson 2010 applied the robust optimization method to support decision making on forest harvest scheduling tan et al 2010 developed a radial interval linear programming to tackle highly uncertain information in waste management problems parisio et al 2012 applied robust optimization methods to address an energy hub operation problem however robust optimization methods were hardly used to address agricultural water management problems under uncertainty especially when multiple objectives were involved therefore this paper aims at developing a robust fractional programming rfp method that not only deals with ratio multi objective problems but also enhances the robustness of optimal plans for supporting agricultural water management under complex uncertainties the applicability of the developed rfp method will be demonstrated through a case study of agricultural water management problems in arid and semi arid region of china the obtained modeling results could provide decision makers with optimal adjustment plans for crop planting structures and inform them with associated water shortage risks this paper is organized as follows the development of the rfp method is explained in section 2 the developed rfp method is applied to a real world case in north west china in section 3 in section 4 the results are interpreted and compared validation and comparisons are discussed in section 5 and section 6 provides concluding remarks of this research 2 development of robust fractional programming method in many real word problems there usually exist multiple hard to coordinate objectives such as maximized economic income and minimized resources input one of the ultimate solutions for coordinating these conflicting objectives is to strengthen system efficiency which can essentially be considered as a ratio optimization problem at the same time uncertainty that is ubiquitous in the processes components and factors of agricultural water management systems cannot be ignored in many cases precise fluctuation information of uncertain parameters is difficult to obtain to overcome the inabilities of existing programming methods in simultaneously tackling ratio optimization problems and complex uncertainties a rfp method is proposed in this paper in rfp the objective function is expressed as the outputs divided by the inputs moreover uncertain parameters without detailed distribution information are coped with in the constraints a general rfp model can be formulated as follows 1a max f j 1 n c j x j α j 1 n d j x j ε subject to 1b j 1 n a ij x j b i i m i k 1c j 1 n a kj x j b k k m k i 1d x j 0 j 1 2 n where a kj b k c j d j x j r a ij b i r α and ε are scalar constants r is the set of real numbers and r donates the set of uncertain variables with known fluctuation ranges but unknown symmetric distributions the values of such uncertain coefficient a ij fall within a fluctuation range a ij a ij a ij a ij where a ij represents the deterministic nominal value of a ij and a ij is the fluctuation radius around the nominal value that determines the size of fluctuation range assume that the objective function 1a is constantly differentiable and the solution set is nonempty and bounded zhu et al 2014 the objective function can be transformed into a linear expression and solved by introducing a new variable r r r under the condition that the denominator is positive and constant in sign zhu et al 2014 charnes and cooper 1962 mani et al 2016 model 1 can thus be transformed to its linear form as follows 2a max g y 1 y 2 y n r j 1 n c j y j α r subject to 2b j 1 n a ij y j b i r i m i k 2c k 1 n a kj y j b k r k m k i 2d j 1 n d j y j ε r 1 2e y j 0 j 1 2 n 2f r 0 where y j is the new decision variable and the original decision variable x j equals to y j r as the uncertain parameters remain unsolved in model 2 robust optimization is introduced in the next step to tackle them bertsimas and sim 2003 palma and nelson 2009 a new parameter γ i named protection level is introduced reflecting the maximal number of uncertain coefficients that are protected against perturbations protection level γ i takes n at most when all coefficients are considered uncertain protection level γ i is not necessarily an integer if γ i 0 constraint i is tantamount to a deterministic one since all uncertain coefficients are forced to take their nominal values if γ i n coefficients are all allowed to take any values within their fluctuation ranges and if 0 γ i n up to γ i coefficients are allowed to take values other than the nominal ones while the feasibility of constraint is guaranteed to transform the constraints with uncertain parameters into deterministic ones a protection function β with a given solution vector y is introduced to constraint 2b 3a j 1 n a ij y j β y γ i b i r i the protection function is formulated as follows 3b β y γ i max s i t i s i j i t i j i s i c a r d s i γ i j s i a ij y j γ i γ i a ij y j where j i denotes the number of uncertain parameters in constraint i the protection function accommodates the variations of a subset s i j i of uncertain coefficients as specified by the protection level when up to γ i uncertain parameters take values within a fluctuation radius of a ij and one extra coefficient take values within a radius of γ i γ i a ij the feasibility of constraint can be guaranteed even if more uncertain parameters take values other than their nominal values the constraint remains feasible with high probability the protection function is then transformed into an optimization model and the linear expression can be obtained through its dual model palma and nelson 2009 the robust counterpart of constraint 2b is obtained and developed as follows 3c j 1 n a ij y j z i γ i j j i p ij b i r i 3d z i p ij a ij y j i j j i 3e p ij 0 i j j i 3f z i 0 i where z i and p ij are the auxiliary variables introduced through dual model transformation based on the method introduced above model 1 can be transformed into the following linear deterministic version that can be easily solved 4a max g y 1 y 2 y n r j 1 n c j y j α r subject to 4b j 1 n a ij y j z i γ i j j i p ij b i i m i k 4c z i p ij a ij y j i m i k j j i 4d j 1 n a kj y j b k r k m k i 4e j 1 n d j y j ε r 1 4f y j 0 j 1 2 n 4g p ij 0 i m i k j j i 4h z i 0 i m i k 4i r 0 through solving model 4 solutions of y j and r j can be obtained as yj opt and r opt and the optimal solutions of the original decision variables can be obtained as x j opt y j opt r opt protection function as a function of γ i can guarantee that the model is feasible if less than γ i parameters change within their fluctuation ranges the probability bound of violation pbv is proposed to approximate the constraint violation risk levels when more than γ i parameters take values other than their nominal ones it can be defined as the maximal chance that constraint i is violated tan et al 2010 pbv can be obtained through the following formula bertsimas and sim 2004 5 pbv n γ i 1 2 n 1 μ l ϑ n n l μ l ϑ 1 n n l 1 2 n 1 μ n ϑ l ϑ 1 n n l where n j i ϑ γ i n 2 and μ ϑ ϑ fig 1 illustrates the framework of the rfp method the solution process of the rfp model can be briefly summarized into six steps as follows step 1 formulate the original rfp model based on the real case problems where uncertain coefficients are expressed as fluctuation ranges i e model 1a 1d step 2 transform the fractional objective function of rfp model into a linear one through introducing a new variable r i e model 2a 2f step 3 introduce the protection function into the uncertain constraints and transform the uncertain constraints into their robust counterparts i e model 3a 3f step 4 corresponding to a user defined protection level solve the linear expression of rfp model i e model 4a 4i step 5 calculate the pbv of user defined protection level which quantified constraint violation risk if more coefficients than the pointed protection level are fluctuated beyond the ranges i e model 5 step 6 obtain y j opt and get the solution of the original decision variables x j opt through dividing y j opt by r opt 3 application 3 1 descriptions of the study problem the developed rfp method has been applied to address a real world agricultural water management problem in minqin county which lies in the lower reaches of the arid shiyang river basin china 101 49 41 104 12 10 e 38 3 45 39 27 37 n fig 2 being surrounded by two deserts minqin played an important role of ecological barrier to prevent desert intersections in north west china it belongs to one of the driest areas in china facing serious desertification crises minqin has an arid climate feng et al 2011 the annual mean precipitation is as little as 113 mm whereas the annual evaporation is as high as 2624 mm deserts occupies 89 8 of the total area in minqin there are three irrigation districts in the study area namely changing huanhe and hongyashan hongyashan is the largest irrigation district taking up 92 8 of the total irrigation area li and guo 2014 irrigated agriculture was the largest water consumer in the study area accounting for more than 90 of the total water consumption the main water sources include surface water from the shiyang river and groundwater changning and huanhe districts solely depend on groundwater for irrigation hongyashan is a mixed irrigation district a reservoir to the south of the irrigation area makes it possible for hongyashan district to use released surface water economic development and population growth in the upper and middle reaches of shiyang river have reduced the available surface water discharged to hongyashan the utilization rate of surface water in the shiyang river basin reached as high as 172 in 2000 which was ranked as the highest in china kang 2008 insufficiencies of surface water supply and the great demands for irrigation water have led to over exploitation of groundwater the groundwater storage in minqin has been facing a serious crisis feng et al 2011 to alleviate water shortage jingdian water diversion project has been constructed to transfer water to this area minqin is one of the national commodity grain bases where local residents mainly depend on agricultural income gross agricultural production accounted for 63 of the regional total output value the main crops included wheat corn cotton sunflowers and vegetables due to the sharp drop in water flow from the upper reaches and the over exploitation of groundwater there has been a severe shortage of agricultural irrigation water it is thus of great significance to improve the utilization efficiency of irrigation water and make the most economic benefits from the limited water resources adjusting crop planting structure has been viewed as an effective way to optimize the use of water resources in the meantime coefficients such as gross irrigation water requirements are usually uncertain which requires treatment in the modelling process to make reliable decisions gross irrigation water requirements can be calculated according to the net irrigation water requirements and utilization efficiency coefficient of irrigation water to solve this problem an agricultural water management model was established based on the developed rfp method the planning horizon was 15 years from 2016 to 2030 which was further divided into three periods with five years in each period the data were gathered from field surveys and a comprehensive review of literatures such as local statistical yearbooks as well as governmental reports and documents for future planning periods parameters related to crop yields prices costs and utilization efficiencies of irrigation water were considered to steadily increase irrigation water prices for crop cultivation were acquired from the governmental documents the basic crop related data including yields prices costs and irrigation water requirements over the planning horizon are presented in table 1 3 2 robust fractional model for supporting agricultural water management in this study the objective was to improve agricultural water use efficiency which represented the economic returns obtained from the consumption of each cubic meter of water resources in irrigated agriculture the objective function is expressed as follows 6a max f max i 1 5 t 1 3 j 1 2 k 1 3 a ijkt y it b it c ijt i 1 5 j 1 2 t 1 3 k 1 3 a ijkt i q ijt where f is the objective function value

application yuan ha i q ijt denotes the net irrigation water requirement for each crop m3 ha the constraints included four aspects water availability constraints restricted that the total irrigation water consumption would not exceed the regulated limit since surface water was not available for changning and huanhe districts the area irrigated by surface water was set to be zero in these two districts food demand constraints considered the basic food requirements for feeding residents planting area constraints limited that the total planting land would be no more than the available cultivation area proportional planting area constraints guaranteed that the planting area of each crop at a certain irrigation district and in a certain planning period occupied a proper proportion of the cultivated land such percentages were deprived from the historical cultivation area data the detailed constraints are presented below water availability constraints 6b i 1 5 j 1 2 k 1 3 g i q ijt

and scenario analyses the optimal plans of agricultural water management at minqin county were obtained from solving the above rfp model either deterministic values or precise distributions of g i q ijk were not available instead it could be expressed as a fluctuation range between g i q ijk g i q ijk and g i q ijk g i q ijk defined by a nominal value g i q ijk and its fluctuation radius g i q ijk fig 3 through consultation with local stakeholders two fluctuation radii for g i q ijk corresponding to lower and higher degrees of data uncertainty were considered which were 0 1 g i q ijk and 0 2 g i q ijk they are respectively referred to as the low and high fluctuation levels hereinafter for simplicity in this study the rfp model was solved under a number of scenarios combining different fluctuation and pbv levels three of which were identified as the main scenarios for the interpretation and comparisons of results a low pbv level at 10 and a high pbv level at 20 were examined among the three main scenarios these main scenarios included scenario r1 with the high fluctuation level but low pbv level r2 with the high fluctuation and pbv levels and r3 with the low fluctuation level but high pbv level in the following results from scenario r1 are interpreted in detail which are then compared against those obtained from scenarios r2 and r3 crop planting patterns obtained from scenario r1 are shown in fig 4 in changning district vegetables would have the largest planting area followed by sunflowers corn and wheat sunflowers and vegetables would occupy as much as 66 of the total planting area over the planning horizon except that vegetables cultivation areas would remain unchanged planting areas of other crops would decrease from period 1 to period 3 cotton would not be planted in changning in line with the current planting practices planting areas of corn would account for the largest portion in huanhe district over the planning horizon which would be in alignment with the historic preference over corn cultivation in this district planting areas of corn would slightly decrease in period 2 and remain unchanged in period 3 decreased areas of corn in the next two planning periods suggest that corn would not be the most economical planting choice sunflowers would be the second popular crop and its planting areas would remain unchanged during the planning horizon planting areas of vegetables would be less than sunflowers at first but notably increase in the following periods indicating that vegetables would be a better choice for economic benefits and water saving requirements wheat would have the smallest planting areas satisfying the basic production requirements cotton would not be planted in huanhe in hongyashan district vegetables would be the most popular crop taking up about 26 of the total planting area on average in the three planning periods cultivation areas of vegetables would gradually expand over the planning horizon this was probably because of the high economic return from vegetables cultivation corn would be ranked as the second popular crop in the first period but overtaken by sunflowers in the following two periods cotton would only be planted in this district with a minimum area to meet the basic production requirements this was due to the higher water consumption and lower economic return of cotton cultivation cultivation areas of both corn and cotton would markedly decrease in periods 2 and 3 wheat would have the least planting areas and keep the same cultivation scale throughout the planning horizon in terms of irrigation water sources both surface water and groundwater are available in hongyashan district sunflowers would only rely on surface water for irrigation in the three periods and this would also be the case for corn in periods 1 and 2 all other crops would be irrigated by both groundwater and surface water surface water would irrigate more than 50 of the land planted with wheat and cotton groundwater would respectively irrigate 18 30 and 30 of the planting area for vegetables in the three periods in general surface water would be the main water source in hongyashan district irrigating about 82 of the total cultivate land over the planning horizon under scenario r1 the planting areas of changning and hongyashan districts would decrease gradually over the planning horizon in contrast the total planting area of huanhe district would increase from periods 1 2 and then drop in period 3 the total planting areas of crops over the planning horizon is shown in fig 5 vegetables would occupy the largest planting area sequentially followed by sunflowers corn cotton and wheat as shown in fig 6 the total planting area in the entire study area would decline over the planning horizon dropping from 28 220 ha to 26 206 ha averagely the total planting area would take up 66 of all the arable land over the planning horizon correspondingly the total water consumption would reduce from 1 09 108 to 1 02 108 m3 over the planning horizon the maximized benefit from every cubic meter of water would be 18 35 yuan the saved cultivation land and water resources could be used for other economic activities or environmental purposes the saved area could be used for afforestation to prevent the desert invasion and the saved water resources could be used as supplementary water of local lakes for ecological restoration solutions from scenario r2 were also obtained for comparisons with r1 figs 4 6 in terms of planting patterns the differences between the two scenarios would be minor in changning district compared to r1 only the planting area of sunflowers in period 3 would slightly decrease under r2 planting areas of vegetables would increase in huanhe and hongyashan districts compared to scenario r1 this is mainly because that higher water availability under r2 would make it possible to grow more vegetables which have the highest economic benefits but relatively high water requirements meanwhile irrigation water sources would change dramatically sunflowers would still choose surface water for irrigation instead of utilizing mixed sources under r1 both wheat and corn would select surface water under r2 both cotton and vegetables would still rely on mixed water sources for irrigation under r2 but the preferences would shift from surface water under r1 to groundwater compared to r1 groundwater irrigated areas of vegetables under r2 would increase by 2 167 1 367 and 211 ha respectively cotton would utilize more groundwater under r2 gradually shifting from two water sources in the first two periods to groundwater only in the last period the share of surface water irrigated area would reduce from 82 under r1 to 78 under r2 in spite of the slight changes in the cultivation areas of sunflowers and vegetables the priority order of the five crops would remain to the same as r1 in terms of the total cultivation land 489 more hectares of land would be cultivated under r2 compared to r1 correspondingly water consumption under r2 would increase by 1 64 106 m3 although the total water consumption would increase the economic benefit gained from every cubic meter of water under r2 would be 0 88 higher than that of r1 such an increase in water use efficiency under r2 would be associated with additional 10 chance of system violation compared to r1 solutions from scenario r3 were also compared to those under r1 figs 4 6 in changning district there would be no obvious differences between these two sets of results in huanhe district the planting areas of vegetables in the three periods under r3 would respectively be 28 24 and 23 higher than those under r1 similarly more vegetables would be planted in hongyashan district under r3 the cultivation areas of vegetables would increase 357 ha planting areas of other crops in hongyashan would remain unchanged compared to r1 surface water would still be the main source servicing 73 of the total irrigated area over the planning horizon similar to r1 solutions sunflowers would solely be irrigated with surface water in periods 1 3 irrigation water for corn fields in period 1 would turn from mixed sources under r1 to surface water only under r3 wheat would turn to rely on surface water under r3 rather than mixed sources under r1 although cotton and vegetables would still use mixed water sources for irrigation groundwater would play a more important role for them under r3 compared to r1 2 432 more hectares of cotton would be irrigated by groundwater in period 1 and groundwater would gradually become the single water source for cotton in the last two periods under r3 as well additional 2 167 983 1 325 ha of vegetables would be irrigated by groundwater over the planning horizon under r3 the order of the planting areas of crops would be the same as r1 as shown in fig 5 the planting areas in the entire study area under r3 would respectively be 28 771 27 525 and 26 399 ha in the three periods compared to r1 the total planting area under r3 would increase 937 ha and the total water consumption would be 2 90 106 m3 more over the planning horizon the economic benefit per cubic meter of water would be 2 16 higher than that under r1 such an increase in water use efficiency could be attributed to less rigid protection against data perturbations with smaller fluctuation ranges and lower protection levels being considered schemes for crop planting areas and irrigation water utilization would vary significantly with the three scenarios under all of the three scenarios vegetables would be the most preferred which could be attributed to its higher economic gains the comparisons of results from these three scenarios suggest that economic benefits per cubic meter of water i e the objective function value would increase with higher pbv levels or lower fluctuation levels although higher objective function values could be achieved under higher pbv levels system violation risks would also be inevitably raised due to lower protection levels and relaxed constraints lower fluctuation levels could also lead to higher objective function values which could be attributed to narrower ranges of fluctuations and lower values of protection functions meanwhile the system violation risks under lower fluctuation levels would increase due to the weakened capability of the model to accommodate a wider range of data perturbations understanding such tradeoffs would be helpful for decision makers to choose optimal schemes according to their expectations over water use efficiency and tolerance attitudes toward water shortage risks besides the above three main scenarios more scenarios were examined in this study through gradually increasing pbv from 5 to 55 under the low and high fluctuation levels fig 7 illustrates how the objective function value i e economic benefit per cubic meter of water would vary along with the changes in the pbv reversely protection level and uncertainty level of parameters higher pbvs indicate lower protection levels and higher risks for irrigation water shortage as pbv increases the benefits gained from consuming one cubic meter of water would climb such an increase would be more notably under the higher level of uncertainty it can be observed that under the same pbv the objective function value would increase as the level of parameter uncertainty decreases this implies that reducing the level of parameter uncertainty would help gain higher agricultural water use efficiency and enhance system efficiency this could be achieved through investing more resources in the process of data collection and analysis for the sake of irrigation water requirement with less uncertainty 5 validation and discussions simulation experiments were run to validate the proposed rfp approach in addition the results from the rfp model were compared with status quo conditions and those from two alternative models to assess its performance and merits in the monte carlo simulations two hundred sets of simulated model inputs in other words two hundred simulated scenarios of uncertain coefficients were used to test the performance of the developed approach in the face of uncertain water demands for crop cultivation in each set a set of deterministic values were used to simulate one combination of uncertain parameter realizations to be in line with the scenario analyses in section 4 the low and high fluctuation levels were respectively examined with one hundred sets of inputs sampled for each fig 7 compares the objective function value e g economic benefit per cubic meter of water obtained from the rfp model and the simulated runs under the low fluctuation level the objective function value obtained from the deterministic simulated runs ranged from 18 85 to 18 88 yuan m3 in comparison the lowest unit benefit from the rfp model would be 18 74 yuan m3 when pbv was set to be as low as 5 being merely 0 6 lower than the average of the simulated results the unit benefit from the rfp would be almost the same as the average from the simulated runs while pbv reached 64 under the high fluctuation level inputs with higher level of uncertainty would lead to results fluctuating within wider ranges which varied from 18 79 to 18 89 yuan m3 similarly the results from the rfp model under the high fluctuation level would be mostly lower than those from the simulated runs but became very close to the simulated average when pbv climbed to 60 it could thus be observed that the objective function value from the rfp model would be mostly a bit lower than those from the simulated runs for the sake of high probabilities of constraint feasibility this validates that the benefits claimed by the rfp model are sufficiently conservative and can be reliably achieved moreover optimal plans obtained from the rfp model were compared with three others which included the benchmark agricultural practices in the base year of 2015 the plans from a deterministic fractional programming model without uncertain parameters and the plans from a conventional robust optimization model with a single linear objective according to the data recorded in the local statistical yearbooks table 2 the economic benefit gained from the consumption of one cubic meter of water was 10 92 yuan in real world practices for the base year of 2015 in contrast the optimal planting structures recommended by the rfp method would provide significantly higher unit economic benefits from each cubic meter of water taking r1 the most conservative one among the three main scenarios as an example the unit economic gain could have been raised by 7 43 yuan m3 if the optimal plans generated from the rfp model were adopted with regard to the total economic benefit although the total economic benefit under scenario r1 would be 18 lower than that in the base year 23 of irrigation water resources and 24 of planting area would be saved this suggests that the planting patterns from the developed method would be helpful for boosting regional agricultural water use efficiency from the perspective of economic productivity a deterministic fractional programming model dfp was formulated to solve the same problem differing from the rfp model uncertainty in parameters was not considered assuming that all of the parameters would take the nominal values only one set of simplified deterministic values were used as inputs in dfp in fact the dfp model represents a single special case among the numerous ones considered in the rfp model unlike rfp that would protect the model from sub optimality or infeasibility associated with data perturbations the dfp solutions would be far from reliable when any of the input parameters take values other than the given deterministic ones in real world problems taking scenario r1 as an example the economic benefit per cubic meter of water from the rfp model would be 2 7 lower compared to the dfp results this minor reduction in the objective function value would be acceptable since the rfp model could sharply reduce the system violation risk by 49 assuming that the protection level in model 5 equals to zero through taking the complex uncertainty into consideration under scenarios r2 and r3 such a reduction in unit economic gain would be even more negligible this implies that the rfp model could significantly enhance the system reliability inversely system violation risks with a trivial compromise in terms of system optimality to demonstrate the advantages of optimizing the water use efficiency in fractional forms a conventional robust optimization ro model was also formulated for comparison the ro model aimed at maximizing the total net economic benefits acquired from irrigated agriculture in other words the original objective function in model 6 was replaced by the following formula 6a max f max i 1 5 t 1 3 j 1 2 k 1 3 a ijkt y it b it c ijt this non fractional model shared the same constraints with the developed rfp model and was solved through the conventional ro algorithm the ro results were obtained under the same combinations of fluctuation and pbv levels i e scenarios r1 r2 and r3 with the rfp results it can be observed that such changes in the model structure would lead to significant variations in the solutions for decision variables and objective function values the comparisons between rfp and ro results with regard to the planting areas of different crops are shown in fig 5 in ro sunflowers would replace vegetables to be the dominant crop occupying the largest area fig 8 illustrates the variations in the total economic benefits total water consumption total planting area economic benefits per cubic meter of water and economic benefits per hectare of land when comparing the ro results against the rfp solutions as a result of its sole interest in economic gains the ro model could achieve slightly higher total economic benefits than rfp which would come at the cost of increased water consumption and land use from the perspective of economic benefits per cubic meter of water rfp outperforms ro under all of the three scenarios with higher water and land use efficiency for instance compared to the ro model the rfp model would respectively gain 6 and 7 more economic benefits from each cubic meter of water and each hectare of land while consuming 11 less water and occupying 12 less cultivation land under r3 therefore rfp outweighs ro through effectively tackling interrelationships among various factors and analyzing tradeoffs between economic gains and resources consumption in real world applications rfp method could help decision makers make overarching master plans of crop planting pattern compared with the baseline condition rfp results would substantially improve water use efficiency generating in higher economic benefits from each cubic meter of water rfp also demonstrates advantages over the existing alternative programming methods the rfp method could improve over the dfp method in terms of uncertainty treatment and system violation risk management compared with the ro method rfp method could effectively balance conflicting interests e g benefits gain and resources consumption and provide compromised solutions with relatively high resource use efficiency through integrating fp and ro into a general framework the developed rfp method could provide an unprejudiced measure for system efficiency expressed as ratio optimal problems moreover rfp could tackle complex uncertainties without precise distribution information through directly communicating numerous combinations of uncertain inputs into the modeling process and providing results with explicit benefit and risk tradeoffs the robust formulation of rfp could significantly reduce the efforts of sensitivity analyses that aimed at investigating the impacts of uncertain inputs in previous studies it could be capable of protecting the solutions from infeasibilities and controlling system violation risks while remaining to be computationally tractable rfp model could provide decision makers with compromised results among economic gain water resources consumption and solution reliability decision makers could thus choose the optimal results based on desired objective values e g economic benefit per cubic meter of water and their tolerance levels for unforeseeable system violation risks 6 conclusions modeling of agricultural water resources management problems is complicated with uncertainties a rfp method along with its solving algorithm has been introduced in this study and was applied to improve water use efficiency in agricultural production through integrating the fractional programming and robust optimization methods into a general framework the developed rfp method could simultaneously tackle ratio optimization problems and complex uncertainty uncertain parameters with known ranges but unknown symmetric distributions could be tackled by virtue of adjustable protection levels rfp method could provide optimal solutions that compromise between desired objective values and potential system violation risks in general the rfp method demonstrated the following advantages i it improved upon the fractional programming by being able to tackle highly uncertain information without known distributions ii it extended the capability of the robust optimization method in addressing ratio optimal problems such as output input benefit volume or benefit time iii it could provide decision makers with risk explicit results and iv it was computationally tractable with a linearizing algorithm the proposed rfp method was applied to an agricultural water resources management problem in north west china where limited irrigation water resources and low economic benefit efficiency were the main constraints of local agriculture development the objective was to maximize water use efficiency expressed as the economic benefits per cubic meter of water with a multitude of physical limitations in water and land resources the model tackled uncertain crop irrigation requirements with known nominal values and fluctuation ranges the developed model was solved under a number of combinations of fluctuation and pbv levels resulting in different sets of solutions the objective function value would increase with higher pbv levels or lower fluctuation levels higher pbv levels indicated lower protection levels and higher risks of irrigation water shortage lower fluctuation levels associated with narrower perturbation ranges of uncertain parameters could be achieved through meticulous investigation of data collection and analysis optimal plans generated from the rfp model implied that vegetables would be the preferred crop with the highest water use efficiency the order of the planting areas would be vegetables sunflowers corn cotton and wheat the developed rfp model was tested and validated through simulation experiments and comparisons against alternative models monte carlo simulations validated that the benefits claimed by the rfp model were sufficiently conservative and could be reliably achieved compared to local baseline conditions the rfp model substantially improved water use efficiency generating higher economic benefits from each cubic meter of water comparisons with other alternatives verified that the rfp model could provide unprejudiced measure of system efficiency ensure constraint feasibility at the expenses of a minor reduction in the objective function value and enhance the efficiency of water and land use in real word applications the rfp model results could provide a set of optimal crop planting patterns with quantified system violation risks based on these solutions decision makers could make plans according to their attitudes toward system profits and risk avoidance the developed approach is also applicable to other optimization problems that emphasize resource use efficiency under complex uncertainty the model formulation can be customized based on the site specific conditions without losses

condition and constant soil water content at the beginning of a soil column it does not make any prior assumptions about the form of the diffusivity function the nonlinear solution is of simple combination of power and exponential functions and expresses in explicit form the distance as function of time and soil water content it involves all the physical parameters and four additional fitting parameters which can be obtained by simple fitting procedure algebraic expressions that quantify the main infiltration process are derived from the basic equation these include the sorptivity the infiltration rate the cumulative infiltration rate and the wetting front a comparison with exact numerical and other analytical solutions validates the accuracy of the approximation and shows its advantage to other approximate solutions the analytical expressions are used to predict experimental soil moisture profiles from simple measurements such as sorptivity wetting front and initial and

unsaturated flow analytical solution estimating hydraulic parameters soil water diffusivity 1 introduction the movement of water through unsaturated soils is mathematically described by the richards equation which combines the effects of both conduction due to gravity and diffusion due to capillarity when gravity is neglected it reduces to a diffusion type equation describing absorption i e infiltration into horizontal systems solutions of the absorption equation have the theoretical importance that they yield the limiting small time behavior of transient infiltration processes even when gravity cannot be neglected and so provide a basic point of departure for the solution of the richards equation philip 1969 analytical solutions for the absorption equation are important since they represent an efficient mathematical tool for the estimation of hydraulic parameters without the need of numerical methods which are expensive to employ due to excessive memory and computational time requirements shao and horton 1998 wang et al 2002 2004 ma et al 2009 2010 2016 evangelides et al 2010 moreover they can be used as reference solutions to verify numerical schemes unlike the vertical

zimmerman and bodvarsson 1991 proposed an approximate solution for horizontal infiltration in a brooks corey medium by assuming piecewise linear saturation profile hang and zhiqiang 1997 used the method of separation of variables together with boltzmann transform method to find out an analytical solution of the horizontal absorption equation for the case of an exponential diffusivity form witelski 1998 obtained a long time asymptotic similarity solution for horizontal absorption from a constant source into a homogeneous layer of soil with a preexisting moisture distribution prasad and salomon 2005 presented a method for the analytical solution of a degenerate diffusion equation with power law diffusivity function the solutions can be used to model horizontal infiltration into dry

equation with brooks corey model based on the least action and variational principles in the present paper an original method for deriving approximate analytical solutions of the horizontal absorption equation is presented the proposed model does not take any prior assumptions about the form of the diffusivity function the method is adaptable for problems with instantaneous jump in the initial soil water content position at the fixed end of a semi infinite domain it allows the derivation of results of practical importance in soil physics the approximate solution can be used to predict soil moisture profile as well as for estimating hydraulic parameters the method applies for various diffusivity forms and its limitation is discussed in detail the paper is organized as follows section 2

diffusivity models section 5 concludes the work 2 theory 2 1 governing equations the one dimensional nonlinear diffusion equation describing horizontal flow of water in unsaturated soil with boundary and initial conditions for absorption is given by bruce and klute 1956 1 θ t x d θ θ x 2 θ θ 0 x 0 t 0 3 θ θ i x 0 t 0 4 θ θ i x t 0 where t is time t x is the horizontal position l θ is the volumetric soil water content l 3 l 3 d is the soil water diffusivity l 2 t and θ 0 and θ i are the boundary and initial soil water contents l 3 l 3 which verify θ 0 θ i for horizontal absorption this problem has a well known boltzmann type similarity solution θ x t θ ξ where the similarity variable is ξ x t 1 2 and the similarity function θ ξ satisfies the nonlinear ordinary differential equation klute 1952 bruce and klute 1956 philip 1955 5 ξ 2 θ ξ ξ d θ θ ξ 6 θ θ 0 ξ 0 7 θ θ i ξ philip 1957 introduced the term sorptivity s defining the capacity of the porous medium to absorb or desorb water by capillarity and expressing it as 8 s θ i θ 0 ξ d θ philip 1969 showed that sorptivity can be determined from the cumulative infiltration i t θ i θ 0 x d θ as follows 9 i t s t the absorption or infiltration rate v 0 which is also the flow velocity at x 0 is defined by philip 1969 10 v o t d i t d t s 2 t let s define the following nondimensional variables 11 θ θ θ r θ s θ r ξ ξ d 0 d d d 0 where θ is the normalized soil water content or effective saturation θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated soil water contents l 3 l 3 respectively ξ is the nondimensional boltzmann variable d 0 is the value of d at θ 0 which is constant depending on the soil properties l 2 t and d d θ is the nondimensional soil water diffusivity introducing 11 into 5 7 yields the following nondimensional problem 12 ξ 2 d θ d ξ d d ξ d θ d θ d ξ 13 θ θ 0 ξ 0 14 θ θ i ξ where θ i and θ 0 are the initial and boundary effective saturations the nondimensional sorptivity s is defined by 15 s θ i θ 0 ξ d θ s θ s θ r d 0 multiplying both sides of 12 by d ξ d θ and integrating between the limits θ i and θ yields 16 d θ 1 2 θ i θ ξ d θ d ξ d θ in the derivation of equation 16 the condition θ θ i d θ d ξ 0 was used this condition is a consequence of conditions 13 and 14 philip 1960a b proposed a general method of exact solutions to 16 for θ i 0 and presented several exact solutions the method consisted in selecting functions ξ ξ θ satisfying the conditions 13 and 14 for which the integral in 16 is solvable analytically this method leads to many exact solutions but it does not apply to a priori given diffusivity function because the expression of this latter depends on the selected function ξ θ in what follows an original method of approximate solutions is presented which applies for a given predefined diffusivity function 2 2 solution method let s first define a function f as follows 17 f θ θ i θ ξ d θ eq 16 writes then as follows 18 d θ 1 2 f θ f θ where f θ d ξ d θ is the second derivative of f with respect to θ note that f θ s is the soil water flux saturation relationship introduced by philip 1973 the method consists in assuming that f θ is expressed in the following mathematical form 19 f θ a θ θ i m e c θ θ i n b θ θ i where a b c m and n are unknown parameters to be determined such that a 0 c 0 m 1 and 2 m n 1 0 these conditions on the parameters a b c m and n are justified in appendix a the choice of the functional form 19 is discussed in section 2 4 based on 19 the analytical expression of ξ θ f θ is obtained as follows 20 ξ θ a m n c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n b the nondimensional wetting front ξ f is the value of ξ at which the effective saturation reaches θ i this gives b ξ f from 20 therefore the analytical expression of ξ θ becomes 21 ξ θ a m n c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n ξ f where ξ f is obtained by using 13 and 21 so that 22 ξ f a m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n it is important to mention that the proposed solution 21 satisfies the following three conditions philip 1960a b 1969 which are required for its existence i ξ θ 0 0 the condition imposed by 13 ii the functions f θ and ξ θ exist both by definition of 17 iii f θ 0 this condition imposed by the nonnegativity of d in the range θ i θ θ 0 this condition is proved in appendix a note that when the nondimensional diffusivity is finite nonzero at θ 0 the wetting front is practically reached at infinity i e ξ f in that case the wetting front is assumed to be reached at θ ε where ε is an arbitrary small number in practice ε is chosen to be equal to 10 5 the nondimensional sorptivity satisfies s f θ 0 therefore it can be expressed analytically in terms of the unknown parameters based on 19 21 and 22 as follows 23 s a 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n eq 21 is the approximate solution of eqs 12 14 it expresses the nondimensional boltzmann variable ξ as function of the normalized soil water content θ for any θ between θ i and θ 0 the dimensionless wetting front and sorptivity are defined by 22 and 23 respectively the analytical approximate expressions 21 23 involve four parameters a c m and n which must be determined as follows eq 18 may be rewritten in terms of the unknown parameters after using 19 this gives 24 d θ a 2 2 n 2 c 2 θ θ i 2 n n c 2 m n 1 θ θ i n m m 1 θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n eq 24 shows that the nondimensional soil water diffusivity is expressed in terms of the unknowns parameters the idea is that for a given soil water diffusivity the unknown parameters a c m and n may be determined by fitting the curve defined by the mathematical function of the right hand side rhs of eq 24 to the curve of the real nondimensional diffusivity function at the left hand side lhs of 24 starting from an initial set of parameters the set which gives the best fit between the two curves is adopted in eqs 21 23 the fitting procedure is briefly discussed in section 3 2 3 analytical expressions in the x t domain the analytical expressions 21 23 can be used to determine the mathematical expression of any physical function or parameter of horizontal absorption in the x t domain these include the soil water content profile the wetting front the sorptivity the cumulative infiltration rate and the infiltration rate the soil water content profile may be determined implicitly x x θ t by using eqs 11 21 and the relationship ξ x t 1 2 this gives x ξ d 0 t therefore the distance is expressed in terms of the physical and fitting parameters as follows 25 x a d 0 t m n c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n x f t where x f t ξ f d 0 t is the position of the wetting front at time t defined as follows after using 22 26 x f t a d 0 t m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n the analytical expression of the sorptivity s can be obtained from 15 and 23 as follows 27 s a θ s θ r d 0 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n the substitution of 27 into 9 yields the analytical expression of the cumulative infiltration rate as function of the physical and fitting parameters 28 i t a θ s θ r d 0 t 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n finally the infiltration rate v 0 which is defined as v 0 t d i t d t can be obtained by deriving 28 with respect to time this gives 29 v 0 t 1 2 a θ s θ r d 0 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n t eqs 28 and 29 show that the cumulative infiltration rate is proportional to t while the infiltration rate is inversely proportional to t these results are well known in the theory of infiltration through soils note that eqs 26 28 and 29 can be converted to the following formulas 30 i t a 1 x f t 31 v 0 t a 2 x f t 32 x f 2 t a 3 t with 33 a 1 θ s θ r s ξ f θ s θ r m 1 n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m n c θ 0 θ i n 34 a 2 a 1 d 0 ξ f 2 2 1 2 a 2 d 0 θ s θ r m 1 n c θ 0 θ i n m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i 2 m 1 e 2 c θ 0 θ i n 35 a 3 2 a 2 a 1 d 0 ξ f 2 a 2 d 0 m n c θ 0 θ i n 2 θ 0 θ i 2 m 1 e 2 c θ 0 θ i n it can be easily shown from 9 33 35 that the sorptivity s is related to the parameters a 1 and a 2 by the following relationship s 2 a 1 a 2 the mathematical expressions 30 35 are useful to compare with numerical results and other existing analytical results such those proposed recently by su et al 2017 note that the relationship 35 between a 1 a 2 and a 3 is similar to the one found by su et al 2017 2 4 the functional form 19 as mentioned above the quantity f θ s is the soil water flux saturation relationship introduced by philip 1973 many researchers have developed generalized expressions of f θ s for more details about these expressions the reader is referred to evangelides et al 2005 who gave a review and a comparative study between several expressions recently ma et al 2017 derived a general expression of the soil water flux saturation relationship containing only one parameter this parameter is a function of the initial soil water content and the soil pore structure index that reflects the shape of the soil water retention curve here the empirical function 19 is proposed to f θ which is equivalent to the flux of water at the position associated to the normalized soil water content θ the function f θ is defined as the sum of two terms the first term is a combination of power and exponential functions of θ θ i and the second term is a linear function of θ θ i this specific choice is justified by the following points 1 the product of power and exponential functions provides a continuous and infinitely differentiable function this would result in a well defined diffusivity function 24 since this latter is defined as a product of f θ and f θ as shown in 18 2 the form 19 as function of θ θ i is chosen in such a way that f θ i 0 this condition is required by definition of f θ in 17 3 the second term in 19 is defined in such a way that the normalized soil water content profile admits a wetting front as shown in 21 and 22 it should be noted that the empirical function 19 is not unique and other function forms would be possible however preliminary numerical experiments show that the proposed empirical function applies successfully to a wide range of soil water diffusivity functions 3 materials and methods the unknow parameters a b m and n appearing in the analytical expressions can be determined by curve fitting to do that the rhs of eq 24 is denoted by d f θ a b m n fitted diffusivity then the segment θ i θ θ 0 is divided into n 1 equal intervals θ k 1 θ k with θ 0 θ i and θ n 1 the parameters a b m and n are then determined by carrying out and optimization procedure on the quantity k 0 n d f θ k a b m n d θ k 2 ε where ε is an arbitrary small number ε 0 in practical applications we take ε 10 6 starting from an initial set of parameters the set which gives the best fit between the two curves is adopted in the approximate solution in the present work the fitting procedure is performed by using the microsoft excel solver walsh and diamond 1995 to validate the proposed approximate solution the method is applied to various types of soil water diffusivity function the following specific form of the nondimensional diffusivity function philip 1960a is used to compare with an existing exact solution 36 d θ 1 2 p θ p 1 θ p 1 p in addition three real and well known soil water diffusivity functions are used to compare the approximate solution with calculated numerical results the first one is the brooks corey model defined by brooks and corey 1964 37 d θ d 0 θ 2 1 λ with d 0 k s h b λ θ s θ r where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t λ 0 is the pore size distribution index and h b is the air entry head value l called also the bubbling pressure the second one is the exponential model which has a nondimensional diffusivity function defined by tolikas et al 1980 tzimopoulos et al 2015 38 d θ d d 0 e β θ s θ r θ where β is a nondimensional parameter characterizing the soil type and d 0 d θ 0 e β θ s θ r θ 0 the third model is the van genuchten model with nondimensional diffusivity function defined as follows van genuchten 1980 39 d θ d d 0 θ 1 2 1 β 1 θ 1 β β 1 θ 1 β β 2 where d 0 1 β k s α β θ s θ r with α 1 l and β are two empirical parameters characterizing the soil type such that 0 β 1 experimental data are also used to predict soil water content profiles as well as to estimate the hydraulic parameters data from 10 soils ranging from sand to clay were taken from the literature the 10 soils were hagener sand selim et al 1970 hayden sandy loam whisler et al 1968 manawatu fine sandy loam clothier et al 1983 adelanto loam jackson 1963 edina silt loam selim et al 1970 nicollet sandy clay loam mcbride and horton 1985 fayette silty clay loam mcbride and horton 1985 panoche clay loam reichardt et al 1972 pine silty clay jackson 1963 and yolo clay nofziger 1978 these experimental data were frequently used in the literature see e g shao and horton 1998 evangelides et al 2010 tzimopoulos et al 2015 ma et al 2016 4 application and discussion 4 1 comparison with an existing exact solution the accuracy of the approximate solution 21 is investigated by comparing it with an existing exact solution the exact solution no 1 presented in table 1 of philip 1960a is used in this test this exact solution writes for any p 0 as follows 40 ξ θ 1 θ p the solution 40 corresponds to θ 0 1 and θ i 0 and to the specific form of the nondimensional diffusivity function defined by 36 fig 1 left panel shows a comparison between the exact nondimensional diffusivity function 36 and the corresponding fitted function 24 for four values of the parameter p the shape of the diffusivity function depends on the value of p it is concave for p 0 5 and p 1 and convex for p 3 while it admits an inflection point for p 2 i e it has both a convex and concave parts note that the case p 2 was already investigated by witelski 1997 1998 the values of the obtained fitted parameters are presented in table 1 it can be shown that for each value of p the exact and fitted diffusivity functions are matched perfectly to each other fig 1 right panel shows the comparison between the exact solution 40 and the proposed approximate solution 21 obtained with the values of the fitted parameters presented in table 1 a perfect match between the exact and the proposed approximate solutions is obtained for all values of p the accuracy of the approximate wetting front values determined from eq 22 is less than 0 00024 of the exact value which is equal to 1 4 2 comparison with calculated numerical solutions numerical computations of the master eq 1 with boundary and initial conditions 2 and 3 are carried out to test the performance of the approximate solutions with real soil water diffusivity in this test the well known brooks corey soil water diffusivity model 37 is used eq 1 is solved numerically for several soil types by applying the matlab solver pdepe www mathworks com which is a sophisticated solver capable to solve a nonlinear system of initial boundary value problems in one space variable and time the length of the domain is chosen to be large enough with respect to the time scale of interest to avoid the effect of the boundary condition at the downstream data corresponding to four soil textures are used that are sand sandy loam clay loam and clay the values of the hydraulic parameters which correspond to these soil textures are taken from rawls et al 1982 table 2 these parameters and the initial and boundary values used for each soil texture are presented also in table 2 of the present paper note that the value of the initial soil water content θ i is not necessary taken equal to θ r i e θ i θ r while θ 0 θ s fig 2 left shows the exact i e d d d 0 θ 2 1 λ and fitted i e eq 24 nondimensional diffusivity functions for all soil textures the fitted parameters values obtained after the fitting procedure are presented in table 2 it can be observed that the exact and fitted soil water diffusivities are in excellent agreements this perfect match between the diffusivities is transformed to the soil water content profiles which are shown in fig 2 right for successive times the obtained approximate solutions are calculated using 25 and 26 based on the obtained fitted parameters the results show excellent agreements between approximate and numerical soil water content profiles for all soil textures fig 2 shows also the analytical soil water content profiles obtained from the solution of su et al 2017 for each soil type it can be shown that the soil water content profiles obtained by the method of these authors give good agreements with numerical profiles only near saturation i e in the regions close to θ s the authors obtained similar results by comparing their solutions with numerical solutions calculated by the numerical code hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2012 note that the discrepancy between numerical and analytical profiles of su et al 2017 tends to increase with increasing time while the profiles obtained from the present approximate solution method are insensitive to time change this is not surprising since the proposed method is based on the theory of self similarity table 2 shows also the sorptivity values obtained numerically by the present method and from su et al 2017 for all soil types the numerical values are obtained using the formula s i t t where i t 0 x f t θ x t θ i d x the integration is performed using the trapezoidal rule the sorptivity values obtained by the present method are calculated based on eq 27 while those obtained from su et al 2017 are calculated using the formula s 2 a 1 a 2 with a 1 and a 2 defined by eqs 29 and 30 of their paper it can be shown that the numerical values are much closer to the values obtained by the present theory table 2 shows that the relative errors between the numerical and analytical values are more severe for the method of su et al 2017 than for the present theory the maximal relative error obtained from the present theory is smaller than 0 13 while it exceeds 5 for the method of su et al 2017 note that s decreases with decreasing λ and k s this is somehow expected since the sorptivity is essentially a property of the medium with some resemblance to permeability philip 1957 4 3 comparison with experimental data and estimating of the brooks corey parameters the aim of this section is first to test the validity of the method by comparing the results to experimental data assuming that these data represent brooks corey soils the second purpose is to use the proposed mathematical expressions to estimate the brooks corey parameters to do so experimental data from the 10 soils presented in section 3 were used input data used were sorptivity s e x p initial and final soil water contents θ i and θ s and distance of the wetting front in transformed coordinates ξ f e x p table 3 the distance of the wetting front in transformed coordinates ξ f e x p is not needed to obtain the results but it is used to compare with the calculated one ξ f c a l the values of s e x p θ i θ s and ξ f e x p for the 10 soils are taken from evangelides et al 2010 the experimental data of the 10 soils are depicted in fig 4 symbols these data were acquired graphically from shao and horton 1998 it is assumed that these experimental data represent brooks corey soils so that the diffusivity function is expressed as 37 d θ d 0 θ l where l 2 1 λ and d 0 is the value of diffusivity function l 2 t at saturation here l is a shape coefficient of the power function soil diffusivity curve to estimate the brooks corey parameters it is assumed that the values of θ i θ r and θ s are given and that the value of k s is experimentally determined i e only a conventional constant water head experiment for measuring k s and a simple horizontal absorption experiment with initially dry soils were required therefore in addition to the parameters a c m and n the two parameters to be estimated are d 0 and l or λ 1 l 2 respectively the value of the air entry head h b is then calculated from 37 using the estimated values of d 0 and λ i e h b λ d 0 θ s θ r k s the nondimensional diffusivity function corresponding to 37 writes d θ d d 0 θ l to calculate estimate the parameters a c m n d 0 and l the proposed mathematical expression of the sorptivity s c a l is calculated using 27 41 s c a l θ s θ r d 0 a 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n for each of the 10 soils the parameters can be obtained by following the steps blow 1 estimate first a c m n and d 0 by carrying out an optimization procedure based on sorptivity s c a l s e x p ε where ε is an arbitrary small number tends to 0 the idea is to fit s c a l as defined by 41 to the experimental value s e x p so that the difference s c a l s e x p is minimal i e equal to ε the solution of the optimization problem can be obtained using genetic algorithms conjugate gradient descent methods newton methods or other optimization algorithms in this case optimization was performed using the microsoft excel solver walsh and diamond 1995 this solver uses an iterative search based on gradient type algorithms the user only needs to define an initial set of parameters and the value of ε then use the excel solver to get the optimal set of parameters in practical applications ε is chosen to be equal to 10 6 2 the values of parameters a c m and n are then used to estimate l by curve fitting as explained in section 3 of d defined by 24 to the one defined by d θ θ l fig 3 shows for the 10 soils the comparison between the calculated nondimensional diffusivity solid lines defined by 24 and the estimated diffusivity dashed lines defined by d θ θ l using the values of the obtained parameters after the fitting procedures the values of the fitting parameters are given in table 3 it can be shown that calculated and estimated diffusivities are in good agreements fig 4 shows the calculated solid lines and estimated dashed lines transformed soil water contents for the 10 literature soils in addition to the experimental data symbols the calculated soil water content profiles are obtained by using the following mathematical expression obtained from 11 21 and 22 42 ξ a d 0 m n c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n the estimated soil water content profiles are obtained by solving numerically system 5 7 with d θ defined by 37 and using the estimated values of d 0 and l obtained from the fitting procedures the estimated values of d 0 and l i e and λ are presented in table 3 it can be observed that calculated and estimated soil water content profiles are in general in good agreements with experimental data among the 10 literature soils the one which shows the most disagreement between the calculated soil water contents and the experimental data is yolo clay this can be explained by the fact that these data cannot be described correctly by a brooks corey soil nevertheless the calculated wetting front agrees well with the experiment value see table 3 the calculated wetting front ξ f c a l agrees well with the experimental value ξ f e x p for all the 10 literature soils see also values in table 3 the value of the calculated wetting front is obtained from 11 and 22 as follows 43 ξ f c a l a d 0 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n the estimated values of d 0 and l and so λ are also compared to the results obtained recently by ma et al 2016 ma et al 2009 2016 proposed a method called msca method of constant saturation absorption for determining the brooks corey parameters based on measured soil water diffusivity the method has been tested using experimental data among them the data of the 10 literature soils used in the present work table 3 shows also a comparison between the estimated values obtained from the present work and those obtained previously by ma et al 2016 for the parameters d 0 l and λ it can be observed that the values are relatively close to each other for the 10 literature soils 4 4 application to other soil water diffusivity models and limitation of the method in the previous sections the proposed method is applied to the well known brooks corey soil water diffusivity model and to an exact model suggested by philip 1960a and used by witelski 1997 1998 in this section the applicability of the method to other soil water diffusivity models is discussed the exponential model exp model tolikas et al 1980 and the van genuchten model vg model van genuchten 1980 are among the soil water diffusivity models which are frequently used in the literature these models are used and tested in the following subsections 4 4 1 the exponential model for the exp model the nondimensional diffusivity function is defined by 38 to make a comparison between the proposed approximate solution and existing previous solutions based on the exp model the data of two experimental soil samples were used soil sample 1 and soil sample 2 evangelides et al 2010 tzimopoulos et al 2015 the soil samples were classified as loam and silty loam according to the texture triangle of the u s department of agriculture for more details about the experimental soil samples the reader is referred to evangelides et al 2010 the input data needed for the exp model 38 are presented in table 4 for each soil sample the approximate solutions corresponding to each soil type are calculated by fitting the nondimensional diffusivity function 24 to the exact exponential diffusivity 38 the exact and fitted diffusivity functions are in good agreement as shown in fig 5 left the values of the fitted parameters a c m and n are depicted inside the figures the transformed soil water content profiles for each of the two soil samples are shown in fig 5 right calculated numerically soil lines by the present approximate solution thick dashed lines by the analytical solution of tzimopoulos et al 2015 thin dashed lines and by the analytical solution of tolikas et al 1980 dash dot lines the figure shows good agreement between all solutions the present approximate solution shows the best agreement with the numerical solution this can be clearly seen on the profiles corresponding to the soil sample 2 the values of the wetting fronts calculated from equation 43 i e ξ f d 0 ξ f and from the above cited works are presented in table 4 it can be shown that the values obtained from the present theory are closer to the experimental data 4 4 2 the van genuchten model for the van genuchten model the nondimensional diffusivity function writes as 39 due to the complexity of the diffusivity function 39 there is no analytical solutions to the horizontal absorption problem 1 3 associated with the van genuchten model in this section the proposed approximate solution is applied to the vg model in order to test its validity for such highly nonlinear problem fig 6 shows the nondimensional diffusivity functions left panel and the soil water content profiles right panel using the vg model in this test the grenoble sand soil was used fuentes et al 1992 stewarts et al 2013 the values of the corresponding parameters are presented in table 4 the first case is performed using the boundary condition θ 0 θ s i e real boundary condition for horizontal absorption the upper left panel of fig 6 shows the exact and fitted diffusivity functions in semilog plot the obtained fitted parameters are depicted inside the figure it can be observed that exact and fitted functions match perfectly between θ 0 and θ 0 75 while important differences are observed for the rest i e for θ 0 75 this means that the mathematical expression 19 and so 20 and 25 is not suitable for a diffusivity function of type 39 the main reason for that is that the soil diffusivity function defined by 39 admits infinite gradient at saturation i e at θ 1 this cannot be modeled by the proposed diffusivity model 24 since this latter admits finite gradient at θ 1 this is somehow a limitation of the present model and another mathematical expression than 19 must be used if it exists despite this difficulty in modeling horizontal absorption problem with the vg model the proposed approximate solution is still attractive for validation of numerical codes indeed the results show that the approximate solution may work well if θ 0 θ s i e θ 1 in such cases the gradient at the inlet boundary is finite for instance the lower part of fig 6 shows the results diffusivity functions and soil water content profiles corresponding to θ 0 0 9 θ s in this region of soil water content exact and fitted diffusivities are in good agreement as shown on the left as a consequence numerical and approximate profiles are also in good agreement as can be observed on the right cleary when θ 0 θ s the problem becomes unrealistic however such cases are important to test the validity of numerical solutions when highly nonlinear problems such those based on the vg model are used 5 conclusion an efficient mathematical method for nonlinear approximate solutions of the horizontal absorption equation in one dimensional soil is proposed the method consists in defining a simple mathematical function with four fitting parameters that allow to approximate the diffusivity function by an empirical function the obtained approximate solution is of simple form which includes power and exponential functions and gives the distance as a function of time and soil water content estimates of the sorptivity the infiltration and cumulative infiltration rates as well as wetting front are obtained in explicit algebraic forms these results are useful for the prediction of soil water content profiles and the estimation of hydraulic parameters the approximate solution is compared to exact and numerical solutions and showed excellent agreements with the solutions the method is also used to validate experimental data and estimating the hydraulic parameters and it is successfully applied to the brooks corey and exponential models however it fails in predicting soil water profiles based on the highly nonlinear van genuchten model the reason for that is because in this case the gradient of the soil water diffusivity goes to infinity near saturation and so the proposed mathematical expression cannot take into account such situation nevertheless the approximate solution can be still of great importance for validating numerical schemes the results show that approximate and numerical solutions are in excellent agreements when the surface boundary condition is set up to 90 of saturation acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors appendix a negativity of f θ the second derivative f θ must be negative in order to get a physically correct solution condition imposed by the nonnegativity of d in the range θ i θ θ 0 it will be shown below that f θ 0 under the following conditions a 0 c 0 m 1 and 2 m n 1 0 indeed deriving twice f θ with respect to θ in 19 gives a 1 f θ a n 2 c 2 θ θ i 2 n n c 2 m n 1 θ θ

f θ 0 is presented the derivative of f θ writes as follows a 3 f θ n 2 c θ θ i n 1 g θ with a 4 g θ 2 n c θ θ i n 2 m n 1 it can be easily shown that g θ is a decreasing function of θ in the range θ i θ θ 0 this is true because g θ 2 n 2 c θ θ i n 1 0 i e assuming c 0 in addition g θ i 2 m n 1 0 i e the parameters m and n verify by definition 2 m n 1 0 this implies that g θ 0 therefore f θ 0 from a 3 since c 0 this means that f θ is an increasing function of θ in the range θ i θ θ 0 moreover f θ i m m 1 0 since m 1 thus f θ 0 and consequently f θ 0

condition and constant soil water content at the beginning of a soil column it does not make any prior assumptions about the form of the diffusivity function the nonlinear solution is of simple combination of power and exponential functions and expresses in explicit form the distance as function of time and soil water content it involves all the physical parameters and four additional fitting parameters which can be obtained by simple fitting procedure algebraic expressions that quantify the main infiltration process are derived from the basic equation these include the sorptivity the infiltration rate the cumulative infiltration rate and the wetting front a comparison with exact numerical and other analytical solutions validates the accuracy of the approximation and shows its advantage to other approximate solutions the analytical expressions are used to predict experimental soil moisture profiles from simple measurements such as sorptivity wetting front and initial and final soil water contents the method is applied to estimate soil hydraulic properties using horizontal water absorption experiments the results of the parameter estimation procedure are compared to other existing results and show good agreements the solution method is also tested to various diffusivity functions and its limitation is discussed in detail keywords horizontal infiltration unsaturated flow analytical solution estimating hydraulic parameters soil water diffusivity 1 introduction the movement of water through unsaturated soils is mathematically described by the richards equation which combines the effects of both conduction due to gravity and diffusion due to capillarity when gravity is neglected it reduces to a diffusion type equation describing absorption i e infiltration into horizontal systems solutions of the absorption equation have the theoretical importance that they yield the limiting small time behavior of transient infiltration processes even when gravity cannot be neglected and so provide a basic point of departure for the solution of the richards equation philip 1969 analytical solutions for the absorption equation are important since they represent an efficient mathematical tool for the estimation of hydraulic parameters without the need of numerical methods which are expensive to employ due to excessive memory and computational time requirements shao and horton 1998 wang et al 2002 2004 ma et al 2009 2010 2016 evangelides et al 2010 moreover they can be used as reference solutions to verify numerical schemes unlike the vertical

zimmerman and bodvarsson 1991 proposed an approximate solution for horizontal infiltration in a brooks corey medium by assuming piecewise linear saturation profile hang and zhiqiang 1997 used the method of separation of variables together with boltzmann transform method to find out an analytical solution of the horizontal absorption equation for the case of an exponential diffusivity form witelski 1998 obtained a long time asymptotic similarity solution for horizontal absorption from a constant source into a homogeneous layer of soil with a preexisting moisture distribution prasad and salomon 2005 presented a method for the analytical solution of a degenerate diffusion equation with power law diffusivity function the solutions can be used to model horizontal infiltration into dry soils evangelides et al 2005 used the flux saturation method based on an empirical function of four constants to predict the horizontal unsaturated flow evangelides et al 2010 presented an empirical function based on three constants for the description of the soil moisture profile these methods generate complex diffusivity functions tzimopoulos et al 2015 derived an explicit analytical solution for the horizontal diffusion equation with exponential diffusivity form based on the flux saturation method more recently su et al 2017 proposed an analytical solution for the horizontal absorption equation with brooks corey model based on the least action and variational principles in the present paper an original method for deriving approximate analytical solutions of the horizontal absorption equation is presented the proposed model does not take any prior assumptions about the form of the diffusivity function the method is adaptable for problems with instantaneous jump in the initial soil water content position at the fixed end of a semi infinite domain it allows the derivation of results of practical importance in soil physics the approximate solution can be used to predict soil moisture profile as well as for estimating hydraulic parameters the method applies for various diffusivity forms and its limitation is discussed in detail the paper is organized as follows section 2

is dedicated to the application of the method with several examples of comparison to other solutions generating soil moisture profiles estimating hydraulic parameters and application to various diffusivity models section 5 concludes the work 2 theory 2 1 governing equations the one dimensional nonlinear diffusion equation describing horizontal flow of water in unsaturated soil with boundary and initial conditions for absorption is given by bruce and klute 1956 1 θ t x d θ θ x 2 θ θ 0 x 0 t 0 3 θ θ i x 0 t 0 4 θ θ i x t 0 where t is time t x is the horizontal position l θ is the volumetric soil water content l 3 l 3 d is the soil water diffusivity l 2 t and θ 0 and θ i are the boundary and initial soil water contents l 3 l 3 which verify θ 0 θ i for horizontal absorption this problem has a well known boltzmann type similarity solution θ x t θ ξ where the similarity variable is ξ x t 1 2 and the similarity function θ ξ satisfies the nonlinear ordinary differential equation klute 1952 bruce and klute 1956 philip 1955 5 ξ 2 θ ξ ξ d θ θ ξ 6 θ θ 0 ξ 0 7 θ θ i ξ philip 1957 introduced the term sorptivity s defining the capacity of the porous medium to absorb or desorb water by capillarity and expressing it as 8 s θ i θ 0 ξ d θ philip 1969 showed that sorptivity can be determined from the cumulative infiltration i t θ i θ 0 x d θ as follows 9 i t s t the absorption or infiltration rate v 0 which is also the flow velocity at x 0 is defined by philip 1969 10 v o t d i t d t s 2 t let s define the following nondimensional variables 11 θ θ θ r θ s θ r ξ ξ d 0 d d d 0 where θ is the normalized soil water content or effective saturation θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated soil water contents l 3 l 3 respectively ξ is the nondimensional boltzmann variable d 0 is the value of d at θ 0 which is constant depending on the soil properties l 2 t and d d θ is the nondimensional soil water diffusivity introducing 11 into 5 7 yields the following nondimensional problem 12 ξ 2 d θ d ξ d d ξ d θ d θ d ξ 13 θ θ 0 ξ 0 14 θ θ i ξ where θ i and θ 0 are the initial and boundary effective saturations the nondimensional sorptivity s is defined by 15 s θ i θ 0 ξ d θ s θ s θ r d 0 multiplying both sides of 12 by d ξ d θ and integrating between the limits θ i and θ yields 16 d θ 1 2 θ i θ ξ d θ d ξ d θ in the derivation of equation 16 the condition θ θ i d θ d ξ 0 was used this condition is a consequence of conditions 13 and 14 philip 1960a b proposed a general method of exact solutions to 16 for θ i 0 and presented several exact solutions the method consisted in selecting functions ξ ξ θ satisfying the conditions 13 and 14 for which the integral in 16 is solvable analytically this method leads to many exact solutions but it does not apply to a priori given diffusivity function because the expression of this latter depends on the selected function ξ θ in what follows an original method of approximate solutions is presented which applies for a given predefined diffusivity function 2 2 solution method let s first define a function f as follows 17 f θ θ i θ ξ d θ eq 16 writes then as follows 18 d θ 1 2 f θ f θ where f θ d ξ d θ is the second derivative of f with respect to θ note that f θ s is the soil water flux saturation relationship introduced by philip 1973 the method consists in assuming that f θ is expressed in the following mathematical form 19 f θ a θ θ i m e c θ θ i n b θ θ i where a b c m and n are unknown parameters to be determined such that a 0 c 0 m 1 and 2 m n 1 0 these conditions on the parameters a b c m and n are justified in appendix a the choice of the functional form 19 is discussed in section 2 4 based on 19 the analytical expression of ξ θ f θ is obtained as follows 20 ξ θ a m n c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n b the nondimensional wetting front ξ f is the value of ξ at which the effective saturation reaches θ i this gives b ξ f from 20 therefore the analytical expression of ξ θ becomes 21 ξ θ a m n c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n ξ f where ξ f is obtained by using 13 and 21 so that 22 ξ f a m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n it is important to mention that the proposed solution 21 satisfies the following three conditions philip 1960a b 1969 which are required for its existence i ξ θ 0 0 the condition imposed by 13 ii the functions f θ and ξ θ exist both by definition of 17 iii f θ 0 this condition imposed by the nonnegativity of d in the range θ i θ θ 0 this condition is proved in appendix a note that when the nondimensional diffusivity is finite nonzero at θ 0 the wetting front is practically reached at infinity i e ξ f in that case the wetting front is assumed to be reached at θ ε where ε is an arbitrary small number in practice ε is chosen to be equal to 10 5 the nondimensional sorptivity satisfies s f θ 0 therefore it can be expressed analytically in terms of the unknown parameters based on 19 21 and 22 as follows 23 s a 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n eq 21 is the approximate solution of eqs 12 14 it expresses the nondimensional boltzmann variable ξ as function of the normalized soil water content θ for any θ between θ i and θ 0 the dimensionless wetting front and sorptivity are defined by 22 and 23 respectively the analytical approximate expressions 21 23 involve four parameters a c m and n which must be determined as follows eq 18 may be rewritten in terms of the unknown parameters after using 19 this gives 24 d θ a 2 2 n 2 c 2 θ θ i 2 n n c 2 m n 1 θ θ i n m m 1 θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n eq 24 shows that the nondimensional soil water diffusivity is expressed in terms of the unknowns parameters the idea is that for a given soil water diffusivity the unknown parameters a c m and n may be determined by fitting the curve defined by the mathematical function of the right hand side rhs of eq 24 to the curve of the real nondimensional diffusivity function at the left hand side lhs of 24 starting from an initial set of parameters the set which gives the best fit between the two curves is adopted in eqs 21 23 the fitting procedure is briefly discussed in section 3 2 3 analytical expressions in the x t domain the analytical expressions 21 23 can be used to determine the mathematical expression of any physical function or parameter of horizontal absorption in the x t domain these include the soil water content profile the wetting front the sorptivity the cumulative infiltration rate and the infiltration rate the soil water content profile may be determined implicitly x x θ t by using eqs 11 21 and the relationship ξ x t 1 2 this gives x ξ d 0 t therefore the distance is expressed in terms of the physical and fitting parameters as follows 25 x a d 0 t m n c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n x f t where x f t ξ f d 0 t is the position of the wetting front at time t defined as follows after using 22 26 x f t a d 0 t m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n the analytical expression of the sorptivity s can be obtained from 15 and 23 as follows 27 s a θ s θ r d 0 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n the substitution of 27 into 9 yields the analytical expression of the cumulative infiltration rate as function of the physical and fitting parameters 28 i t a θ s θ r d 0 t 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n finally the infiltration rate v 0 which is defined as v 0 t d i t d t can be obtained by deriving 28 with respect to time this gives 29 v 0 t 1 2 a θ s θ r d 0 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n t eqs 28 and 29 show that the cumulative infiltration rate is proportional to t while the infiltration rate is inversely proportional to t these results are well known in the theory of infiltration through soils note that eqs 26 28 and 29 can be converted to the following formulas 30 i t a 1 x f t 31 v 0 t a 2 x f t 32 x f 2 t a 3 t with 33 a 1 θ s θ r s ξ f θ s θ r m 1 n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m n c θ 0 θ i n 34 a 2 a 1 d 0 ξ f 2 2 1 2 a 2 d 0 θ s θ r m 1 n c θ 0 θ i n m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i 2 m 1 e 2 c θ 0 θ i n 35 a 3 2 a 2 a 1 d 0 ξ f 2 a 2 d 0 m n c θ 0 θ i n 2 θ 0 θ i 2 m 1 e 2 c θ 0 θ i n it can be easily shown from 9 33 35 that the sorptivity s is related to the parameters a 1 and a 2 by the following relationship s 2 a 1 a 2 the mathematical expressions 30 35 are useful to compare with numerical results and other existing analytical results such those proposed recently by su et al 2017 note that the relationship 35 between a 1 a 2 and a 3 is similar to the one found by su et al 2017 2 4 the functional form 19 as mentioned above the quantity f θ s is the soil water flux saturation relationship introduced by philip 1973 many researchers have developed generalized expressions of f θ s for more details about these expressions the reader is referred to evangelides et al 2005 who gave a review and a comparative study between several expressions recently ma et al 2017 derived a general expression of the soil water flux saturation relationship containing only one parameter this parameter is a function of the initial soil water content and the soil pore structure index that reflects the shape of the soil water retention curve here the empirical function 19 is proposed to f θ which is equivalent to the flux of water at the position associated to the normalized soil water content θ the function f θ is defined as the sum of two terms the first term is a combination of power and exponential functions of θ θ i and the second term is a linear function of θ θ i this specific choice is justified by the following points 1 the product of power and exponential functions provides a continuous and infinitely differentiable function this would result in a well defined diffusivity function 24 since this latter is defined as a product of f θ and f θ as shown in 18 2 the form 19 as function of θ θ i is chosen in such a way that f θ i 0 this condition is required by definition of f θ in 17 3 the second term in 19 is defined in such a way that the normalized soil water content profile admits a wetting front as shown in 21 and 22 it should be noted that the empirical function 19 is not unique and other function forms would be possible however preliminary numerical experiments show that the proposed empirical function applies successfully to a wide range of soil water diffusivity functions 3 materials and methods the unknow parameters a b m and n appearing in the analytical expressions can be determined by curve fitting to do that the rhs of eq 24 is denoted by d f θ a b m n fitted diffusivity then the segment θ i θ θ 0 is divided into n 1 equal intervals θ k 1 θ k with θ 0 θ i and θ n 1 the parameters a b m and n are then determined by carrying out and optimization procedure on the quantity k 0 n d f θ k a b m n d θ k 2 ε where ε is an arbitrary small number ε 0 in practical applications we take ε 10 6 starting from an initial set of parameters the set which gives the best fit between the two curves is adopted in the approximate solution in the present work the fitting procedure is performed by using the microsoft excel solver walsh and diamond 1995 to validate the proposed approximate solution the method is applied to various types of soil water diffusivity function the following specific form of the nondimensional diffusivity function philip 1960a is used to compare with an existing exact solution 36 d θ 1 2 p θ p 1 θ p 1 p in addition three real and well known soil water diffusivity functions are used to compare the approximate solution with calculated numerical results the first one is the brooks corey model defined by brooks and corey 1964 37 d θ d 0 θ 2 1 λ with d 0 k s h b λ θ s θ r where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t λ 0 is the pore size distribution index and h b is the air entry head value l called also the bubbling pressure the second one is the exponential model which has a nondimensional diffusivity function defined by tolikas et al 1980 tzimopoulos et al 2015 38 d θ d d 0 e β θ s θ r θ where β is a nondimensional parameter characterizing the soil type and d 0 d θ 0 e β θ s θ r θ 0 the third model is the van genuchten model with nondimensional diffusivity function defined as follows van genuchten 1980 39 d θ d d 0 θ 1 2 1 β 1 θ 1 β β 1 θ 1 β β 2 where d 0 1 β k s α β θ s θ r with α 1 l and β are two empirical parameters characterizing the soil type such that 0 β 1 experimental data are also used to predict soil water content profiles as well as to estimate the hydraulic parameters data from 10 soils ranging from sand to clay were taken from the literature the 10 soils were hagener sand selim et al 1970 hayden sandy loam whisler et al 1968 manawatu fine sandy loam clothier et al 1983 adelanto loam jackson 1963 edina silt loam selim et al 1970 nicollet sandy clay loam mcbride and horton 1985 fayette silty clay loam mcbride and horton 1985 panoche clay

tzimopoulos et al 2015 ma et al 2016 4 application and discussion 4 1 comparison with an existing exact solution the accuracy of the approximate solution 21 is investigated by comparing it with an existing exact solution the exact solution no 1 presented in table 1 of philip 1960a is used in this test this exact solution writes for any p 0 as follows 40 ξ θ 1 θ p the solution 40 corresponds to θ 0 1 and θ i 0 and to the specific form of the nondimensional diffusivity function defined by 36 fig 1 left panel shows a comparison between the exact nondimensional diffusivity function 36 and the corresponding fitted function 24 for four values of the parameter p the shape of the diffusivity function depends on the value of p it is concave for p 0 5 and p 1 and convex for p 3 while it admits an inflection point for p 2 i e it has both a convex and concave parts note that the case p 2 was already investigated by witelski 1997 1998 the values of the obtained fitted parameters are presented in table 1 it can be shown that for each value of p the exact and fitted diffusivity functions are matched perfectly to each other fig 1 right panel shows the comparison between the exact solution 40 and the proposed approximate solution 21 obtained with the values of the fitted parameters presented in table 1 a perfect match between the exact and the proposed approximate solutions is obtained for all values of p the accuracy of the approximate wetting front values determined from eq 22 is less than 0 00024 of the exact value which is equal to 1 4 2 comparison with calculated numerical solutions numerical computations of the master eq 1 with boundary and initial conditions 2 and 3 are carried out to test the performance of the approximate solutions with real soil water diffusivity in this test the well known brooks corey soil water diffusivity model 37 is used eq 1 is solved numerically for several soil types by applying the matlab solver pdepe www mathworks com which is a sophisticated solver capable to solve a nonlinear system of initial boundary value problems in one space variable and time the length of the domain is chosen to be large enough with respect to the time scale of interest to avoid the effect of the boundary condition at the downstream data corresponding to four soil textures are used that are sand sandy loam clay loam and clay the values of the hydraulic parameters which correspond to these soil textures are taken from rawls et al 1982 table 2 these parameters and the initial and boundary values used for each soil texture are presented also in table 2 of the present paper note that the value of the initial soil water content θ i is not necessary taken equal to θ r i e θ i θ r while θ 0 θ s fig 2 left shows the exact i e d d d 0 θ 2 1 λ and fitted i e eq 24 nondimensional diffusivity functions for all soil textures the fitted parameters values obtained after the fitting procedure are presented in table 2 it can be observed that the exact and fitted soil water diffusivities are in excellent agreements this perfect match between the diffusivities is transformed to the soil water content profiles which are shown in fig 2 right for successive times the obtained approximate solutions are calculated using 25 and 26 based on the obtained fitted parameters the results show excellent agreements between approximate and numerical soil water content profiles for all soil textures fig 2 shows also the analytical soil water content profiles obtained from the solution of su et al 2017 for each soil type it can be shown that the soil water content profiles obtained by the method of these authors give good agreements with numerical profiles only near saturation i e in the regions close to θ s the authors obtained similar results by comparing their solutions with numerical solutions calculated by the numerical code hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2012 note that the discrepancy between numerical and analytical profiles of su et al 2017 tends to increase with increasing time while the profiles obtained from the present approximate solution method are insensitive to time change this is not surprising since the proposed method is based on the theory of self similarity table 2 shows also the sorptivity values obtained numerically by the present method and from su et al 2017 for all soil types the numerical values are obtained using the formula s i t t where i t 0 x f t θ x t θ i d x the integration is performed using the trapezoidal rule the sorptivity values obtained by the present method are calculated based on eq 27 while those obtained from su et al 2017 are calculated using the formula s 2 a 1 a 2 with a 1 and a 2 defined by eqs 29 and 30 of their paper it can be shown that the numerical values are much closer to the values obtained by the present theory table 2 shows that the relative errors between the numerical and analytical values are more severe for the method of su et al 2017 than for the present theory the maximal relative error obtained from the present theory is smaller than 0 13 while it exceeds 5 for the method of su et al 2017 note that s decreases with decreasing λ and k s this is somehow expected since the sorptivity is essentially a property of the medium with some resemblance to permeability philip 1957 4 3 comparison with experimental data and estimating of the brooks corey parameters the aim of this section is first to test the validity of the method by comparing the results to experimental data assuming that these data represent brooks corey soils the second purpose is to use the proposed mathematical expressions to estimate the brooks corey parameters to do so experimental data from the 10 soils presented in section 3 were used input data used were sorptivity s e x p initial and final soil water contents θ i and θ s and distance of the wetting front in transformed coordinates ξ f e x p table 3 the distance of the wetting front in transformed coordinates ξ f e x p is not needed to obtain the results but it is used to compare with the calculated one ξ f c a l the values of s e x p θ i θ s and ξ f e x p for the 10 soils are taken from evangelides et al 2010 the experimental data of the 10 soils are depicted in fig 4 symbols these data were acquired graphically from shao and horton 1998 it is assumed that these experimental data represent brooks corey soils so that the diffusivity function is expressed as 37 d θ d 0 θ l where l 2 1 λ and d 0 is the value of diffusivity function l 2 t at saturation here l is a shape coefficient of the power function soil diffusivity curve to estimate the brooks corey parameters it is assumed that the values of θ i θ r and θ s are given and that the value of k s is experimentally determined i e only a conventional constant water head experiment for measuring k s and a simple horizontal absorption experiment with initially dry soils were required therefore in addition to the parameters a c m and n the two parameters to be estimated are d 0 and l or λ 1 l 2 respectively the value of the air entry head h b is then calculated from 37 using the estimated values of d 0 and λ i e h b λ d 0 θ s θ r k s the nondimensional diffusivity function corresponding to 37 writes d θ d d 0 θ l to calculate estimate the parameters a c m n d 0 and l the proposed mathematical expression of the sorptivity s c a l is calculated using 27 41 s c a l θ s θ r d 0 a 1 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m e c θ 0 θ i n for each of the 10 soils the parameters can be obtained by following the steps blow 1 estimate first a c m n and d 0 by carrying out an optimization procedure based on sorptivity s c a l s e x p ε where ε is an arbitrary small number tends to 0 the idea is to fit s c a l as defined by 41 to the experimental value s e x p so that the difference s c a l s e x p is minimal i e equal to ε the solution of the optimization problem can be obtained using genetic algorithms conjugate gradient descent methods newton methods or other optimization algorithms in this case optimization was performed using the microsoft excel solver walsh and diamond 1995 this solver uses an iterative search based on gradient type algorithms the user only needs to define an initial set of parameters and the value of ε then use the excel solver to get the optimal set of parameters in practical applications ε is chosen to be equal to 10 6 2 the values of parameters a c m and n are then used to estimate l by curve fitting as explained in section 3 of d defined by 24 to the one defined by d θ θ l fig 3 shows for the 10 soils the comparison between the calculated nondimensional diffusivity solid lines defined by 24 and the estimated diffusivity dashed lines defined by d θ θ l using the values of the obtained parameters after the fitting procedures the values of the fitting parameters are given in table 3 it can be shown that calculated and estimated diffusivities are in good agreements fig 4 shows the calculated solid lines and estimated dashed lines transformed soil water contents for the 10 literature soils in addition to the experimental data symbols the calculated soil water content profiles are obtained by using the following mathematical expression obtained from 11 21 and 22 42 ξ a d 0 m n c θ θ i n θ θ i m 1 e c θ θ i n m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n the estimated soil water content profiles are obtained by solving numerically system 5 7 with d θ defined by 37 and using the estimated values of d 0 and l obtained from the fitting procedures the estimated values of d 0 and l i e and λ are presented in table 3 it can be observed that calculated and estimated soil water content profiles are in general in good agreements with experimental data among the 10 literature soils the one which shows the most disagreement between the calculated soil water contents and the experimental data is yolo clay this can be explained by the fact that these data cannot be described correctly by a brooks corey soil nevertheless the calculated wetting front agrees well with the experiment value see table 3 the calculated wetting front ξ f c a l agrees well with the experimental value ξ f e x p for all the 10 literature soils see also values in table 3 the value of the calculated wetting front is obtained from 11 and 22 as follows 43 ξ f c a l a d 0 m n c θ 0 θ i n θ 0 θ i m 1 e c θ 0 θ i n the estimated values of d 0 and l and so λ are also compared to the results obtained recently by ma et al 2016 ma et al 2009 2016 proposed a method called msca method of constant saturation absorption for determining the brooks corey parameters based on measured soil water diffusivity the method has been tested using experimental data among them the data of the 10 literature soils used in the present work table 3 shows also a comparison between the estimated values obtained from the present work and those obtained previously by ma et al 2016 for the parameters d 0 l and λ it can be observed that the values are relatively close to each other for the 10 literature soils 4 4 application to other soil water diffusivity models and limitation of the method in the previous sections the proposed method is applied to the well known brooks corey soil water diffusivity model and to an exact model suggested by philip 1960a and used by witelski 1997 1998 in this section the applicability of the method to other soil water diffusivity models is discussed the exponential model exp model tolikas et al 1980 and the van genuchten model vg model van genuchten 1980 are among the soil water diffusivity models which are frequently used in the literature these models are used and tested in the following subsections 4 4 1 the exponential model for the exp model the nondimensional diffusivity function is defined by 38 to make a comparison between the proposed approximate solution and existing previous solutions based on the exp model the data of two experimental soil samples were used soil sample 1 and soil sample 2 evangelides et al 2010 tzimopoulos et al 2015 the soil samples were classified as loam and silty loam according to the texture triangle of the u s department of agriculture for more details about the experimental soil samples the reader is referred to evangelides et al 2010 the input data needed for the exp model 38 are presented in table 4 for each soil sample the approximate solutions corresponding to each soil type are calculated by fitting the nondimensional diffusivity function 24 to the exact exponential diffusivity 38 the exact and fitted diffusivity functions are in good agreement as shown in fig 5 left the values of the fitted parameters a c m and n are depicted inside the figures the transformed soil water content profiles for each of the two soil samples are shown in fig 5 right calculated numerically soil lines by the present approximate solution thick dashed lines by the analytical solution of tzimopoulos et al 2015 thin dashed lines and by the analytical solution of tolikas et al 1980 dash dot lines the figure shows good agreement between all solutions the present approximate solution shows the best agreement with the numerical solution this can be clearly seen on the profiles corresponding to the soil sample 2 the values of the wetting fronts calculated from equation 43 i e ξ f d 0 ξ f and from the above cited works are presented in table 4 it can be shown that the values obtained from the present theory are closer to the experimental data 4 4 2 the van genuchten model for the van genuchten model the nondimensional diffusivity function writes as 39 due to the complexity of the diffusivity function 39 there is no analytical solutions to the horizontal absorption problem 1 3 associated with the van genuchten model in this section the proposed approximate solution is applied to the vg model in order to test its validity for such highly nonlinear problem fig 6 shows the nondimensional diffusivity functions left panel and the soil water content profiles right panel using the vg model in this test the grenoble sand soil was used fuentes et al 1992 stewarts et al 2013 the values of the corresponding parameters are presented in table 4 the first case is performed using the boundary condition θ 0 θ s i e real boundary condition for horizontal absorption the upper left panel of fig 6 shows the exact and fitted diffusivity functions in semilog plot the obtained fitted parameters are depicted inside the figure it can be observed that exact and fitted functions match perfectly between θ 0 and θ 0 75 while important differences are observed for the rest i e for θ 0 75 this means that the mathematical expression 19 and so 20 and 25 is not suitable for a diffusivity function of type 39 the main reason for that is that the soil diffusivity function defined by 39 admits infinite gradient at saturation i e at θ 1 this cannot be modeled by the proposed diffusivity model 24 since this latter admits finite gradient at θ 1 this is somehow a limitation of the present model and another mathematical expression than 19 must be used if it exists despite this difficulty in modeling horizontal absorption problem with the vg model the proposed approximate solution is still attractive for validation of numerical codes indeed the results show that the approximate solution may work well if θ 0 θ s i e θ 1 in such cases the gradient at the inlet boundary is finite for instance the lower part of fig 6 shows the results diffusivity functions and soil water content profiles corresponding to θ 0 0 9 θ s in this region of soil water content exact and fitted diffusivities are in good agreement as shown on the left as a consequence numerical and approximate profiles are also in good agreement as can be observed on the right cleary when θ 0 θ s the problem becomes unrealistic however such cases are important to test the validity of numerical solutions when highly nonlinear problems such those based on the vg model are used 5 conclusion an efficient mathematical method for nonlinear approximate solutions of the horizontal absorption equation in one dimensional soil is proposed the method consists in defining a simple mathematical function with four fitting parameters that allow to approximate the diffusivity function by an empirical function the obtained approximate solution is of simple form which includes power and exponential functions and gives the distance as a function of time and soil water content estimates of the sorptivity the infiltration and cumulative infiltration rates as well as wetting front are obtained in explicit algebraic forms these results are useful for the prediction of soil water content profiles and the estimation of hydraulic parameters the approximate solution is compared to exact and numerical solutions and showed excellent agreements with the solutions the method is also used to validate experimental data and estimating the hydraulic parameters and it is successfully applied to the brooks corey and exponential models however it fails in predicting soil water profiles based on the highly nonlinear van genuchten model the reason for that is because in this case the gradient of the soil water diffusivity goes to infinity near saturation and so the proposed mathematical expression cannot take into account such situation nevertheless the approximate solution can be still of great importance for validating numerical schemes the results show that approximate and numerical solutions are in excellent agreements when the surface boundary condition is set up to 90 of saturation acknowledgments this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors appendix a negativity of f θ the second derivative f θ must be negative in order to get a physically correct solution condition imposed by the nonnegativity of d in the range θ i θ θ 0 it will be shown below that f θ 0 under the following conditions a 0 c 0 m 1 and 2 m n 1 0 indeed deriving twice f θ with respect to θ in 19 gives a 1 f θ a n 2 c 2 θ θ i 2 n n c 2 m n 1 θ θ i n m m 1 θ θ i m 2 e c θ θ i n a f θ θ θ i m 2 e c θ θ i n with a 2 f θ n 2 c 2 θ θ i 2 n n c 2 m n 1 θ θ i n m m 1 therefore it is sufficient to prove that f θ 0 if a 0 in what follows the prove of f θ 0 is presented the derivative of f θ writes as follows a 3 f θ n 2 c θ θ i n 1 g θ with a 4 g θ 2 n c θ θ i n 2 m n 1 it can be easily shown that g θ is a decreasing function of θ in the range θ i θ θ 0 this is true because g θ 2 n 2 c θ θ i n 1 0 i e assuming c 0 in addition g θ i 2 m n 1 0 i e the parameters m and n verify by definition 2 m n 1 0 this implies that g θ 0 therefore f θ 0 from a 3 since c 0 this means that f θ is an increasing function of θ in the range θ i θ θ 0 moreover f θ i m m 1 0 since m 1 thus f θ 0 and consequently f θ 0 
7119,on the tibetan plateau climate change particularly increases in air temperature significantly affects cryospheric and hydrological processes based on 5 typical future climate scenarios from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 under emission scenario rcp4 5 and a distributed ecohydrological model gbehm this study analyzes the potential characteristics of future climate change from 2011 to 2060 and the associated effects on the cryospheric and hydrological processes in the upper heihe river basin a typical cold mountain region located on the northeastern tibetan plateau the precipitation air temperature and frozen ground elasticities of runoff evapotranspiration are then estimated based on the simulation results the typical future climate scenarios suggest that air temperature will increase at an average rate of 0 34 c 10a in the future and that precipitation will increase slightly by 6 mm 10a under the rcp 4 5 emission scenario based on the gbehm simulated results due to the increase in air temperature glaciers would be reduced to less than 100 million m3 by 2060 the permafrost area would shrink by 23 the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground would decrease by 5 4 cm 10a and the active layer depth of the frozen ground would increase by 6 1 cm 10a additionally runoff would decrease by approximately 5 mm 10a and evapotranspiration would increase by approximately 9 mm 10a the estimated elasticities indicate that annual runoff would decrease at an average rate of 24 mm c and evapotranspiration would increase at an average rate of 21 mm c with rising air temperature in the future the impacts of increased air temperature on hydrological processes are mainly due to changes in frozen ground the thickening of the active layer of the frozen ground increases the soil storage capacity leading to decreased runoff and increased evapotranspiration when the active layer depth increases by 1 cm annual runoff decreases by approximately 1 3 mm and annual evapotranspiration increases by approximately 0 9 mm in addition the shift from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground increases groundwater infiltration which decreases surface runoff compared to that over the past 50 years the effect of increased air temperature on the frozen ground in the upper heihe river basin will be greater in the future which would result in a faster reduction in runoff in the future considering the effects of global warming keywords increasing air temperature frozen ground runoff change distributed ecohydrological model heihe river basin 1 introduction the tibetan plateau as the source area of many major asian rivers provides valuable freshwater resources for hundreds of millions of people in china and southeast asian countries immerzeel et al 2010 due to its unique geography the tibetan plateau is more sensitive to global climate change than other areas bales et al 2006 cheng and wu 2007 in recent decades rivers on the tibetan plateau have experienced significant but different runoff changes due to climate change cuo et al 2014 on the eastern tibetan plateau which is controlled by the east asian monsoon runoff has decreased yang et al 2011 and in the region mainly controlled by the westerly belt runoff has increased cheng and jin 2013 will these trends continue or change in the future to develop reasonable water resource management strategies it is important to reasonably estimate the trends of river runoff unlike other regions the tibetan plateau is widely covered by permafrost and glaciers previous studies have shown that in addition to the changes in temperature and precipitation cryospheric changes such as variations in glacier coverage and the area of frozen ground have had important and far reaching effects on the ecological and hydrological processes in the basin barry and gan 2011 immerzeel et al 2012 cuo et al 2014 accelerated glacial ablation can increase surface runoff reduce water reserves and change the surface albedo and permafrost degradation can alter the soil moisture content soil water storage capacity and other hydrological elements cuo et al 2015 in recent decades global warming has led to the substantial retreat of frozen ground and glaciers on the tibetan plateau yao et al 2007 kang et al 2010 cheng and jin 2013 in the past 30 years the permafrost area of the tibetan plateau has been reduced from 1 50 106 km2 to 1 05 106 km2 and the permafrost degradation trend may continue or even accelerate in the future cheng and jin 2013 according to the first and second glacier inventory datasets of china guo et al 2014 the glacier area on the tibetan plateau retreated by 23 over the past 50 years these changes will further affect the hydrological cycle therefore to reliably predict future runoff trends it is important to answer the following 3 questions 1 how will the cryospheric response vary for typical future climate change scenarios 2 how will climate change effect hydrological processes and what factors cause changes to glacier and frozen soil regimes 3 can these influences be quantified previous studies have lacked the ability to estimate cryospheric changes in the context of future climate change and analyses of the impacts of cryospheric changes on hydrological processes have not been conducted distributed hydrological models that consider cryospheric processes are the major tools used to estimate the spatial distribution and dynamic variations of cryospheric and hydrological processes in previous studies models such as mike she bosson et al 2012 clm lawrence et al 2015 web dhm wang et al 2010 and vic cuo et al 2015 considered the effects of cryospheric processes however in most of these studies frozen ground was considered a static layer the dynamic changes in frozen ground and the interactions between frozen ground and hydrological processes were not effectively considered qin et al 2016 yang et al 2015 developed a distributed ecohydrological model gbehm that fully couples cryospheric processes with this model the spatial distribution and dynamic variations of glaciers and frozen soils can be simulated gao et al 2016 gbehm has been applied in certain river basins on the tibetan plateau such as the heihe river basin hrb and upper yellow river basin and the cryospheric and hydrological processes in recent decades were successfully simulated yang et al 2015 qin et al 2016 based on the model the responses of cryospheric and hydrological processes to climate change in the future can be analyzed future climate scenarios are mainly derived from the simulation results of general circulation models gcms fowler et al 2007 in general gcm simulations often have bias compared to measured values therefore bias correction is needed due to the lack of gauge observations future simulation results must be corrected based on the relationship between historical data and historical model simulation results wood et al 2004 three bias correction methods have mainly been used in previous studies including the delta method the unbiasing method and the quantile quantile mapping method gao 2012 the quantile quantile mapping method has been widely adopted boé et al 2007 in addition to bias another problem associated with gcm simulations is their low spatial resolution the original gcm outputs cannot meet the requirements of high spatial resolution hydrological simulations wood 2002 2004 and a spatial downscaling process is necessary among statistical downscaling and dynamic downscaling methods statistical downscaling methods are simple and more applicable when historical observations are abundant gao 2012 the hrb which is located on the northeastern tibetan plateau is the second largest inland river basin in china it flows through the hexi corridor which is the most important route from northern china to central asia for traders and the military and an essential grain producing region in northwestern china zhang et al 2016a the water resources required for socioeconomic development and the sustainment of ecosystems in the middle and lower reaches of the basin are heavily dependent on the water from the headwater region the headwater region of the heihe river is covered by frozen ground specifically this area is the junction area of permafrost and seasonal frozen soil wang et al 2013 which is sensitive to climate change cuo et al 2015 the hrb has been considered a typical region for scientists to study the hydrology and water resources of cold and arid regions in china ning et al 2008 this study assesses the potential climate changes based on the outputs of gcms and the associated influences on the cryospheric and hydrological processes in the hrb from 2011 to 2060 using a distributed hydrological model the objectives of this study are as follows i to estimate the possible climate changes in the hrb over the next 50 years ii to estimate the responses of cryospheric and hydrologic processes especially runoff to future climate change and iii to quantitatively analyze the effects of precipitation air temperature and frozen ground changes on runoff 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the hrb originates on the north slope of the qilian mountains located on the northeastern tibetan plateau flows through the hexi corridor and ends in juyanhai lake fig 1 the upper reach of the heihe river is located at an elevation of 1800 5000 m and gauged at yingluoxia hydrological station the river has a drainage area of 10 009 km2 and generates nearly 70 of the total runoff in the basin yang et al 2015 in the 2000s the mean annual runoff observed at yingluoxia station was approximately 1 8 billion m3 the annual precipitation in the upper hrb ranges from 200 to 700 mm and the annual mean air temperature ranges from 9 to 5 c precipitation and temperature are significantly affected by the elevation of the upper hrb precipitation increases with elevation and temperature decreases with elevation wang et al 2017 which also leads to the significant spatial variability in land use cover gao et al 2016 low elevation areas are relatively arid and mainly distributed with seasonal frozen soils as elevation and precipitation increase water becomes more abundant and vegetation types and cover increase the elevation zone of 2800 m 3600 m is the most vegetated area in the basin gao et al 2016 as the elevation continues to increase the temperature drop leads to sparse vegetation the 3600 3900 m elevation range is mainly the transition zone from permafrost to seasonal frozen soil gao et al 2018 in addition the area above 4000 m is mainly the permafrost area and includes a few glaciers as the temperature has increased in recent decades the glaciers and frozen grounds in the upper hrb have become significantly degraded gao et al 2018 until 2010 the total glacier area was approximately 80 km2 and the total associated water reserve was approximately 0 5 billion m3 according to the second glacier inventory dataset of china guo et al 2014 2 2 data used in the study 1 gcm data the gcms used in the study were selected from 47 gcms in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 hu et al 2014 evaluated the precipitation and temperature of 44 gcms from cmip5 on the tibetan plateau and recommended 19 of them zhang et al 2016a adopted a method proposed by fu et al 2013 to evaluate the outputs of the 47 gcms in the hrb based on these evaluations we selected 5 gcms with relative high spatial accuracy see table 1 from the recommended gcms fig 2 compares the simulated historical annual precipitation and air temperature of the gcms with observations the data show that the simulated precipitation estimates are similar to the observations relative error of less than 20 however the 5 gcms overestimate the air temperature in the upper hrb this system bias is corrected based on the quantile quantile mapping method introduced in section 3 1 fig 2 also shows that the historical air temperature trends simulated by the gcms are close to the observed values as shown in table 1 the gcm simulated values of daily precipitation mean maximum minimum air temperature wind speed and relative humidity under emission scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were adopted in this study 2 historical precipitation air temperature and runoff historical 1 km gridded precipitation and air temperature data from 1981 to 2010 were used as references to correct the future climate data the historical precipitation data were derived from a 3 km resolution gridded daily precipitation dataset and resampled to 1 km grids the spatial resolution required by the ecohydrological model wang et al 2017 the historical air temperature data were interpolated by observations from meteorological stations using an angular distance weighting adw interpolation method willmott et al 1985 new et al 2000 yang et al 2004 and the interpolation considered the temperature gradient with elevation additionally the historical runoff data observed at the yingluoxia station were used for comparison with the simulated future runoff 3 other geographical data topography land use soil parameters and leaf area index lai data are required to build a distributed ecohydrological model the topography data were obtained from the srtm dataset jarvis et al 2008 the land use data were provided by the institute of botany chinese academy of sciences zhou and zheng 2014 the soil parameters including the hydraulic conductivity residual soil moisture content and saturated soil moisture content were derived from a 1 km dataset developed by song et al 2016 the historical lai data were derived from an lai dataset produced by fan 2014 and in this study we assumed that the future lai equals the average of the corresponding values from 2001 to 2010 3 methods 3 1 statistical downscaling of gcm outputs we adopted a bias correction and spatial downscaling bcsd method for statistically downscaling the gcm simulated precipitation and air temperature wood 2002 2004 this method includes two major steps bias correction and spatial downscaling bias correction is implemented based on the quantile quantile mapping method for a given variable such as the precipitation or air temperature the cumulative density function cdf of the control simulation i e historical simulation is first matched with the cdf of the observation and a correction function is generated depending on the quantile then this correction function is used to correct the variable historical and future simulations in a quantile by quantile process boé et al 2007 we assume that the cdfs of the observations and historical gcm simulations are f 1 x and f 2 x respectively then we correct the gcm simulation xsim to xcor f 1 1 f 2 xsim bias correction is applied at the spatial scale of the gcm output for convenience we define the grid scale of gcm output as a large scale then the corrected values are spatially downscaled to a small scale which is required by the hydrological model 1 km in this study we first define the adjustment coefficient of the large scale grid m n as f t m n xcor m n xobs m n for air temperature and f p m n xcor m n xobs m n for precipitation where xobs m n denotes the long term mean observed value then we spatially interpolate resample the adjustment coefficients f t and f p to the small scale using the adw interpolation method willmott et al 1985 new et al 2000 yang et al 2004 finally the corrected simulation results for the small scale grid u v are calculated as xcor u v xobs u v f t u v for temperature and xcor u v xobs u v f p u v for precipitation 3 2 geomorphology based ecohydrological model gbehm gbehm was developed to simulate hydrological processes by considering the cryospheric processes in cold regions gao et al 2016 in the model glacier melting is calculated based on an energy balance equation gao et al 2018 1 q m sw 1 α lw in lw out q h q l q g q r where q m is the net energy absorbed by the surface of the glacier w m2 sw is the incoming shortwave radiation w m2 α is the surface albedo lw in is the incoming longwave radiation w m2 lw out is the outgoing longwave radiation w m2 q h is the sensible heat flux w m2 q l is the latent heat flux w m2 q g is the penetrating shortwave radiation w m2 and q r is the energy from rainfall w m2 soil freezing and thawing processes are simulated based on the calculation of the energy balance in the soil layer gao et al 2018 2 c s t t ρ i l f θ i t z λ s t z ρ l c l q l t z 0 where c s is the volumetric soil heat capacity j m 3 k 1 t is the temperature k of the soil layers t is time s z is the vertical depth of the soil m ρ i

specific heat of liquid water j kg 1 k 1 and q l is the water flux between different soil layers m s the model fully couples the soil freeze thaw process and hydrological processes the freeze thaw process affects soil infiltration which further effects additional hydrological processes in terms of the runoff production mechanism the model distinguishes between saturation excess runoff and infiltration excess runoff surface runoff is calculated based on excess infiltration or the exceedance of soil saturation yang et al 2015 the calculation of subsurface flow considers the difference between the saturated zone and unsaturated zone flow in the saturated zone is calculated based on a mass balance equation and darcy s law and flow in the unsaturated zone is described using the one dimensional richards equation yang et al 2002 the details of gbehm can be found in recent studies by yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 qin et al 2017 and gao et al 2018 yang et al 2015 and gao et al 2016 applied gbehm in the upper hrb with the support of an integrated research project under the major research plan of the integrated research on the ecohydrological processes of the heihe river basin which has been funded by the national natural science foundation of china since 2010 based on the model hydrological processes and cryospheric processes in the upper hrb over the past 50 years 1961 2010 were successfully simulated and validated yang et al 2015 gao et al 2018 moreover the ecohydrological processes spatial patterns of water balance components the effects of frozen soil degradation on the hydrological processes were analyzed in detail as were other relevant issues gao et al 2016 2018 in the present study the cryospheric and hydrological responses to future climate change from 2011 to 2060 are simulated based on gbehm the model parameters are consistent with those used in the historical simulation calibrated by gao et al 2016 2018 and the initial conditions of the simulation in this study are adopted as the historical simulation results for 2010 3 3 attribution analysis of the hydrological changes in this study we mainly focus on the impacts of future precipitation and air temperature changes and ignored the changes in other climate factors such as solar radiation we also neglect changes in land use cover e g vegetation in the study area the effects of precipitation and air temperature changes on runoff and evapotranspiration are quantified using a climate elasticity model fu 1981 schaake 1990 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 chiew et al 2006 yang and yang 2011 konapala and mishra 2016 the impacts of precipitation and air temperature changes on runoff and evapotranspiration can be calculated as follows 3 δ r i r ε p r δ p i p ε t r δ t i t 4 δ et i et ε p et δ p i p ε t et δ t i t where i is the year number δ r i δ p i δ t i and δ et i are the changes in annual mean runoff r i precipitation p i air temperature t i and evapotranspiration et i compared to the long term mean values of r p t and et respectively and δ r i r δ p i p δ t t and δ et et are the normalized values of the differences because the long term mean air temperature in the upper hrb is approximately 2 c the normalization of δ t i is δ t t ε p r and ε t r are the precipitation and air temperature elasticities of runoff and ε p et and ε t et are the precipitation and air temperature elasticities of evapotranspiration respectively ma et al 2010 to clearly express the contributions of precipitation and air temperature changes to runoff and evapotranspiration changes eqs 3 and 4 can be rewritten in the following forms 5 δ r i δ r i p δ r i t ε p r δ p i ε t r δ t i 6 δ et i δ et i p δ et i t ε p et δ p i ε t et δ t i where δ r i p δ r i t δ et i p and δ et i t are the runoff change caused by a precipitation change runoff change caused by an air temperature change evapotranspiration change caused by a precipitation change and evapotranspiration change caused by an air temperature change respectively additionally ε p r ε p r r p ε t r ε t r r t ε p et ε p et et p and ε t et ε t et et t are the new forms of the elasticities which reflect the changes in runoff or evapotranspiration when precipitation or the air temperature changes by one unit 1 mm for precipitation and 1 c for air temperature in this study the future elasticities are compared with the historical values to assess whether the elasticities change in the future the effects of air temperature changes on runoff and evapotranspiration can be divided into two major categories potential evaporation changes and cryospheric changes we assume potential evaporation changes are mainly caused by temperature changes because variations in solar radiation are ignored due to the scarcity of glaciers in the upper hrb the cryospheric changes are mainly reflected by the changes in frozen soil wang et al 2015 moreover one possible mechanism that influences changes in frozen ground and the related hydrological processes is the thickening of the active layer which increases the soil moisture capacity wang et al 2015 therefore in eqs 5 and 6 the effects of air temperature changes on runoff δ r i t and evapotranspiration δ et i t are divided into δ r i t δ r i pet δ r i d and δ et i t δ et i pet δ et i d respectively where subscript pet represents the impact of a potential evaporation change and subscript d represents the impact of a change in the depth of the active layer consequently eqs 5 and 6 can be revised as follows 7 δ r i δ r i p δ r i pet δ r i d ε p r δ p ε pet r δ pet i ε d r δ d i 8 δ et i δ et i p δ et i pet δ et i d ε p et δ p ε pet et δ pet i ε d et δ d i where δ pet and δ d i are the differences in annual mean potential evaporation pet i and the active layer depth d i compared to the long term mean values pet and d respectively additionally ε pet r ε d r ε pet et and ε d et are elasticities that represent the changes in runoff or evapotranspiration when potential evaporation or the active layer depth changes by one unit 1 mm for potential evaporation and 1 cm for the active layer depth 4 results 4 1 the future climate in the upper hrb table 1 provides the precipitation and air temperature trends after bias correction and downscaling over 50 years 2011 2060 based on the 5 gcm outputs which represent 5 future climate scenarios the future climate scenarios given by csiro mk3 6 0 and mpi esm lr yield rates of temperature increase higher than the historical trend and the future precipitation trends are different notably csiro mk3 6 0 produces a significant increasing trend and mpi esm lr obtains a decreasing trend bcc csm1 1 m ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cm5 yield rates of increases in the air temperature that are lower than or similar with the historical trend ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cm5 simulate significant increasing trends for future precipitation and bcc csm1 1 m displays a slight decreasing trend fig 3 presents the annual sequences of future precipitation and air temperature generally the upstream portion of the hrb is expected to warm at an average rate of 0 34 c 10a and precipitation is expected to experience a slight increasing trend of 5 9 mm 10a the average rate of air temperature increase of 0 34 c 10a is close to the estimation of the average warming rate in the hrb or northeastern tibetan plateau under the rcp4 5 emission scenario in previous studies su et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a 4 2 changes in glaciers and the frozen soils under future climate scenarios table 2 shows the changes in glaciers and frozen soils from 2011 to 2060 based on gbehm outputs the results show that for rising temperatures glaciers will largely disappear by 2060 to less than 100 million m3 in this study permafrost and seasonal frozen ground are distinguished according to the soil temperature a grid cell was characterized as permafrost when the simulated soil temperature was at or below 0 c for at least two consecutive years woo 2012 gao et al 2018 in 2010 the simulated permafrost area was approximately 5800 km2 gao et al 2018 in the future 50 years the permafrost area is projected to shrink by approximately 25 17 34 based on different climate scenarios fig 4 shows the spatially averaged monthly ground temperature from 2011 to 2060 in the elevation range between 3600 and 3900 m which is the transition zone from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground the results were calculated as the mean value of simulations based on the 5 gcms the result indicate that the simulated ground temperature displays a significant increasing trend and the transition from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground is obvious in the 2010s permafrost and the active layer depth were relatively stable beginning in the 2020s permafrost starts to degrade to seasonal frozen ground in addition to decreases in the permafrost area the future degradation of frozen soil is also observed based on the decrease in the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground mtsfg and the thickening of the active layer of the permafrost the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground displays a significant decreasing trend of approximately 5 4 cm 10a 3 0 6 7 cm 10a for different climate scenarios and the active layer depth will significantly increase by approximately 6 1 cm 10a 3 4 8 5 cm 10a for different climate scenarios fig 5 presents the changes in the mtsfg and active layer depth of the permafrost from 2011 to 2060 mean value of the simulation results of 5 gcms 4 3 changes in the annual water balance under future climate scenarios fig 6 shows the changes in simulated runoff and evapotranspiration in the future 50 years based on different gcms because of the uncertainty in the future climate the results are not directly expressed by annual runoff and evapotranspiration but by 5 year moving average values based on the results annual runoff exhibits a decreasing trend and annual evapotranspiration displays a significant increasing trend on average annual runoff is expected to be reduced by approximately 5 mm 10a and the decreases mainly occur in the 2010s and around approximately 2050 by the end of the 2050s the runoff is expected to be only approximately 1 4 billion m3 or approximately 80 of the runoff in the 2000s evapotranspiration is expected to increase by approximately 9 mm 10a mainly in the 2010s 2030s and 2050s this finding is consistent with the changes in the mtsfg and active layer depth of the permafrost indicating that the thinning of the frozen layer and thickening of the active layer may have important effects on evapotranspiration in addition annual fluctuations in simulated runoff and evapotranspiration based on different gcms are different although the long term trends are similar table 3 shows the average water balance components over the next 50 years based on different gcms in comparison to the values over the past 30 years 1981 2010 simulated by gao et al 2016 precipitation is clearly more abundant in the next 50 years 486 518 mm based on different gcms 498 mm on average than in the past 30 years 476 mm however the runoff in the future 124 159 mm based on different gcms 138 mm on average is less than that in the past 165 mm more precipitation will be lost via evapotranspiration 356 363 mm based on different gcms 360 mm on average in the future and 312 mm in the past additionally the runoff coefficient will be smaller in the future 0 28 on average than that in the past 0 35 table 4 shows the trends of runoff coefficients over the future 50 years in different elevation zones based on different gcms the four elevation zones from low to high include the low altitude vegetation sparse area less than 2800 m highly vegetated area 2800 3600 m permafrost degradation area 3600 3900 m and high altitude permafrost area 3900 m the results show that the runoff coefficient decreases in each elevation zone the most dramatic decrease occurs in the elevation zone from 3600 to 3900 m indicating that the degradation process from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground significantly influences the related hydrological processes additionally permafrost degradation increases infiltration and groundwater leakage leading to a decrease in surface runoff 4 4 impacts of precipitation and air temperature changes on annual runoff and evapotranspiration table 5 shows the precipitation and air temperature elasticities of runoff evapotranspiration and the runoff and evapotranspiration changes estimated using the average elasticities in the future 50 years 2011 2060 under the rcp4 5 scenario in comparison with those in the previous 30 years 1981 2010 the results show that when precipitation increases by one unit 1 mm runoff will increase by 0 72 mm on average 0 53 0 90 mm based on different gcms and evapotranspiration will increase by 0 18 mm on average 0 06 0 27 mm based on different gcms in the future these values are similar to the historical observations runoff increase by 0 66 mm and evapotranspiration increase by 0 14 mm when the air temperature rises by 1 c runoff will decrease by 24 mm on average 15 40 mm based on different gcms and evapotranspiration will increase by 21 mm on average 15 32 mm based on different gcms these values that are notably higher absolute values than those in the past based on historical observations runoff decrease by 6 8 mm and evapotranspiration increase by 11 8 mm this result indicates that runoff and evapotranspiration may be more sensitive to air temperature increases in the future in addition to the increase in potential evaporation as the air temperature rises the increase in air temperature may indirectly affect some hydrological processes the runoff and evapotranspiration changes in the future based on the average elasticities indicate that decreased runoff and increased evapotranspiration in the future are mainly due to the temperature increase because the future precipitation change is not significant future climate change is associated with considerable uncertainties table 1 shows that the climate change trends obtained from different gcms are considerably different however there is a general consensus that warming will continue in the future consequently understanding the response of hydrological processes to the rising air temperature is very important based on the estimated air temperature elasticities of runoff evapotranspiration in the future we can directly estimate the runoff and evapotranspiration changes under different increased temperature scenarios table 6 shows the air temperature trends and their effects on runoff and evapotranspiration changes estimated using the average elasticities shown in table 5 under different emission scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in the future 50 years 2011 2060 in comparison with those in the past 1981 2010 the average rates of air temperature increases in the future are approximately 0 26 c 10a rcp 2 6 0 34 c 10a rcp 4 5 and 0 40 c 10a rcp8 5 in the hrb or the northeastern tibetan plateau su et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a according to the elasticities runoff would decrease at a rate of 6 mm 10a under rcp 2 6 scenario 8 mm 10a under rcp 4 5 scenario and 10 mm 10a under rcp 8 5 scenario and evapotranspiration would increase at a rate of 6 mm 10a under rcp 2 6 scenario 7 mm 10a under rcp 4 5 scenario and 8 mm 10a under rcp 8 5 scenario 4 5 impact of changes in the active layer depth of permafrost on hydrological processes table 7 gives the potential evaporation and active layer depth elasticities of runoff and evapotranspiration in the future 50 years 2011 2060 the results show that when potential evaporation increases by one unit 1 mm runoff will decrease by approximately 0 16 mm on average 0 03 0 28 mm based on different gcms and evapotranspiration will increase by approximately 0 3 mm on average 0 14 0 51 mm based on different gcms when the active layer depth of permafrost increases by one unit 1 cm runoff will decrease by approximately 1 3 mm on average 0 6 2 3 mm based on different gcms and evapotranspiration will increase by approximately 0 9 mm on average 0 1 1 7 mm based on different gcms table 8 shows the effects of changes in potential evaporation and the active layer depth on annual runoff and evapotranspiration in the future 50 years 2011 2060 which were estimated based on the average elasticities shown in table 7 the results show that both the potential evaporation change and the active layer depth change contribute to the runoff decrease and evapotranspiration increase and the contribution of the active layer depth change is notably higher than the contribution of the potential evaporation change especially for annual runoff in addition the aggregate effects of potential evaporation and active layer depth changes on runoff and evapotranspiration are given in table 8 for comparison with the air temperature influences shown in table 5 the results indicate that the two values are similar although the results from each individual gcm may have some bias because the average elasticities cannot perfectly represent the elasticities of each gcm thus the assumption that the impacts of air temperature change can be divided into the impact of the potential evaporation change and the impact of the active layer depth change is reasonable consequently we can conclude that the main influence of the air temperature change on runoff is associated with the change in the active depth of the frozen soil rather than the change in potential evaporation the rising temperature thickens the active layer depth of the frozen ground leading to an increase in the soil storage capacity and changing the mechanism of runoff production 5 discussion 5 1 impact of frozen ground degradation on runoff change in the upper hrb precipitation is mainly concentrated in the summer and the soil in summer is largely saturated the main runoff production mechanism in the upper hrb is excess saturation in addition precipitation increases significantly with elevation in the upper hrb wang et al 2017 therefore runoff is mainly generated at high latitudes and the permafrost region and transition region from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground contribute the most to runoff in the upper hrb gao et al 2016 according to the results in section 4 the effects of the degradation of frozen soil in these two regions on the runoff change are different in permafrost areas the thickening of the active layer increases the soil storage capacity fig 7 shows the change in simulated monthly basin averaged soil liquid water from 2011 to 2060 and the change in the annual soil liquid water equivalent the results show that the soil liquid water content significantly increases in the next 50 years and that the lower boundary of soil liquid water becomes deeper due to the impact of active layer changes on the soil water capacity the annual soil liquid water equivalent displays a significant increasing trend and the associated changes are highly correlated with the changes in the active layer depth of permafrost fig 5 with a correlation coefficient r2 equal to 0 98 this finding also indicates that the change in the active layer depth has a significant effect on soil moisture due to the main runoff production mode in the upper hrb is saturation excess runoff the increase in the soil storage capacity significantly impacts runoff decrease and evapotranspiration increase in the transition areas the change from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground increases groundwater infiltration leading to an increase in liquid soil moisture in the deep layers and a decrease in surface runoff notably frozen ground degradation causes an increase in the water storage capacity thereby changing the runoff mechanism cao et al 2012 analyzed the change in the soil storage capacity in the hrb from 2003 to 2008 based on grace data and observed an increasing trend which is consistent with our conclusion in previous studies climate change was often considered based on changes in precipitation and drought indexes namely potential evaporation divided by precipitation therefore the impacts of climate change on runoff change were divided between the impact of precipitation change and the impact of potential evaporation change e g the budyko based approach budyko 1974 yang and yang 2011 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b however in cold areas in addition to the effects of precipitation change and potential evaporation change the influence of frozen ground changes on runoff is also important even more important than the effects of precipitation and potential evaporation changes according to the results in section 4 5 consequently it is necessary to consider the effect of frozen ground change when analyzing the influences of climate change on runoff in future studies 5 2 differences in frozen ground changes in the past and future over the past 30 years 1981 2010 the increasing air temperature trend was approximately 0 33 c 10a based on the gbehm simulation result gao et al 2018 the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground decreased by approximately 4 1 cm 10a and the active layer depth increased by approximately 2 2 cm 10a over the past 30 years these results were validated based on the gauge observations from national meteorological stations wang et al 2013 wu and zhang 2010 peng et al 2017 the rate of increase in air temperature over the future 50 years approximately 0 34 c 10a estimated in this study in the upper hrb is close to the historical value however both the decrease in the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground and thickening of the active layer of permafrost are projected to accelerate in the future 5 4 cm 10a and 6 1 cm 10a respectively compared with the rates in the past this difference partially explains why the absolute values of the air temperature elasticities of annual runoff evapotranspiration in the future are much higher than those in the past as shown in table 5 thus the hydrological changes in the hrb are highly sensitive to the increase in air temperature due to the degradation of frozen ground 5 3 comparison with previous similar studies this study is a follow up to the series of studies of our research group in our previous studies we used an empirical model and a physical model to estimate the effects of climate change on frozen ground and the impacts of frozen ground degradation on hydrological processes respectively based on the empirical model the budyko framework we conducted an attribution analysis of the runoff changes in a frozen ground region in the context of climate change wang et al 2018 the research distinguished the effects of changes in precipitation potential evaporation frozen ground and land use on runoff changes and the conclusion that frozen ground change had a significant effect on the change in runoff was obtained however the study by wang et al 2018 did not quantitatively provide the air temperature elasticity of runoff and the frozen ground elasticity of runoff therefore the effects of air temperature change on runoff in the future could not be assessed based on the physical model gbhem gao et al 2018 simulated the changes in frozen ground and the changes in hydrological processes based on historical climate trends the study explained the physical mechanisms of the impact of warming on frozen ground and the impacts of frozen ground degradation on hydrological processes the current study is an extension of gao s research based on gbehm we simulated the changes in frozen ground and runoff under typical climate scenarios in the future based on the simulation results we estimated the air temperature elasticity of runoff and the frozen ground elasticity of runoff then according to the elasticities we quantitatively estimated the changes in frozen ground and runoff under different increased temperature scenarios in the future this study shows that the degradation of frozen ground in the upper hrb increases infiltration and soil water storage which subsequently increases evapotranspiration and reduces runoff the degradation of frozen ground leads to an increase in soil water storage which is consistent with the results of several previous studies including studies in arctic alaska mcnamara et al 1998 north america lyon and destouni 2010 austria rogger et al 2017 and the tibetan plateau region cuo et al 2015 gao et al 2018 however the conclusion that permafrost deterioration will lead to a reduction in runoff varies in different regions for example previous studies in the source regions of the yellow river jin et al 2009 and yangtze river qiu 2012 showed that the degradation of permafrost can lead to a decrease in runoff which was the cause of the thickening of the active layer of permafrost qiu 2012 these conclusions are consistent with the findings of this study studies by lyon et al 2009 in north america and rogger et al 2017 in austria suggested that the degradation of permafrost increases the melting of soil ice which leads to an increase in runoff this difference may be related to climatic differences the climate of the upper hrb is relatively dry and previous studies showed that there is little soil ice in the frozen soils of the region gao et al 2018 in recent years zhang et al 2016a and chen et al 2018 also analyzed the future cryospheric and hydrological changes in the upper hrb based on different hydrological models chen et al 2018 showed that the glaciers in the upper hrb could disappear in the future which is consistent with the findings of the present study both studies stated that future runoff would increase due to increased precipitation the two studies also noted that future precipitation is associated with considerable uncertainty compared with these previous studies the present study quantified the impact of the accelerated degradation of the frozen soils caused by the air temperature increase on future runoff and evapotranspiration this research shows that the effects of permafrost degradation on runoff are greater than the impacts of glacier melt and snow melt in the upper hrb all gcms projected increases in the future air temperature thus regardless of how precipitation changes in the future the degradation of permafrost caused by increased air temperatures is projected to significantly reduce runoff and potentially result in water resource shortages in the lower reaches of the study area 5 4 uncertainty and limitations the sources of uncertainty in this study include the climate models the downscaling and bias correction methods and the structure and parameters of the ecohydrological model wilby and harris 2006 because future climate simulations are uncertain the low spatial accuracy of the gcms leads to difficulty in reflecting the spatial variability of the climate in mountainous areas despite the application of downscaling and bias correction methods the high resolution spatial patterns of the climate factors such as precipitation and air temperature are difficult to perfectly represent uncertainties with respect to the choice of model parameterization in the ecohydrological simulation are another complicated source of error since the terrain conditions in mountainous areas are complex the inhomogeneity among factors such as surface albedo soil type soil depth land use type and vegetation cover may not be fully captured at the regional scale moreover soil water and heat parameters can affect ecohydrological simulations the above uncertainties lead to variations in the conclusions obtained based on different climate models to reduce the impacts of these uncertainties this study adopted an ensemble estimation based on multiple gcms future improvement of the gcms and the consideration of additional data could greatly reduce these uncertainties 6 conclusion based on 5 typical future climate scenarios under emission scenario rcp4 5 this study employed a distributed ecohydrological model gbehm to analyze the potential future climate change from 2011 to 2060 and the associated impacts on the cryospheric and hydrological processes in the upper hrb according to the simulation results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the air temperature is projected to rise by approximately 0 34 c 10a and precipitation is projected to slightly increase by approximately 6 mm 10a in the future under rcp 4 5 scenario by 2060 glaciers would comprise a volume of less than 100 million m3 the permafrost area would shrink by approximately 23 the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground would decrease by approximately 5 4 cm 10a and the active layer depth over the permafrost would increase by approximately 6 1 cm 10a 2 due to climate change runoff is projected to decrease by approximately 5 mm 10a and evapotranspiration is projected to increase by approximately 9 mm 10a the average increases in annual precipitation runoff and et over the future 50 years are estimated to be 498 mm 138 mm and 360 mm respectively this average runoff is only 80 of that in the 2000s the average runoff coefficient over the future 50 years is 0 28 and the decrease in the runoff coefficient is greatest in the elevation zone of 3600 3900 m where permafrost degrades and becomes seasonal frozen ground 3 over the future 50 years the changes in hydrological processes are mainly due to the increase in the air temperature with average changes of 24 mm c for runoff and 21 mm c for evapotranspiration the effects of air temperature changes on runoff and evapotranspiration are largely dominated by changes in frozen ground the first associated mechanism is the thickening of the active layer which increases the soil storage capacity and leads to a decrease in runoff and increase in evapotranspiration when the active layer depth increases by 1 cm runoff will decrease by approximately 1 3 mm and evapotranspiration will increase by approximately 0 9 mm the other mechanism involves changes from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground which increase groundwater infiltration and the volume of liquid soil moisture in the deep layers and decrease surface runoff 4 the frozen ground in the upper hrb is more sensitive to temperature increases in the future than those in the past this trend leads to a faster reduction in runoff in the future based on the same rate of temperature increase 5 the elasticities obtained in this study can be utilized to estimate the runoff changes in different climate scenarios based on these elasticities future runoff would decrease at rates of approximately 6 mm 10a 8 mm 10a and 10 mm 10a under the emission scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively additionally and evapotranspiration would increase at rates of approximately 6 mm 10a 7 mm 10a and 8 mm 10a under these three emission scenarios in this study we did not consider vegetation changes in the future however the interactions among vegetation growth cryospheric processes and hydrological processes could be important therefore the effects of vegetation dynamics should be considered in future studies

7119,on the tibetan plateau climate change particularly increases in air temperature significantly affects cryospheric and hydrological processes based on 5 typical future climate scenarios from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 under emission scenario rcp4 5 and a distributed ecohydrological model gbehm this study analyzes the potential characteristics of future climate change from 2011 to 2060 and the associated effects on the cryospheric and hydrological processes in the upper heihe river basin a typical cold mountain region located on the northeastern tibetan plateau the precipitation air temperature and frozen ground elasticities of runoff evapotranspiration are then estimated based on the simulation results the typical future climate scenarios suggest that air temperature will increase at an average rate of 0 34 c 10a in the future and that precipitation will increase slightly by 6 mm 10a under the rcp 4 5 emission scenario based on the gbehm simulated results due to the increase in air temperature glaciers would be reduced to less than 100 million m3 by 2060 the permafrost area would shrink by 23 the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground would decrease by 5 4 cm 10a and the active layer depth of the frozen ground would increase by 6 1 cm 10a additionally runoff would decrease by approximately 5 mm 10a and evapotranspiration would increase by approximately 9 mm 10a the estimated elasticities indicate that annual runoff would decrease at an average rate of 24 mm c and evapotranspiration would increase at an average rate of 21 mm c with rising air temperature in the future the impacts of increased air temperature on hydrological processes are mainly due to changes in frozen ground the thickening of the active layer of the frozen ground increases the soil storage capacity leading to decreased runoff and increased evapotranspiration when the active layer depth increases by 1 cm annual runoff decreases by approximately 1 3 mm and annual evapotranspiration increases by approximately 0 9 mm in addition the shift from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground increases groundwater infiltration which decreases surface runoff compared to that over the past 50 years the effect of increased air temperature on the frozen ground in the upper heihe river basin will be greater in the future which would result in a faster reduction in runoff in the future considering the effects of global warming keywords increasing air temperature frozen ground runoff change distributed ecohydrological model heihe river basin 1 introduction the tibetan plateau as the source area of many major asian rivers provides valuable freshwater resources for hundreds of millions of people in china and southeast asian countries immerzeel et al 2010 due to its unique geography the tibetan plateau is more sensitive to global climate change than other areas bales et al 2006 cheng and wu 2007 in recent decades rivers on the tibetan plateau have experienced significant but different runoff changes due to climate change cuo et al 2014 on the eastern tibetan plateau which is controlled by the east asian monsoon runoff has decreased yang et al 2011 and in the region mainly controlled by the westerly belt runoff has increased cheng and jin 2013 will these trends continue or change in the future to develop reasonable water resource management strategies it is important to reasonably estimate the trends of river runoff unlike other regions the tibetan plateau is widely covered by permafrost and glaciers previous studies have shown that in addition to the changes in temperature and precipitation cryospheric changes such as variations in glacier coverage and the area of frozen ground have had important and far reaching effects on the ecological and hydrological processes in the basin barry and gan 2011 immerzeel et al 2012 cuo et al 2014 accelerated glacial ablation can increase surface runoff reduce water reserves and change the surface albedo and permafrost degradation can alter the soil moisture content soil water storage capacity and other hydrological elements cuo et al 2015 in recent decades global warming has led to the substantial retreat of frozen ground and glaciers on the tibetan plateau yao et al 2007 kang et al 2010 cheng and jin 2013 in the past 30 years the permafrost area of the tibetan plateau has been reduced from 1 50 106 km2 to 1 05 106 km2 and the permafrost degradation trend may continue or even accelerate in the future cheng and jin 2013 according to the first and second glacier inventory datasets of china guo et al 2014 the glacier area on the tibetan plateau retreated by 23 over the past 50 years these changes will further affect the hydrological cycle therefore to reliably predict future runoff trends it is important to answer the following 3 questions 1 how will the cryospheric response vary for typical future climate change scenarios 2 how will climate change effect hydrological processes and what factors cause changes to glacier and frozen soil regimes 3 can these influences be quantified previous studies have lacked the ability to estimate cryospheric changes in the context of future climate change and analyses of the impacts of cryospheric changes on hydrological processes have not been conducted distributed hydrological models that consider cryospheric processes are the major tools used to estimate the spatial distribution and dynamic variations of cryospheric and hydrological processes in previous studies models such as mike she bosson et al 2012 clm lawrence et al 2015 web dhm wang et al 2010 and vic cuo et al 2015 considered the effects of cryospheric processes however in most of these studies frozen ground was considered a static layer the dynamic changes in frozen ground and the interactions between frozen ground and hydrological processes were not effectively considered qin et al 2016 yang et al 2015 developed a distributed ecohydrological model gbehm that fully couples cryospheric processes with this model the spatial distribution and dynamic variations of glaciers and frozen soils can be simulated gao et al 2016 gbehm has been applied in certain river basins on the tibetan plateau such as the heihe river basin hrb and upper yellow river basin and the cryospheric and hydrological processes in recent decades were successfully simulated yang et al 2015 qin et al 2016 based on the model the responses of cryospheric and hydrological processes to climate change in the future can be analyzed future climate scenarios are mainly derived from the simulation results of general circulation models gcms fowler et al 2007 in general gcm simulations often have bias compared to measured values therefore bias correction is needed due to the lack of gauge observations future simulation results must be corrected based on the relationship between historical data and historical model simulation results wood et al 2004 three bias correction methods have mainly been used in previous studies including the delta method the unbiasing method and the quantile quantile mapping method gao 2012 the quantile quantile mapping method has been widely adopted boé et al 2007 in addition to bias another problem associated with gcm simulations is their low spatial resolution the original gcm outputs cannot meet the requirements of high spatial resolution hydrological simulations wood 2002 2004 and a spatial downscaling process is necessary among statistical downscaling and dynamic downscaling methods statistical downscaling methods are simple and more applicable when historical observations are abundant gao 2012 the hrb which is located on the northeastern tibetan plateau is the second largest inland river basin in china it flows through the hexi corridor which is the most important route from northern china to central asia for traders and the military and an essential grain producing region in northwestern china zhang et al 2016a the water resources required for socioeconomic development and the sustainment of ecosystems in the middle and lower reaches of the basin are heavily dependent on the water from the headwater region the headwater region of the heihe river is covered by frozen ground specifically this area is the junction area of permafrost and seasonal frozen soil wang et al 2013 which is sensitive to climate change cuo et al 2015 the hrb has been considered a typical region for scientists to study the hydrology and water resources of cold and arid regions in china ning et al 2008 this study assesses the potential climate changes based on the outputs of gcms and the associated influences on the cryospheric and hydrological processes in the hrb from 2011 to 2060 using a distributed hydrological model the objectives of this study are as follows i to estimate the possible climate changes in the hrb over the next 50 years ii to estimate the responses of cryospheric and hydrologic processes especially runoff to future climate change and iii to quantitatively analyze the effects of precipitation air temperature and frozen ground changes on runoff 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the hrb originates on the north slope of the qilian mountains located on the northeastern tibetan plateau flows through the hexi corridor and ends in juyanhai lake fig 1 the upper reach of the heihe river is located at an elevation of 1800 5000 m and gauged at yingluoxia hydrological station the river has a drainage area of 10 009 km2 and generates nearly 70 of the total runoff in the basin yang et al 2015 in the 2000s the mean annual runoff observed at yingluoxia station was approximately 1 8 billion m3 the annual precipitation in the upper hrb ranges from 200 to 700 mm and the annual mean air temperature ranges from 9 to 5 c precipitation and temperature are significantly affected by the elevation of the upper hrb precipitation increases with elevation and temperature decreases with elevation wang et al 2017 which also leads to the significant spatial variability in land use cover gao et al 2016 low elevation areas are relatively arid and mainly distributed with seasonal frozen soils as elevation and precipitation increase water becomes more abundant and vegetation types and cover increase the elevation zone of 2800 m 3600 m is the most vegetated area in the basin gao et al 2016 as the elevation continues to increase the temperature drop leads to sparse vegetation the 3600 3900 m elevation range is mainly the transition zone from permafrost to seasonal frozen soil gao et al 2018 in addition the area above 4000 m is mainly the permafrost area and includes a few glaciers as the temperature has increased in recent decades the glaciers and frozen grounds in the upper hrb have become significantly degraded gao et al 2018 until 2010 the total glacier area was approximately 80 km2 and the total associated water reserve was approximately 0 5 billion m3 according to the second glacier inventory dataset of china guo et al 2014 2 2 data used in the study 1 gcm data the gcms used in the study were selected from 47 gcms in the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 http cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 hu et al 2014 evaluated the precipitation and temperature of 44 gcms from cmip5 on the tibetan plateau and recommended 19 of them zhang et al 2016a adopted a method proposed by fu et al 2013 to evaluate the outputs of the 47 gcms in the hrb based on these evaluations we selected 5 gcms with relative high spatial accuracy see table 1 from the recommended gcms fig 2 compares the simulated historical annual precipitation and air temperature of the gcms with observations the data show that the simulated precipitation estimates are similar to the observations relative error of less than 20 however the 5 gcms overestimate the air temperature in the upper hrb this system bias is corrected based on the quantile quantile mapping method introduced in section 3 1 fig 2 also shows that the historical air temperature trends simulated by the gcms are close to the observed values as shown in table 1 the gcm simulated values of daily precipitation mean maximum minimum air temperature wind speed and relative humidity under emission scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were adopted in this study 2 historical precipitation air temperature and runoff historical 1 km gridded precipitation and air temperature data from 1981 to 2010 were used as references to correct the future climate data the historical precipitation data were derived from a 3 km resolution gridded daily precipitation dataset and resampled to 1 km grids the spatial resolution required by the ecohydrological model wang et al 2017 the historical air temperature data were interpolated by observations from meteorological stations using an angular distance weighting adw interpolation method willmott et al 1985 new et al 2000 yang et al 2004 and the interpolation considered the temperature gradient with elevation additionally the historical runoff data observed at the yingluoxia station were used for comparison with the simulated future runoff 3 other geographical data topography land use soil parameters and leaf area index lai data are required to build a distributed ecohydrological model the topography data were obtained from the srtm dataset jarvis et al 2008 the land use data were provided by the institute of botany chinese academy of sciences zhou and zheng 2014 the soil parameters including the hydraulic conductivity residual soil moisture content and saturated soil moisture content were derived from a 1 km dataset developed by song et al 2016 the historical lai data were derived from an lai dataset produced by fan 2014 and in this study we assumed that the future lai equals the average of the corresponding values from 2001 to 2010 3 methods 3 1 statistical downscaling of gcm outputs we adopted a bias correction and spatial downscaling bcsd method for statistically downscaling the gcm simulated precipitation and air temperature wood 2002 2004 this method includes two major steps bias correction and spatial downscaling bias correction is implemented based on the quantile quantile mapping method for a given variable such as the precipitation or air temperature the cumulative density function cdf of the control simulation i e historical simulation is first matched with the cdf of the observation and a correction function is generated depending on the quantile then this correction function is used to correct the variable historical and future simulations in a quantile by quantile process boé et al 2007 we assume that the cdfs of the observations and historical gcm simulations are f 1 x and f 2 x respectively then we correct the gcm simulation xsim to xcor f 1 1 f 2 xsim bias correction is applied at the spatial scale of the gcm output for convenience we define the grid scale of gcm output as a large scale then the corrected values are spatially downscaled to a small scale which is required by the hydrological model 1 km in this study we first define the adjustment coefficient of the large scale grid m n as f t m n xcor m n xobs m n for air temperature and f p m n xcor m n xobs m n for precipitation where xobs m n denotes the long term mean observed value then we spatially interpolate resample the adjustment coefficients f t and f p to the small scale using the adw interpolation method willmott et al 1985 new et al 2000 yang et al 2004 finally the corrected simulation results for the small scale grid u v are calculated as xcor u v xobs u v f t u v for temperature and xcor u v xobs u v f p u v for precipitation 3 2 geomorphology based ecohydrological model gbehm gbehm was developed to simulate hydrological processes by considering the cryospheric processes in cold regions gao et al 2016 in the model glacier melting is calculated based on an energy balance equation gao et al 2018 1 q m sw 1 α lw in lw out q h q l q g q r where q m is the net energy absorbed by the surface of the glacier w m2 sw is the incoming shortwave radiation w m2 α is the

process affects soil infiltration which further effects additional hydrological processes in terms of the runoff production mechanism the model distinguishes between saturation excess runoff and infiltration excess runoff surface runoff is calculated based on excess infiltration or the exceedance of soil saturation yang et al 2015 the calculation of subsurface flow considers the difference between the saturated zone and unsaturated zone flow in the saturated zone is calculated based on a mass balance equation and darcy s law and flow in the unsaturated zone is described using the one dimensional richards equation yang et al 2002 the details of gbehm can be found in recent studies by yang et al 2015 gao et al 2016 qin et al 2017 and gao et al 2018 yang et al 2015 and gao et al 2016 applied gbehm in the upper hrb with the support of an integrated research project under the major research plan of the integrated research on the ecohydrological processes of the heihe river basin which has been funded by the national natural science foundation of china since 2010 based on the model hydrological processes and cryospheric processes in the upper hrb over the past 50 years 1961 2010 were successfully simulated and validated yang et al 2015 gao et al 2018 moreover the ecohydrological processes spatial patterns of water balance components the effects of frozen soil degradation on the hydrological processes were analyzed in detail as were other relevant issues gao et al 2016 2018 in the present study the cryospheric and hydrological responses to future climate change from 2011 to 2060 are simulated based on gbehm the model parameters are consistent with those used in the historical simulation calibrated by gao et al 2016 2018 and the initial conditions of the simulation in this study are adopted as the historical simulation results for 2010 3 3 attribution analysis of the hydrological changes in this study we mainly focus on the impacts of future precipitation and air temperature changes and ignored the changes in other climate factors such as solar radiation we also neglect changes in land use cover e g vegetation in the study area the effects of precipitation and air temperature changes on runoff and evapotranspiration are quantified using a climate elasticity model fu 1981 schaake 1990 sankarasubramanian et al 2001 chiew et al 2006 yang and yang 2011 konapala and mishra 2016 the impacts of precipitation and air temperature changes on runoff and evapotranspiration can be calculated as follows 3 δ r i r ε p r δ p i p ε t r δ t i t 4 δ et i et ε p et δ p i p ε t et δ t i t where i is the year number δ r i δ p i δ t i and δ et i are the changes in annual mean runoff r i precipitation p i air temperature t i and evapotranspiration et i compared to the long term mean values of r p t and et respectively and δ r i r δ p i p δ t t and δ et et are the normalized values of the differences because the long term mean air temperature in the upper hrb is approximately 2 c the normalization of δ t i is δ t t ε p r and ε t r are the precipitation and air temperature elasticities of runoff and ε p et and ε t et are the precipitation and air temperature elasticities of evapotranspiration respectively ma et al 2010 to clearly express the contributions of precipitation and air temperature changes to runoff and evapotranspiration changes eqs 3 and 4 can be rewritten in the following forms 5 δ r i δ r i p δ r i t ε p r δ p i ε t r δ t i 6 δ et i δ et i p δ et i t ε p et δ p i ε t et δ t i where δ r i p δ r i t δ et i p and δ et i t are the runoff change caused by a precipitation change runoff change caused by an air temperature change evapotranspiration change caused by a precipitation change and evapotranspiration change caused by an air temperature change respectively additionally ε p r ε p r r p ε t r ε t r r t ε p et ε p et et p and ε t et ε t et et t are the new forms of the elasticities which reflect the changes in runoff or evapotranspiration when precipitation or the air temperature changes by one unit 1 mm for precipitation and 1 c for air temperature in this study the future elasticities are compared with the historical values to assess whether the elasticities change in the future the effects of air temperature changes on runoff and evapotranspiration can be divided into two major categories potential evaporation changes and cryospheric changes we assume potential evaporation changes are mainly caused by temperature changes because variations in solar radiation are ignored due to the scarcity of glaciers in the upper hrb the cryospheric changes are mainly reflected by the changes in frozen soil wang et al 2015 moreover one possible mechanism that influences changes in frozen ground and the related hydrological processes is the thickening of the active layer which increases the soil moisture capacity wang et al 2015 therefore in eqs 5 and 6 the effects of air temperature changes on runoff δ r i t and evapotranspiration δ et i t are divided into δ r i t δ r i pet δ r i d and δ et i t δ et i pet δ et i d respectively where subscript pet represents the impact of a potential evaporation change and subscript d represents the impact of a change in the depth of the active layer consequently eqs 5 and 6 can be revised as follows 7 δ r i δ r i p δ r i pet δ r i d ε p r δ p ε pet r δ pet i ε d r δ d i 8 δ et i δ et i p δ et i pet δ et i d ε p et δ p ε pet et δ pet i ε d et δ d i where δ pet and δ d i are the differences in annual mean potential evaporation pet i and the active layer depth d i compared to the long term mean values pet and d respectively additionally ε pet r ε d r ε pet et and ε d et are elasticities that represent the changes in runoff or evapotranspiration when potential evaporation or the active layer depth changes by one unit 1 mm for potential evaporation and 1 cm for the active layer depth 4 results 4 1 the future climate in the upper hrb table 1 provides the precipitation and air temperature trends after bias correction and downscaling over 50 years 2011 2060 based on the 5 gcm outputs which represent 5 future climate scenarios the future climate scenarios given by csiro mk3 6 0 and mpi esm lr yield rates of temperature increase higher than the historical trend and the future precipitation trends are different notably csiro mk3 6 0 produces a significant increasing trend and mpi esm lr obtains a decreasing trend bcc csm1 1 m ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cm5 yield rates of increases in the air temperature that are lower than or similar with the historical trend ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cm5 simulate significant increasing trends for future precipitation and bcc csm1 1 m displays a slight decreasing trend fig 3 presents the annual sequences of future precipitation and air temperature generally the upstream portion of the hrb is expected to warm at an average rate of 0 34 c 10a and precipitation is expected to experience a slight increasing trend of 5 9 mm 10a the average rate of air temperature increase of 0 34 c 10a is close to the estimation of the average warming rate in the hrb or northeastern tibetan plateau under the rcp4 5 emission scenario in previous studies su et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a 4 2 changes in glaciers and the frozen soils under future climate scenarios table 2 shows the changes in glaciers and frozen soils from 2011 to 2060 based on gbehm outputs the results show that for rising temperatures glaciers will largely disappear by 2060 to less than 100 million m3 in this study permafrost and seasonal frozen ground are distinguished according to the soil temperature a grid cell was characterized as permafrost when the simulated soil temperature was at or below 0 c for at least two consecutive years woo 2012 gao et al 2018 in 2010 the simulated permafrost area was approximately 5800 km2 gao et al 2018 in the future 50 years the permafrost area is projected to shrink by approximately 25 17 34 based on different climate scenarios fig 4 shows the spatially averaged monthly ground temperature from 2011 to 2060 in the elevation range between 3600 and 3900 m which is the transition zone from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground the results were calculated as the mean value of simulations based on the 5 gcms the result indicate that the simulated ground temperature displays a significant increasing trend and the transition from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground is obvious in the 2010s permafrost and the active layer depth were relatively stable beginning in the 2020s permafrost starts to degrade to seasonal frozen ground in addition to decreases in the permafrost area the future degradation of frozen soil is also observed based on the decrease in the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground mtsfg and the thickening of the active layer of the permafrost the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground displays a significant decreasing trend of approximately 5 4 cm 10a 3 0 6 7 cm 10a for different climate scenarios and the active layer depth will significantly increase by approximately 6 1 cm 10a 3 4 8 5 cm 10a for different climate scenarios fig 5 presents the changes in the mtsfg and active layer depth of the permafrost from 2011 to 2060 mean value of the simulation results of 5 gcms 4 3 changes in the annual water balance under future climate scenarios fig 6 shows the changes in simulated runoff and evapotranspiration in the future 50 years based on different gcms because of the uncertainty in the future climate the results are not directly expressed by annual runoff and evapotranspiration but by 5 year moving average values based on the results annual runoff exhibits a decreasing trend and annual evapotranspiration displays a significant increasing trend on average annual runoff is expected to be reduced by approximately 5 mm 10a and the decreases mainly occur in the 2010s and around approximately 2050 by the end of the 2050s the runoff is expected to be only approximately 1 4 billion m3 or approximately 80 of the runoff in the 2000s evapotranspiration is expected to increase by approximately 9 mm 10a mainly in the 2010s 2030s and 2050s this finding is consistent with the changes in the mtsfg and active layer depth of the permafrost indicating that the thinning of the frozen layer and thickening of the active layer may have important effects on evapotranspiration in addition annual fluctuations in simulated runoff and evapotranspiration based on different gcms are different although the long term trends are similar table 3 shows the average water balance components over the next 50 years based on different gcms in comparison to the values over the past 30 years 1981 2010 simulated by gao et al 2016 precipitation is clearly more abundant in the next 50 years 486 518 mm based on different gcms 498 mm on average than in the past 30 years 476 mm however the runoff in the future 124 159 mm based on different gcms 138 mm on average is less than that in the past 165 mm more precipitation will be lost via evapotranspiration 356 363 mm based on different gcms 360 mm on average in the future and 312 mm in the past additionally the runoff coefficient will be smaller in the future 0 28 on average than that in the past 0 35 table 4 shows the trends of runoff coefficients over the future 50 years in different elevation zones based on different gcms the four elevation zones from low to high include the low altitude vegetation sparse area less than 2800 m highly vegetated area 2800 3600 m permafrost degradation area 3600 3900 m and high altitude permafrost area 3900 m the results show that the runoff coefficient decreases in each elevation zone the most dramatic decrease occurs in the elevation zone from 3600 to 3900 m indicating that the degradation process from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground significantly influences the related hydrological processes additionally permafrost degradation increases infiltration and groundwater leakage leading to a decrease in surface runoff 4 4 impacts of precipitation and air temperature changes on annual runoff and evapotranspiration table 5 shows the precipitation and air temperature elasticities of runoff evapotranspiration and the runoff and evapotranspiration changes estimated using the average elasticities in the future 50 years 2011 2060 under the rcp4 5 scenario in comparison with those in the previous 30 years 1981 2010 the results show that when precipitation increases by one unit 1 mm runoff will increase by 0 72 mm on average 0 53 0 90 mm based on different gcms and evapotranspiration will increase by 0 18 mm on average 0 06 0 27 mm based on different gcms in the future these values are similar to the historical observations runoff increase by 0 66 mm and evapotranspiration increase by 0 14 mm when the air temperature rises by 1 c runoff will decrease by 24 mm on average 15 40 mm based on different gcms and evapotranspiration will increase by 21 mm on average 15 32 mm based on different gcms these values that are notably higher absolute values than those in the past based on historical observations runoff decrease by 6 8 mm and evapotranspiration increase by 11 8 mm this result indicates that runoff and evapotranspiration may be more sensitive to air temperature increases in the future in addition to the increase in potential evaporation as the air temperature rises the increase in air temperature may indirectly affect some hydrological processes the runoff and evapotranspiration changes in the future based on the average elasticities indicate that decreased runoff and increased evapotranspiration in the future are mainly due to the temperature increase because the future precipitation change is not significant future climate change is associated with considerable uncertainties table 1 shows that the climate change trends obtained from different gcms are considerably different however there is a general consensus that warming will continue in the future consequently understanding the response of hydrological processes to the rising air temperature is very important based on the estimated air temperature elasticities of runoff evapotranspiration in the future we can directly estimate the runoff and evapotranspiration changes under different increased temperature scenarios table 6 shows the air temperature trends and their effects on runoff and evapotranspiration changes estimated using the average elasticities shown in table 5 under different emission scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in the future 50 years 2011 2060 in comparison with those in the past 1981 2010 the average rates of air temperature increases in the future are approximately 0 26 c 10a rcp 2 6 0 34 c 10a rcp 4 5 and 0 40 c 10a rcp8 5 in the hrb or the northeastern tibetan plateau su et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a according to the elasticities runoff would decrease at a rate of 6 mm 10a under rcp 2 6 scenario 8 mm 10a under rcp 4 5 scenario and 10 mm 10a under rcp 8 5 scenario and evapotranspiration would increase at a rate of 6 mm 10a under rcp 2 6 scenario 7 mm 10a under rcp 4 5 scenario and 8 mm 10a under rcp 8 5 scenario 4 5 impact of changes in the active layer depth of permafrost on hydrological processes table 7 gives the potential evaporation and active layer depth elasticities of runoff and evapotranspiration in the future 50 years 2011 2060 the results show that when potential evaporation increases by one unit 1 mm runoff will decrease by approximately 0 16 mm on average 0 03 0 28 mm based on different gcms and evapotranspiration will increase by approximately 0 3 mm on average 0 14 0 51 mm based on different gcms when the active layer depth of permafrost increases by one unit 1 cm runoff will decrease by approximately 1 3 mm on average 0 6 2 3 mm based on different gcms and evapotranspiration will increase by approximately 0 9 mm on average 0 1 1 7 mm based on different gcms table 8 shows the effects of changes in potential evaporation and the active layer depth on annual runoff and evapotranspiration in the future 50 years 2011 2060 which were estimated based on the average elasticities shown in table 7 the results show that both the potential evaporation change and the active layer depth change contribute to the runoff decrease and evapotranspiration increase and the contribution of the active layer depth change is notably higher than the contribution of the potential evaporation change especially for annual runoff in addition the aggregate effects of potential evaporation and active layer depth changes on runoff and evapotranspiration are given in table 8 for comparison with the air temperature influences shown in table 5 the results indicate that the two values are similar although the results from each individual gcm may have some bias because the average elasticities cannot perfectly represent the elasticities of each gcm thus the assumption that the impacts of air temperature change can be divided into the impact of the potential evaporation change and the impact of the active layer depth change is reasonable consequently we can conclude that the main influence of the air temperature change on runoff is associated with the change in the active depth of the frozen soil rather than the change in potential evaporation the rising temperature thickens the active layer depth of the frozen ground leading to an increase in the soil storage capacity and changing the mechanism of runoff production 5 discussion 5 1 impact of frozen ground degradation on runoff change in the upper hrb precipitation is mainly concentrated in the summer and the soil in summer is largely saturated the main runoff production mechanism in the upper hrb is excess saturation in addition precipitation increases significantly with elevation in the upper hrb wang et al 2017 therefore runoff is mainly generated at high latitudes and the permafrost region and transition region from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground contribute the most to runoff in the upper hrb gao et al 2016 according to the results in section 4 the effects of the degradation of frozen soil in these two regions on the runoff change are different in permafrost areas the thickening of the active layer increases the soil storage capacity fig 7 shows the change in simulated monthly basin averaged soil liquid water from 2011 to 2060 and the change in the annual soil liquid water equivalent the results show that the soil liquid water content significantly increases in the next 50 years and that the lower boundary of soil liquid water becomes deeper due to the impact of active layer changes on the soil water capacity the annual soil liquid water equivalent displays a significant increasing trend and the associated changes are highly correlated with the changes in the active layer depth of permafrost fig 5 with a correlation coefficient r2 equal to 0 98 this finding also indicates that the change in the active layer depth has a significant effect on soil moisture due to the main runoff production mode in the upper hrb is saturation excess runoff the increase in the soil storage capacity significantly impacts runoff decrease and evapotranspiration increase in the transition areas the change from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground increases groundwater infiltration leading to an increase in liquid soil moisture in the deep layers and a decrease in surface runoff notably frozen ground degradation causes an increase in the water storage capacity thereby changing the runoff mechanism cao et al 2012 analyzed the change in the soil storage capacity in the hrb from 2003 to 2008 based on grace data and observed an increasing trend which is consistent with our conclusion in previous studies climate change was often considered based on changes in precipitation and drought indexes namely potential evaporation divided by precipitation therefore the impacts of climate change on runoff change were divided between the impact of precipitation change and the impact of potential evaporation change e g the budyko based approach budyko 1974 yang and yang 2011 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b however in cold areas in addition to the effects of precipitation change and potential evaporation change the influence of frozen ground changes on runoff is also important even more important than the effects of precipitation and potential evaporation changes according to the results in section 4 5 consequently it is necessary to consider the effect of frozen ground change when analyzing the influences of climate change on runoff in future studies 5 2 differences in frozen ground changes in the past and future over the past 30 years 1981 2010 the increasing air temperature trend was approximately 0 33 c 10a based on the gbehm simulation result gao et al 2018 the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground decreased by approximately 4 1 cm 10a and the active layer depth increased by approximately 2 2 cm 10a over the past 30 years these results were validated based on the gauge observations from national meteorological stations wang et al 2013 wu and zhang 2010 peng et al 2017 the rate of increase in air temperature over the future 50 years approximately 0 34 c 10a estimated in this study in the upper hrb is close to the historical value however both the decrease in the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground and thickening of the active layer of permafrost are projected to accelerate in the future 5 4 cm 10a and 6 1 cm 10a respectively compared with the rates in the past this difference partially explains why the absolute values of the air temperature elasticities of annual runoff evapotranspiration in the future are much higher than those in the past as shown in table 5 thus the hydrological changes in the hrb are highly sensitive to the increase in air temperature due to the degradation of frozen ground 5 3 comparison with previous similar studies this study is a follow up to the series of studies of our research group in our previous studies we used an empirical model and a physical model to estimate the effects of climate change on frozen ground and the impacts of frozen ground degradation on hydrological processes respectively based on the empirical model the budyko framework we conducted an attribution analysis of the runoff changes in a frozen ground region in the context of climate change wang et al 2018 the research distinguished the effects of changes in precipitation potential evaporation frozen ground and land use on runoff changes and the conclusion that frozen ground change had a significant effect on the change in runoff was obtained however the study by wang et al 2018 did not quantitatively provide the air temperature elasticity of runoff and the frozen ground elasticity of runoff therefore the effects of air temperature change on runoff in the future could not be assessed based on the physical model gbhem gao et al 2018 simulated the changes in frozen ground and the changes in hydrological processes based on historical climate trends the study explained the physical mechanisms of the impact of warming on frozen ground and the impacts of frozen ground degradation on hydrological processes the current study is an extension of gao s research based on gbehm we simulated the changes in frozen ground and runoff under typical climate scenarios in the future based on the simulation results we estimated the air temperature elasticity of runoff and the frozen ground elasticity of runoff then according to the elasticities we quantitatively estimated the changes in frozen ground and runoff under different increased temperature scenarios in the future this study shows that the degradation of frozen ground in the upper hrb increases infiltration and soil water storage which subsequently increases evapotranspiration and reduces runoff the degradation of frozen ground leads to an increase in soil water storage which is consistent with the results of several previous studies including studies in arctic alaska mcnamara et al 1998 north america lyon and destouni 2010 austria rogger et al 2017 and the tibetan plateau region cuo et al 2015 gao et al 2018 however the conclusion that permafrost deterioration will lead to a reduction in runoff varies in different regions for example previous studies in the source regions of the yellow river jin et al 2009 and yangtze river qiu 2012 showed that the degradation of permafrost can lead to a decrease in runoff which was the cause of the thickening of the active layer of permafrost qiu 2012 these conclusions are consistent with the findings of this study studies by lyon et al 2009 in north america and rogger et al 2017 in austria suggested that the degradation of permafrost increases the melting of soil ice which leads to an increase in runoff this difference may be related to climatic differences the climate of the upper hrb is relatively dry and previous studies showed that there is little soil ice in the frozen soils of the region gao et al 2018 in recent years zhang et al 2016a and chen et al 2018 also analyzed the future cryospheric and hydrological changes in the upper hrb based on different hydrological models chen et al 2018 showed that the glaciers in the upper hrb could disappear in the future which is consistent with the findings of the present study both studies stated that future runoff would increase due to increased precipitation the two studies also noted that future precipitation is associated with considerable uncertainty compared with these previous studies the present study quantified the impact of the accelerated degradation of the frozen soils caused by the air temperature increase on future runoff and evapotranspiration this research shows that the effects of permafrost degradation on runoff are greater than the impacts of glacier melt and snow melt in the upper hrb all gcms projected increases in the future air temperature thus regardless of how precipitation changes in the future the degradation of permafrost caused by increased air temperatures is projected to significantly reduce runoff and potentially result in water resource shortages in the lower reaches of the study area 5 4 uncertainty and limitations the sources of uncertainty in this study include the climate models the downscaling and bias correction methods and the structure and parameters of the ecohydrological model wilby and harris 2006 because future climate simulations are uncertain the low spatial accuracy of the gcms leads to difficulty in reflecting the spatial variability of the climate in mountainous areas despite the application of downscaling and bias correction methods the high resolution spatial patterns of the climate factors such as precipitation and air temperature are difficult to perfectly represent uncertainties with respect to the choice of model parameterization in the ecohydrological simulation are another complicated source of error since the terrain conditions in mountainous areas are complex the inhomogeneity among factors such as surface albedo soil type soil depth land use type and vegetation cover may not be fully captured at the regional scale moreover soil water and heat parameters can affect ecohydrological simulations the above uncertainties lead to variations in the conclusions obtained based on different climate models to reduce the impacts of these uncertainties this study adopted an ensemble estimation based on multiple gcms future improvement of the gcms and the consideration of additional data could greatly reduce these uncertainties 6 conclusion based on 5 typical future climate scenarios under emission scenario rcp4 5 this study employed a distributed ecohydrological model gbehm to analyze the potential future climate change from 2011 to 2060 and the associated impacts on the cryospheric and hydrological processes in the upper hrb according to the simulation results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the air temperature is projected to rise by approximately 0 34 c 10a and precipitation is projected to slightly increase by approximately 6 mm 10a in the future under rcp 4 5 scenario by 2060 glaciers would comprise a volume of less than 100 million m3 the permafrost area would shrink by approximately 23 the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground would decrease by approximately 5 4 cm 10a and the active layer depth over the permafrost would increase by approximately 6 1 cm 10a 2 due to climate change runoff is projected to decrease by approximately 5 mm 10a and evapotranspiration is projected to increase by approximately 9 mm 10a the average increases in annual precipitation runoff and et over the future 50 years are estimated to be 498 mm 138 mm and 360 mm respectively this average runoff is only 80 of that in the 2000s the average runoff coefficient over the future 50 years is 0 28 and the decrease in the runoff coefficient is greatest in the elevation zone of 3600 3900 m where permafrost degrades and becomes seasonal frozen ground 3 over the future 50 years the changes in hydrological processes are mainly due to the increase in the air temperature with average changes of 24 mm c for runoff and 21 mm c for evapotranspiration the effects of air temperature changes on runoff and evapotranspiration are largely dominated by changes in frozen ground the first associated mechanism is the thickening of the active layer which increases the soil storage capacity and leads to a decrease in runoff and increase in evapotranspiration when the active layer depth increases by 1 cm runoff will decrease by approximately 1 3 mm and evapotranspiration will increase by approximately 0 9 mm the other mechanism involves changes from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground which increase groundwater infiltration and the volume of liquid soil moisture in the deep layers and decrease surface runoff 4 the frozen ground in the upper hrb is more sensitive to temperature increases in the future than those in the past this trend leads to a faster reduction in runoff in the future based on the same rate of temperature increase 5 the elasticities obtained in this study can be utilized to estimate the runoff changes in different climate scenarios based on these elasticities future runoff would decrease at rates of approximately 6 mm 10a 8 mm 10a and 10 mm 10a under the emission scenarios of rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively additionally and evapotranspiration would increase at rates of approximately 6 mm 10a 7 mm 10a and 8 mm 10a under these three emission scenarios in this study we did not consider vegetation changes in the future however the interactions among vegetation growth cryospheric processes and hydrological processes could be important therefore the effects of vegetation dynamics should be considered in future studies
