3530,in this study we calibrated and tested the soil conservation service curve number scs cn based modified sahu mishra eldo msme model for predicting storm event direct runoff qtot and its soil saturation coefficient α as a threshold antecedent moisture condition for partitioning into overland surface and shallow subsurface runoff components the model calibration was performed using 36 storm events from 2008 to 2015 on a 160 ha low gradient forested watershed ws80 on poorly drained soil the model was further validated without calibration using data from 2011 to 2015 on two sites 115 ha conifer and 210 ha eccles church and from 2008 to 2011 on a third site the 100 ha upper debidue creek udc all similar forested watersheds on the atlantic coastal plain usa the calibrated msme model was able to accurately predict the estimated qtot pred for the ws80 watershed with calculated nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse rmse standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias of 0 80 0 44 and 16 7 respectively by applying the same calibrated α value of 0 639 from the ws80 to two other similar poorly drained watersheds the msme model satisfactorily predicted the estimated qtot pred for both the eccles church nse 0 64 rsr 0 57 pbias 28 9 and conifer nse 0 60 rsr 0 58 pbias 21 3 watersheds respectively the msme model however yielded unsatisfactory results nse 0 13 rsr 2 06 pbias 616 3 on the udc watershed with coarse textured soils indicating the possible association of the α coefficient with soil subsurface texture based on the analysis of event rainfall and pre event water table elevation and linking them with the calibrated α coefficient that describes the proportion of saturated depth in a soil profile it was found that rainfall was the main determining factor for overland runoff generation these results demonstrate the msme model s potential to predict direct runoff in poorly drained forested watersheds which serve as a reference for urbanizing coastal landscapes in a changing climate keywords overland surface runoff shallow subsurface saturated runoff water table antecedent soil moisture poorly drained soils 1 introduction runoff and streamflow processes in topographically low gradient coastal watersheds are dominated by shallow subsurface drainage from saturated areas and saturation excess overland surface runoff that occurs when a shallow water table wt is present amatya et al 2019 epps et al 2013a slattery et al 2006 these low gradient watershed areas generally located along the atlantic and gulf coastal plain regions in the u s are rapidly being developed and urbanized baseline reference data on storm runoff characteristics of unimpaired watersheds are crucial for describing and assessing the hydrological impacts of developing areas and urbanization in these and other similar coastal watersheds a number of studies have attempted to describe such storm event characteristics using data for headwater coastal watersheds in the southeastern atlantic coastal plain amatya et al 2000 2019 blair et al 2014 bosch et al 2017 capece et al 1986 epps et al 2013a la torre torres et al 2011 sheridan et al 2002 swindel et al 1983 a region characterized by a low gradient forested landscape that is undergoing significant residential and commercial development o driscoll et al 2010 hitchcock et al 2014 lockaby et al 2013 at the same time multiple hydrologic models of varying complexities and scales have been used to estimate predict runoff response to storm events from catchments with various topographic and land cover conditions blair et al 2014 fedelman 2000 genereux 2003 hayes and young 2006 kannan et al 2007 rossman and huber 2016 usda 2004 for example the rational method kuichling 1889 the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method usda 2004 and hec hms hec 2006 menberu et al 2014 model serve as some examples among others there are several studies in the literature on the modification of the original scs cn method to assess direct runoff blair et al 2014 epps et al 2013a grimaldi et al 2013a 2013b kannan et al 2007 młyński et al 2020 verma et al 2020 however uncertainty remains due to a large range of estimates of runoff volume and peak flow response to storm events obtained from these models genereux 2003 joo et al 2014 walega et al 2020 only a limited number of such models have been tested on forest systems corbin et al 2022 tedela et al 2012 particularly on less studied small low gradient watersheds some of the recently modified versions of the scs cn models bartlett et al 2016 blair et al 2012 walega et al 2020 have shown improvement in predictions of storm response on relatively undisturbed headwater forested watersheds thus informing better stormwater management in such landscapes that are undergoing development for example stormflow on lower coastal plain lcp watersheds was shown to be driven by the wt depth and antecedent soil moisture asm stormflow increases substantially as shallow overland surface runoff soon after near surface saturation or surface ponding epps et al 2013a harder et al 2007 slattery et al 2006 epps et al 2013b showed that event runoff predictions do not compare closely to measured flow under the average moisture condition normally associated with the scs cn method usda 2004 warranting adjustments of the cn for wt based asm most of these studies applied the standard scs cn model but with a modified initial abstraction component to predict direct runoff for the shallow wt conditions in this region blair et al 2014 epps et al 2013b la torre torres 2008 blair et al 2012 developed and successfully tested the swarm model to predict runoff volume and peak discharge with limited data for some lcp watersheds of south carolina bartlett et al 2016 moved beyond the classic scs cn by accommodating different runoff concepts and distributions of heterogeneities in storage capacity and soil moisture as the basis for upscaling a point runoff response and linking ecohydrological processes to runoff modeling those authors showed proof of concept in four forested watersheds and argued that their resulting model may better represent geographic regions and site types that previously have been beyond the scope of the traditional scs cn method however all those watersheds were on upland sites where hillslope hydrology dominates runoff generation hewlett 1982 a recent previous version of the modified scs cn sme m which includes a single modified asm was found to perform better than the scs cn model but still relatively unsatisfactory in predicting total direct runoff and peak discharge on a low gradient coastal forest watershed walega et al 2020 most recently building on the sme m model walega et al 2020 the msme modified sahu mishra eldho model was developed which incorporates a soil saturation coefficient α for partitioning the total direct runoff into the overland surface and saturated subsurface runoff based on the asm with the wt as a proxy this is somewhat similar to the concept in bartlett et al 2016 to more accurately predict storm response to event outflow and peak discharge rates the model was successfully tested for predicting qtot pred in an artificially drained coastal forested watershed with open ditches 100 m apart walega and amatya 2020 results showed computed qtot pred was completely dominated by saturated subsurface runoff as drainage in the ditch driven by the gradient between the wt midway between the ditches and ditch water level with negligible overland surface runoff consistent with earlier studies amatya et al 1996 skaggs et al 2016 however to date the msme model has not been tested in naturally drained no ditch system forest watersheds where both forms of direct runoff are possible to occur amatya et al 2019 reported that on low gradient watersheds lateral subsurface flow and soil moisture storage vary widely with the balance of rainfall and evapotranspiration et with lateral flow likely occurring for only a short distance about 50 100 m as in the case of ditched systems without drainage or with a low drainage density in low gradient watersheds the shallow wt position during dry periods would be near the stream channel bottoms during a storm event only a small amount of rainwater is needed to cause a rapid rise in the wt resulting in a larger hydraulic gradient and thus causing subsurface flow towards the stream bonnel 1993 during wet periods wt rise results in near surface lateral subsurface flow which redistributes water to compensate for et and microtopographic variation younger 2006 such a process is described as subsurface stormflow common in humid climatic regions slattery et al 2006 as the wt approaches the surface in a broad inter stream area watershedwide overland surface runoff occurs depending upon the microtopography once the groundwater is recharged and the wt has risen to the surface precipitation to these areas will become runoff regardless of rainfall intensity and water travels quickly to the stream dingman 2002 conceptually different from the classical concepts developed by hewlett 1982 for upland hillslope hydrology in which subsurface stormflow is defined as interflow and surface stormflow as overland runoff the process of saturation excess runoff generation is common in humid low gradient systems with a shallow wt slattery et al 2006 younger 2006 the concept of direct runoff and its components saturated subsurface interpreted as streamside drainage and overland surface runoff interpreted as watershedwide runoff on low gradient forest systems primarily affected by soil moisture with the wt as a proxy were implemented in the msme model as an advancement in the scs cn method applicable to areas 300 ha typically with less spatial variability in the soil moisture deficit famiglietti et al 2008 as cited in bartlett et al 2016 in this study we applied the msme model on four first order catchments in naturally drained low gradient forests on the south carolina atlantic coastal plain to examine rainfall runoff processes as influenced by the antecedent moisture condition amc we used measured storm event data from 2008 to 2015 for the one watershed 160 ha data from 2011 to 2015 for two watersheds 110 ha and 210 ha and data from 2008 to 2011 for a fourth watershed 100 ha fig 1 the main objectives of this study were 1 to calibrate the msme model for the ws80 watershed and 2 to validate its performance by predicting observed storm event direct runoff qtot obs for the three remaining watersheds without any calibration the hypotheses tested were 1 the msme model using the published scs cn values and calibrated with storm event data for other parameters on the poorly drained ws80 watershed can accurately predict the observed storm event based total direct runoff qtot obs based on accepted statistical criteria 2 there exists a threshold for both the pre event initial water table elevation wte and precipitation amount identified using the calibrated soil saturation coefficient α above which event overland surface runoff is predicted in addition to predicted subsurface saturated runoff on this watershed 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description four first order watersheds were studied ws80 1 60 km2 eccles church 2 10 km2 conifer 1 15 km2 and upper debidue creek udc 1 00 km2 the hydrologic unit code huc for the first three watersheds is 0305020103 and the huc for udc is 0302040804 the eccles church and conifer watersheds are within the third order turkey creek tc watershed 52 4 km2 fig 1 in the usda forest service francis marion national forest fmnf located approximately 60 km northeast of charleston south carolina morrison 2016 the ws80 conifer and eccles church watersheds within the larger turkey creek tc watershed are rural forested lands that drain to turkey creek which discharges to huger creek a headwater catchment of the east branch of the cooper river that catchment ultimately drains into the charleston harbor harder et al 2007 james 2013 la torre torres et al 2011 separately the udc watershed located in coastal georgetown county south carolina is part of the freshwater portion of debidue creek in the north inlet estuary epps et al 2013a udc drains into an area with an existing suburban housing development and then into the north inlet tidal saltwater estuary all four watersheds are characterized by low gradient topography and shallow water table conditions long term 1946 2008 average annual minimum and maximum air temperatures were 3 2 and 30 6 c respectively and the annual rainfall ranged from 834 to 2106 mm on the usfs santee experimental forest sef site july and november were on average the wettest 187 mm mean rainfall and the driest 69 mm mean rainfall months respectively dai et al 2013 the ws80 watershed is on the north bank of turkey creek and is the control catchment of a paired system the watershed is comprised of about 70 mixed pine and hardwood stands and 48 forested wetland based on the u s national wetlands inventory classification nwi 2021 ws80 has poorly drained soils primarily of the wahee soil series fine mixed semiactive thermic aeric endoaquults which has a large field capacity and small permeability harder et al 2007 the eccles church watershed is located on the south bank of the tc watershed the dominant vegetation of the eccles church watershed is loblolly pine pinus taeda followed by longleaf pine pinus palustris table 1 the dominant land use is thinned forest basal area 25 m2 ha 1 followed by dense forest basal area 25 m2 ha 1 and the dominant soil series are lynchburg 48 6 and goldsboro 14 morrison 2016 the conifer watershed is located on the right north bank of the tc watershed loblolly pine is the dominant land cover followed by the longleaf pine land use is dense forest and the primary soil series is wahee lenoir 79 other watershed characteristics are presented in table 1 with more details in morrison 2016 the udc watershed is characterized by low gradient topography and shallow water table conditions epps et al 2013a the landscape is currently forested with mixed hardwood lowlands and upland pine stands based on the national land cover database nlcd 2016 the watershed is comprised of 83 vegetated wetland much higher than the other three watersheds in this study the primary soil series in the udc watershed are lynn haven and leon these soils are formed in sandy marine sediments and are associated with very low gradient conditions high permeability and are poorly to very poorly drained usda 1980 2 2 data collection rainfall data for the eccles church and conifer watersheds were collected at a weather station approximately 3 km east of the study sites fig 1 an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge with an adjacent manual gauge was used rainfall for both ws80 and udc watersheds were also collected using an automatic tipping bucket backed up by a manual gauge fig 1 additional rain gauges approximately 6 km west at the turkey creek outlet usgs gauge and at the sef were used to fill data gaps on ws80 eccles and conifer watersheds flow rates were estimated by the standard culvert area velocity method using stage and corresponding velocity data collected at 15 min intervals using an automated isco 4150 flow meter teledyne inc thousand oaks ca usa installed inside and at the downstream end of round concrete culverts that were 914 mm and 762 mm in diameter for the eccles church and conifer watersheds respectively flow rates for 15 min intervals were integrated to compute stream discharge volumetric flow and to estimate event based total streamflow i e outflow morrison 2016 digital measurements of stage recorded every 10 minutes by a teledyne isco flowmeter installed upstream of the ws80 watershed weir outlet gauging stations were used with established rating curves for compound v notch weir for estimating streamflow rates amatya and trettin 2019 2021 watershed outflow rate in the udc was estimated using a 0 6 m modified parshall flume located immediately downstream of a road culvert epps et al 2013a hitchcock et al 2009 shallow groundwater data i e depth to water table from ground surface were measured on an hourly basis using a global water wl 16 pressure transducer xylem inc rye brook ny usa with a datalogger on an upland well on ws80 amatya and trettin 2021 and in the wells on lynchburg and wahee soils near the eccles church and conifer watersheds respectively amatya et al 2018 morrison 2016 a water table well with a pressure transducer solinist logger georgetown ontario canada was located in an upland pine area near the udc watershed boundary epps et al 2013a additional details of hydro meteorological measurements may be found elsewhere amatya and trettin 2021 epps et al 2013a morrison 2016 2 3 hydrograph separation separation of storm event hydrographs into direct runoff and baseflow values for all watersheds were conducted primarily following techniques used by williams 2007 as cited in epps et al 2013a in which a log linear regression line was fit for the exponential receding limb of the hydrographs for the udc and ws80 however a linear regression with the same separation technique was used by morrison 2016 for eccles and conifer watersheds storm events were selected using rainfall and streamflow data during 2008 2015 for ws80 2008 2011 for udc and 2011 2015 period for the eccles church and conifer watersheds individual storm events were selected for each of the watersheds and flow rate data were plotted against the corresponding rainfall that may have triggered the event two screening criteria were selected to identify storm events 1 events with a single peak hydrograph and 2 event rainfall of at least 12 mm and minimum of six hours between rainfall events amatya et al 2000 epps et al 2013a la torres et al 2011 although all events exceeded 20 mm size except for two events on the eccles church watershed events with a small double peak were also analyzed for comparison storm event outflow characteristics evaluated included total stream outflow mm and direct runoff qtot obs which was calculated as a difference between total outflow and baseflow obtained using hydrograph separation epps et al 2013a morrison 2016 total 5 day rainfall p5 amount before the start of each event was also tabulated as proxies for the asm out of the 36 events analyzed for the ws80 watershed 20 events occurred during the winter and spring seasons november to april with smaller et demand and 16 events were during the summer and fall seasons may to october with larger et the wt data from the wells in wahee soil on the ws80 watershed amatya and trettin 2021 in the dominant wahee lenoir soil on conifer in the lynchburg soil for eccles church morrison 2016 and leon soils on the udc epps et al 2013a watersheds were used in the analysis all of these wells installed in different soil series with varying soil drainage and infiltration response also provided information on water table position as a surrogate for asm conditions for the area amatya and trettin 2010 amatya et al 2018 callahan et al 2012 epps et al 2013a williams and amatya 2016 zhai et al 2020 2 4 scs cn model and modified sahu mishra eldho msme model direct runoff qtot pred for all events on all four watersheds was predicted using the msme model the model was also used to simulate both the subsurface saturated streamside qsubs pred and shallow watershedwide surface overland runoff qsurf pred components of the direct runoff qtot pred saturated groundwater flow in the form of baseflow to receiving waters is not considered in the msme model the model functions somewhat similar to ab components of the abcd conceptual model formulated for upper and lower zone soil moisture as cited in martinez and gupta 2011 to predict only 1 c as direct runoff and not d for the baseflow 2 4 1 theoretical background of the runoff formation in the msme model in the msme model it is assumed that in the initial phase of rainfall when the soil has antecedent moisture m after p5 direct runoff does not occur fig 2 a the m is determined by infiltrated water from p5 after exceeding the interception depression storage and potential evapotranspiration pet losses past studies blair et al 2014 baltas 2007 hawkins et al 2002 mishra and singh 2002 soulis and valiantzas 2012 woodward et al 2003 have reported that the initial abstraction ia was overestimated when calculated using the original method in this model we used the m parameter to reduce ia compared to the original method appendix a which seems to be more relevant on low gradient watersheds with high water table elevation during a storm event when the sum of precipitation p exceeds the first soil saturation threshold ia1 subsurface stormflow begins fig 2b if the rainfall p continues during the event the soil profile will continue to be saturated achieving the second threshold ia 2 resulting in the occurrence of overland surface runoff fig 2c the ia1 and ia2 parameters are determined not only by m and but also by the saturated area of the watershed at the beginning of rainfall only a small part of the watershed mainly located close to the stream can be saturated because the land surface wte is relatively deeper to be hydraulically connected with the stream water level during longer duration storms the saturated area tends to increase widely across many more parts of the watershed potentially generating saturated surface stormflow the factor determining the proportion of saturated areas in the whole watershed is the soil saturation parameter α we hypothesized that the soil profile in the watershed is completely saturated when α 1 0 if the soil profile is only partially saturated α 1 0 storm subsurface runoff may occur only from the part of the watershed located closest to the water course this α coefficient in the msme represents the saturation in the soil column similar to the b as water holding capacity of upper soil zone conceptualized in the abcd model cited in martinez and gupta 2011 where direct runoff 1 c depends upon the soil available moisture after subtracting recharge c for baseflow interestingly the a parameter in the abcd model represents the runoff propensity index similar to the threshold for generating the qsurf as will be discussed below the key difference is that the msme model further attempts to partition direct runoff 1 c into qsubs pred and qsurf pred which were calculated by introducing different soil moisture conditions expressed by sa sb and two thresholds of initial abstractions ia1 and ia2 both the initial abstractions are linked with the α coefficient in addition the ia which relies on interception surface storage and infiltration is also adjusted by the soil moisture m as an index parameter in the model with increased m primarily reducing initial abstraction ia the coefficient α obtained by calibration for the proportion of saturated soil in the profile plays a significant role in identifying a threshold of wte while transitioning from qsubs pred to qsurf pred this is similar to bartlett et al 2016 who used antecedent soil moisture deficit c in their model like the α coefficient in the msme model in both cases these coefficients represent soil moisture conditions before rainfall events however the msme model is a lumped model with parameters describing antecedent moisture representative of the soil profile in a small homogenous area where the scs cn is applicable in contrast with the bartlett et al 2016 who modified the scs cn method allowing to capture runoff from small rainfall events that do not activate large areas of threshold excess runoff and thus better represent various geographic regions and site types the later model using probabilistic distributions to consider heterogeneities in rainfall and soil water storage distribution was shown to perform better than the scs cn model on upland watersheds the potential water retention parameters sa and sb were calculated based on the same approach as in the original scs cn method where cn is a critical parameter the cn value was obtained from the published nrcs tables usda 2004 using the land cover conditions and soil hydrologic group for each area covered by a soil type within a watershed then an area weighted average cn for amcii was calculated and presented in table 1 for each of the watersheds haley 2007 epps et al 2013b in the msme model for this study the weighted cn in table 1 was further modified for different antecedent moisture conditions for each of the storm events producing different weighted cns with their calculated statistics shown in table 2 each of the cn values in tables 2 5 6 and 7 used in the msme model for the four watersheds was obtained as a storm event average of the weighted cn ii table 1 modified for antecedent moisture conditions amc dry amci wet amciii and average amc ii for each of the storm events the observed rainfall runoff data were plotted against calculated runoff for each rainfall based on the scs cn method where cn was assumed for amci amcii and amciii an example of this is presented in fig b1 for watershed ws80 next each observed runoff was compared to theoretical line of direct runoff for each of the three amc values and the final cn value in the msme model was based on distance between observed point and nearest theoretical line for the given amc this procedure is similar to described by walker et al 2001 the coefficient α and λ and β parameters were optimized using the maximum nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 as an objective function in the solver tool of microsoft excel version 2010 additionally computed qsurf pred and qsubs pred runoff components of qtot pred from the msme model were compared to the measured pre event initial wte as the amc on the ws80 watershed with dominant wahee soil series fig 1 for identifying detecting a wte threshold when the model predicted qsurf pred to test the 2nd hypothesis that there is a threshold water table elevation and precipitation amount above which overland surface runoff would occur the nse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 were used as goodness of fit measures to assess the performance of the models in predicting direct outflow using the ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 criteria for the nse with satisfactory performance for nse 0 65 good performance for nse 0 80 and very good performance for nse 0 90 we also conducted an uncertainty analysis of simulated event qtot pred predicted by the msme model on the ws80 watershed based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method the procedure is based on running monte carlo mc model simulations with different parameter sets the parameter sets were sampled from proposed prior distributions and the simulated outputs and parameter posterior distributions were inferred to identify the closest fit to the observations obtained from parameter sets defined as behavioral blasone et al 2008 a priori uniform distribution of the α model coefficient was assumed based on the observed events for generating random values for the mc simulation run again the nse statistic was chosen for the likelihood function to provide a quantitative evaluation of the difference among the results the following uncertainties were calculated average relative interval length aril proposed by jin et al 2010 1 aril 1 n i 1 n limit u t limit l t q t o t o b s t average asymmetry degree aad

obs t is the total observed runoff and n is the number of time steps additionally the percentages of observations that are contained in the calculated 95 confidence intervals jin et al 2010 were also calculated as 4 p 95 c i nq i n 100 where n is the number of events and nqi is the number of observations that are contained in the calculated confidence intervals finally we applied the msme model without any calibration to predict the qtot pred on eccles church and conifer watersheds with 12 and 6 storm events respectively and in sandy udc watershed with 23 events for the model validation we also assumed the same value of α coefficient calibrated for the ws80 watershed for predicting qtot pred on all the three watersheds as a part of the same hypothesis to demonstrate that the msme model can generate the qtot pred and its surface and subsurface components from varying coastal forest watersheds 3 results and discussion 3 1 storm event hydrograph characteristics data in table 2 shows the values and statistics of measured rainfall runoff storm event parameters used in the msme model for the 2008 2015 period for the ws80 watershed the average and maximum event precipitation p for the period amounted to 73 1 mm and 157 7 mm respectively the observed direct runoff qtot obs response to rainfall events varied from zero to 88 mm with an average of 13 2 mm table 2 the 5 day prior rainfall p5 showed some variability cov table 2 the large values of kurtosis and skewness and the difference between the mean and the median show an asymmetric distribution of most of the p and qtot obs parameters to the right table 2 the value of kurtosis suggests most of p and qtot obs values were grouped about the mean value while the skewness shows that more events have rainfall and runoff less than their respective mean value 3 2 msme modeling of surface and subsurface runoff in ws80 watershed the msme model predicted mean total runoff qtot pred value across 36 storms for the 2008 2015 period was 11 0 mm close to the observed value of 13 2 mm with no significant difference t test 0 787 p 0 436 α 0 05 table 2 the analysis was based on the weighted cn taken from the published nrcs table usda 1986 but modified with the amc with a mean of 66 7 57 0 88 0 which was almost the same as the value of 68 reported earlier by epps et al 2013b after adjustment of the antecedent soil moisture asm defined by wt for selected storm events on the ws80 watershed table 1 mean asm expressed by the m parameter eq a 4 was equal to m 3 6 mm with a range of 0 0 41 5 and represents soil moisture index for very thin soil layer added by p5 rainfall table 2 the lower initial soil moisture on the ws80 watershed was supported by the lower mean initial wte fig 3 it is evident from the asymptotic nature of the plots in fig 3a and 3b that the wte attains its highest value at nearly 9 m and remains stable but at a single well location on the watershed for m 1 0 mm this result tends to indicate that there may possibly be a watershed wide threshold value of the shallow wte within an uncertainty range due to varying microtopography amoah et al 2013 when soils attain high antecedent moisture with saturation hypothesis 2 this relationship is also consistent with amatya et al 2020 who reported all high water table soils generally respond similarly to extreme precipitation events as a next step we examined the influence of p5 antecedent rainfall on wte in fig 3a apparently for a small increase in values of p5 wte increases rapidly attaining a maximum wte after p5 reaches a threshold of 3 0 mm the wte has lesser variability for any m values higher than the threshold value fig 3b therefore more water added to an already saturated soil cannot infiltrate further into the soil and causes ponding and generating higher overland surface runoff than the subsurface computed results showed that the average qsubs pred was larger than the average qsurf pred on the ws80 watershed table 2 consistent with amatya et al 1996 study who reported that it is rare in low gradient watersheds for qsurf to occur but may occur for example after large two year recurrence storm events exceeding 100 mm of rainfall in 24 hrs amatya et al 1998 relationships between rainfall and computed runoff for all events on the ws80 watershed are presented in fig 4 initial wtes were also plotted for the corresponding events for ws80 in fig 4a which shows despite the wte achieved threshold of 9 00 m or somewhat higher only qsubs pred was observed left side of the vertical line in fig 4a on the other hand the qsurf pred runoff was generated by the msme model only when p threshold of 113 mm was achieved accordingly we can conclude that it is the rainfall together with amc not wte alone is a crucial factor determining generation of overland flow in this flat coastal watershed accordingly when the high wte near 9 0 m was linked with corresponding high event rainfall the model generated highest qtot pred when the p was below detected threshold only qsubs pred was predicted on the watershed the p threshold on the ws80 watershed was equal to 113 mm supporting our 2nd hypothesis however there was no data on individual q components to verify although this qualitatively supports the harder et al 2007 study who reported that when the wt positions at their single study well were at 0 1 m depth at the onset of the storm event the saturated conditions should cause a large fraction of the rainfall to leave the system as surface and shallow subsurface runoff a similar concept of pre threshold runoff as subsurface and threshold excess runoff in the scs cn method was proposed by bartlett et al 2016 for simulating runoff generation in hillslope hydrology dominated forest watersheds however additional field studies are needed to verify the generation of separate qsub and qsurf components for the runoff events as only the total direct runoff q was measured at the site parameters of the calibrated msme model and computed measures of goodness of fit for model performance compared to the observed data are given in table 3 for ws80 watershed and additionally for three other validated watersheds eccles church conifer and the udc the coefficient α obtained from the calibration was found to be equal to 0 639 for the ws80 watershed the value of β 0 703 indicated that the asm index m at the beginning of the rain event was not only likely caused by infiltrating rainfall as defined by p5 but also by the wte as a surrogate of soil moisture because a portion of p5 would have been lost by et amatya et al 2020 the model performance statistics of rsr and nse calculated as 0 44 and 0 80 respectively were classified as good for nse according to ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 criteria these results are also better than those from the previous versions of the model sme m and others on the ws80 watershed for example walega et al 2020 obtained an nse of 0 72 using the sme m model and 0 73 for the original scs cn model using the cn based on usda 2004 on this watershed however walega et al 2017 had reported slightly better performance of the mishra sahu ms model compared to the sahu 1 and 3 parameter models on this watershed the positive value of pbias suggests the average tendency of the simulated data to slightly underestimate total direct runoff to their observed counterparts comparing the predicted event total runoff qtot pred to the observed data fig 4b shows a good agreement for the ws80 watershed supporting the 1st hypothesis however predicted qtot pred values are slightly lower than those observed in the case of larger runoff events this may be likely due to slightly lower weighted cn value 66 7 obtained from the usda 2004 to include in the msme model table 2 compared to the cn of 68 obtained after adjusting for the amc defined by the wt at the site as reported in epps et al 2013b study 3 3 uncertainty of the msme model the uncertainty of the msme model predictions was analyzed for the storm events on the ws80 watershed to detect the potential influence of the α coefficient on prediction errors of simulations a selection criterion for the α coefficient was the threshold value of the likelihood function with the nse value exceeding 0 65 which as previously mentioned was deemed satisfactory the simulations in which the nse values were below 0 65 were excluded from further analysis to provide a broad quantitative evaluation of the uncertainty analysis simulations results from aril aad and ada statistical criteria were calculated table 4 the calculated value of aril 0 496 is in a somewhat similar range reported in other literature 0 09 to 1 30 for monthly nitrate load and storm hydrograph predictions appling et al 2015 walega and książek 2016 indicating relatively lower uncertainties in the model predictions an aad value lower than 0 50 indicates that on average the observed runoff was within the prediction uncertainty bands whereas the higher the aad value the more asymmetrical the uncertainty bands were around the observed water levels xiong et al 2009 walega and książek 2016 our calculations showed the aad value of 0 797 table 4 was slightly higher than 0 50 but substantially lower than 1 32 obtained by walega and książek 2016 suggesting that the average observed runoff is likely higher than the upper uncertainty band p 95 ci statistics used to quantify the random and systematic errors in simulations indicate that the p 95 ci values 50 stand for more random errors whereas the p 95 ci values 50 suggest systematic errors as sources of uncertainties in simulations as shown in table 3 our calculated p 95 ci value of 44 44 is slightly lower than 50 indicating a slight potential for systematic errors in the msme modeling results the plot in fig 2b shows the model s tendency to slightly underpredict the events particularly those with deeper wtes however this systematic average error of 15 overprediction of runoff with a range of 8 7 to 20 2 was deemed acceptable considering other potential errors in the estimated cn parameter as well as in the measured data also this was likely due to predicted narrow bands of uncertainty caused by narrow variability of the accepted α coefficient assuming a uniform wahee soil throughout the watershed which has some heterogeneities fig 1 this means the model may have insufficiently captured changes of asm across the watershed however this potential wte threshold from localized well data on the wahee soil may not be quite representative of the whole watershed with some additional soil types consistent with bartlett et al 2016 for addressing heterogeneities for large areas 3 4 validation of msme model on two other watersheds with relatively poorly drained low permeability soils observed data and computed statistics of rainfall runoff parameters for the msme model for the eccles church and conifer watersheds for the 2011 2015 period are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively the average event p of 61 0 mm for eccles church is slightly lower than the 65 9 mm for the conifer watershed and much lower than for ws80 table 2 but similar maximum values were observed for the eccles church and conifer sites the 5 day prior p5 is lesser on eccles church and conifer watersheds compared to the ws80 watershed the observed average outflows qtot obs were 22 1 mm 32 0 mm and 13 2 mm for the eccles church conifer and ws80 watersheds respectively mean cn values obtained from the usda 1986 and modified for the amcs for the eccles church and conifer watersheds were found to be 77 5 and 83 respectively with a range of 60 90 for both tables 5 and 6 cn was higher on the conifer watershed than the eccles church watershed as expected due to relatively well drained soils on eccles church with a potential for a larger initial abstraction relative to the conifer watershed the m index for the validated watersheds eccles church on sandy soils and the conifer on loamy clay soils were smaller than on ws80 watershed tables 2 5 6 with a large field capacity and low permeability soils in addition to the largest wetland area harder et al 2007 table 1 relationships between rainfall and computed runoff for all events on eccles church and conifer watersheds are presented in fig 5 the influence of rainfall p on the runoff qtot obs is evident the analysis showed a lack of overland surface runoff on both the eccles and conifer watersheds including for larger rainfall events we assumed the wte threshold at saturation for the eccles church on lynchburg soils and conifer on wahee soil similar to that on ws80 because both the wahee and lynchburg soils are classified as somewhat poorly drained located in the same low gradient topographical and geological conditions also both soils are similar texture wise as fine sandy loam and fine loamy sand and have three out of five similar terms in taxonomy semi active thermic aeric williams and amatya 2016 in addition when the soils are saturated with wte near or at the surface both soils respond similarly during high rainfall events amatya et al 2020 comparisons of the predicted event total runoff qtot pred to the observed data for the eccles church and conifer watersheds plotted in fig 6 a and 6b respectively show a relatively poorer agreement for both the watersheds compared to ws80 fig 4b with slightly lower predicted q values than the observed although the computed statistics showed a satisfactory performance table 3 positive values of pbias in both watersheds suggest that the msme model tends to underestimate mean direct runoff as much as 29 compared to the observed the fact that the model performance of simulating qtot pred was satisfactory based on evaluation statistics table 3 fig 6 suggests that the msme model using the published ncrs cn values and calibrated with parameters from a watershed with long term data can be used for simulating event rainfall runoff in ungauged watersheds with similar conditions 3 5 validation of the msme model on a watershed with high permeability soils the predicted values and statistics of rainfall runoff parameters for the msme model for the 2008 2011 period for the udc watershed are shown in table 7 together with observed rainfall and runoff data the average event p of 41 7 mm was much less than that for previously described watersheds despite the slightly higher 5 day prior rainfall than for the eccles church and conifer watersheds but less compared to the ws80 watershed the smallest observed average qtot obs of 3 7 mm on udc the smallest value for all the four watersheds was likely due to the larger permeability of the sandy soils of lynn haven and leon series epps et al 2013a the calculated cn mean for the udc watersheds was 69 1 with a range of 57 0 88 0 which was substantially lower than the cn values for the conifer and eccles church watersheds tables 5 and 6 but slightly higher than the values reported by epps et al 2013b however the asm index m values for this validated watershed were similar to that of the ws80 watershed tables 2 and 7 the relationship between p and computed qtot pred and its components for all storm events on the udc watershed are presented in fig 7 a the plot and the analysis showed that the msme model using the α coefficient as on the ws80 did not yield surface overland runoff in any of the storm events but only the shallow subsurface saturated runoff on this watershed with highly permeable soil this result is consistent with slattery et al 2006 who showed that the subsurface flow is dominant where there are deep permeable soils the plot in fig 7a also shows an increase in qsubs pred values with an increase in wtes consistent with other studies harder et al 2007 as a result total runoff from the udc watershed was simulated as shallow subsurface saturated runoff only the msme model for this watershed performed poorer nse 0 13 than for the other watersheds table 2 with an unsatisfactory performance using the ritter and carpena 2013 criterion the poor quality of the model is also evident from the calculated rsr and pbias measures high pbias suggests that total direct runoff predicted by the msme model is substantially underestimated compared to observed events the poor results of runoff achieved from the msme model in the udc watershed can be attributed to the underestimation of the antecedent soil moisture m for high permeability soil the initial abstractions ia1 and ia2 were too large and thus losses of rainfall p caused the predicted runoff from the msme model to be significantly smaller than the observed thus we conclude that the msme model without any calibration is not able to reasonably predict total direct runoff formation from storm events on this watershed with higher soil permeability fig 7b 3 6 interpretations of runoff response for storm event modeling and future works 3 6 1 water table threshold on partitioning subsurface saturated and surface overland runoff in this study we found the model predicted shallow subsurface saturated flow as streamside runoff for all storm events on all four watersheds only on ws80 when a threshold of 113 mm precipitation was exceeded the model predicted surface overland watershedwide runoff the results on the ws80 are consistent with other forested catchments juez et al 2021 wilcox et al 2011 for example juez et al 2021 studied hydrological dynamics in forested catchments in san salvador central spanish pyrenees and detected a rainfall threshold of 105 8 mm above which high magnitude low frequency events were observed with the rainfall runoff slope considerably stronger than the observed under the threshold the same authors also concluded that the catchment response is related to the height of the water table which in turn was related to antecedent rainfall conditions similar to our results the msme model assumes that watershedwide surface overland runoff is initiated when the watershed is completely saturated in a situation when p5 corresponds to the maximum potential retention this study did not find a threshold relationship for wte above which surface overland runoff would likely be generated by the msme model the model yielded only subsurface saturated runoff even for the wte of 9 0 m or above fig 4a at a single well location on ws80 on the other hand a wte of approximately 9 0 m in a well on ws80 suggests that there may possibly be a threshold wte value when soils attain high antecedent moisture with saturation across the watershed fig 3 thus producing increased total runoff this hypothesis for ws80 is supported by wte versus observed total runoff q plot in fig 8 a but did not hold true for the well on the udc watershed fig 8b detection of a relationship between wte and runoff could dictate the rainfall response on these watersheds between dry and wet asm as mentioned early wte can influence on soil moisture and thus on possible runoff generation as shown in fig b2 wte elevation is linked with ia1 representing initial abstraction for subsurface saturated runoff initially when wte is close to the surface ia1 has lower value but after rain events the value exceeds ia1 resulting in formation of subsurface runoff for deeper wte ia1 is also decreased potentially with also the decreased chance of the subsurface runoff occurrence moreover according to equation a 2 the ia1 is determined by antecedent soil moisture m for example if m increases yielding higher moisture ia1 decreases and thus also the storage decreases this behavior consequently pronounces the subsurface runoff generation process in this case both the wte and ia2 do not yield similar behavior confirming that occurrence of surface overland runoff is more determined by rainfall depth than the wte for example in their study on this watershed epps et al 2013a showed that only very moderate amounts of runoff could be expected for rain events that occur when the wte is below a threshold as dry asm on the other hand substantial watershed wide runoff generation might be expected under high wte across the watershed exceeding a representative of threshold consistent with harder et al 2007 who found exponentially increasing runoff when the water table was ponded 40 mm at a given well location on the ws80 watershed all three studies found a threshold rainfall to runoff response when the wte at the ws80 observation well reached near 9 m which was close to the soil surface at that location however we expect some variation in this single well based threshold on a watershed scale basis for this watershed with a mean depressional storage of 93 mm 87 99 mm amoah et al 2013 the udc watershed demonstrates how wte is a site specific varible udc has an elevation range of 1 8 6 5 m table 2 indicating a wte of 9 m is impossible at this site the relationship for the observations at udc fig 8b indicates 7 out of 17 events with wte ranging from 2 3 to 3 3 m result in no runoff and higher rates of runoff are associated with wte over 3 4 m the sandy subsoils of udc have much less moisture holding capacity and unsaturated storage is quite small in this case threshold behavior occurs over a broader range of wte from 3 4 to 3 8 m epps et al 2013a and half of the observed storm with runoff were above the 3 4 m value of wte 3 6 2 soil saturation coefficient α the coefficient α in the msme model can be interpreted as the partial area contribution of saturated soil that coefficient plays an important role in predicting the switching from qsubs pred to qsurf pred runoff in this way the msme model may be mimicking saturation excess overland flow dunne and black 1970 the relationship of α to both a threshold rainfall amount and a specific wte on ws80 suggests the calibrated coefficients of the lumped msme may relate to a spatially distributed saturation excess overland flow generation process dunne et al 1975 the role of soil saturation water table depth or elevation in runoff threshold behavior has been recognized in coastal forested watersheds for decades epps et al 2013a eshleman et al 1994 harder et al 2007 williams 1979 williams 2007 yet those studies like this one used a single well elevation as an index to infer the spatially distributed water table siebert et al 2011 determined that a major source of runoff generation in swedish peat dominated low gradient forested watersheds was the high conductivity of the surface forest floor and upper peat layers mcdonnell et al 1991 also found high horizontal conductivity in the forest floor on steep forested watersheds in new zealand they discounted the mechanism as a source of runoff in those watersheds as rapid flow could only be measured over a distance of a few tens of meters bishop et al 1990 found that the flow in the swedish streams could be accounted for by this shallow flow in a region within 30 m of the stream skaggs et al 2016 found similar apparent high surface hydraulic conductivity in north carolina but a tenfold decrease after bedding destroyed the forest floor walega and amatya 2020 used data from an undisturbed but artificially drained forested watershed in coastal north carolina in the development of the msme model that model indicated that the shallow subsurface mechanism occurred within 50 m of the stream can the results of the msme model be used to create a hypothesis of how a shallow subsurface flow mechanism may be active on undrained coastal forested watersheds the eccles church watershed can be used to visualize the above hypothesis fig 9 eccles church is located on a pleistocene aged floodplain colquhoun 1974 where soils have developed on the former floodplain surface the stream has developed in an old meander scar while other poorly drained soils are found in micro topographic lows based on an overlay of soils with a lidar based digital elevation model dem of the area amatya et al 2015 using the msme model results for this watershed table 5 we can visualize a condition similar to fig 9a after 25 9 mm of rain during median conditions with that rainfall rapid subsurface flow occurs only on the most poorly drained portions of the watershed and drains to the closest topographic low and limited area near the stream contributes to stream flow the model also suggests that the condition of fig 9a may occur after only 7 6 mm of rainfall during wet conditions or as much as 69 1 mm during dry conditions similarly the model predicts conditions of fig 9b will occur after 146 7 mm of rain in median conditions in this case the rapid shallow subsurface flow will be extensive on all but the well drained soils and the topographic lows will connect to the stream forming a continuous saturated zone across much of the watershed as shown earlier in fig 2 one could visualize the model component ia1 to represent the rainfall needed to trigger rapid subsurface flow and ia2 to be the additional rainfall needed before all the topographic lows are connected to the outlet the model results suggest the initiation of this watershedwide runoff may occur after as little as 55 mm during wet conditions or only after 366 mm during very dry periods these findings suggest the need for attention to varying parameters and initial conditions when modeling storm runoff in wetland rich low gradient watersheds in the southeastern u s for example initial wte and soil moisture if available should be investigated on soil texture and drainage class basis as the parameters calibrated on the ws80 were validated satisfactorily on two other watersheds with clay and clay loam subsoil but performed rather poorly for a watershed with sandy subsoil and very low relief in the same region accounting for these initial conditions is one of the key advantages of applying the cn based models including the msme model also with watershedwide overland surface and streamside shallow subsurface saturated runoff partitioning methods used in this study over the widely used original scs cn method however the uncertainty analysis of simulated direct runoff due to the α coefficient in the msme model showed systematic errors with some overpredictions of observed runoff events the values of α were less variable due to the small variability in wte above the 9 00 m soil saturation resulting in overland surface runoff based on a single well data on the dominant soil of the ws80 watershed these results demonstrate the need for model validation with multiple soil types and topography even in the low gradient system to reduce prediction uncertainties for the general application of the model in similar other regions we recognize this is a more intensive field approach yet it yielded more detailed independent data for components of stormflow itself besides the purpose of stormflow baseflow separation of streamflow this is important for calibrating runoff models applied in the design of stormwater management practices in these coastal landscapes facing urbanization and climate change effects including extreme rainfall events amatya et al 2021 corbin et al 2022 future research may also consider the msme model integrated with empirical rainfall runoff models like soil conservation service unit hydrograph scs uh and or eba4sub model petroselli 2020 to include surface and subsurface runoff in design hydrograph generation and test the approach in multiple watersheds with varying slopes and land cover another recommended aspect of future studies is to focus on the α parameter and its linkage with a parameter describing groundwater and or soil moisture as was described by camporese et al 2019 who used topographic wetness indices twi to determine the value of the α parameter similar linkage including those derived using recent ultra high resolution remote sensing based soil moisture images ma et al 2020 is also a possibility with the msme model to reliably predict direct surface runoff in an ungauged forest and rural watersheds 4 summary and conclusions storm event direct runoff qtot pred was evaluated on three small forested watersheds 115 160 and 210 ha at the usda forest service francis marion national forest and a fourth watershed 100 ha near georgetown and north inlet winyah bay all in the rapidly urbanizing lower coastal plain of south carolina usa the watersheds had different dominant soil types with varying drainage classes but similar forest management practices we analyzed and satisfactorily calibrated the interrelationships of the qtot obs and event rainfall predicted using the modified mishra sahu eldo msme model mechanisms for the 160 ha watershed this was performed in conjunction with published nrcs cn values and other event parameters including antecedent moisture conditions defined by rainfall and water table elevation using data collected from multiple storm events that occurred between 2008 and 2015 also we found that water table elevation can be linked with α parameter in the msme model which can be interpreted as a soil saturation coefficient obtained by calibration for approximating the proportion of watershed area with saturated soil profile to partition watershedwide overland surface qsurf pred and subsurface saturated qsubs pred runoff the uncertainty analysis showed that systematic error due to this parameter can be a significant source of q prediction uncertainty model validation using the same α parameter and event data for the 2008 2011 period on the 100 ha watershed and the 2011 2015 period on two other watersheds 110 ha and 210 ha showed satisfactory performance of the msme model in predicting direct runoff only on the two poorly drained watersheds but not on the 100 ha watershed with higher soil permeability our results showed that qsurf pred is triggered only after rainfall reaches threshold values of 113 mm on ws80 but not on eccles and conifer watersheds with limited event data compared to ws80 results of this study suggest that the msme model can be used for adequately estimating total direct runoff on poorly drained coastal sites with similar characteristics as the study sites in addition the model has the potential to be used in partitioning the direct runoff and estimating peak discharge estimates for the design of road drainage and stormwater management practices in the face of changing land use and climate in coastal watersheds with low gradient topography and shallow water table soils credit

3530,in this study we calibrated and tested the soil conservation service curve number scs cn based modified sahu mishra eldo msme model for predicting storm event direct runoff qtot and its soil saturation coefficient α as a threshold antecedent moisture condition for partitioning into overland surface and shallow subsurface runoff components the model calibration was performed using 36 storm events from 2008 to 2015 on a 160 ha low gradient forested watershed ws80 on poorly drained soil the model was further validated without calibration using data from 2011 to 2015 on two sites 115 ha conifer and 210 ha eccles church and from 2008 to 2011 on a third site the 100 ha upper debidue creek udc all similar forested watersheds on the atlantic coastal plain usa the calibrated msme model was able to accurately predict the estimated qtot pred for the ws80 watershed with calculated nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse rmse standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias of 0 80 0 44 and 16 7 respectively by applying the same calibrated α value of 0 639 from the ws80 to two other similar poorly drained watersheds the msme model satisfactorily predicted the estimated qtot pred for both the eccles church nse 0 64 rsr 0 57 pbias 28 9 and conifer nse 0 60 rsr 0 58 pbias 21 3 watersheds respectively the msme model however yielded unsatisfactory results nse 0 13 rsr 2 06 pbias 616 3 on the udc watershed with coarse textured soils indicating the possible association of the α coefficient with soil subsurface texture based on the analysis of event rainfall and pre event water table elevation and linking them with the calibrated α coefficient that describes the proportion of saturated depth in a soil profile it was found that rainfall was the main determining factor for overland runoff generation these results demonstrate the msme model s potential to predict direct runoff in poorly drained forested watersheds which serve as a reference for urbanizing coastal landscapes in a changing climate keywords overland surface runoff shallow subsurface saturated runoff water table antecedent soil moisture poorly drained soils 1 introduction runoff and streamflow processes in topographically low gradient coastal watersheds are dominated by shallow subsurface drainage from saturated areas and saturation excess overland surface runoff that occurs when a shallow water table wt is present amatya et al 2019 epps et al 2013a slattery et al 2006 these low gradient watershed areas generally located along the atlantic and gulf coastal plain regions in the u s are rapidly being developed and urbanized baseline reference data on storm runoff characteristics of unimpaired watersheds are crucial for describing and assessing the hydrological impacts of developing areas and urbanization in these and other similar coastal watersheds a number of studies have attempted to describe such storm event characteristics using data for headwater coastal watersheds in the southeastern atlantic coastal plain amatya et al 2000 2019 blair et al 2014 bosch et al 2017 capece et al 1986 epps et al 2013a la torre torres et al 2011 sheridan et al 2002 swindel et al 1983 a region characterized by a low gradient forested landscape that is undergoing significant residential and commercial development o driscoll et al 2010 hitchcock et al 2014 lockaby et al 2013 at the same time multiple hydrologic models of varying complexities and scales have been used to estimate predict runoff response to storm events from catchments with various topographic and land cover conditions blair et al 2014 fedelman 2000 genereux 2003 hayes and young 2006 kannan et al 2007 rossman and huber 2016 usda 2004 for example the rational method kuichling 1889 the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method usda 2004 and hec hms hec 2006 menberu et al 2014 model serve as some examples among others there are several studies in the literature on the modification of the original scs cn method to assess direct runoff blair et al 2014 epps et al 2013a grimaldi et al 2013a 2013b kannan et al 2007 młyński et al 2020 verma et al 2020 however uncertainty remains due to a large range of estimates of runoff volume and peak flow response to storm events obtained from these models genereux 2003 joo et al 2014 walega et al 2020 only a limited number of such models have been tested on forest systems corbin et al 2022 tedela et al 2012 particularly on less studied small low gradient watersheds some of the recently modified versions of the scs cn models bartlett et al 2016 blair et al 2012 walega et al 2020 have shown improvement in predictions of storm response on relatively undisturbed headwater forested watersheds thus informing better stormwater management in such landscapes that are undergoing development for example stormflow on lower coastal plain lcp watersheds was shown to be driven by the wt depth and antecedent soil moisture asm stormflow increases substantially as shallow overland surface runoff soon after near surface saturation or surface ponding epps et al 2013a harder et al 2007 slattery et al 2006 epps et al 2013b showed that event runoff predictions do not compare closely to measured flow under the average moisture condition normally associated with the scs cn method usda 2004 warranting adjustments of the cn for wt based asm most of these studies applied the standard scs cn model but with a modified initial abstraction component to predict direct runoff for the shallow wt conditions in this region blair et al 2014 epps et al 2013b la torre torres 2008 blair et al 2012 developed and successfully tested the swarm model to predict runoff volume and peak discharge with limited data for some lcp watersheds of south carolina bartlett et al 2016 moved beyond the classic scs cn by accommodating different runoff concepts and distributions of heterogeneities in storage capacity and soil moisture as the basis for upscaling a point runoff response and linking ecohydrological processes to runoff modeling those authors showed proof of concept in four forested watersheds and argued that their resulting model may better represent geographic regions and site types that previously have been beyond the scope of the traditional scs cn method however all those watersheds were on upland sites where hillslope hydrology dominates runoff generation hewlett 1982 a recent previous version of the modified scs cn sme m which includes a single modified asm was found to perform better than the scs cn model but still relatively unsatisfactory in predicting total direct runoff and peak discharge on a low gradient coastal forest watershed walega et al 2020 most recently building on the sme m model walega et al 2020 the msme modified sahu mishra eldho model was developed which incorporates a soil saturation coefficient α for partitioning the total direct runoff into the overland surface and saturated subsurface runoff based on the asm with the wt as a proxy this is somewhat similar to the concept in bartlett et al 2016 to more accurately predict storm response to event outflow and peak discharge rates the model was successfully tested for predicting qtot pred in an artificially drained coastal forested watershed with open ditches 100 m apart walega and amatya 2020 results showed computed qtot pred was completely dominated by saturated subsurface runoff as drainage in the ditch driven by the gradient between the wt midway between the ditches and ditch water level with negligible overland surface runoff consistent with earlier studies amatya et al 1996 skaggs et al 2016 however to date the msme model has not been tested in naturally drained no ditch system forest watersheds where both forms of direct runoff are possible to occur amatya et al 2019 reported that on low gradient watersheds lateral subsurface flow and soil moisture storage vary widely with the balance of rainfall and evapotranspiration et with lateral flow likely occurring for only a short distance about 50 100 m as in the case of ditched systems without drainage or with a low drainage density in low gradient watersheds the shallow wt position during dry periods would be near the stream channel bottoms during a storm event only a small amount of rainwater is needed to cause a rapid rise in the wt resulting in a larger hydraulic gradient and thus causing subsurface flow towards the stream bonnel 1993 during wet periods wt rise results in near surface lateral subsurface flow which redistributes water to compensate for et and microtopographic variation younger 2006 such a process is described as subsurface stormflow common in humid climatic regions slattery et al 2006 as the wt approaches the surface in a broad inter stream area watershedwide overland surface runoff occurs depending upon the microtopography once the groundwater is recharged and the wt has risen to the surface precipitation to these areas will become runoff regardless of rainfall intensity and water travels quickly to the stream dingman 2002 conceptually different from the classical concepts developed by hewlett 1982 for upland hillslope hydrology in which subsurface stormflow is defined as interflow and surface stormflow as overland runoff the process of saturation excess runoff generation is common in humid low gradient systems with a shallow wt slattery et al 2006 younger 2006 the concept of direct runoff and its components saturated subsurface interpreted as streamside drainage and overland surface runoff interpreted as watershedwide runoff on low gradient forest systems primarily affected by soil moisture with the wt as a proxy were implemented in the msme model as an advancement in the scs cn method applicable to areas 300 ha typically with less spatial variability in the soil moisture deficit famiglietti et al 2008 as cited in bartlett et al 2016 in this study we applied the msme model on four first order catchments in naturally drained low gradient forests on the south carolina atlantic coastal plain to examine rainfall runoff processes as influenced by the antecedent moisture condition amc we used measured storm event data from 2008 to 2015 for the one watershed 160 ha data from 2011 to 2015 for two watersheds 110 ha and 210 ha and data from 2008 to 2011 for a fourth watershed 100 ha fig 1 the main objectives of this study were 1 to calibrate the msme model for the ws80 watershed and 2 to validate its performance by predicting observed storm event direct runoff qtot obs for the three remaining watersheds without any calibration the hypotheses tested were 1 the msme model using the published scs cn values and calibrated with storm event data for other parameters on the poorly drained ws80 watershed can accurately predict the observed storm event based total direct runoff qtot obs based on accepted statistical criteria 2 there exists a threshold for both the pre event initial water table elevation wte and precipitation amount identified using the calibrated soil saturation coefficient α above which event overland surface runoff is predicted in addition to predicted subsurface saturated runoff on this watershed 2 material and methods 2 1 study site description four first order watersheds were studied ws80 1 60 km2 eccles church 2 10 km2 conifer 1 15 km2 and upper debidue creek udc 1 00 km2 the hydrologic unit code huc for the first three watersheds is 0305020103 and the huc for udc is 0302040804 the eccles church and conifer watersheds are within the third order turkey creek tc watershed 52 4 km2 fig 1 in the usda forest service francis marion national forest fmnf located approximately 60 km northeast of charleston south carolina morrison 2016 the ws80 conifer and eccles church watersheds within the larger turkey creek tc watershed are rural forested lands that drain to turkey creek which discharges to huger creek a headwater catchment of the east branch of the cooper river that catchment ultimately drains into the charleston harbor harder et al 2007 james 2013 la torre torres et al 2011 separately the udc watershed located in coastal georgetown county south carolina is part of the freshwater portion of debidue creek in the north inlet estuary epps et al 2013a udc drains into an area with an existing suburban housing development and then into the north inlet tidal saltwater estuary all four watersheds are characterized by low gradient topography and shallow water table conditions long term 1946 2008 average annual minimum and maximum air temperatures were 3 2 and 30 6 c respectively and the annual rainfall ranged from 834 to 2106 mm on the usfs santee experimental forest sef site july and november were on average the wettest 187 mm mean rainfall and the driest 69 mm mean rainfall months respectively dai et al 2013 the ws80 watershed is on the north bank of turkey creek and is the control catchment of a paired system the watershed is comprised of about 70 mixed pine and hardwood stands and 48 forested wetland based on the u s national wetlands inventory classification nwi 2021 ws80 has poorly drained soils primarily of the wahee soil series fine mixed semiactive thermic aeric endoaquults which has a large field capacity and small permeability harder et al 2007 the eccles church watershed is located on the south bank of the tc watershed the dominant vegetation of the eccles church watershed is loblolly pine pinus taeda followed by longleaf pine pinus palustris table 1 the dominant land use is thinned forest basal area 25 m2 ha 1 followed by dense forest basal area 25 m2 ha 1 and the dominant soil series are lynchburg 48 6 and goldsboro 14 morrison 2016 the conifer watershed is located on

landscape is currently forested with mixed hardwood lowlands and upland pine stands based on the national land cover database nlcd 2016 the watershed is comprised of 83 vegetated wetland much higher than the other three watersheds in this study the primary soil series in the udc watershed are lynn haven and leon these soils are formed in sandy marine sediments and are associated with very low gradient conditions high permeability and are poorly to very poorly drained usda 1980 2 2 data collection rainfall data for the eccles church and conifer watersheds were collected at a weather station approximately 3 km east of the study sites fig 1 an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge with an adjacent manual gauge was used rainfall for both ws80 and udc watersheds were also collected using an automatic tipping bucket backed up by a manual gauge fig 1 additional rain gauges approximately 6 km west at the turkey creek outlet usgs gauge and at the sef were used to fill data gaps on ws80 eccles and conifer watersheds flow rates were estimated by the standard culvert area velocity method using stage and corresponding velocity data collected at 15 min intervals using an automated isco 4150 flow meter teledyne inc thousand oaks ca usa installed inside and at the downstream end of round concrete culverts that were 914 mm and 762 mm in diameter for the eccles church and conifer watersheds respectively flow rates for 15 min intervals were integrated to compute stream discharge volumetric flow and to estimate event based total streamflow i e outflow morrison 2016 digital measurements of stage recorded every 10 minutes by a teledyne isco flowmeter installed upstream of the ws80 watershed weir outlet gauging stations were used with established rating curves for compound v notch weir for estimating streamflow rates amatya and trettin 2019 2021 watershed outflow rate in the udc was estimated using a 0 6 m modified parshall flume located immediately downstream of a road culvert epps et al 2013a hitchcock et al 2009 shallow groundwater data i e depth to water table from ground surface were measured on an hourly basis using a global water wl 16 pressure transducer xylem inc rye brook ny usa with a datalogger on an upland well on ws80 amatya and trettin 2021 and in the wells on lynchburg and wahee soils near the eccles church and conifer watersheds respectively amatya et al 2018 morrison 2016 a water table well with a pressure transducer solinist logger georgetown ontario canada was located in an upland pine area near the udc watershed boundary epps et al 2013a additional details of hydro meteorological measurements may be found elsewhere amatya and trettin 2021 epps et al 2013a morrison 2016 2 3 hydrograph separation separation of storm event hydrographs into direct runoff and baseflow values for all watersheds were conducted primarily following techniques used by williams 2007 as cited in epps et al 2013a in which a log linear regression line was fit for the exponential receding limb of the hydrographs for the udc and ws80 however a linear regression with the same separation technique was used by morrison 2016 for eccles and conifer watersheds storm events were selected using rainfall and streamflow data during 2008 2015 for ws80 2008 2011 for udc and 2011 2015 period for the eccles church and conifer watersheds individual storm events were selected for each of the watersheds and flow rate data were plotted against the corresponding rainfall that may have triggered the event two screening criteria were selected to identify storm events 1 events with a single peak hydrograph and 2 event rainfall of at least 12 mm and minimum of six hours between rainfall events amatya et al 2000 epps et al 2013a la torres et al 2011 although all events exceeded 20 mm size except for two events on the eccles church watershed events with a small double peak were also analyzed for comparison storm event outflow characteristics evaluated included total stream outflow mm and direct runoff qtot obs which was calculated as a difference between total outflow and baseflow obtained using hydrograph separation epps et al 2013a morrison 2016 total 5 day rainfall p5 amount before the start of each event was also tabulated as proxies for the asm out of the 36 events analyzed for the ws80 watershed 20 events occurred during the winter and spring seasons november to april with smaller et demand and 16 events were during the summer and fall seasons may to october with larger et the wt data from the wells in wahee soil on the ws80 watershed amatya and trettin 2021 in the dominant wahee lenoir soil on conifer in the lynchburg soil for eccles church morrison 2016 and leon soils on the udc epps et al 2013a watersheds were used in the analysis all of these wells installed in different soil series with varying soil drainage and infiltration response also provided information on water table position as a surrogate for asm conditions for the area amatya and trettin 2010 amatya et al 2018 callahan et al 2012 epps et al 2013a williams and amatya 2016 zhai et al 2020 2 4 scs cn model and modified sahu mishra eldho msme model direct runoff qtot pred for all events on all four watersheds was predicted using the msme model the model was also used to simulate both the subsurface saturated streamside qsubs pred and shallow watershedwide surface overland runoff qsurf pred components of the direct runoff qtot pred saturated groundwater flow in the form of baseflow to receiving waters is not considered in the msme model the model functions somewhat similar to ab components of the abcd conceptual model formulated for upper and lower zone soil moisture as cited in martinez and gupta 2011 to predict only 1 c as direct runoff and not d for the baseflow 2 4 1 theoretical background of the runoff formation in the msme model in the msme model it is assumed that in the initial phase of rainfall when the soil has antecedent moisture m after p5 direct runoff does not occur fig 2 a the m is determined by infiltrated water from p5 after exceeding the interception depression storage and potential evapotranspiration pet losses past studies blair et al 2014 baltas 2007 hawkins et al 2002 mishra and singh 2002 soulis and valiantzas 2012 woodward et al 2003 have reported that the initial abstraction ia was overestimated when calculated using the original method in this model we used the m parameter to reduce ia compared to the original method appendix a which seems to be more relevant on low gradient watersheds with high water table elevation during a storm event when the sum of precipitation p exceeds the first soil saturation threshold ia1 subsurface stormflow begins fig 2b if the rainfall p continues during the event the soil profile will continue to be saturated achieving the second threshold ia 2 resulting in the occurrence of overland surface runoff fig 2c the ia1 and ia2 parameters are determined not only by m and but also by the saturated area of the watershed at the beginning of rainfall only a small part of the watershed mainly located close to the stream can be saturated because the land surface wte is relatively deeper to be hydraulically connected with the stream water level during longer duration storms the saturated area tends to increase widely across many more parts of the watershed potentially generating saturated surface stormflow the factor determining the proportion of saturated areas in the whole watershed is the soil saturation parameter α we hypothesized that the soil profile in the watershed is completely saturated when α 1 0 if the soil profile is only partially saturated α 1 0 storm subsurface runoff may occur only from the part of the watershed located closest to the water course this α coefficient in the msme represents the saturation in the soil column similar to the b as water holding capacity of upper soil zone conceptualized in the abcd model cited in martinez and gupta 2011 where direct runoff 1 c depends upon the soil available moisture after subtracting recharge c for baseflow interestingly the a parameter in the abcd model represents the runoff propensity index similar to the threshold for generating the qsurf as will be discussed below the key difference is that the msme model further attempts to partition direct runoff 1 c into qsubs pred and qsurf pred which were calculated by introducing different soil moisture conditions expressed by sa sb and two thresholds of initial abstractions ia1 and ia2 both the initial abstractions are linked with the α coefficient in addition the ia which relies on interception surface storage and infiltration is also adjusted by the soil moisture m as an index parameter in the model with increased m primarily reducing initial abstraction ia the coefficient α obtained by calibration for the proportion of saturated soil in the profile plays a significant role in identifying a threshold of wte while transitioning from qsubs pred to qsurf pred this is similar to bartlett et al 2016 who used antecedent soil moisture deficit c in their model like the α coefficient in the msme model in both cases these coefficients represent soil moisture conditions before rainfall events however the msme model is a lumped model with parameters describing antecedent moisture representative of the soil profile in a small homogenous area where the scs cn is applicable in contrast with the bartlett et al 2016 who modified the scs cn method allowing to capture runoff from small rainfall events that do not activate large areas of threshold excess runoff and thus better represent various geographic regions and site types the later model using probabilistic distributions to consider heterogeneities in rainfall and soil water storage distribution was shown to perform better than the scs cn model on upland watersheds the potential water retention parameters sa and sb were calculated based on the same approach as in the original scs cn method where cn is a critical parameter the cn value was obtained from the published nrcs tables usda 2004 using the land cover conditions and soil hydrologic group for each area covered by a soil type within a watershed then an area weighted average cn for amcii was calculated and presented in table 1 for each of the watersheds haley 2007 epps et al 2013b in the msme model for this study the weighted cn in table 1 was further modified for different antecedent moisture conditions for each of the storm events producing different weighted cns with their calculated statistics shown in table 2 each of the cn values in tables 2 5 6 and 7 used in the msme model for the four watersheds was obtained as a storm event average of the weighted cn ii table 1 modified for antecedent moisture conditions amc dry amci wet amciii and average amc ii for each of the storm events the observed rainfall runoff data were plotted against calculated runoff for each rainfall based on the scs cn method where cn was assumed for amci amcii and amciii an example of this is presented in fig b1 for watershed ws80 next each observed runoff was compared to theoretical line of direct runoff for each of the three amc values and the final cn value in the msme model was based on distance between observed point and nearest theoretical line for the given amc this procedure is similar to described by walker et al 2001 the coefficient α and λ and β parameters were optimized using the maximum nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 as an objective function in the solver tool of microsoft excel version 2010 additionally computed qsurf pred and qsubs pred runoff components of qtot pred from the msme model were compared to the measured pre event initial wte as the amc on the ws80 watershed with dominant wahee soil series fig 1 for identifying detecting a wte threshold when the model predicted qsurf pred to test the 2nd hypothesis that there is a threshold water table elevation and precipitation amount above which overland surface runoff would occur the nse rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 were used as goodness of fit measures to assess the performance of the models in predicting direct outflow using the ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 criteria for the nse with satisfactory performance for nse 0 65 good performance for nse 0 80 and very good performance for nse 0 90 we also conducted an uncertainty analysis of simulated event qtot pred predicted by the msme model on the ws80 watershed based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method the procedure is based on running monte carlo mc model simulations with different parameter sets the parameter sets were sampled from proposed prior distributions and the simulated outputs and parameter posterior distributions were inferred to identify the closest fit to the observations obtained from parameter sets defined as behavioral blasone et al 2008 a priori uniform distribution of the α model coefficient was assumed based on the observed events for generating random values for the mc simulation run again the nse statistic was chosen for the likelihood function to provide a quantitative evaluation of the difference among the results the following uncertainties were calculated average relative interval length aril proposed by jin et al 2010 1 aril 1 n i 1 n limit u t limit l t q t o t o b s t average asymmetry degree aad

obs t is the total observed runoff and n is the number of time steps additionally the percentages of observations that are contained in the calculated 95 confidence intervals jin et al 2010 were also calculated as 4 p 95 c i nq i n 100 where n is the number of events and nqi is the number of observations that are contained in the calculated confidence intervals finally we applied the msme model without any calibration to predict the qtot pred on eccles church and conifer watersheds with 12 and 6 storm events respectively and in sandy udc watershed with 23 events for the model validation we also assumed the same value of α coefficient calibrated for the ws80 watershed for predicting qtot pred on all the three watersheds as a part of the same hypothesis to demonstrate that the msme model can generate the qtot pred and its surface and subsurface components from varying coastal forest watersheds 3 results and discussion 3 1 storm event hydrograph characteristics data in table 2 shows the values and statistics of measured rainfall runoff storm event parameters used in the msme model for the 2008 2015 period for the ws80 watershed the average and maximum event precipitation p for the period amounted to 73 1 mm and 157 7 mm respectively the observed direct runoff qtot obs response to rainfall events varied from zero to 88 mm with an average of 13 2 mm table 2 the 5 day prior rainfall p5 showed some variability cov table 2 the large values of kurtosis and skewness and the difference between the mean and the median show an asymmetric distribution of most of the p and qtot obs parameters to the right table 2 the value of kurtosis suggests most of p and qtot obs values were grouped about the mean value while the skewness shows that more events have rainfall and runoff less than their respective mean value 3 2 msme modeling of surface and subsurface runoff in ws80 watershed the msme model predicted mean total runoff qtot pred value across 36 storms for the 2008 2015 period was 11 0 mm close to the observed value of 13 2 mm with no significant difference t test 0 787 p 0 436 α 0 05 table 2 the analysis was based on the weighted cn taken from the published nrcs table usda 1986 but modified with the amc with a mean of 66 7 57 0 88 0 which was almost the same as the value of 68 reported earlier by epps et al 2013b after adjustment of the antecedent soil moisture asm defined by wt for selected storm events on the ws80 watershed table 1 mean asm expressed by the m parameter eq a 4 was equal to m 3 6 mm with a range of 0 0 41 5 and represents soil moisture index for very thin soil layer added by p5 rainfall table 2 the lower initial soil moisture on the ws80 watershed was supported by the lower mean initial wte fig 3 it is evident from the asymptotic nature of the plots in fig 3a and 3b that the wte attains its highest value at nearly 9 m and remains stable but at a single well location on the watershed for m 1 0 mm this result tends to indicate that there may possibly be a watershed wide threshold value of the shallow wte within an uncertainty range due to varying microtopography amoah et al 2013 when soils attain high antecedent moisture with saturation hypothesis 2 this relationship is also consistent with amatya et al 2020 who reported all high water table soils generally respond similarly to extreme precipitation events as a next step we examined the influence of p5 antecedent rainfall on wte in fig 3a apparently for a small increase in values of p5 wte increases rapidly attaining a maximum wte after p5 reaches a threshold of 3 0 mm the wte has lesser variability for any m values higher than the threshold value fig 3b therefore more water added to an already saturated soil cannot infiltrate further into the soil and causes ponding and generating higher overland surface runoff than the subsurface computed results showed that the average qsubs pred was larger than the average qsurf pred on the ws80 watershed table 2 consistent with amatya et al 1996 study who reported that it is rare in low gradient watersheds for qsurf to occur but may occur for example after large two year recurrence storm events exceeding 100 mm of rainfall in 24 hrs amatya et al 1998 relationships between rainfall and computed runoff for all events on the ws80 watershed are presented in fig 4 initial wtes were also plotted for the corresponding events for ws80 in fig 4a which shows despite the wte achieved threshold of 9 00 m or somewhat higher only qsubs pred was observed left side of the vertical line in fig 4a on the other hand the qsurf pred runoff was generated by the msme model only when p threshold of 113 mm was achieved accordingly we can conclude that it is the rainfall together with amc not wte alone is a crucial factor determining generation of overland flow in this flat coastal watershed accordingly when the high wte near 9 0 m was linked with corresponding high event rainfall the model generated highest qtot pred when the p was below detected threshold only qsubs pred was predicted on the watershed the p threshold on the ws80 watershed was equal to 113 mm supporting our 2nd hypothesis however there was no data on individual q components to verify although this qualitatively supports the harder et al 2007 study who reported that when the wt positions at their single study well were at 0 1 m depth at the onset of the storm event the saturated conditions should cause a large fraction of the rainfall to leave the system as surface and shallow subsurface runoff a similar concept of pre threshold runoff as subsurface and threshold excess runoff in the scs cn method was proposed by bartlett et al 2016 for simulating runoff generation in hillslope hydrology dominated forest watersheds however additional field studies are needed to verify the generation of separate qsub and qsurf components for the runoff events as only the total direct runoff q was measured at the site parameters of the calibrated msme model and computed measures of goodness of fit for model performance compared to the observed data are given in table 3 for ws80 watershed and additionally for three other validated watersheds eccles church conifer and the udc the coefficient α obtained from the calibration was found to be equal to 0 639 for the ws80 watershed the value of β 0 703 indicated that the asm index m at the beginning of the rain event was not only likely caused by infiltrating rainfall as defined by p5 but also by the wte as a surrogate of soil moisture because a portion of p5 would have been lost by et amatya et al 2020 the model performance statistics of rsr and nse calculated as 0 44 and 0 80 respectively were classified as good for nse according to ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 criteria these results are also better than those from the previous versions of the model sme m and others on the ws80 watershed for example walega et al 2020 obtained an nse of 0 72 using the sme m model and 0 73 for the original scs cn model using the cn based on usda 2004 on this watershed however walega et al 2017 had reported slightly better performance of the mishra sahu ms model compared to the sahu 1 and 3 parameter models on this watershed the positive value of pbias suggests the average tendency of the simulated data to slightly underestimate total direct runoff to their observed counterparts comparing the predicted event total runoff qtot pred to the observed data fig 4b shows a good agreement for the ws80 watershed supporting the 1st hypothesis however predicted qtot pred values are slightly lower than those observed in the case of larger runoff events this may be likely due to slightly lower weighted cn value 66 7 obtained from the usda 2004 to include in the msme model table 2 compared to the cn of 68 obtained after adjusting for the amc defined by the wt at the site as reported in epps et al 2013b study 3 3 uncertainty of the msme model the uncertainty of the msme model predictions was analyzed for the storm events on the ws80 watershed to detect the potential influence of the α coefficient on prediction errors of simulations a selection criterion for the α coefficient was the threshold value of the likelihood function with the nse value exceeding 0 65 which as previously mentioned was deemed satisfactory the simulations in which the nse values were below 0 65 were excluded from further analysis to provide a broad quantitative evaluation of the uncertainty analysis simulations results from aril aad and ada statistical criteria were calculated table 4 the calculated value of aril 0 496 is in a somewhat similar range reported in other literature 0 09 to 1 30 for monthly nitrate load and storm hydrograph predictions appling et al 2015 walega and książek 2016 indicating relatively lower uncertainties in the model predictions an aad value lower than 0 50 indicates that on average the observed runoff was within the prediction uncertainty bands whereas the higher the aad value the more asymmetrical the uncertainty bands were around the observed water levels xiong et al 2009 walega and książek 2016 our calculations showed the aad value of 0 797 table 4 was slightly higher than 0 50 but substantially lower than 1 32 obtained by walega and książek 2016 suggesting that the average observed runoff is likely higher than the upper uncertainty band p 95 ci statistics used to quantify the random and systematic errors in simulations indicate that the p 95 ci values 50 stand for more random errors whereas the p 95 ci values 50 suggest systematic errors as sources of uncertainties in simulations as shown in table 3 our calculated p 95 ci value of 44 44 is slightly lower than 50 indicating a slight potential for systematic errors in the msme modeling results the plot in fig 2b shows the model s tendency to slightly underpredict the events particularly those with deeper wtes however this systematic average error of 15 overprediction of runoff with a range of 8 7 to 20 2 was deemed acceptable considering other potential errors in the estimated cn parameter as well as in the measured data also this was likely due to predicted narrow bands of uncertainty caused by narrow variability of the accepted α coefficient assuming a uniform wahee soil throughout the watershed which has some heterogeneities fig 1 this means the model may have insufficiently captured changes of asm across the watershed however this potential wte threshold from localized well data on the wahee soil may not be quite representative of the whole watershed with some additional soil types consistent with bartlett et al 2016 for addressing heterogeneities for large areas 3 4 validation of msme model on two other watersheds with relatively poorly drained low permeability soils observed data and computed statistics of rainfall runoff parameters for the msme model for the eccles church and conifer watersheds for the 2011 2015 period are shown in tables 5 and 6 respectively the average event p of 61 0 mm for eccles church is slightly lower than the 65 9 mm for the conifer watershed and much lower than for ws80 table 2 but similar maximum values were observed for the eccles church and conifer sites the 5 day prior p5 is lesser on eccles church and conifer watersheds compared to the ws80 watershed the observed average outflows qtot obs were 22 1 mm 32 0 mm and 13 2 mm for the eccles church conifer and ws80 watersheds respectively mean cn values obtained from the usda 1986 and modified for the amcs for the eccles church and conifer watersheds were found to be 77 5 and 83 respectively with a range of 60 90 for both tables 5 and 6 cn was higher on the conifer watershed than the eccles church watershed as expected due to relatively well drained soils on eccles church with a potential for a larger initial abstraction relative to the conifer watershed the m index for the validated watersheds eccles church on sandy soils and the conifer on loamy clay soils were smaller than on ws80 watershed tables 2 5 6 with a large field capacity and low permeability soils in addition to the largest wetland area harder et al 2007 table 1 relationships between rainfall and computed runoff for all events on eccles church and conifer watersheds are presented in fig 5 the influence of rainfall p on the runoff qtot obs is evident the analysis showed a lack of overland surface runoff on both the eccles and conifer watersheds including for larger rainfall events we assumed the wte threshold at saturation for the eccles church on lynchburg soils and conifer on wahee soil similar to that on ws80 because both the wahee and lynchburg soils are classified as somewhat poorly drained located in the same low gradient topographical and geological conditions also both soils are similar texture wise as fine sandy loam and fine loamy sand and have three out of five similar terms in taxonomy semi active thermic aeric williams and amatya 2016 in addition when the soils are saturated with wte near or at the surface both soils respond similarly during high rainfall events amatya et al 2020 comparisons of the predicted event total runoff qtot pred to the observed data for the eccles church and conifer watersheds plotted in fig 6 a and 6b respectively show a relatively poorer agreement for both the watersheds compared to ws80 fig 4b with slightly lower predicted q values than the observed although the computed statistics showed a satisfactory performance table 3 positive values of pbias in both watersheds suggest that the msme model tends to underestimate mean direct runoff as much as 29 compared to the observed the fact that the model performance of simulating qtot pred was satisfactory based on evaluation statistics table 3 fig 6 suggests that the msme model using the published ncrs cn values and calibrated with parameters from a watershed with long term data can be used for simulating event rainfall runoff in ungauged watersheds with similar conditions 3 5 validation of the msme model on a watershed with high permeability soils the predicted values and statistics of rainfall runoff parameters for the msme model for the 2008 2011 period for the udc watershed are shown in table 7 together with observed rainfall and runoff data the average event p of 41 7 mm was much less than that for previously described watersheds despite the slightly higher 5 day prior rainfall than for the eccles church and conifer watersheds but less compared to the ws80 watershed the smallest observed average qtot obs of 3 7 mm on udc the smallest value for all the four watersheds was likely due to the larger permeability of the sandy soils of lynn haven and leon series epps et al 2013a the calculated cn mean for the udc watersheds was 69 1 with a range of 57 0 88 0 which was substantially lower than the cn values for the conifer and eccles church watersheds tables 5 and 6 but slightly higher than the values reported by epps et al 2013b however the asm index m values for this validated watershed were similar to that of the ws80 watershed tables 2 and 7 the relationship between p and computed qtot pred and its components for all storm events on the udc watershed are presented in fig 7 a the plot and the analysis showed that the msme model using the α coefficient as on the ws80 did not yield surface overland runoff in any of the storm events but only the shallow subsurface saturated runoff on this watershed with highly permeable soil this result is consistent with slattery et al 2006 who showed that the subsurface flow is dominant where there are deep permeable soils the plot in fig 7a also shows an increase in qsubs pred values with an increase in wtes consistent with other studies harder et al 2007 as a result total runoff from the udc watershed was simulated as shallow subsurface saturated runoff only the msme model for this watershed performed poorer nse 0 13 than for the other watersheds table 2 with an unsatisfactory performance using the ritter and carpena 2013 criterion the poor quality of the model is also evident from the calculated rsr and pbias measures high pbias suggests that total direct runoff predicted by the msme model is substantially underestimated compared to observed events the poor results of runoff achieved from the msme model in the udc watershed can be attributed to the underestimation of the antecedent soil moisture m for high permeability soil the initial abstractions ia1 and ia2 were too large and thus losses of rainfall p caused the predicted runoff from the msme model to be significantly smaller than the observed thus we conclude that the msme model without any calibration is not able to reasonably predict total direct runoff formation from storm events on this watershed with higher soil permeability fig 7b 3 6 interpretations of runoff response for storm event modeling and future works 3 6 1 water table threshold on partitioning subsurface saturated and surface overland runoff in this study we found the model predicted shallow subsurface saturated flow as streamside runoff for all storm events on all four watersheds only on ws80 when a threshold of 113 mm precipitation was exceeded the model predicted surface overland watershedwide runoff the results on the ws80 are consistent with other forested catchments juez et al 2021 wilcox et al 2011 for example juez et al 2021 studied hydrological dynamics in forested catchments in san salvador central spanish pyrenees and detected a rainfall threshold of 105 8 mm above which high magnitude low frequency events were observed with the rainfall runoff slope considerably stronger than the observed under the threshold the same authors also concluded that the catchment response is related to the height of the water table which in turn was related to antecedent rainfall conditions similar to our results the msme model assumes that watershedwide surface overland runoff is initiated when the watershed is completely saturated in a situation when p5 corresponds to the maximum potential retention this study did not find a threshold relationship for wte above which surface overland runoff would likely be generated by the msme model the model yielded only subsurface saturated runoff even for the wte of 9 0 m or above fig 4a at a single well location on ws80 on the other hand a wte of approximately 9 0 m in a well on ws80 suggests that there may possibly be a threshold wte value when soils attain high antecedent moisture with saturation across the watershed fig 3 thus producing increased total runoff this hypothesis for ws80 is supported by wte versus observed total runoff q plot in fig 8 a but did not hold true for the well on the udc watershed fig 8b detection of a relationship between wte and runoff could dictate the rainfall response on these watersheds between dry and wet asm as mentioned early wte can influence on soil moisture and thus on possible runoff generation as shown in fig b2 wte elevation is linked with ia1 representing initial abstraction for subsurface saturated runoff initially when wte is close to the surface ia1 has lower value but after rain events the value exceeds ia1 resulting in formation of subsurface runoff for deeper wte ia1 is also decreased potentially with also the decreased chance of the subsurface runoff occurrence moreover according to equation a 2 the ia1 is determined by antecedent soil moisture m for example if m increases yielding higher moisture ia1 decreases and thus also the storage decreases this behavior consequently pronounces the subsurface runoff generation process in this case both the wte and ia2 do not yield similar behavior confirming that occurrence of surface overland runoff is more determined by rainfall depth than the wte for example in their study on this watershed epps et al 2013a showed that only very moderate amounts of runoff could be expected for rain events that occur when the wte is below a threshold as dry asm on the other hand substantial watershed wide runoff generation might be expected under high wte across the watershed exceeding a representative of threshold consistent with harder et al 2007 who found exponentially increasing runoff when the water table was ponded 40 mm at a given well location on the ws80 watershed all three studies found a threshold rainfall to runoff response when the wte at the ws80 observation well reached near 9 m which was close to the soil surface at that location however we expect some variation in this single well based threshold on a watershed scale basis for this watershed with a mean depressional storage of 93 mm 87 99 mm amoah et al 2013 the udc watershed demonstrates how wte is a site specific varible udc has an elevation range of 1 8 6 5 m table 2 indicating a wte of 9 m is impossible at this site the relationship for the observations at udc fig 8b indicates 7 out of 17 events with wte ranging from 2 3 to 3 3 m result in no runoff and higher rates of runoff are associated with wte over 3 4 m the sandy subsoils of udc have much less moisture holding capacity and unsaturated storage is quite small in this case threshold behavior occurs over a broader range of wte from 3 4 to 3 8 m epps et al 2013a and half of the observed storm with runoff were above the 3 4 m value of wte 3 6 2 soil saturation coefficient α the coefficient α in the msme model can be interpreted as the partial area contribution of saturated soil that coefficient plays an important role in predicting the switching from qsubs pred to qsurf pred runoff in this way the msme model may be mimicking saturation excess overland flow dunne and black 1970 the relationship of α to both a threshold rainfall amount and a specific wte on ws80 suggests the calibrated coefficients of the lumped msme may relate to a spatially distributed saturation excess overland flow generation process dunne et al 1975 the role of soil saturation water table depth or elevation in runoff threshold behavior has been recognized in coastal forested watersheds for decades epps et al 2013a eshleman et al 1994 harder et al 2007 williams 1979 williams 2007 yet those studies like this one used a single well elevation as an index to infer the spatially distributed water table siebert et al 2011 determined that a major source of runoff generation in swedish peat dominated low gradient forested watersheds was the high conductivity of the surface forest floor and upper peat layers mcdonnell et al 1991 also found high horizontal conductivity in the forest floor on steep forested watersheds in new zealand they discounted the mechanism as a source of runoff in those watersheds as rapid flow could only be measured over a distance of a few tens of meters bishop et al 1990 found that the flow in the swedish streams could be accounted for by this shallow flow in a region within 30 m of the stream skaggs et al 2016 found similar apparent high surface hydraulic conductivity in north carolina but a tenfold decrease after bedding destroyed the forest floor walega and amatya 2020 used data from an undisturbed but artificially drained forested watershed in coastal north carolina in the development of the msme model that model indicated that the shallow subsurface mechanism occurred within 50 m of the stream can the results of the msme model be used to create a hypothesis of how a shallow subsurface flow mechanism may be active on undrained coastal forested watersheds the eccles church watershed can be used to visualize the above hypothesis fig 9 eccles church is located on a pleistocene aged floodplain colquhoun 1974 where soils have developed on the former floodplain surface the stream has developed in an old meander scar while other poorly drained soils are found in micro topographic lows based on an overlay of soils with a lidar based digital elevation model dem of the area amatya et al 2015 using the msme model results for this watershed table 5 we can visualize a condition similar to fig 9a after 25 9 mm of rain during median conditions with that rainfall rapid subsurface flow occurs only on the most poorly drained portions of the watershed and drains to the closest topographic low and limited area near the stream contributes to stream flow the model also suggests that the condition of fig 9a may occur after only 7 6 mm of rainfall during wet conditions or as much as 69 1 mm during dry conditions similarly the model predicts conditions of fig 9b will occur after 146 7 mm of rain in median conditions in this case the rapid shallow subsurface flow will be extensive on all but the well drained soils and the topographic lows will connect to the stream forming a continuous saturated zone across much of the watershed as shown earlier in fig 2 one could visualize the model component ia1 to represent the rainfall needed to trigger rapid subsurface flow and ia2 to be the additional rainfall needed before all the topographic lows are connected to the outlet the model results suggest the initiation of this watershedwide runoff may occur after as little as 55 mm during wet conditions or only after 366 mm during very dry periods these findings suggest the need for attention to varying parameters and initial conditions when modeling storm runoff in wetland rich low gradient watersheds in the southeastern u s for example initial wte and soil moisture if available should be investigated on soil texture and drainage class basis as the parameters calibrated on the ws80 were validated satisfactorily on two other watersheds with clay and clay loam subsoil but performed rather poorly for a watershed with sandy subsoil and very low relief in the same region accounting for these initial conditions is one of the key advantages of applying the cn based models including the msme model also with watershedwide overland surface and streamside shallow subsurface saturated runoff partitioning methods used in this study over the widely used original scs cn method however the uncertainty analysis of simulated direct runoff due to the α coefficient in the msme model showed systematic errors with some overpredictions of observed runoff events the values of α were less variable due to the small variability in wte above the 9 00 m soil saturation resulting in overland surface runoff based on a single well data on the dominant soil of the ws80 watershed these results demonstrate the need for model validation with multiple soil types and topography even in the low gradient system to reduce prediction uncertainties for the general application of the model in similar other regions we recognize this is a more intensive field approach yet it yielded more detailed independent data for components of stormflow itself besides the purpose of stormflow baseflow separation of streamflow this is important for calibrating runoff models applied in the design of stormwater management practices in these coastal landscapes facing urbanization and climate change effects including extreme rainfall events amatya et al 2021 corbin et al 2022 future research may also consider the msme model integrated with empirical rainfall runoff models like soil conservation service unit hydrograph scs uh and or eba4sub model petroselli 2020 to include surface and subsurface runoff in design hydrograph generation and test the approach in multiple watersheds with varying slopes and land cover another recommended aspect of future studies is to focus on the α parameter and its linkage with a parameter describing groundwater and or soil moisture as was described by camporese et al 2019 who used topographic wetness indices twi to determine the value of the α parameter similar linkage including those derived using recent ultra high resolution remote sensing based soil moisture images ma et al 2020 is also a possibility with the msme model to reliably predict direct surface runoff in an ungauged forest and rural watersheds 4 summary and conclusions storm event direct runoff qtot pred was evaluated on three small forested watersheds 115 160 and 210 ha at the usda forest service francis marion national forest and a fourth watershed 100 ha near georgetown and north inlet winyah bay all in the rapidly urbanizing lower coastal plain of south carolina usa the watersheds had different dominant soil types with varying drainage classes but similar forest management practices we analyzed and satisfactorily calibrated the interrelationships of the qtot obs and event rainfall predicted using the modified mishra sahu eldo msme model mechanisms for the 160 ha watershed this was performed in conjunction with published nrcs cn values and other event parameters including antecedent moisture conditions defined by rainfall and water table elevation using data collected from multiple storm events that occurred between 2008 and 2015 also we found that water table elevation can be linked with α parameter in the msme model which can be interpreted as a soil saturation coefficient obtained by calibration for approximating the proportion of watershed area with saturated soil profile to partition watershedwide overland surface qsurf pred and subsurface saturated qsubs pred runoff the uncertainty analysis showed that systematic error due to this parameter can be a significant source of q prediction uncertainty model validation using the same α parameter and event data for the 2008 2011 period on the 100 ha watershed and the 2011 2015 period on two other watersheds 110 ha and 210 ha showed satisfactory performance of the msme model in predicting direct runoff only on the two poorly drained watersheds but not on the 100 ha watershed with higher soil permeability our results showed that qsurf pred is triggered only after rainfall reaches threshold values of 113 mm on ws80 but not on eccles and conifer watersheds with limited event data compared to ws80 results of this study suggest that the msme model can be used for adequately estimating total direct runoff on poorly drained coastal sites with similar characteristics as the study sites in addition the model has the potential to be used in partitioning the direct runoff and estimating peak discharge estimates for the design of road drainage and stormwater management practices in the face of changing land use and climate in coastal watersheds with low gradient topography and shallow water table soils credit

feva can not only identify the main factors that influence the risk assessment of hydrometeorological extremes but also reflect main and interactive effects of such complex uncertainties feva is applied to central asia for analyzing maximum 1 day precipitation pmax maximum daily temperature tmax and minimum daily temperature tmin where data from 32 long term 1881 2018 observation stations are adopted and 32 scenarios are examined main findings are 1 during the 20th century the occurrences of precipitation and temperature extremes were increased in central asia and minimum temperature extreme increases faster than maximum temperature extreme 2 the dominated factor affecting the return levels of pmax tmax and tmin is ees with average contributions of 32 9 47 0 and 53 5 respectively

interval agilan et al 2021 assessed the effects of threshold selection in modeling non stationary extreme precipitation results indicated that the uncertainty due to the choice of threshold under non stationary condition is higher than stationary condition in general the performance of eva model depends on the choices of extreme event sampling ees stationary non stationary assumption sna and parameter estimation pe approaches and each approach has its own merits and demerits however most of previous studies mainly focused on the comparison between stationary and non stationary models or the influence of threshold selection few studies were conducted to quantify the effects of multiple uncertainties and their interactions on the hydrometeorological eva factorial experimental design fed is a variance based sensitivity analysis approach which is effective in identification of important uncertainty sources as well as their potential interactions montgomery 2012 previously fed has been extensively adopted for uncertainty decompositions in hydrological model addor et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 chegwidden et al 2019 lyu and fan 2021 climate projection yip et al 2011 whateley and

respectively to ensure the independence of data series extreme variables that occur within 5 consecutive days are ruled out in the pot series the generalized pareto gp distribution is used for modeling the data series sampled from pot and its cdf can be formulated as follows coles 2001 3 f gpd x 1 1 ξ x u σ 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp x u σ ξ 0 where u is the given threshold of random variables x

feva method is applied to central asia for exploring the effects of multiple uncertainty sources on risk estimates of maximum 1 day precipitation pmax maximum daily temperature tmax and minimum daily temperature tmin central asia is located in the core region of the asian continent 35 13 55 44 n and 46 50 87 32 e and covers five countries i e kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan as one of the driest regions in the world central asia has continental arid and semi arid climates with high precipitation and temperature fluctuation in addition the increasing temperature has been observed over central asia and projected to increase in the future hu et al 2014 ozturk et al 2017 under this warming climate it is expected that both temperature and precipitation extremes are changing over time liu et al 2021 thus it is desired to explore the tail behaviors of temperature and precipitation extremes in central asia the observed daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures data over central asia were obtained from noaa s national climatic data center ncdc http ncdc noaa gov which include 32 meteorological stations with long term time series 1881 2018 and low missing rate the detailed information of meteorological stations is presented in supplemental material table s1 4 result and discussion 4 1 effects of multiple uncertainty sources the 2 4 4 32 possible pe ees sna scenarios within the mixed level factorial experiments were examined in the 32 meteorological stations over central asia figs 2 4 present the return level curves of pmax tmax and tmin under all scenarios and their sen s slopes sen 1968 in bm series the mean return levels of pmax tmax and tmin under 50 year return period over central asia are occurred in 34 35 80 07 mm 39 61 47 81 c and 20 84 47 79 c respectively which is consistent with arid and semi arid climates in addition the sen s slopes of pmax tmax and tmin indicate the increases of precipitation and temperature extremes during the 20th century and minimum temperature extreme generally increases faster than maximum temperature extreme different methodological combinations would lead to varied return level curves compared with low return periods large discrepancies of return levels for precipitation and temperature extremes are observed in high return periods the results indicate that the estimation of return level is influenced by pe ees and sna and it is desired for quantifying such uncertainties to provide more reliable assessment fig 5 shows the main effects of pe ees and sna on the average return levels of pmax tmax and tmin the slope of the line represents the influence of uncertainty source on eva it is obvious that all uncertainty sources i e pe ees and sna have nonnegligible effects on the return levels of precipitation and temperature extremes for example the absolute values of return levels of pmax tmax and tmin derived from bayesian estimation are higher than mle indicating the importance of parameter uncertainty in eva model the successful application of an eva model depends on how well its parameters estimated which are generally conducted through 1 a theoretical relationship between the parameter and empirical order statistics 2 inference from empirical probability distribution of extreme data sadegh et al 2017 however due to the plotting position and data availability there are still challenges for estimating the underlying parameter uncertainties figs 2 4 also present the comparison of empirical return levels estimated by weibull hazen and gringorten plotting formulas for the same sample of pmax tmax and tmin the largest return period are estimated by the hazen formula followed by gringorten and weibull formulas similar results were also reported by makkonen 2008 and the in depth analysis of plotting position could be found in kim et al 2012 makkonen and pajari 2014 and makkonen and tikanmäki 2019 the absolute values of return levels of pmax tmax and tmin derived from the pot method trend to increase with the increase of threshold value of extreme series the results indicated that risk assessment with pot l approach would underestimate the return level of extreme event comparing with the pot method the absolute values of return levels of pmax tmax and tmin derived from the bm method are higher in the long return periods e g 100 year but lower in the short return periods e g 5 year in term of the sna the non stationary model trend to estimate the low return levels of extreme events compared with the stationary model particularly the highest return levels of pmax are modeled through ns 30 followed by stn ns temp and ns time there are little differences of return levels in the different return periods between ns time and ns temp this is mainly because significant increase in surface temperature was occurred in central asia resulting in the dependence structure between the temperature and time covariates figs 6 8 show the interactive effects of pe ees and sna on the average return levels of pmax tmax and tmin respectively these plots depict the effect of one uncertainty source i e pe ees and sna on the return level under the impact of another uncertainty source results indicate that when the parameter are estimated by bayesian inference the effects of ees and sna are larger than the parameters estimated by mle this is mainly because bayesian inference with mcmc draws the posterior distribution of the parameter from well constructed markov chain which provides more robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification than mle ragno et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in contrast the discrepancies of return level between mle and bayesian under pot m and pot h are obviously larger than bm and pot l particularly when the extreme events sampled through the poh m and pot h the return levels of tmax estimated by bayesian estimation are larger than mle in term of the interaction between ees and sna it is obvious that the effects of ees on the return levels of extreme events vary with the change of sna for example when the extreme series sampled from bm and pot h the differences of return levels of pmax among different sna are slight in contrast when the extreme series sampled from pot l and pot m the return levels of pmax derived from ns time and ns temp are obviously lower than stn and ns 30 this is mainly because extreme series sampled from different threshold generate the different degree of non stationary in general the pot l would result in the lower return levels of pmax tmax and tmin under the assumptions of non stationary with time and temperature covariates 4 2 contribution of uncertainty sources on the eva figs 9 11 show the percentage contributions of uncertainty sources and their interactions on the return levels of pmax tmax and tmin respectively compared with the contributions among different meteorological stations ees is the most important factor for modeling the return levels of pmax the contribution of ees under high return period is larger than low return period for example the mean contributions of ees on the return levels of pmax under 5 year 20 year 50 year and 100 year return periods are 27 2 30 8 35 4 and 38 2 respectively the sna pe ees and pe sna also have important effects the contributions are larger than 10 on the return levels of pmax in term of temperature extremes both pe and ees have important effects on the return levels of tmax and tmin the contribution of ees is more for low return period and the contribution of pe is more for high return period for example the mean contributions of pe on the return levels of tmax under 5 year 20 year 50 year and 100 year return periods are 5 5 22 9 41 8 and 49 1 respectively while the mean contribution of ees are 85 6 61 4 37 6 and 29 5 respectively in general ees plays the dominant roles in the quantile estimations for both precipitation and temperature extreme series which are mainly attributed to the threshold u used in the pot approach from a statistical perspective the selection of the threshold u is a balance between bias and variance coles 2001 the high threshold ensures the asymptotic tail approximation but increases the variance of parameter estimation due to the few exceedances scarrott and macdonald 2012 katz 2013 in addition the interaction between ees and sna is also important particularly for precipitation extreme series as shown in fig 6 the effect of threshold selection under non stationary model is obviously larger than stationary model similarly results are also found by agilan et al 2021 and their study showed that the uncertainty due to threshold selection is 54 higher in the non stationary model for precipitation extreme series when compared to the stationary model therefore the appropriate threshold definition in pot is desired for reliable extreme value estimation 4 3 threshold detection in pot the ees plays the dominant roles in the risk estimations of pmax tmax and tmin which is mainly attributed to the threshold selection in pot approach according to langousis et al 2016 the graphical and gof metrics methods show superior performances in threshold detection in the pot approach relying on the preasymptotic property of gp distribution in this study the graphical method with mean residual life mrl plot and gof metrics method with anderson darling ad and cramér von mises cvm statistic tests were conducted for detecting the appropriate threshold u in pot series and their methodologies are provided in appendix fig 12 is the mrl plots for pmax with threshold u larger than 90th percentile and corresponding time series trend based on sen s slope estimator sen 1968 and mann kendall m k test hipel and mcleod 1994 similar results for tmax and tmin are provided in the supplemental data tables s1 and s2 from the results mrl plots are approximately linear until threshold equal to 99 9th percentile for pmax tmax and tmin in fact there are multiple possible thresholds for eva through pot a sufficiently high value of threshold u is usually suggested to ensure the asymptotic basis of the model thus reducing the bias solan and losada 2012 however a value of threshold u that is too high is likely to lead the reduced sample size and high variance estimations particularly for the non stationary model in regard to the time series trend the sen s slopes are roughly stable when the thresholds u are less than 99 5th percentile for pmax and the thresholds u are less than 99th percentiles for tmax and tmin for the appropriate threshold the mrl should be approximately linear in threshold u and sen s slope should be avoiding the large fluctuations thus when time series trends are taken into account the 99 5th and 99th percentiles are suggested as the appropriate thresholds for precipitation and temperature extremes respectively figs 13 and 14 show the ad and cvm statistic tests for pmax respectively similar results for tmax and tmin are provided in the supplemental data table s3 s6 the a2 and w2 statistics decrease with increase in threshold u and is equal to 0 when the exceedances of extreme events are less than 7 the appropriate threshold is defined as the p values of a2 and w2 statistics exceeded 0 1 choulakian and stephens 2001 fig 15 presents the appropriate threshold values for precipitation and temperature extremes through gof metrics method from the results the intervals of appropriate threshold values for pmax tmax and tmin in 32 stations are 11 57 37 63 mm 34 15 44 46 c and 40 07 10 83 c respectively and the corresponding percentiles are 99 70th 99 95th 99 15th 99 93th and 99 12th 99 87th percentiles respectively the appropriate thresholds detected by gof metrics method are slightly larger than graphical method most of the previous studies using the pot approach were employed a single threshold value to extract the extreme event series such as 90th percentile ammar et al 2020 agilan et al 2021 95th percentile vittal et al 2013 and 98th percentile ragno et al 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 according to the results of uncertainty effects low threshold value would underestimate the return level of extreme event in fact the selection of threshold u is a trade off between tail asymptotics of extreme event and bias of parameter estimation underlying the gp distribution high threshold value ensures the samples to be extreme but reduces the sample size of extreme events thus increasing the variance of parameter estimation the results demonstrate that pre process of threshold detection is necessary to reliable modeling of hydrometeorological extreme events 5 conclusions in this study a factorial extreme value analysis feva method has been developed through integrating four eess four snas and two pes into a mixed level factorial experiment framework feva can identify main factors that influence the quantile estimatiosn of hydrometeorological extremes under uncertainty and can also quantify their interactive effects on the extreme values feva has been demonstrated through its application to central asia for analyzing the effects of multiple uncertainty sources i e ees sna and pe on precipitation and temperature extremes i e pmax tmax and tmin using data from 32 long term 1881 2018 observation stations based on 32 scenario analyses results disclose that 1 central asia is characterized with arid and semi arid climates where the return levels of pmax tmax and tmin under 50 year return period are occurred in 34 35 80 07 mm 39 61 47 81 c and 20 84 47 79 c respectively the increases of precipitation and temperature extremes were observed over the past one hundred years and minimum temperature extreme generally increases faster than maximum temperature extreme 2 the most important factor that influences the return levels risk of occurrence of pmax tmax and tmin is ees with average contribution of 32 9 47 0 and 53 5 respectively the return levels of precipitation and temperature extremes trend to increase with the increase of threshold u in the pot extreme series 3 the second important facts are sna 13 8 for pmax pe 29 2 for tmax and pe 29 8 for tmin 4 the interactions are pe ees 17 8 pe sna 13 6 ees sna 9 9 for pmax pe ees 9 5 ees sna 4 5 pe sna 1 9 for tmax and pe ees 4 5 ees sna 4 4 pe sna 2 2 for tmin indicating that pe and ees have obvious interactive effects on quantile estimation of hydrometeorological extremes 5 bayesian approach with mcmc show more robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification than mle when the parameters of underlying distribution estimated by bayesian estimation the estimated return levels of pmax tmax and tmin as well as the effects of ees and sna are larger than mle 6 the interaction between ees and sna is due to the reason that extreme series sampled from different threshold u would yield the different degree of non stationary the dominant role of ees is mainly attributed to the threshold selection in pot approach which has significant effects on risk assessment of hydrometeorological extremes thus the graphical and gof metrics methods have been employed to detect the appropriate threshold in the pot based model of precipitation and temperature extremes results disclose that the appropriate threshold values for pmax tmax and tmin in central asia are 11 57 37 63 mm 34 15 44 46 c and 40 07 10 83 c respectively which are larger than 99th percentile of station observation the pre process of threshold detection is necessary to reliable modeling of hydrometeorological extreme event the findings are helpful for researchers to formulate effective methodological combinations and improve the simulation and prediction accuracy of

parameter estimation pe in this study a factorial extreme value analysis feva method is developed through integrating four eess four snas and two pes into a mixed level factorial experiment framework feva can not only identify the main factors that influence the risk assessment of hydrometeorological extremes but also reflect main and interactive effects of such complex uncertainties feva is

sampling extreme event from hydrometeorological series is usually conducted through block maxima bm and peak over threshold pot approaches bm considering the annual maximum values of recorded series

huang and fan 2021 in addition plotting position and data availability are also important sources of uncertainties in eva makkonen 2008 ossandón et al 2021 in general there are multiple methodological choices coupled in eva and it is difficult to find a universal scheme performing best for all extreme variables over the past decades numerous studies have been conducted to reflect uncertainties in the eva process langousis et al 2016 nagy et al 2017 mélèse et al 2018 emmanouil et al 2020 makkonen and tikanmäki 2019 sen et al 2020 agilan et al 2021 for example langousis et al 2016 compared

interval agilan et al 2021 assessed the effects of threshold selection in modeling non stationary extreme precipitation results indicated that the uncertainty due to the choice of threshold under non stationary condition is higher than stationary condition in general the performance of eva model depends on the choices of extreme event sampling ees stationary non stationary assumption sna and parameter estimation pe approaches and each approach has its own merits and demerits however most of previous studies mainly focused on the comparison between stationary and non stationary models or the influence of threshold selection few studies were conducted to quantify the effects of multiple uncertainties and their interactions on the hydrometeorological eva factorial experimental design fed is a variance based sensitivity analysis approach which is effective in identification of important uncertainty sources as well as their potential interactions montgomery 2012 previously fed has

precipitation and wind projections in regional climate models rcms fan et al 2021 employed the fed to quantify the uncertainty contributions of marginal distribution copula function and model parameter in multivariate flood risk assessment however no previous study attempts to incorporate fed within the eva model to explore the effects of multiple uncertainties in statistical modeling of

analyzing interactive effects between different methodological choices in eva the proposed feva method will be applied to central asia for statistical analysis of precipitation and temperature

cumulative distribution function cdf can be formulated as follows coles 2001 1 f gev x exp 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ ξ 0 exp exp x μ σ ξ 0 where μ σ and ξ are the location scale and shape parameters respectively the return level xp of gev distribution associated with the return period t is given by 2 x p μ σ ξ 1 ln 1 1 t ξ ξ 0 μ σ ln ln 1 1 t ξ 0 the pot extracts the partial duration series that exceed a pre specified threshold from the whole time series tabari 2021 in this study the thresholds for pot l pot m and pot h are equal to the 97th 98th and 99th percentiles of extreme variables in the all days respectively to ensure the independence of data series extreme variables that occur within 5 consecutive days are ruled out in the pot series the generalized pareto gp distribution is used for modeling the data series sampled from pot and its cdf can be formulated as follows coles 2001 3 f gpd x 1 1 ξ x u σ 1 ξ ξ 0 1 exp x u σ ξ 0 where u is the given threshold of random variables x

feva method is applied to central asia for exploring the effects of multiple uncertainty sources on risk estimates of maximum 1 day precipitation pmax maximum daily temperature tmax and minimum daily temperature tmin central asia is located in the core region of the asian continent 35 13 55 44 n and 46 50 87 32 e and covers five countries i e kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan tajikistan and kyrgyzstan as one of the driest regions in the world central asia has continental arid and semi arid climates with high precipitation and temperature fluctuation in addition the increasing temperature has been observed over central asia and projected to increase in the future hu et al 2014 ozturk et al 2017 under this warming climate it is expected that both temperature and precipitation extremes are changing over time liu et al 2021 thus it is desired to explore the tail behaviors of temperature and precipitation extremes in central asia the observed daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures data over central asia were obtained from noaa s national climatic data center ncdc http ncdc noaa gov which include 32 meteorological stations with long term time series 1881 2018 and low missing rate the detailed information of meteorological stations is presented in supplemental material table s1 4 result and discussion 4 1 effects of multiple uncertainty sources the 2 4 4 32 possible pe ees sna scenarios within the mixed level factorial experiments were examined in the 32 meteorological stations over central asia figs 2 4 present the return level curves of pmax tmax and tmin under all scenarios and their sen s slopes sen 1968 in bm series the mean return levels of pmax tmax and tmin under 50 year return period over central asia are occurred in 34 35 80 07 mm 39 61 47 81 c and 20 84 47 79 c respectively which is consistent with arid and semi arid climates in addition the sen s slopes of pmax tmax and tmin indicate the increases of precipitation and temperature extremes during the 20th century and minimum temperature extreme generally increases faster than maximum temperature extreme different methodological combinations would lead to varied return level curves compared with low return periods large discrepancies of return levels for precipitation and temperature extremes are observed in high return periods the results indicate that the estimation of return level is influenced by pe ees and sna and it is desired for quantifying such uncertainties to provide more reliable assessment fig 5 shows the main effects of pe ees and sna on the average return levels of pmax tmax and tmin the slope of the line represents the influence of uncertainty source on eva it is obvious that all uncertainty sources i e pe ees and sna have nonnegligible effects on the return levels of precipitation and temperature extremes for example the absolute values of return levels of pmax tmax and tmin derived from bayesian estimation are higher than mle indicating the importance of parameter uncertainty in eva model the successful application of an eva model depends on how well its parameters estimated which are generally conducted through 1 a theoretical relationship between the parameter and empirical order statistics 2 inference from empirical probability distribution of extreme data sadegh et al 2017 however due to the plotting position and data availability there are still challenges for estimating the underlying parameter uncertainties figs 2 4 also present the comparison of empirical return levels estimated by weibull hazen and gringorten plotting formulas for the same sample of pmax tmax and tmin the largest return period are estimated by the hazen formula followed by gringorten and weibull formulas similar results were also reported by makkonen 2008 and the in depth analysis of plotting position could be found in kim et al 2012 makkonen and pajari 2014 and makkonen and tikanmäki 2019 the absolute values of return levels of pmax tmax and tmin derived from the pot method trend to increase with the increase of threshold value of extreme series the results indicated that risk assessment with pot l approach would underestimate the return level of extreme event comparing with the pot method the absolute values of return levels of pmax tmax and tmin derived from the bm method are higher in the long return periods e g 100 year but lower in the short return periods e g 5 year in term of the sna the non stationary model trend to estimate the low return levels of extreme events compared with the stationary model particularly the highest return levels of pmax are modeled through ns 30 followed by stn ns temp and ns time there are little differences of return levels in the different return periods between ns time and ns temp this is mainly because significant increase in surface temperature was occurred in central asia resulting in the dependence structure between the temperature and time covariates figs 6 8 show the interactive effects of pe ees and sna on the average return levels of pmax tmax and tmin respectively these plots depict the effect of one uncertainty source i e pe ees and sna on the return level under the impact of another uncertainty source results indicate that when the parameter are estimated by bayesian inference the effects of ees and sna are larger than the parameters estimated by mle this is mainly because bayesian inference with mcmc draws the posterior distribution of the parameter from well constructed markov chain which provides more robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification than mle ragno et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in contrast the discrepancies of return level between mle and bayesian under pot m and pot h are obviously larger than bm and pot l particularly when the extreme events sampled through the poh m and pot h the return levels of tmax estimated by bayesian estimation are larger than mle in term of the interaction between ees and sna it is obvious that the effects of ees on the return levels of extreme events vary with the change of sna for example when the extreme series sampled from bm and pot h the differences of return levels of pmax among different sna are slight in contrast when the extreme series sampled from pot l and pot m the return levels of pmax derived from ns time and ns temp are obviously lower than stn and ns 30 this is mainly because extreme series sampled from different threshold generate the different degree of non stationary in general the pot l would result in the lower return levels of pmax tmax and tmin under the assumptions of non stationary with time and temperature covariates 4 2 contribution of uncertainty sources on the eva figs 9 11 show the percentage contributions of uncertainty sources and their interactions on the return levels of pmax tmax and tmin respectively compared with the contributions among different meteorological stations ees is the most important factor for modeling the return levels of pmax the contribution of ees under high return period is larger than low return period for example the mean contributions of ees on the return levels of pmax under 5 year 20 year 50 year and 100 year return periods are 27 2 30 8 35 4 and 38 2 respectively the sna pe ees and pe sna also have important effects the contributions are larger than 10 on the return levels of pmax in term of temperature extremes both pe and ees have important effects on the return levels of tmax and tmin the contribution of ees is more for low return period and the contribution of pe is more for high return period for example the mean contributions of pe on the return levels of tmax under 5 year 20 year 50 year and 100 year return periods are 5 5 22 9 41 8 and 49 1 respectively while the mean contribution of ees are 85 6 61 4 37 6 and 29 5 respectively in general ees plays the dominant roles in the quantile estimations for both precipitation and temperature extreme series which are mainly attributed to the threshold u used in the pot approach from a statistical perspective the selection of the threshold u is a balance between bias and variance coles 2001 the high threshold ensures the asymptotic tail approximation but increases the variance of parameter estimation due to the few exceedances scarrott and macdonald 2012 katz 2013 in addition the interaction between ees and sna is also important particularly for precipitation extreme series as shown in fig 6 the effect of threshold selection under non stationary model is obviously larger than stationary model similarly results are also found by agilan et al 2021 and their study showed that the uncertainty due to threshold selection is 54 higher in the non stationary model for precipitation extreme series when compared to the stationary model therefore the appropriate threshold definition in pot is desired for reliable extreme value estimation 4 3 threshold detection in pot the ees plays the dominant roles in the risk estimations of pmax tmax and tmin which is mainly attributed to the threshold selection in pot approach according to langousis et al 2016 the graphical and gof metrics methods show superior performances in threshold detection in the pot approach relying on the preasymptotic property of gp distribution in this study the graphical method with mean residual life mrl plot and gof metrics method with anderson darling ad and cramér von mises cvm statistic tests were conducted for detecting the appropriate threshold u in pot series and their methodologies are provided in appendix fig 12 is the mrl plots for pmax with threshold u larger than 90th percentile and corresponding time series trend based on sen s slope estimator sen 1968 and mann kendall m k test hipel and mcleod 1994 similar results for tmax and tmin are provided in the supplemental data tables s1 and s2 from the results mrl plots are approximately linear until threshold equal to 99 9th percentile for pmax tmax and tmin in fact there are multiple possible thresholds for eva through pot a sufficiently high value of threshold u is usually suggested to ensure the asymptotic basis of the model thus reducing the bias solan and losada 2012 however a value of threshold u that is too high is likely to lead the reduced sample size and high variance estimations particularly for the non stationary model in regard to the time series trend the sen s slopes are roughly stable when the thresholds u are less than 99 5th percentile for pmax and the thresholds u are less than 99th percentiles for tmax and tmin for the appropriate threshold the mrl should be approximately linear in threshold u and sen s slope should be avoiding the large fluctuations thus when time series trends are taken into account the 99 5th and 99th percentiles are suggested as the appropriate thresholds for precipitation and temperature extremes respectively figs 13 and 14 show the ad and cvm statistic tests for pmax respectively similar results for tmax and tmin are provided in the supplemental data table s3 s6 the a2 and w2 statistics decrease with increase in threshold u and is equal to 0 when the exceedances of extreme events are less than 7 the appropriate threshold is defined as the p values of a2 and w2 statistics exceeded 0 1 choulakian and stephens 2001 fig 15 presents the appropriate threshold values for precipitation and temperature extremes through gof metrics method from the results the intervals of appropriate threshold values for pmax tmax and tmin in 32 stations are 11 57 37 63 mm 34 15 44 46 c and 40 07 10 83 c respectively and the corresponding percentiles are 99 70th 99 95th 99 15th 99 93th and 99 12th 99 87th percentiles respectively the appropriate thresholds detected by gof metrics method are slightly larger than graphical method most of the previous studies using the pot approach were employed a single threshold value to extract the extreme event series such as 90th percentile ammar et al 2020 agilan et al 2021 95th percentile vittal et al 2013 and 98th percentile ragno et al 2019 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2020 according to the results of uncertainty effects low threshold value would underestimate the return level of extreme event in fact the selection of threshold u is a trade off between tail asymptotics of extreme event and bias of parameter estimation underlying the gp distribution high threshold value ensures the samples to be extreme but reduces the sample size of extreme events thus increasing the variance of parameter estimation the results demonstrate that pre process of threshold detection is necessary to reliable modeling of hydrometeorological extreme events 5 conclusions in this study a factorial extreme value analysis feva method has been developed through integrating four eess four snas and two pes into a mixed level factorial experiment framework feva can identify main factors that influence the quantile estimatiosn of hydrometeorological extremes under uncertainty and can also quantify their interactive effects on the extreme values feva has been demonstrated through its application to central asia for analyzing the effects of multiple uncertainty sources i e ees sna and pe on precipitation and temperature extremes i e pmax tmax and tmin using data from 32 long term 1881 2018 observation stations based on 32 scenario analyses results disclose that 1 central asia is characterized with arid and semi arid climates where the return levels of pmax tmax and tmin under 50 year return period are occurred in 34 35 80 07 mm 39 61 47 81 c and 20 84 47 79 c respectively the increases of precipitation and temperature extremes were observed over the past one hundred years and minimum temperature extreme generally increases faster than maximum temperature extreme 2 the most important factor that influences the return levels risk of occurrence of pmax tmax and tmin is ees with average contribution of 32 9 47 0 and 53 5 respectively the return levels of precipitation and temperature extremes trend to increase with the increase of threshold u in the pot extreme series 3 the second important facts are sna 13 8 for pmax pe 29 2 for tmax and pe 29 8 for tmin 4 the interactions are pe ees 17 8 pe sna 13 6 ees sna 9 9 for pmax pe ees 9 5 ees sna 4 5 pe sna 1 9 for tmax and pe ees 4 5 ees sna 4 4 pe sna 2 2 for tmin indicating that pe and ees have obvious interactive effects on quantile estimation of hydrometeorological extremes 5 bayesian approach with mcmc show more robust parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification than mle when the parameters of underlying distribution estimated by bayesian estimation the estimated return levels of pmax tmax and tmin as well as the effects of ees and sna are larger than mle 6 the interaction between ees and sna is due to the reason that extreme series sampled from different threshold u would yield the different degree of non stationary the dominant role of ees is mainly attributed to the threshold selection in pot approach which has significant effects on risk assessment of hydrometeorological extremes thus the graphical and gof metrics methods have been employed to detect the appropriate threshold in the pot based model of precipitation and temperature extremes results disclose that the appropriate threshold values for pmax tmax and tmin in central asia are 11 57 37 63 mm 34 15 44 46 c and 40 07 10 83 c respectively which are larger than 99th percentile of station observation the pre process of threshold detection is necessary to reliable modeling of hydrometeorological extreme event the findings are helpful for researchers to formulate effective methodological combinations and improve the simulation and prediction accuracy of

3532,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas contamination is ubiquitous and likely co exist with hydrocarbon surfactants in the subsurface environment the transport of pfas in unsaturated porous media quartz sand packed columns with an anionic hydrocarbon surfactant was investigated using perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs as representative pfas and hydrocarbon surfactant at 1 5 and 30 mm nacl respectively our results show that sdbs inhibited the retardation of pfoa during transport the degree of the inhibited retardation was more significant at higher concentration of sdbs c sdbs for a given concentration of pfoa c pfoa and higher ionic strength in contrast pfoa only marginally affected the transport of sdbs under all tested conditions this is mainly due to the greater surface activity of sdbs with respect to pfoa favoring the competitive preferential adsorption of sdbs at the air water interface and then the transport of pfoa in the unsaturated sand this assumption is further supported by the greater air water adsorption coefficient kai and surface excess γ for sdbs than those for pfoa as well as the surface tension isotherms that fairly weighted toward to sdbs in the binary pfoa sdbs system our findings indicate the critical role of anionic hydrocarbon surfactant in retarding pfoa transport in unsaturated zone this should be considered when assessing the transport potential and environmental risk and developing remedial strategies of pfas in the subsurface environment keywords perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa anionic hydrocarbon surfactant transport unsaturated porous media 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of synthetic organofluorine surfactants that have been produced and released to the environment for over 50 years strong carbon fluorine bonds make pfas recalcitrant to conventional treatment techniques and thus be ubiquitous and persistent in subsurface environment houtz et al 2013 xu et al 2021 concern about pfas has increased recently as growing data suggest that pfas exposure is likely associated with adiposity in children preterm birth and impairment of immune system guillette et al 2020 liu et al 2020 nian et al 2020 ojo et al 2021 the u s environmental protection agency epa has issued a health advisory level for two common pfas of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in drinking water at 70 ng l combined epa 2016 however highly elevated pfas concentrations up to 5 300 µg l have been reported in global groundwater systems chen et al 2018 houtz et al 2013 liu et al 2018 nickerson et al 2020 as groundwater meets drinking water needs for over 50 of the world s population statistics 2010 understanding pfas transport in subsurface environment is essential for both human health protection and remediation strategies development the unique hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties make pfas to be retained at the air water interface costanza et al 2019 schaefer et al 2019 many field studies have documented that the unsaturated zone is an important sink of pfas and can serve as a long term source of groundwater contamination weber et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 prediction of the resulting risk of pfas presenting to deep groundwater and nearby living organisms relies on a thorough understanding of their transport potential in the unsaturated zone however our current knowledge on pfas transport in unsaturated zone is still in the infancy findings from limited studies have shown that compared to the solid water interface the adsorption of pfas at the air water interface is of greater importance for controlling their transport in the unsaturated zone li et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 yan et al 2020 pfas e g pfoa and genx exhibited negligible or a small degree of retardation in saturated sand and soil but greater retardation under unsaturated conditions due to the impact of the air water interface li et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 yan et al 2020 lower water content smaller grain size and rougher medium surface significantly enhance the retardation of pfoa during transport in unsaturated quartz sand due to the greater air water interfacial areas lyu et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 additionally lower pfoa concentration higher ionic strength and in the presence of divalent ca2 vs monovalent na can result in a higher interfacial sorption capacity to strongly enhance pfoa retardation under unsaturated conditions li et al 2021 lyu and brusseau 2020 lyu et al 2018 while these existing studies provide some insights on how environmental parameters affect pfas transport a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing pfas transport in complex unsaturated zone is highly urgent recently co contamination of hydrocarbon surfactants and pfas in the subsurface environment has garnered increasing concern garcia et al 2019 guelfo and higgins 2013 high concentrations of hydrocarbon surfactants in sewage effluent up to 20 70 mg l discharged to groundwater krueger et al 1998 matthijs et al 1999 wang et al 2014 along with sewage sludge up to 19 25 mg kg carlsen et al 2002 leached to soils may coexist with the released pfas gros et al 2017 in the subsurface system in many aqueous film forming foams afffs impacted sites various classes of anionic hydrocarbon surfactants e g linear alkyl benzene sulfonate and pfas were sequentially identified in groundwater due to the high content of hydrocarbon surfactants 5 10 and pfas 0 9 5 in afffs d agostino and mabury 2014 garcia et al 2019 pabon and corpart 2002 schultz et al 2004 vecitis et al 2010 as the nature of surfactants both pfas and anionic hydrocarbon surfactants tend to accumulate at the air water interface it is thus critical to consider the surface performance and interfacial interactions between pfas and anionic hydrocarbon surfactants when they co exist in the unsaturated zone moreover several studies have reported that anionic hydrocarbon surfactants can strongly increase the critical micelle concentration cmc for both pfoa and pfos suggesting their strong perturbation on the surface activity of pfas in the mixed system brusseau and van glubt 2019 matsuki et al 1992 mukerjee and yang 1976 this raises the question as to whether and to what extent anionic hydrocarbon surfactants mediate the transport behavior of pfas in unsaturated zone unfortunately to date there are few studies addressing this issue this research was designed to investigate the transport behavior of pfas in the presence of anionic hydrocarbon surfactant in unsaturated porous media pfoa and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs were used as a representative pfas and anionic hydrocarbon surfactant due to their ubiquity and high concentrations detected in the environment jensen 1999 xiao et al 2015 ying 2006 laboratory column experiments were conducted with various input concentrations of pfoa c pfoa and sdbs c sdbs and ionic strengths in both saturated and unsaturated quartz sand surface tensions for individual pfoa and sdbs solution as well as the binary pfoa sdbs mixture were measured and analyzed to assess the interfacial adsorption performance the underlying mechanisms of how sdbs influences pfoa transport under unsaturated conditions were then proposed and elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials radioactively labeled pfoa 1 14c 14c pfoa was purchased from american radiolabeled chemicals inc st louis mo usa with a specific radioactivity of 2 035 gbq mm 99 radiochemical purity non labeled pfoa cas 335 67 1 96 purity was purchased from the kmf laborchemie handels gmbh germany sdbs cas 25155 30 0 analytical reagent was purchased from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china the basic physicochemical properties of pfoa and sdbs are summarized in table s1 for column experiments 14c pfoa solutions were prepared by adding 155 μl of 14c pfoa stock solution 9 50 kbq ml and 0 14 1 67 and 17 ml of unlabeled pfoa stock solutions 10 mg l to 250 ml of deionized di water to obtain final concentrations of 0 0068 0 068 and 0 68 mg l at two ionic strengths 1 5 and 30 mm nacl table 1 to test the effect of surfactants on pfoa transport sdbs was added to 14c pfoa solutions at initial concentrations of 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 mg l at a c pfoa to c sdbs ratio of 1 1 47 and 1 14 7 respectively table 1 the concentrations of pfoa and sdbs used in this study were all below their cmc values pfoa 37 9 mm sdbs 2 66 mm table s1 yang et al 2015 yu et al 2009 the reasons for selecting the concentrations and ratios for pfoa and sdbs are shown in s1 to measure the surface tension individual pfoa and sdbs solution at various concentrations and pfoa sdbs mixed solutions with the identical ratios to the transport experiments c pfoa c sdbs 1 1 47 or 1 14 7 were prepared using non labeled pfoa 200 mg l and sdbs stock solution 1 g l a 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution was used to adjust solution ph to 6 0 0 1 which is within the range of the reported groundwater ph values 4 26 9 5 in the natural environment karhu and kortelainen 2009 nath et al 2021 the change in ionic strength by adding hcl or naoh for ph adjustment was negligible as one of the most common cations in groundwater na was chosen as representative cation the ionic strength was controlled by adding 0 5 m stock solution of nacl lyu and brusseau 2020 lyu et al 2018 wu et al 2016 quartz sand is one of the most representative porous media in subsurface environment and was widely used to study pollutants transport in porous media brusseau et al 2021 kasel et al 2013 lyu et al 2018 van glubt and brusseau 2021 the quartz sand unimin corporation mn usa with a size range of 0 30 0 38 mm was utilized in this study prior to use the sand was sequentially treated by tap water 10 nitric acid v v and di water to remove metal oxide and other impurities tian et al 2011 it was then dried overnight at 90 c and stored under vacuum for later use 2 2 column experiments column experiments were conducted in duplicate to quadruplicate following the methods used in many previous studies li et al 2021 liu et al 2013 tian et al 2012 tian et al 2011 briefly a polypropylene column with 2 5 cm in inner diameter and 16 7 cm in length was used with 100 mesh stainless steel screens on both ends to support the sand and ensure uniform flow fisher power and cheng 2018 kasel et al 2013 tian et al 2011 six vent holes were drilled on opposite sides at 3 7 5 and 12 cm from the top of the vertically oriented column to allow air to enter under unsaturated conditions to pack a saturated sand column cleaned quartz sand was wet packed into the column with porosity and bulk density of 0 35 0 36 and 1 67 1 68 g cm3 respectively to prepare for an unsaturated transport experiment the initially saturated column was drained by elevating the outflow rate 5 higher than the inflow rate to reach a target water saturation s w of 0 63 0 64 tian et al 2011 previous studies have demonstrated that this method can maintain spatially uniform and steady moisture content and capillary pressure head during the experiment gao et al 2004 lenhart and saiers 2002 detailed information about column preparations can be found in the previous studies li et al 2021 tian et al 2011 nonreactive tracer 20 mg l kno3 was applied to the columns prior to the pfoa transport experiments with detailed procedures described in s2 feriancikova and xu 2012 li et al 2021 the experimental and fitted results suggested the columns were well packed with no significant preferential flow or presence of non flow domains figure s1 afterwards the columns were pre equilibrated by injecting 10 pore volumes pvs of background solution at the desired ionic strength approximately 4 6 pvs of individual 14c pfoa sdbs or a mixture of 14c pfoa and sdbs solution were then introduced to the top of the column followed by several pvs of background solution the solutions were injected at a flow rate of 1 ml min equivalent to a mean pore water velocity of 34 4 cm h for saturated columns and 54 2 cm h for unsaturated columns the flow rate was widely used to examine the transport of pollutants in subsurface environment in the literature brusseau et al 2019 cornelis et al 2013 yan et al 2020 effluent samples were continuously collected at a regular time interval 6 min using a fraction collector bs 100a puyang scientific instrument research institute china sdbs concentration in the effluents was determined by a uv 2000 spectrophotometer unico instrument co ltd china at the wavelength of 223 6 nm rao and he 2006 and the presence of pfoa in the effluents was found to have a negligible impact on sdbs measurement under the tested c pfoa and c sdbs values s3 and table s2 the r 2 value greater than 0 9998 from the calibration curve suggests that absorbance can be directly correlated to sdbs concentration figure s2 subsequently the effluents were well mixed with scintillation cocktail gold star multipurpose meridian biotechnologies ltd uk of the same volume and then measured on a liquid scintillation counter lsc ls6500 beckman coulter usa to determine the concentrations of pfoa the limits of detection lod and the limit of quantification loq were 0 0577 and 0 159 µg l for 14c pfoa and 0 03 and 0 11 mg l for sdbs in this study s4 2 3 aqueous surface tension measurement surface tensions were determined to describe surface activity schaefer et al 2019 the surface tensions of the aqueous solution under different ionic strength conditions were measured on an optical contact angle analyzer with contour analysis system oca 30 dataphysics germany which was widely used in previous studies berry et al 2015 hoorfar et al 2005 saad et al 2011 the measurements were repeated in an hour until the measured tension deviated within 1 across three consecutive measurements silva et al 2019 details of the method are described in the supporting information s5 2 4 data analysis the retardation factor r f of pfoa sdbs was determined by moment

that have been shown to provide a good interpretation of pfas retardation in unsaturated porous media under various conditions brusseau et al 2021 costanza et al 2019 li et al 2021 lyu et al 2018 yan

sdbs at the targeted ionic strength mn m and a and b are fitted parameters the szyszkowski equation was fitted to the data utilizing the origin software and the total squared errors between the

the target concentration with equation 3 and 4 statistically significant difference was performed using the one way analysis of variance anova by the spss 25 0 probabilities lower to 0 05 p 0 05 were considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport behaviors of pfoa and sdbs 3 1 1 significant effects of sdbs on pfoa transport fig 1 and fig 2 present the btcs of pfoa 0 0068 0 68 mg l in saturated and unsaturated quartz sand in the absence and presence of sdbs 0 10 mg l under two ionic strength conditions 1 5 and 30 mm nacl under saturated conditions the btcs of pfoa with without presence of sdbs were identical to those of the tracer transport fig 1 exhibiting sharp arrival and elution waves with retardation factors around 1 table s3 this indicates the negligible adsorption of pfoa on quartz sand surface i e sand water interface consistent with our previous studies li et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 and also shows the negligible impact of sdbs on pfoa transport in saturated sand columns in contrast a striking observation was that although the effluent recoveries all exceeded 97 46 0 99 table 1 the presence of sdbs inhibited the retardation of pfoa in the unsaturated columns fig 2 at a given c pfoa fig 2a b 0 0068 mg l fig 2c d 0 068 mg l fig 2e f 0 68 mg l increasing c sdbs resulted in greater shift of pfoa btcs to the left under both ionic strengths for instance when c pfoa was 0 068 mg l fig 2c d increasing c sdbs 0 1 mg l caused the peaks of btcs reduced from 5 78 to 2 65 pv at 1 5 mm nacl fig 2c and from 6 04 to 4 79 pv at 30 mm nacl fig 2d respectively the resultant retardation factors for pfoa significantly decreased from 2 66 0 09 to 1 49 0 22 at 1 5 mm nacl table 1 nos 7 9 and 4 15 0 22 to 2 97 0 44 at 30 mm nacl table 1 nos 10 12 p 0 05 these results indicated that sdbs may compete with pfoa for the limited sorption sites at the air water interfaces in the columns considering the anionic surfactant nature of pfoa and sdbs they both prefer to accumulate at the air water interface the repulsive interaction between both negatively charged headgroups of pfoa and sdbs in mixed monolayers may cause a sorption competition for the finite air water interfacial areas in the columns this could be the major contributor to the retardation inhibition effect of pfoa mediated by sdbs similar competitive adsorption of surfactants at the air water interface was also reported previously based on surface tension measurements fainerman et al 2020 parra et al 2020 silva et al 2021 tucker et al 2020 note that concentrations of pfoa in the effluent greatly exceeded the influent concentrations at the c pfoa to c sdbs ratio of 1 14 7 i e low c pfoa and high c sdbs fig 2 this is commonly referred as effluent concentration overshooting which has been well exemplified in a multicomponent flow through column system figueira et al 2000 kratochvil and volesky 2000 montalvo and smolders 2019 tsang and lo 2006 the overshooting of pfoa can be explained by competitive ion exchange whereby the high affinity sdbs caused desorption or displacement of the low affinity pfoa which had previously sorbed at the air water interface leading to normalized effluent concentrations greater than unity similar results have been also reported in columns receiving multi metal mixture solutions montalvo and smolders 2019 tsang and lo 2006 additionally the blocking effect induced by previously adsorbed sdbs at the air water interface may also lead to the overshooting it was worth noting that even at a same c pfoa to c sdbs ratio the effect of sdbs on pfoa transport can be different depending on the absolute values of c pfoa and c sdbs fig 2 fig 2a c and e or fig 2b d and f compare the btcs for pfoa in the presence of sdbs at c pfoa c sdbs 1 1 47 or 1 14 7 to those for pfoa alone at three different c pfoa and c sdbs values at 1 5 mm nacl the ability of sdbs to inhibit pfoa retardation had no obvious correlation with the absolute values of c pfoa and c sdbs fig 2a c and e however the ability of sdbs to inhibit pfoa retardation was stronger at higher c pfoa and c sdbs at 30 mm nacl fig 2b d and f table s4 shows the decrease in retardation factor for pfoa in the presence of sdbs at c pfoa c sdbs 1 1 47 than pfoa alone δ rf 1 and at c pfoa c sdbs 1 14 7 than pfoa alone δ rf 2 for three different c pfoa values greater c pfoa was generally found to correspond to greater δ rf 1 and δ rf 2 values at 30 mm nacl indicating higher degrees of change in pfoa retardation at higher c pfoa and c sdbs this was likely because mixed surfactants only form a compact monolayer at the air water interface rosen 2004 the interfacial sorption sites in the columns could be sufficient for the adsorption at lower c pfoa and c sdbs values and then inhibit the interfacial competition but may not be enough for the adsorption at higher c pfoa and c sdbs values which thus facilitated the interfacial competition between sdbs and pfoa as mentioned above the inhibition effect of sdbs on pfoa transport differed at two ionic strengths fig 2a c e 1 5 mm nacl fig 2b d f 30 mm nacl the retardation inhibition effect of sdbs was greater at higher ionic strength under almost all tested c pfoa values table s4 also compares the increase in retardation factor for pfoa with elevated c sdbs δ rf 1 and δ rf 2 at the two ionic strengths except for the δ rf2 for c pfoa 0 0068 mg l the values of δ rf 1 and δ rf 2 at 1 5 mm nacl were both smaller than those at 30 mm nacl under all three c pfoa conditions table s4 as higher ionic strength induced greater air water interfacial activity for ionic surfactant costanza et al 2019 li et al 2021 silva et al 2019 the interfacial sorption capacity for pfoa and sdbs can both increase with increasing ionic strength it was likely that greater discrepancy in interfacial sorption capacity between pfoa and sdbs occurred at higher ionic strength this can favor the competitive preferential adsorption of sdbs at the limited air water interfaces which then accelerated the transport of pfoa in the columns 3 1 2 marginal effects of pfoa on sdbs transport to reveal the mechanisms on how sdbs affects pfoa transport sdbs concentrations in the effluent under selected experimental conditions c pfoa 0 068 or 0 68 mg l c sdbs 1 or 10 mg l ionic strength 1 5 or 30 mm nacl were also measured table s5 nos 2 3 5 6 8 and 10 besides the transport of individual sdbs at the same c sdbs values and unsaturated condition was examined as control experiments table s5 nos 1 4 7 and 9 the btcs of sdbs in the absence and presence of pfoa were shown in fig 3 notably in contrast to the pronounced influence of sdbs on pfoa retardation as discussed above pfoa had no significant effect on sdbs retardation under all tested conditions p 0 05 fig 3 and table s5 this was likely linked to the distinct difference in air water interfacial activity between pfoa and sdbs i e potentially greater surface activity of sdbs than pfoa competitive adsorption of the various components at the air water interface occurred according to their individual surface activities silva et al 2021 it is thus difficult for pfoa to compete with sdbs for air water interfacial areas conversely sdbs can compete with pfoa and substitute the previously absorbed pfoa as described in section 3 1 1 the competitive adsorption and preferential adsorption of the more surface active pfas component at the air water interface was also reported in the binary and ternary pfas mixtures silva et al 2021 vecitis et al 2008 3 2 surface tension isotherms to further understand the underlying mechanism for sdbs affecting pfoa transport in unsaturated sand media surface tensions for individual pfoa and sdbs at 1 5 and 30 mm nacl and binary mixed solution at 1 5 mm nacl were systematically measured the values of k ai and γ for pfoa and sdbs were determined with the local slope by fitting measured surface tension data using the szyszkowski equation costanza et al 2019 szyszkowski 1908 3 2 1 surface tension isotherms for individual pfoa and sdbs fig 4 presents the measured and fitted surface tension curve for individual pfoa and sdbs in solutions under 1 5 and 30 mm nacl a lower surface tension was observed for sdbs than pfoa at concentration greater than 1 mg l under both ionic strengths the disparity is due to the difference in molecular weights of cf2 versus ch2 groups resulting in longer tails for surfactants containing ch2 groups than those of comparable molecular weight containing only cf2 groups brusseau 2019 sdbs thus exhibited much greater surface activity than pfoa due to its much longer tail similar lower surface tension of sdbs versus pfoa pfos was observed in a synthetic groundwater previously brusseau 2021 brusseau and van glubt 2019 the estimated k ai and γ for individual pfoa and sdbs at concentrations used in the column studies c pfoa 0 0068 0 68 mg l c sdbs 0 01 10 mg l and supplemental concentration values c sdbs 0 01 10 mg l c pfoa 0 0068 0 68 mg l were estimated and presented in table 2 and table s6 respectively k ai and γ values for sdbs were respectively 2 91 10 3 9 50 10 3 cm and 2 05 10 4 8 39 10 1 mg m2 greater than the values of 1 27 10 3 7 71 10 3 cm and 1 31 10 4 3 31 10 1 mg m2 for pfoa in the overall concentration range of 0 0068 10 mg l table 2 and table s6 also note that γ and k ai values for sdbs were higher than those for pfoa at both c pfoa to c sdbs ratios applied in the column experiments these findings clearly suggest that sdbs has a more profound surface activity than pfoa which can outperform pfoa for the limited interfacial areas and thus contribute to the inhibition retardation for pfoa this was consistent with the results of silva et al 2021 who found that competitive adsorption at the air water interface was dominated by the adsorption of perfluodecanoic acid pfda vs pfoa as the most surface active component however zhao et al 1984 found na pfoa exhibited much higher surface activity than another anionic hydrocarbon surfactant sodium decylsulfate and would be adsorbed preferentially at the air water interface this indicated that the transport behavior of binary mixed solution depended on the relative values in surface activity of pfoa and anionic hydrocarbon surfactants the air water interfacial activity for pfoa and sdbs has a same variation trend in response to the changes in ionic strength increasing ionic strength led to a decrease in surface tension for both pfoa and sdbs and k ai and γ values at 30 mm nacl were much greater comparing to those at 1 5 mm nacl fig 4 and table 2 similar trends for pfoa and other surfactants have also been reported previously brusseau and van glubt 2019 li et al 2021 psillakis et al 2009 however it should be noted that the discrepancy in kai between pfoa and sdbs at 1 5 δ kai1 was smaller than that at 30 mm nacl δ kai2 table s7 the result clearly illustrates a greater discrepancy in surface activity between pfoa and sdbs at higher ionic strength the competitive effect of sdbs on pfoa interfacial sorption is thus more significant and hence caused a greater inhibition on pfoa retardation at higher ionic strength fig 2 similarly although not focusing on the changes of solution chemistry silva et al 2021 found pfas mixture components with greater difference in surface activity exhibited a more significant competitive air water interfacial adsorption therefore difference in surface activity of the mixture influenced by for example change of solution chemistry condition or surfactant type is the key factor controlling the transport of pfoa in the unsaturated zone future research is needed to further verify the key role of surface activity on the transport of pfas under other environmentally relevant conditions e g different pfas mixtures concentrations ph values etc 3 2 2 surface tension isotherms for binary pfoa and sdbs mixture surface tensions for binary pfoa and sdbs mixture in 1 5 mm nacl solution are shown in fig 5 the surface tension isotherms for pfoa sdbs mixtures are positioned within the bounds of the mono component isotherms demonstrating a lack of synergistic adsorption at the air water interface this stems from the electrostatic repulsion between both negatively charged headgroups of pfoa and sdbs brusseau and van glubt 2019 moreover the positioning of the mixture isotherms is fairly weighted toward sdbs at both ratios 1 1 47 and 1 14 7 this demonstrates that sdbs which has greater surface activity than pfoa dominated the air water interfacial activity and also the interfacial sorption of the binary mixed system hence sdbs outcompeted pfoa for the limited air water interfacial areas thereby largely inhibited the interfacial adsorption of pfoa this is the underlying cause for the significant impact of sdbs on pfoa transport but negligible impact of pfoa on sdbs transport our results were consistent with the findings in previous studies which found pfda pfos with greater surface activity controlled the surface activity of the mixed system for pfda pfos and pfoa based on surface tension measurements brusseau and van glubt 2019 silva et al 2021 vecitis et al 2008 4 conclusions our findings indicate that the presence of sdbs inhibited the retardation of pfoa during transport in the unsaturated sand porous media especially under higher c pfoa and c sdbs and higher ionic strength conditions the presence of sdbs did not affect the adsorption of pfoa at the sand water interfaces but strongly affected the adsorption of pfoa at the air water interfaces it was further supported by the analysis of surface tension data which demonstrates a more profound surface activity of sdbs than pfoa this results in the competitive and preferential adsorption of sdbs at the air water interfaces limiting the adsorption of pfoa and accelerating pfoa transport under the unsaturated environment this work provides new information on the fate and transport of pfas in unsaturated zone mediated by anionic hydrocarbon surfactants which is important to the design and implementation of effective strategies for managing and treating pfas impacted matrices with presence of cosolvents credit authorship contribution statement xueyan lyu writing original draft

3532,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas contamination is ubiquitous and likely co exist with hydrocarbon surfactants in the subsurface environment the transport of pfas in unsaturated porous media quartz sand packed columns with an anionic hydrocarbon surfactant was investigated using perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs as representative pfas and hydrocarbon surfactant at 1 5 and 30 mm nacl respectively our results show that sdbs inhibited the retardation of pfoa during transport the degree of the inhibited retardation was more significant at higher concentration of sdbs c sdbs for a given concentration of pfoa c pfoa and higher ionic strength in contrast pfoa only marginally affected the transport of sdbs under all tested conditions this is mainly due to the greater surface activity of sdbs with respect to pfoa favoring the competitive preferential adsorption of sdbs at the air water interface and then the transport of pfoa in the unsaturated sand this assumption is further supported by the greater air water adsorption coefficient kai and surface excess γ for sdbs than those for pfoa as well as the surface tension isotherms that fairly weighted toward to sdbs in the binary pfoa sdbs system our findings indicate the critical role of anionic hydrocarbon surfactant in retarding pfoa transport in unsaturated zone this should be considered when assessing the transport potential and environmental risk and developing remedial strategies of pfas in the subsurface environment keywords perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa anionic hydrocarbon surfactant transport unsaturated porous media 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of synthetic organofluorine surfactants that have been produced and released to the environment for over 50 years strong carbon fluorine bonds make pfas recalcitrant to conventional treatment techniques and thus be ubiquitous and persistent in subsurface environment houtz et al 2013 xu et al 2021 concern about pfas has increased recently as growing data suggest that pfas exposure is likely associated with adiposity in children preterm birth and impairment of immune system guillette et al 2020 liu et al 2020 nian et al 2020 ojo et al 2021 the u s environmental protection agency epa has issued a health advisory level for two common pfas of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in drinking water at 70 ng l combined epa 2016 however highly elevated pfas concentrations up to 5 300 µg l have been reported in global groundwater systems chen et al 2018 houtz et al 2013 liu et al 2018 nickerson et al 2020 as groundwater meets drinking water needs for over 50 of the world s population statistics 2010 understanding pfas transport in subsurface environment is essential for both human health protection and remediation strategies development the unique hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties make pfas to be retained at the air water interface costanza et al 2019 schaefer et al 2019 many field studies have documented that the unsaturated zone is an important sink of pfas and can serve as a long term source of groundwater contamination weber et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 prediction of the resulting risk of pfas presenting to deep groundwater and nearby living organisms relies on a thorough understanding of their transport potential in the unsaturated zone however our current knowledge on pfas transport in unsaturated zone is still in the infancy findings from limited studies have shown that compared to the solid water interface the adsorption of pfas at the air water interface is of greater importance for controlling their transport in the unsaturated zone li et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 yan et al 2020 pfas e g pfoa and genx exhibited negligible or a small degree of retardation in saturated sand and soil but greater retardation under unsaturated conditions due to the impact of the air water interface li et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 yan et al 2020 lower water content smaller grain size and rougher medium surface significantly enhance the retardation of pfoa during transport in unsaturated quartz sand due to the greater air water interfacial areas lyu et al 2020 lyu et al 2018 additionally lower pfoa concentration higher ionic strength and in the presence of divalent ca2 vs monovalent na can result in a higher interfacial sorption capacity to strongly enhance pfoa retardation under unsaturated conditions li et al 2021 lyu and brusseau 2020 lyu et al 2018 while these existing studies provide some insights on how environmental parameters affect pfas transport a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing pfas transport in complex unsaturated zone is highly urgent recently co contamination of hydrocarbon surfactants and pfas in the subsurface environment has garnered increasing concern garcia et al 2019 guelfo and higgins 2013 high concentrations of hydrocarbon surfactants in sewage effluent up to 20 70 mg l discharged to groundwater krueger et al 1998 matthijs et al 1999 wang et al 2014 along with sewage sludge up to 19 25 mg kg carlsen et al 2002 leached to soils may coexist with the released pfas gros et al 2017 in the subsurface system in many aqueous film forming foams afffs impacted sites various classes of anionic hydrocarbon surfactants e g linear alkyl benzene sulfonate and pfas were sequentially identified in groundwater due to the high content of hydrocarbon surfactants 5 10 and pfas 0 9 5 in afffs d agostino and mabury 2014 garcia et al 2019 pabon and corpart 2002 schultz et al 2004 vecitis et al 2010 as the nature of surfactants both pfas and anionic hydrocarbon surfactants tend to accumulate at the air water interface it is thus critical to consider the surface performance and interfacial interactions between pfas and anionic hydrocarbon surfactants when they co exist in the unsaturated zone moreover several studies have reported that anionic hydrocarbon surfactants can strongly increase the critical micelle concentration cmc for both pfoa and pfos suggesting their strong perturbation on the surface activity of pfas in the mixed system brusseau and van glubt 2019 matsuki et al 1992 mukerjee and yang 1976 this raises the question as to whether and to what extent anionic hydrocarbon surfactants mediate the transport behavior of pfas in unsaturated zone unfortunately to date there are few studies addressing this issue this research was designed to investigate the transport behavior of pfas in the presence of anionic hydrocarbon surfactant in unsaturated porous media pfoa and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs were used as a representative pfas and anionic hydrocarbon surfactant due to their ubiquity and high concentrations detected in the environment jensen 1999 xiao et al 2015 ying 2006 laboratory column experiments were conducted with various input concentrations of pfoa c pfoa and sdbs c sdbs and ionic strengths in both saturated and unsaturated quartz sand surface tensions for individual pfoa and sdbs solution as well as the binary pfoa sdbs mixture were measured and analyzed to assess the interfacial adsorption performance the underlying mechanisms of how sdbs influences pfoa transport under unsaturated conditions were then proposed and elucidated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials radioactively labeled pfoa 1 14c 14c pfoa was purchased from american radiolabeled chemicals inc st louis mo usa with a specific radioactivity of 2 035 gbq mm 99 radiochemical purity non labeled pfoa cas 335 67 1 96 purity was purchased from the kmf laborchemie handels gmbh germany sdbs cas 25155 30 0 analytical reagent was purchased from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china the basic physicochemical properties of pfoa and sdbs are summarized in table s1 for column experiments 14c pfoa solutions were prepared by adding 155 μl of 14c pfoa stock solution 9 50 kbq ml and 0 14 1 67 and 17 ml of unlabeled pfoa stock solutions 10 mg l to 250 ml of deionized di water to obtain final concentrations of 0 0068 0 068 and 0 68 mg l at two ionic strengths 1 5 and 30 mm nacl table 1 to test the effect of surfactants on pfoa transport sdbs was added to 14c pfoa solutions at initial concentrations of 0 01 0 1 1 and 10 mg l at a c pfoa to c sdbs ratio of 1 1 47 and 1 14 7 respectively table 1 the concentrations of pfoa and sdbs used in this study were all below their cmc values pfoa 37 9 mm sdbs 2 66 mm table s1 yang et al 2015 yu et al 2009 the reasons for selecting the concentrations and ratios for pfoa and sdbs are shown in s1 to measure the surface tension individual pfoa and sdbs solution at various concentrations and pfoa sdbs mixed solutions with the identical ratios to the transport experiments c pfoa c sdbs 1 1 47 or 1 14 7 were prepared using non labeled pfoa 200 mg l and sdbs stock solution 1 g l a 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution was used to adjust solution ph to 6 0 0 1 which is within the range of the reported groundwater ph values 4 26 9 5 in the natural environment karhu and kortelainen 2009 nath et al 2021 the change in ionic strength by adding hcl or naoh for ph adjustment was negligible as one of the most common cations in groundwater na was chosen as representative cation the ionic strength was controlled by adding 0 5 m stock solution of nacl lyu and brusseau 2020 lyu et al 2018 wu et al 2016 quartz sand is one of the most representative porous media in subsurface environment and was widely used to study pollutants transport in porous media brusseau et al 2021 kasel et al 2013 lyu et al 2018 van glubt and brusseau 2021 the quartz sand unimin corporation mn usa with a size range of 0 30 0 38 mm was utilized in this study prior to use the sand was sequentially treated by tap water 10 nitric acid v v and di water to remove metal oxide and other impurities tian et al 2011 it was then dried overnight at 90 c and stored under vacuum for later use 2 2 column experiments column experiments were conducted in duplicate to quadruplicate following the methods used in many previous studies li et al 2021 liu et al 2013 tian et al 2012 tian et al 2011 briefly a polypropylene column with 2 5 cm in inner diameter and 16 7 cm in length was used with 100 mesh stainless steel screens on both ends to support the sand and ensure uniform flow fisher power and cheng 2018 kasel et al 2013 tian et al 2011 six vent holes were drilled on opposite sides at 3 7 5 and 12 cm from the top of the vertically oriented column to allow air to enter under unsaturated conditions to pack a saturated sand column cleaned quartz sand was wet packed into the column with porosity and bulk density of 0 35 0 36 and 1 67 1 68 g cm3 respectively to prepare for an unsaturated transport experiment the initially saturated column was drained by elevating the outflow rate 5 higher than the inflow rate to reach a target water saturation s w of 0 63 0 64 tian et al 2011 previous studies have demonstrated that this method can maintain spatially uniform and steady moisture content and capillary pressure head during the experiment gao et al 2004 lenhart and saiers 2002 detailed information about column preparations can be found in the previous studies li et al 2021 tian et al 2011 nonreactive tracer 20 mg l kno3 was applied to the columns prior to the pfoa transport experiments with detailed procedures described in s2 feriancikova and xu 2012 li et al 2021 the experimental and fitted results suggested the columns were well packed with no significant preferential flow or presence of non flow domains figure s1 afterwards the columns were pre equilibrated by injecting 10 pore volumes pvs of background solution at the desired ionic strength approximately 4 6 pvs of individual 14c pfoa sdbs or a mixture of 14c pfoa and sdbs solution were then introduced to the top of the column followed by several pvs of background solution the solutions were injected at a flow rate of 1 ml min equivalent to a mean pore water velocity of 34 4 cm h for saturated columns and 54 2 cm h for unsaturated columns the flow rate was widely used to examine the transport of pollutants in subsurface environment in the literature brusseau et al 2019 cornelis et al 2013 yan et al 2020 effluent samples were continuously collected at a regular time interval 6 min using a fraction collector bs 100a puyang scientific instrument research institute china sdbs concentration in the effluents was determined by a uv 2000 spectrophotometer unico instrument co ltd china at the wavelength of 223 6 nm rao and he 2006 and the presence of pfoa in the effluents was found to have a negligible impact on sdbs measurement under the tested c pfoa and c sdbs values s3 and table s2 the r 2 value greater than 0 9998 from the calibration curve suggests that absorbance can be directly correlated to sdbs concentration figure s2 subsequently the effluents were well mixed with scintillation cocktail gold star multipurpose meridian biotechnologies ltd uk of the same volume and then measured on a liquid scintillation counter lsc ls6500 beckman coulter usa to determine the concentrations of pfoa the limits of detection lod and the limit of quantification loq were 0 0577 and 0 159 µg l for 14c pfoa and 0 03 and 0 11 mg l for sdbs in this study s4 2 3 aqueous surface tension measurement surface tensions were determined to describe surface activity schaefer et al 2019 the surface tensions of the aqueous solution under different ionic strength conditions were measured on an optical contact angle analyzer with contour analysis system oca 30 dataphysics germany which was widely used in previous studies berry et al 2015 hoorfar et al 2005 saad et al 2011 the measurements were repeated in an hour until the measured tension deviated within 1 across three consecutive measurements silva et al 2019 details of the method are described in the supporting information s5 2 4 data analysis the retardation factor r f of pfoa sdbs was determined by moment

that have been shown to provide a good interpretation of pfas retardation in unsaturated porous media under various conditions brusseau et al 2021 costanza et al 2019 li et al 2021 lyu et al 2018 yan

the target concentration with equation 3 and 4 statistically significant difference was performed using the one way analysis of variance anova by the spss 25 0 probabilities lower to 0 05 p 0 05 were considered as statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport behaviors of pfoa and sdbs 3 1 1 significant effects of sdbs on pfoa transport fig 1 and fig 2 present the btcs of pfoa 0 0068 0 68 mg l in saturated and unsaturated quartz sand in the absence and presence of sdbs 0 10 mg l under two ionic strength conditions 1 5 and 30 mm nacl under saturated conditions the btcs of pfoa with without presence of sdbs were identical to those of the tracer transport fig 1 exhibiting sharp arrival and elution waves with retardation factors around 1 table s3 this indicates the negligible adsorption of pfoa on quartz sand surface i e sand water interface consistent with our previous studies li et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 and also shows the negligible impact of sdbs on pfoa transport in saturated sand columns in contrast a striking observation was that although the effluent recoveries all exceeded 97 46 0 99 table 1 the presence of sdbs inhibited the retardation of pfoa in the unsaturated columns fig 2 at a given c pfoa fig 2a b 0 0068 mg l fig 2c d 0 068 mg l fig 2e f 0 68 mg l increasing c sdbs resulted in greater shift of pfoa btcs to the left under both ionic strengths for instance when c pfoa was 0 068 mg l fig 2c d increasing c sdbs 0 1 mg l caused the peaks of btcs reduced from 5 78 to 2 65 pv at 1 5 mm nacl fig 2c and from 6 04 to 4 79 pv at 30 mm nacl fig 2d respectively the resultant retardation factors for pfoa significantly decreased from 2 66 0 09 to 1 49 0 22 at 1 5 mm nacl table 1 nos 7 9 and 4 15 0 22 to 2 97 0 44 at 30 mm nacl table 1 nos 10 12 p 0 05 these results indicated that sdbs may compete with pfoa for the limited sorption sites at the air water interfaces in the columns considering the anionic surfactant nature of pfoa and sdbs they both prefer to accumulate at the air water interface the repulsive interaction between both negatively charged headgroups of pfoa and sdbs in mixed monolayers may cause a sorption competition for the finite air water interfacial areas in the columns this could be the major contributor to the retardation inhibition effect of pfoa mediated by sdbs similar competitive adsorption of surfactants at the air water interface was also reported previously based on surface tension measurements fainerman et al 2020 parra et al 2020 silva et al 2021 tucker et al 2020 note that concentrations of pfoa in the effluent greatly exceeded the influent concentrations at the c pfoa to c sdbs ratio of 1 14 7 i e low c pfoa and high c sdbs fig 2 this is commonly referred as effluent concentration overshooting which has been well exemplified in a multicomponent flow through column system figueira et al 2000 kratochvil and volesky 2000 montalvo and smolders 2019 tsang and lo 2006 the overshooting of pfoa can be explained by competitive ion exchange whereby the high affinity sdbs caused desorption or displacement of the low affinity pfoa which had previously sorbed at the air water interface leading to normalized effluent concentrations greater than unity similar results have been also reported in columns receiving multi metal mixture solutions montalvo and smolders 2019 tsang and lo 2006 additionally the blocking effect induced by previously adsorbed sdbs at the air water interface may also lead to the overshooting it was worth noting that even at a same c pfoa to c sdbs ratio the effect of sdbs on pfoa transport can be different depending on the absolute values of c pfoa and c sdbs fig 2 fig 2a c and e or fig 2b d and f compare the btcs for pfoa in the presence of sdbs at c pfoa c sdbs 1 1 47 or 1 14 7 to those for pfoa alone at three different c pfoa and c sdbs values at 1 5 mm nacl the ability of sdbs to inhibit pfoa retardation had no obvious correlation with the absolute values of c pfoa and c sdbs fig 2a c and e however the ability of sdbs to inhibit pfoa retardation was stronger at higher c pfoa and c sdbs at 30 mm nacl fig 2b d and f table s4 shows the decrease in retardation factor for pfoa in the presence of sdbs at c pfoa c sdbs 1 1 47 than pfoa alone δ rf 1 and at c pfoa c sdbs 1 14 7 than pfoa alone δ rf 2 for three different c pfoa values greater c pfoa was generally found to correspond to greater δ rf 1 and δ rf 2 values at 30 mm nacl indicating higher degrees of change in pfoa retardation at higher c pfoa and c sdbs this was likely because mixed surfactants only form a compact monolayer at the air water interface rosen 2004 the interfacial sorption sites in the columns could be sufficient for the adsorption at lower c pfoa and c sdbs values and then inhibit the interfacial competition but may not be enough for the adsorption at higher c pfoa and c sdbs values which thus facilitated the interfacial competition between sdbs and pfoa as mentioned above the inhibition effect of sdbs on pfoa transport differed at two ionic strengths fig 2a c e 1 5 mm nacl fig 2b d f 30 mm nacl the retardation inhibition effect of sdbs was greater at higher ionic strength under almost all tested c pfoa values table s4 also compares the increase in retardation factor for pfoa with elevated c sdbs δ rf 1 and δ rf 2 at the two ionic strengths except for the δ rf2 for c pfoa 0 0068 mg l the values of δ rf 1 and δ rf 2 at 1 5 mm nacl were both smaller than those at 30 mm nacl under all three c pfoa conditions table s4 as higher ionic strength induced greater air water interfacial activity for ionic surfactant costanza et al 2019 li et al 2021 silva et al 2019 the interfacial sorption capacity for pfoa and sdbs can both increase with increasing ionic strength it was likely that greater discrepancy in interfacial sorption capacity between pfoa and sdbs occurred at higher ionic strength this can favor the competitive preferential adsorption of sdbs at the limited air water interfaces which then accelerated the transport of pfoa in the columns 3 1 2 marginal effects of pfoa on sdbs transport to reveal the mechanisms on how sdbs affects pfoa transport sdbs concentrations in the effluent under selected experimental conditions c pfoa 0 068 or 0 68 mg l c sdbs 1 or 10 mg l ionic strength 1 5 or 30 mm nacl were also measured table s5 nos 2 3 5 6 8 and 10 besides the transport of individual sdbs at the same c sdbs values and unsaturated condition was examined as control experiments table s5 nos 1 4 7 and 9 the btcs of sdbs in the absence and presence of pfoa were shown in fig 3 notably in contrast to the pronounced influence of sdbs on pfoa retardation as discussed above pfoa had no significant effect on sdbs retardation under all tested conditions p 0 05 fig 3 and table s5 this was likely linked to the distinct difference in air water interfacial activity between pfoa and sdbs i e potentially greater surface activity of sdbs than pfoa competitive adsorption of the various components at the air water interface occurred according to their individual surface activities silva et al 2021 it is thus difficult for pfoa to compete with sdbs for air water interfacial areas conversely sdbs can compete with pfoa and substitute the previously absorbed pfoa as described in section 3 1 1 the competitive adsorption and preferential adsorption of the more surface active pfas component at the air water interface was also reported in the binary and ternary pfas mixtures silva et al 2021 vecitis et al 2008 3 2 surface tension isotherms to further understand the underlying mechanism for sdbs affecting pfoa transport in unsaturated sand media surface tensions for individual pfoa and sdbs at 1 5 and 30 mm nacl and binary mixed solution at 1 5 mm nacl were systematically measured the values of k ai and γ for pfoa and sdbs were determined with the local slope by fitting measured surface tension data using the szyszkowski equation costanza et al 2019 szyszkowski 1908 3 2 1 surface tension isotherms for individual pfoa and sdbs fig 4 presents the measured and fitted surface tension curve for individual pfoa and sdbs in solutions under 1 5 and 30 mm nacl a lower surface tension was observed for sdbs than pfoa at concentration greater than 1 mg l under both ionic strengths the disparity is due to the difference in molecular weights of cf2 versus ch2 groups resulting in longer tails for surfactants containing ch2 groups than those of comparable molecular weight containing only cf2 groups brusseau 2019 sdbs thus exhibited much greater surface activity than pfoa due to its much longer tail similar lower surface tension of sdbs versus pfoa pfos was observed in a synthetic groundwater previously brusseau 2021 brusseau and van glubt 2019 the estimated k ai and γ for individual pfoa and sdbs at concentrations used in the column studies c pfoa 0 0068 0 68 mg l c sdbs 0 01 10 mg l and supplemental concentration values c sdbs 0 01 10 mg l c pfoa 0 0068 0 68 mg l were estimated and presented in table 2 and table s6 respectively k ai and γ values for sdbs were respectively 2 91 10 3 9 50 10 3 cm and 2 05 10 4 8 39 10 1 mg m2 greater than the values of 1 27 10 3 7 71 10 3 cm and 1 31 10 4 3 31 10 1 mg m2 for pfoa in the overall concentration range of 0 0068 10 mg l table 2 and table s6 also note that γ and k ai values for sdbs were higher than those for pfoa at both c pfoa to c sdbs ratios applied in the column experiments these findings clearly suggest that sdbs has a more profound surface activity than pfoa which can outperform pfoa for the limited interfacial areas and thus contribute to the inhibition retardation for pfoa this was consistent with the results of silva et al 2021 who found that competitive adsorption at the air water interface was dominated by the adsorption of perfluodecanoic acid pfda vs pfoa as the most surface active component however zhao et al 1984 found na pfoa exhibited much higher surface activity than another anionic hydrocarbon surfactant sodium decylsulfate and would be adsorbed preferentially at the air water interface this indicated that the transport behavior of binary mixed solution depended on the relative values in surface activity of pfoa and anionic hydrocarbon surfactants the air water interfacial activity for pfoa and sdbs has a same variation trend in response to the changes in ionic strength increasing ionic strength led to a decrease in surface tension for both pfoa and sdbs and k ai and γ values at 30 mm nacl were much greater comparing to those at 1 5 mm nacl fig 4 and table 2 similar trends for pfoa and other surfactants have also been reported previously brusseau and van glubt 2019 li et al 2021 psillakis et al 2009 however it should be noted that the discrepancy in kai between pfoa and sdbs at 1 5 δ kai1 was smaller than that at 30 mm nacl δ kai2 table s7 the result clearly illustrates a greater discrepancy in surface activity between pfoa and sdbs at higher ionic strength the competitive effect of sdbs on pfoa interfacial sorption is thus more significant and hence caused a greater inhibition on pfoa retardation at higher ionic strength fig 2 similarly although not focusing on the changes of solution chemistry silva et al 2021 found pfas mixture components with greater difference in surface activity exhibited a more significant competitive air water interfacial adsorption therefore difference in surface activity of the mixture influenced by for example change of solution chemistry condition or surfactant type is the key factor controlling the transport of pfoa in the unsaturated zone future research is needed to further verify the key role of surface activity on the transport of pfas under other environmentally relevant conditions e g different pfas mixtures concentrations ph values etc 3 2 2 surface tension isotherms for binary pfoa and sdbs mixture surface tensions for binary pfoa and sdbs mixture in 1 5 mm nacl solution are shown in fig 5 the surface tension isotherms for pfoa sdbs mixtures are positioned within the bounds of the mono component isotherms demonstrating a lack of synergistic adsorption at the air water interface this stems from the electrostatic repulsion between both negatively charged headgroups of pfoa and sdbs brusseau and van glubt 2019 moreover the positioning of the mixture isotherms is fairly weighted toward sdbs at both ratios 1 1 47 and 1 14 7 this demonstrates that sdbs which has greater surface activity than pfoa dominated the air water interfacial activity and also the interfacial sorption of the binary mixed system hence sdbs outcompeted pfoa for the limited air water interfacial areas thereby largely inhibited the interfacial adsorption of pfoa this is the underlying cause for the significant impact of sdbs on pfoa transport but negligible impact of pfoa on sdbs transport our results were consistent with the findings in previous studies which found pfda pfos with greater surface activity controlled the surface activity of the mixed system for pfda pfos and pfoa based on surface tension measurements brusseau and van glubt 2019 silva et al 2021 vecitis et al 2008 4 conclusions our findings indicate that the presence of sdbs inhibited the retardation of pfoa during transport in the unsaturated sand porous media especially under higher c pfoa and c sdbs and higher ionic strength conditions the presence of sdbs did not affect the adsorption of pfoa at the sand water interfaces but strongly affected the adsorption of pfoa at the air water interfaces it was further supported by the analysis of surface tension data which demonstrates a more profound surface activity of sdbs than pfoa this results in the competitive and preferential adsorption of sdbs at the air water interfaces limiting the adsorption of pfoa and accelerating pfoa transport under the unsaturated environment this work provides new information on the fate and transport of pfas in unsaturated zone mediated by anionic hydrocarbon surfactants which is important to the design and implementation of effective strategies for managing and treating pfas impacted matrices with presence of cosolvents credit authorship contribution statement xueyan lyu writing original draft

3533,domestic water supply and agricultural irrigation are highly dependent on groundwater in beijing groundwater table gwt decline and ecological issues caused by groundwater overexploitation have been of growing concern however some positive measures such as groundwater extraction control improvement of water use efficiency and south to north water diversion middle route project snwdmrp have alleviated severe groundwater shortage situation in recent years therefore quantifying the contributions of different factors to the deceleration of groundwater table decline contributes to guide groundwater resources in this study in situ groundwater table data climate data and water use data were used to identify the deceleration and driving factors of gwt decline by comprehensively using water table fluctuation wtf method mann kendall mk trend test wavelet analysis methods and random forest regression rfr firstly the mk trend test evaluated the trend of the defined groundwater stress index gsi and groundwater table decline rate gtdr changes indicating the fact that gwt decline was decelerated during 1999 2018 then the wtf method combined with in situ groundwater level data and specific yield were used to derive the monthly groundwater storage anomalies gwsa which revealed a slight gws recovery in the past decade especially a significant increase of gws with a rate of 5 76 mm month since the operation of south to north water diversion middle route project snwdmrp wavelet analysis identified a correlation and coherence between gwsa and precipitation in the time frequency domain furthermore correlation analysis indicated that the deceleration of gwt decline may be attributed to climatic factors e g precipitation temperature the snwdmrp and water supply and use

industry and ecosystems sustaining the global water and food security groundwater accounts for 43 of water resources consumed for agricultural irrigation worldwide siebert et al 2010 more than two billion people in the world use groundwater as the main source of agriculture consumption voss et al 2009 climate change growing population and human activities have changed the distribution and reserves of groundwater resources wang and qin 2017 malekinezhad and banadkooki 2018 moreover groundwater is increasingly threatened by serious shortages caused by overexploitation in the future ojha et al 2015 china is facing a severe groundwater crisis more than 40 of irrigation coming from groundwater while in north and northwest china around 70 of drinking water depends on groundwater qiu 2010 the north china plain ncp is an important grain production base jeong et al 2014 the majority of water used for irrigation and drinking is supplied by groundwater zhao et al 2017 elevated demand for freshwater resources in rapid urbanization has led to groundwater overexploitation resulting in continuous groundwater depletion in ncp over the past few decades li et al 2014 beijing is a densely populated and water scarce megacity ye et al 2018 relying on groundwater for both domestic and agricultural water supply the annual available water resources are less than water demand especially during dry periods the balance of water supply and demand must be met through overexploitation of groundwater zhai et al 2012a which further aggravates groundwater shortage consequently groundwater table gwt continued to decline caused numerous geological and environmental problems e g land subsidence drying up of rivers and lakes and groundwater quality deterioration liu et al 2001 zheng et al 2010 guo et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 the factors influencing gwt include demand factor supply factor and loss factor and the demand factor has the greatest effect zhou et al 2016 which causes water scarcity to evaluate the scarcity of regional or global water resources and their relationship with socio economic development many studies have been conducted on water stress wada et al 2011a wada et al 2011b schlosser et al 2014 which can be used to explore the relationship between human water use and availability however some previous studies on water stress used only a single water resource data zhao et al 2020 and paid less attention to freshwater stored in aquifers which can create significant uncertainty in groundwater stress assessment two main methods were used in the evaluation of groundwater stress 1 quantifying the ratio of groundwater use to availability alcamo et al 1997 voss et al 2009 richey et al 2015 and defining this index as renewable groundwater stress alcamo et al 1997 richey et al 2015 in particular some studies have defined groundwater use as groundwater withdrawal including the return flow while groundwater availability is defined as groundwater recharge döll 2009 wada et al 2010 another indicator groundwater development stress is also defined according to the ratio of above two variables alley et al 2018 2 groundwater stress is expressed by a ratio of groundwater footprint to aquifer area and recycled portion of pumped groundwater and portion of available groundwater used for maintaining environmental flow are considered gleeson et al 2012 the calculation formula was given by q r e a gleeson and wada 2013 where q represents groundwater withdrawal r represents groundwater availability including surface water and groundwater irrigation return flow e represents groundwater for maintaining river ecology and a represents the aquifer area however this method is difficult to determine e thus the calculation of groundwater footprint index is not considered in this study groundwater stress helps to improve our understanding of gws changes among which grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite as an effective tool has been widely used to assess groundwater storage gws changes rodell et al 2007 scanlon et al 2012 evaluate groundwater drought index thomas et al 2017 and quantify groundwater stress richey et al 2015 evidence from grace estimated gws changes and identified groundwater depletion in ncp feng et al 2013 which may be attributed to climate variations human activities and relevant policies previous studies have evaluated the effects of different factors e g climate changes pumping and water diversion on gws changes using groundwater flow models or coupled groundwater surface models under specific physical mechanisms scibek et al 2007 li et al 2017 xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the wavelet analysis has been widely used to analyze the periodicity and correlations in hydrological and climatological time series data charlier et al 2015 huang et al 2016 ouyang et al 2017 and reveal the time and space phase frequency relationship between gws and climate factors charlier et al 2015 resende et al 2019 however some of the limitations associated with numerical simulation include the difficulty of obtaining various parameters and the uncertainty in parameters and conceptual model will bring challenges to simulation and accuracy rojas et al 2008 thus machine learning has inherent benefits of accurately identifying the contributions of different factors on gws sahoo et al 2017 smith and majumdar 2020 kayhomayoon et al 2021 random forest model is widely used in hydrometeorology and water resources and quantifying the influence of various factors on gwt gws with excellent accuracy scanlon et al 2012 smith and majumdar 2020 rfr has the following characteristics 1 excellent accuracy compared with other algorithms 2 processing high dimensional characteristics samples without dimensionality reduction 3 assessing the importance of various variables 4 the estimation of missing data and non equilibrium data is relatively robust which is praised as one of the best algorithms at present iverson et al 2008 in particular rfr can simultaneously evaluate the influence of different independent variables on dependent variables select important characteristic variables and rank the importance of independent variables rodriguez galiano et al 2014 rfr has been widely used in the potential of groundwater spring simulation of groundwater nitrogen pollution rodriguez galiano et al 2014 wheeler et al 2015 ouedraogo et al 2019 the south to north water diversion project was launched in 2002 to alleviate serious water shortage in northern china li et al 2016 the south to north water diversion middle route project snwdmrp diverts water from danjiangkou reservoir into beijing to alleviate beijing s water shortage researchers have studied the impact of snwdmrp on groundwater dynamics yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 due to the effect of snwdmrp groundwater extraction has been reduced and gwt has recovered to varying degrees zhang et al 2020 moreover snwdmrp has the effectiveness of stabilizing beijing s gwt and promoting gws recovery long et al 2020 this study quantitatively identified the effect of snwdmrp on gwt using random forest regression and discussed its impact on the sustainability of groundwater previous studies have mostly focused on the degree of water stress or gwt decline in beijing however few studies paid attention to the evaluation of groundwater resources stress which were usually included in water resources as a whole zhang et al 2012 cheng et al 2019 sun et al 2019 in view of the importance of groundwater in beijing it is essential to determine groundwater stress in addition prior studies focused on gws changes gong et al 2018 the factors influencing gwt decline li et al 2014 and a series of geological environmental problems in beijing however less attention has been paid to groundwater table decline rate gtdr undergoing gratifying changes and the causes of its alleviation it is worth noting that gwt has continued to rise since the operation of snwdmrp currently quantitative identification of the impact of climate human activities and related policies on gws changes is rarely reported this study was mainly aimed at quantitatively identifying the influencing factors of gwt in beijing using mathematical model based on machine learning three major questions have been addressed 1 according to the trend of newly defined two indicators changes gsi and gtdr that characterize the groundwater decline obtained by mk test and sen s slope gwt decline alleviation and gws recovery have been reported 2 using correlation analysis and wavelet analysis the influencing factors of the above indicators were analyzed and the driving factors behind gwt gwsa changes were identified 3 random forest regression rfr model quantitatively identified the influencing factors of gwt changes and evaluated the effect of snwdmrp on groundwater dynamics the research results have important implications for groundwater management in beijing and other similar areas 2 study area and data 2 1 study area beijing located in the north of the ncp is characterized by high in the northwest and low in the southeast in topography and has a warm temperature and semi humid continental monsoon climate the plain area is 20 60 m above sea level and covers an area of 6 338 km2 the average annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 800 mm mostly concentrated in june to september the natural river channel runs through five major water systems from west to east which are juma river yongding river beiyun river chaobai river and jiyun river fig 1 in recent decades the rapid growth of population and industrial development have greatly increased the water consumption which has exceeded the carrying capacity of water resources beijing has been undergoing the water quantity reduction and water quality deterioration issues groundwater is the main source of water supply however due to excessive exploitation of shallow and deep groundwater the average groundwater depth in beijing plain decreased from 14 21 m in 1999 to 24 92 m in 2010 in order to alleviate the water shortage and water quality deterioration issues the utilization of external water resources has been increased correspondingly the use of local water resources has been reduced over the past decade zhao et al 2020 the implementation of some measures such as the operation of snwdmrp the increased use of recycled water and environmental water as well as the increased investment in water conservancy facilities which alleviated the water shortage and the water quality deterioration to a certain extent the snwdmrp was operated in december 2014 starting from the drainage of danjiangkou reservoir and finally reaching beijing by the end of 2019 a total of 5 2 km3 water has been supplied to beijing and 70 has been used for water supply beijing water authority 2019 the operation of snwdmrp has fundamentally changed water supply pattern in beijing and has alleviated continued decline of gwt however the situation remains severe according to water resources bulletin the amount of water resources per capita in beijing in 2018 was 165 m3 beijing water authority 2018 which is only 1 12 of the national per capita water resources ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2018 the dynamic features and calculation results of groundwater balance in beijing indicated that the main recharge source of groundwater is atmospheric precipitation and the main discharge path is artificial exploitation zhou et al 2012 groundwater has been overexploited for a long time especially from 1999 to 2007 when rainfall was 400 mm in consecutive years and surface water resources were seriously insufficient groundwater played a significant role in water supply for domestic agriculture and industry zhang et al 2018 leading to serious groundwater overexploitation and continuous decrease of gwt after 2008 with an increase in precipitation and implementation of groundwater extraction control downward trend of gwt has eased in particular since the operation of snwdmrp in december 2014 gwt has been continuously rising and rising against the precipitation trend for the latter the precipitation has decreased from 2016 to 2018 but gwt has been rising against the trend 2 2 data source data e g climate data water resources

monthly scales beijing water authority 1999 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater stress index gsi in this study gsi was determined by the ratio of annual groundwater withdrawal to availability the groundwater withdrawal refers to groundwater use in different sectors e g agricultural industrial domestic ecological although partial irrigation return flow back into groundwater system in order to calculate the criticality ratio alcamo et al 1997 groundwater withdrawal rather than groundwater use the difference between withdrawal and return flow was used for calculating gsi additionally groundwater availability was defined as the groundwater resources involved in the process of water circulation replenished during the year alcamo et al 1997 specifically refers to the amount of precipitation and surface water recharge to aquifers including precipitation infiltration and infiltration of water bodies in rivers lake reservoirs canal systems canal irrigation fields the groundwater availability data comes from beijing water resources bulletin the calculation formula of gsi was given by 1 gsi g w withdrawal g w availability where gwwithdrawal refers to groundwater withdrawal in different sectors and gwavailability represents groundwater availability groundwater stress state was classified based on different ranges of gsi according to the classification standards of the united nations and some previous studies raskin et al 1997 shiklomanov 1997 groundwater is under high pressure state when gsi is greater than 0 4 3 2 groundwater storage anomaly estimation based on water table fluctuation method this study focuses on the renewable groundwater of the quaternary in the plain area groundwater storage gws changes were determined by specific zhai et al 2012a yield for the aquifer and groundwater table changes δgwt chinnasamy et al 2018 gws changes δgws was calculated according to water table fluctuation wtf method wang et al 2020 the formula was as follows 2 δ g w s δ g w t sy where δgws represents the monthly gws changes δgwt represents the monthly gwt changes s y is the equivalent specific yield of the aquifer supplementary information text s1 the gwt and gws as hydrological variables has significant seasonal characteristics to eliminate seasonal trends and better understand changes in monthly scale we calculated the monthly gwt anomalies gwta by 3 gwta i j gwt i j j i n gwt i j n where i represents the month j represents the year and n presents the number of total years considered in this study then gws anomalies gwsa were derived from in situ gwt data and specific yield of the aquifer 3 3 mann kendall mk trend test and sen s slope estimator the nonparametric mk test method mann 1945 kendall 1948 has been widely used to determine the trend of hydrological and meteorological data e g precipitation runoff groundwater dynamics with abnormal distribution bui et al 2012 mondal et al 2012 da silva et al 2015 for the time series data x x1 x2 xn and the test statistic s was calculated by 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x i x j where 5 sgn x j x i 1 x j x i 0 x j x i 1 x j x i where n represents the length of time series data x and different n corresponds to different selection of significance test statistics s a positive value of s indicates an increasing trend while negative of s indicates a decreasing trend n 10 the test statistic z was used to assess the trend for the data where length n greater than 10 and approximately conforms the standard normal distribution variance σ2 1 and mean μ 0 value which can be calculated by 6 z s 1 var s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s 0 where var represents the variance of s which was given by 7 var n n 1 2 n 5 t ft ft 1 2 ft 5 18 where n represents the length of time series data and ft represents the frequency of the data occurrence under the given significant level in bilateral trend test supposing the critical value of normal distribution is z1 α 2 when z z1 α 2 it implies that the data accepts the null hypothesis therefore the trend is not statistically significant otherwise when z z 1 α 2 the null hypothesis is invalid and the trend is statistically obvious in this study 95 confidence level z1 α 2 1 96 was used to mk trend test the mk test assumed that data are serially independent however hydrometeorological time series may have autocorrelation which will cause errors in trend test increasing the significance of data yue et al 2002 to eliminate the influence of autocorrelation prewhitening has been frequently used to eliminate autocorrelation in time series with a lag 1 autoregressive ar 1 process before mk test von storch and cannon 1995 yue and wang 2002 and the original time series xt was replaced with a new series by following formula 8 x t x t r 1 x t 1 where r1 represents the lag 1 serial correlation coefficient of time series new series xt does not have autocorrelation and was used for mk test sen s slope estimator is a non parametric method which was used to estimate the slope of data series trend by using a linear model and the calculation formula was sen 1968 9 β m e d i a n x j x i j i j i where xj and xi represent the sequence values at times of i and j sen s slope β is the median of the slope in this method trend degree β is used to identify whether the trend is increasing or decreasing there is an upward and downward trend when β is larger and smaller than 0 respectively in this study mk trend test and sen s slope estimator were carried out by r software version 3 3 1 3 4 random forest regression rfr random forest model proposed by breiman is an integrated algorithm composed of decision trees the basic unit is decision tree dt which can be divided into classification tree ct and regression tree rt to deal with classification and regression problems respectively breiman 2001 the bootstrap method was used to extract multiple samples from the original samples with replacement for dt modeling then combine these decision trees and take the average of all dt results as the final regression result the mathematical expression was given by 10 f x i 1 m t i x m where f x represents the response of the dependent variable which refers to gwt in this study ti represents a single dt and represents n dimensional input data of independent variables which refers to precipitation temperature agricultural water use domestic water use gsi and snwdmrp water supply random forest regression rfr model can be used to analyze the explanatory effects of multiple independent variables on dependent variable f x in this study the randomforest program package liaw and wiener 2002 of r software version 3 3 1 was used for rfr analysis and important characteristic variables were selected and the importance of each independent variable was determined given the feature of resampling by putting back of rfr and this study aims to determine the main factors affecting gwt and order their importance therefore the data set does not distinguish between training set and test set in order to highlight its advantages in gwt regression analysis comparison with multiple linear regression mlr was conducted to check its applicability and superiority 3 5 wavelet analysis methods wavelet analysis represents the local characteristics of time series data in time and frequency domain which was widely used to analyze the periodicity and correlations in hydrological and climatological time series data charlier et al 2015 huang et al 2016 ouyang et al 2017 wavelet analysis is composed of a cluster of wavelet functions that oscillate and decay to zero quickly which represent or approximate signals or functions by scaling in frequency domain and translation on the time axis the wavelet function ψ t satisfies the following conditions 11 ψ t dt 0 where ψ t is the mother wavelet function furthermore the wavelet function can be defined as 12 ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a where a is the scale factor b is the translation parameter which is used to determine the position of the wavelet function for continuous scaling factor and translation parameter continuous wavelet transform cwt is widely used in wavelet analysis

a is the complex conjugate function of ψ x b a cross wavelet transform xwt was used to analyze the consistency of periodic intensity of two time series data in time frequency domain and reveals the areas with high common power the xwt was defined by jury et al 2002 grinsted et al 2004 14 w xy a b w x a b w y a b where wx a b and wy a b are the cwt of time series data x and y respectively

results and discussions 4 1 groundwater table gwt and groundwater storage gws decline in the beijing plain 4 1 1 variations of gwt and gws gwt continued to decrease during 1999 2011 fig 2 a whereas a short groundwater recovery occurred in 2012 2013 fig 2b which may attribute to a significant increase in precipitation since the operation of snwdmrp in december 2014 gwt continued to rise rising of 2 72 m during 2015 2018 it is worth noting that the annual precipitation showed a downward trend from 2016 to 2018 but gwt continued to increase gws changes represented a decreasing trend from 1999 to 2014 with the exception of 2012 fig 2d suggesting that the decreasing trend of gws has been alleviated gws showed an upward trend since 2015 suggesting the alleviation of gwt decline and even the phenomenon of rising in recent years groundwater recovery since 2015 may be attributed to both groundwater extraction control and water transfer project snwdmrp the monthly variation characteristics of gwt was analyzed based on monthly groundwater dynamics data 2010 2019 as shown in fig s1 the monthly variation of gwt showed obvious seasonal changes and the gwt continued to rise from 2016 to 2019 with a significant increase from 2018 to 2019 and gwt in some months has risen by 2 m compared with the same period last year monthly gwt changes fig s1 indicated that a continuous rise of gwt occurred in 2012 2013 may be the cause of precipitation and 2017 2019 the combined effect of snwdmrp and groundwater extraction control 4 1 2 temporal variations of gsi and gtdr groundwater withdrawals showed a significant downward trend from 2 676 km3 to 1 626 km3 during 1999 2018 fig 2c the results of mk test and sen s slope estimator method demonstrated that gsi showed a significant downward trend from 2 09 in 1999 to 0 77 in 2018 with the decline rate of 0 054 per year to quantitatively analyze the trend of gwt decline groundwater table decline rate gtdr was calculated by subtracting the groundwater depth of current year from previous year positive and negative difference represents the decrease and rise of gwt respectively a significant downward trend of gtdr was observed which indicated the deceleration of gwt decline however from 1999 to 2014 gtdr was greater than zero except 2012 suggesting that gwt continued to decline which may be caused by continuous drought 1999 2007 and groundwater overexploitation since the operation of snwdmrp negative value of gtdr represented the increase of gwt in particular gwt at the end of 2018 increased by 1 94 m compared with 2017 fig 2a which further confirmed the fact that gwt decline has decelerated and risen for three consecutive years variations of both gtdr and gis indicated that groundwater depletion has been alleviated which may be attributed to the increase of precipitation and the contribution of snwdmrp and was also inseparable from the implementation of related policies e g industrial structure adjustment agricultural and industrial water use efficiency improvement and groundwater extraction control 4 1 3 identification of groundwater recharge events according to previous study masbruch et al 2016 the annual gwt change or slope can be used to represent the dynamic change characteristics of gwt the positive and negative value of slope represent the rise and decline of gwt respectively however in this study the difference of annual groundwater depth was used to represent the slope of gwt which was calculated by subtracting the gwt in the current year from the previous year that is gldr therefore when the slope is positive and negative representing the decline and rise of gwt the groundwater recharge event supplementary information text s2 in the study area was defined that the gwt increased continuously for three years which could better represent its rising characteristics masbruch et al 2016 the reason is that after gwt rises in current year if gwt declines in next year there will be no significant continuous changes in gws which cannot reflect the occurrence of groundwater recharge therefore although gtdr showed a downward trend on the whole during 1999 2018 groundwater recharge events only occurred from 2016 to 2018 fig s2 which may be attributed to both snwdmrp and groundwater extraction control 4 2 variations of the structure of water supply and use the structure of water supply e g surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water denotes water sources utilized by different sectors e g industry agriculture domestic environment the proportion of different water sources embodies the endowment characteristics of local water resources and socioeconomic development while water use structure reflects the distribution of water use understanding the variations of water sources and use contributes to explain the reduction of gwt and gws decline the proportion of surface water for water supply showed obvious decline trend fig 3 from 35 8 in 1999 to 7 7 in 2018 which was a result of strategically water management to meet the water demand in emergencies e g droughts by storing water into reservoirs during 1999 2018 the continuous droughts 1999 2007 caused surface water resources to be attenuated by nearly 60 and surface water available for supply decreased which increased groundwater extraction the proportion of groundwater used for supply continued to increase during 1999 2004 with the highest value in 2004 77 6 which may be attributed to the continuous drought that restricted the supply of surface water and continued to over exploit groundwater then a significant downward trend occurred from 2004 to 2018 down to 41 4 moreover the proportion of recycled water since 2003 and the snwdmrp for water supply since 2008 showed a significant upward trend accounting for 27 4 and 23 5 in 2018 respectively since 2015 water supply from snwdmrp increased significantly from 0 08 km3 in 2014 to 0 93 km3 in 2018 and the proportion of surface water and groundwater for supply decreased by 14 8 from 22 5 to 7 7 and 10 8 from 52 2 to 41 4 respectively the variations were due to two main factors 1 snwdmrp has replaced water resources for domestic and ecological replenishment and 2 conjunctive use of surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water prioritize the use of external water thereby alleviating groundwater pressure the variations of water use structure e g industry agriculture domestic environment were presented in fig 3b a significant downward trend was observed during 1999 2018 in terms of water use and the proportion of industry from 44 2 to 10 7 and agriculture from 25 3 to 8 4 conversely the domestic and environmental water use represented a significant upward trend with an increase from 27 4 and 3 1 in 1999 to 46 8 and 34 1 in 2018 respectively the variations of water use in different sectors were the combined result of urbanization changes in socio economic structure and relevant water policies long et al 2020 previous studies have confirmed that the way and efficiency of irrigation determine groundwater withdrawals scanlon et al 2007 siebert et al 2010 shahdany et al 2018 as well as the degree of groundwater decline in arid or semi arid irrigation areas chen et al 2018 the main source of agricultural water in beijing is groundwater wang and wang 2005 thus the decrease in the proportion of agricultural water reduces the huge demand for groundwater which is mainly due to the upgrading of industrial structure and the increase of effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water zheng et al 2010 the key of irrigation water saving measures is to increase water use efficiency while reducing evaporation cao et al 2013 ecological water use is becoming increasingly important for increasing groundwater recharge by increasing the infiltration replenishment yan et al 2018 water use structure changes showed that ecological water use presented a significant increasing trend with the increase from 0 72 km3 19 2 in 2014 to 1 12 km3 27 2 in 2015 accounting for a third of the total water use in 2018 beijing water authority 2018 and more than 80 was used to replenish rivers and lakes from the perspective of groundwater surplus or deficit except for the four years of 2012 and 2016 2018 groundwater withdrawal was greater than renewable groundwater resources which led to continuous decline of gwt termed as groundwater deficit however in 2012 and 2016 2018 groundwater withdrawal was less than renewable groundwater resources termed groundwater surplus fig s2 although groundwater is in deficit in most years the trend analysis of groundwater surplus and deficit indicated that groundwater deficit showed a decreasing trend especially from 2016 to 2018 when groundwater was in surplus for three consecutive years 4 3 driving factors of groundwater table decline deceleration and groundwater recovery 4 3 1 analysis of the factors affecting gsi and gtdr the correlations analysis between gsi and four factors e g annual precipitation snwdmrp water resources agricultural water use and fraction of groundwater supply showed that gsi was inversely proportional to precipitation and snwdmrp water resources fig 4 a fig 4b however agricultural water use and the fraction of groundwater supply were directly proportional to gsi fig 4c fig 4d in addition the positive linear relationship between gtdr and gsi was observed fig 4e which was attributed to the decrease of gsi caused by the reduction of groundwater withdrawal leads to the increase of water used to restore gws and the gtdr also drop correspondingly in the four years 2008 2016 2018 when gsi is 1 the gtdr is negative suggesting that gwt has risen however gtdr has a negative linear relationship with precipitation snwdmrp water resources and ecological water use the increase of the above three variables leads to the decrease of gtdr representing the rise of gwt gwt decline is partly related to water availability used to restore gws aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 which is renewable groundwater resources increase of groundwater withdrawal enhances the gsi meanwhile water resources available to restore gws decreases gws and gwt declines correspondingly precipitation represents direct groundwater recharge therefore the amount of precipitation may determine the amount of groundwater recharge and availability singh et al 2019 the gtdr is inversely proportional to precipitation due to main factors 1 low precipitation reduced groundwater recharge and availability but high demand needs continuous groundwater extraction 2 when precipitation is low groundwater acted to buffer the agricultural water use increasing the groundwater use and further leads to the increase of gtdr on the contrary when precipitation is large the gtdr decreases correspondingly however groundwater extraction far exceeds the ability of precipitation to recharge the aquifer zhai et al 2012b therefore the increase of precipitation cannot completely alleviate the situation of gwt decline and the key is to reduce groundwater withdrawal kundzewicz and doell 2009 groundwater overexploitation is the main influencing factor leading to gwt decline wada et al 2012 and it is likely to exceed natural replenishment and make a greater contribution to gws decline wu et al 2020 however snwdmrp water resources replacing groundwater and ecological recharge can be understood as indirect groundwater recharge the increase in the water supply of snwdmrp and the amount of reclaimed water alleviates gwt decline to a certain extent fig 3a table 1 the operation of snwdmrp has fundamentally changed water supply structure and alleviated groundwater stress cao et al 2013 liu et al 2020 the effect of snwdmrp on groundwater is manifested in reducing the groundwater withdrawal for domestic use and increasing the ecological water for groundwater recharge kattel et al 2019 on the one hand snwdmrp plays a role of replacing groundwater as water supply yang et al 2018 for example groundwater used for water supply was 1 626 km3 41 4 of total water supply in 2018 beijing water authority 1999 2018 while nearly two thirds of water supply mainly depended on groundwater in 1999 beijing water authority 1999 2018 and the proportion exceeded three quarters in 2004 beijing water authority 1999 2018 this condition has improved significantly on the other hand owing to the ecological benefits of snwdmrp liu 2003 the water used for ecological replenishment increased the groundwater recharge agricultural water use and the fraction of groundwater supply represent groundwater discharge since agricultural irrigation mainly depends on groundwater according to the action plan for the comprehensive control of groundwater over extraction in north china ministry of water resources the comprehensive treatment measure namely one reduction one increase was implemented to address the groundwater over extraction issues one reduction means the groundwater extraction control through water saving and agricultural structure adjustment the changes of agricultural planting structure one increase means to increase the groundwater supply through multiple channels and implement groundwater recharge measures 4 3 2 variation characteristics of groundwater storage anomalies gwsa gwsa showed an upward trend on the whole 0 63 mm month and can be divided into two phases fig 5 the first phase 2010 2015 displayed a fluctuating downward trend which reached 0 96 0 22 mm month the second phase 2015 2019 represented a significant increasing trend which reached 5 76 0 37 mm month the significant increase of gwsa occurred during 2018 2019 which may be attributed to 1 the elevated precipitation 2 70 of the water from snwdmrp was used for water supply by water plants and the rest was stored in large and medium sized reservoirs recharge rivers lakes and groundwater after years of operation the ecological benefits of snwdmrp have gradually emerged 3 increasing replacement of groundwater withdrawal with the snwdmrp groundwater extraction in main emergency water sources has decreased significantly coupled with groundwater extraction control the accumulation of positive effects of multiple factors has led to significant changes in gwsa during 2018 2019 4 3 3 correlation between gwsa and precipitation based on wavelet analysis wavelet analysis methods were used to analyze the correlation between precipitation and gwsa in multi scale time frequency space the xwt results of precipitation fig 6 a showed that the highest power is 10 15 months scale over the entire data period representing the most powerful waveband with the characteristic of approximately annual periodicity in addition the low precipitation periods 6 months scale were around 2016 and 2018 however fig 6b illustrated that the continuous wavelet power spectrum of gwsa has a long period 24 36 months scale in the whole time series and the most powerful waveband approximately 27 35 months scale periodicity occurred in 2016 2019 the xwt of precipitation and gwsa was shown in fig 6c a significant common power area in the 8 10 months band from 2017 to 2019 was observed representing the obvious correlation between precipitation and gwsa in this period in addition the precipitation leads gwsa by a 1 4 period in the phase of time frequency domain the synchronization relationship between gwsa and precipitation was examined as shown in fig 6d the wtc results showed that scattered significant localized coherence were around 2011 2012 and 2016 2018 and 3 5 7 months waveband was observed in 2011 2012 with upward pointing phase arrows indicating that gwsa has a significant coherence correlation with precipitation and the corresponding lagging behind 1 4 period during 2016 2018 the scattered high power spectrum areas of wavelet coherence that are 6 months waveband and 8 10 months waveband were observed 4 4 rfr analysis of groundwater dynamic variations 4 4 1 identification of the importance of factors affecting gwt mlr and rfr were employed to analyze gwt variations feature variables were selected using rfr supplementary information text s3 and more important feature variables were extracted according to the variance interpretation rate corresponding to different feature variables the increase in mean squared error incmse representing the importance of variables was obtained using rfr the greater value of incmse means high importance fig 7 illustrated that agricultural water use is of the greatest importance to gwt and the decreasing order of importance is domestic water use gsi snwdmrp water supply the proportion of groundwater supply and precipitation mlr determines the ranking of each factor according to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between gwt and each factor as shown in table 2 the ranking of the independent variables by two methods showed a high consistency the top three are agricultural water use domestic water use gsi however the importance of precipitation and snwdmrp is inconsistent in two methods and the effect of temperature on gwt is ranked last figure 8 showed the predicted gwt obtained by mlr and rfr it can be seen that the fitting effect of rfr was better than mlr and the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 837 and 0 914 respectively table s1 illustrated the interpretation variation explained of six independent variables to dependent variables the variation explained of rfr is higher than mlr which is 90 18 and 83 69 respectively this study identified the top two factors affecting groundwater dynamics which were agricultural water use and domestic water use both of which represent the degree of groundwater exploitation this result agrees with the previous studies for example li et al 2014 identified the driving factors and groundwater exploitation has a greater impact on groundwater dynamics than precipitation and other factors similarly zhou et al 2016 revealed that demand factor e g agricultural and domestic water use has a significant role on groundwater dynamic in addition fei et al 2009 found that artificial groundwater exploitation is the main factor in gwt decline therefore groundwater abstraction especially overexploitation affects groundwater dynamics significantly shamsudduha et al 2011 wu et al 2020 4 4 2 effects of snwdmrp on groundwater resources in this study the quantitative identification of factors affecting the gwt by rfr showed that snwdmrp is more important than natural factors e g precipitation and temperature on groundwater dynamics which implied that snwdmrp has a positive effect on alleviating gwt decline and may promote the groundwater recovery which was consistent with previous studies long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in this study the trend of gwsa showed that the alleviation of gws with a rate of 69 mm year since 2015 zhang et al 2020 found that snwdmrp has a positive effect on the groundwater recovery which showed an increasing trend 0 3 km3 year in ncp however zhang et al focus on the gws recovery in the ncp during 2015 2018 and did not separately characterize the groundwater recovery in beijing because the snwdmrp has different effects on gws in ncp and has the greatest positive effect on beijing cao et al 2013 therefore it is reasonable to estimate gws changes after the operation of snwdmrp in this study although the snwdmrp has a positive effect on groundwater the results of quantitative analysis showed that its impact on groundwater dynamics is less than that of agricultural water use domestic water use and gsi representing the ratio of groundwater withdrawal to availability indicating that snwdmrp has limited effect on alleviating gwt decline kendy et al 2007 consequently relying only on snwdmrp is not enough to fundamentally address the groundwater resources shortage in the short term cao et al 2013 according to the 13th five year plan for water affair development in beijing 13 thwadb beijing water authority 2016 the snwdmrp water supply will continued to be promoted snwdmrp will play an increasingly important role in alleviating groundwater stress and promoting groundwater recovery long et al 2020 in addition limiting increasing water demand improving water efficiency and solving water pollution issues should be paid more attention to given that high proportion of water used in agricultural demand balancing water conservation and food security and considering regional and structural reforms in agricultural sector has become increasingly important 5 implications and limitations 5 1 sustainability of groundwater resources multiple interpretations for groundwater resources sustainability have been reported depending on the balance between recharge and discharge of aquifers and the resulting ecological effects hiscock et al 2002 mays 2013 richey et al 2015 the sustainability represents an inextricably and positively state ranjan 2012 on the other hand groundwater stress aiming to understand the balance between groundwater supply and demand factors inherently indicates the sustainability of groundwater resources richey et al 2015 in the study area groundwater has experienced a long term unsustainable development owing to the overexploitation and continuous drought 1999 2007 fei et al 2007 fei et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 climate variability has increased the uncertainty of water resources because of the uncertainty of hydrological conditions minville et al 2008 kundzewicz et al 2018 for example precipitation and evaporation variations play a crucial role in groundwater dynamic li et al 2014 which may affect the groundwater availability moreover the uncertainty of climate changes makes it challenging to analyze and predict its impact on groundwater resources earman and dettinger 2011 although snwdmrp has contributed to alleviate the continuous decline of gwt and promote gws recovery and sustainability of groundwater resources water diversion cannot provide a simple solution to water resources shortage and the uncertainties of the water diversion project have been reported zhao et al 2020 the danjiangkou reservoir water source region of snwdmrp has reduced its water intake by an average of 17 in recent years zhao et al 2020 the total water supply guarantee rate is greatly affected by climate factors only accounting for 17 6 from 2000 to 2016 liu et al 2018 climate variability may still lead to drought in the water source region and a growing possibility of simultaneous drought in water receiving region and water source region was predicted in 2020 2050 liu et al 2015 which poses challenges to snwdmrp however groundwater resources are developing towards sustainability since the operation of snwdmrp which was attributed to 1 the sustainable groundwater management measures and projects formulated by comprehensively considering social political economic and institutional aspects to reduce the dependence on groundwater zheng et al 2010 yang et al 2018 2 the adjustment of water use structure i e industrial agricultural and the improvement of water use efficiency have alleviated water demand conflicts thereby reducing groundwater withdrawal wei et al 2018 especially the positive impact of changes in agricultural water use on the sustainability of groundwater the groundwater used for agriculture decreased by 29 from 2003 1 38 km3 to 2018 0 45 km3 long et al 2020 the decline was attributed to the improvement of effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water 0 742 in 2018 beijing water statistical yearbook 2018 which achieved the level 0 7 0 8 of developed countries the increase of this coefficient significantly reduced the excessive extraction of groundwater fishman et al 2015 and every increase of 0 05 saves 0 2 km3 zhao et al 2020 the policy guidance plays a positive role in groundwater recovery according to 13th five year plan for water affair development in beijing 13 thwadb beijing water authority 2016 the conjunctive use of local surface water groundwater and water transferred from outside can reduce the groundwater pressure for water supply in addition the implementation of the groundwater protection and pollution prevention and control plan and the replenishment of water sources should be implemented and groundwater protection and management should be strengthened the above analysis showed that groundwater is projected to develop towards sustainability however groundwater resources are still facing a severe situation indicated by gsi 0 4 moreover the growth of population and the rapid development of socio economy will increase the domestic water use and water demand therefore the water resources from snwdmrp should still be utilized efficiently meanwhile the groundwater extraction control and effective measures e g controlling water use and improving water use efficiency in key industries should be implemented 13 thwadb to promote the groundwater sustainability 5 2 uncertainty analysis and limitation there are several limitations that need to be improved in the future this study has insufficient researches on internal physical mechanism of the alleviation of gwt decline driven by natural and human factors and the physical and numerical models have not been established for quantitative characterization although hydrological models integrated different factors help explain the internal mechanism quantitatively identify the contribution of different factors wu et al 2017 and predict gwt and gws changes under the climate variability and human activities however the model usually has limitations and complexity ludwig et al 2009 schoups et al 2008 and uncertainties of climate variability leads to the uncertainties of related parameters in the model her and chaubey 2015 in addition anthropogenic extraction has a greater impact on groundwater than climate changes wu et al 2020 but it is difficult to accurately characterize in hydrological models which are usually expressed as a decrease or increase in the amount of groundwater cao et al 2013 some limitations may come from the data used data used in this study were derived from the statistical data in the beijing municipal water resources bulletin bmwrb which were statistics for the whole beijing city the amount of groundwater availability used to calculate gsi is represented by the annual renewable amount of groundwater resources derived from the bmwrb because the calculation of groundwater availability requires scientific procedures and policy guidance in particular policy guidance e g management goals environmental issues and related regulations and laws usually plays a more important role in the delineation of groundwater availability mace et al 2001 additionally due to the limitation of data the spatial difference of gwt decline alleviation needs to be further studied nevertheless the methods used in this study the fact that gwt decline has slowed down and gws recovery occurred and the identification and quantification of different influencing factors have still achieved good results 6 conclusions this study revealed the fact that gtdr has decelerated from 1999 to 2018 and identified the main driving factors leading to this phenomenon moreover this study assessed the dynamic changes in gsi analyzed the characteristics of gwt decline and gws changes and identified the groundwater recharge event the trend analysis of gsi gtdr and various influencing factors e g precipitation snwdmrp water use was carried out by using mk sen s slope and the correlations between gsi gtdr and various factors were clarified finally the mlr and rfr method were employed to identify the contributions of different factors to gwt and the reasons for natural and human factors to the alleviation of gwt decline were quantitatively evaluated therefore the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the trend analysis of gsi and gtdr obtained by mk trend test and sen s slope estimator revealed the fact that gwt decline has decelerated 2 the wtf method combined with in situ groundwater level data and specific yield derived the monthly gwsa which revealed a slight gws recovery in the past decade especially a significant increase of gws with a rate of 5 76 mm month since the operation of snwdmrp 3 wavelet analysis identified a correlation and coherence between gwsa and precipitation in the time frequency domain precipitation is one of the important factors in gws changes and gws lags behind precipitation 1 4 period 4 the deceleration of gwt decline may be attributed to climatic factors e g precipitation temperature the snwdmrp and water supply and use structure 5 rfr quantitatively identified the contribution of natural factors e g precipitation temperature and anthropic factors snwdmrp agricultural and domestic water use water use has the greatest impact on gwt dynamics and the effect of the snwdmrp is greater than climate factors e g precipitation temperature the results illustrated the main factors influencing the gwt is the over extraction of groundwater just rely on the snwdmrp water supply is not enough to address the serious groundwater shortage in beijing the key to alleviating the groundwater shortage situation lies in the parallel implementation of related measures such as groundwater extraction control improvement of water use efficiency utilization of external water transfer snwdmrp and reasonable adjustment of water use structure which reveals the necessity of building a water saving society credit authorship contribution

3533,domestic water supply and agricultural irrigation are highly dependent on groundwater in beijing groundwater table gwt decline and ecological issues caused by groundwater overexploitation have been of growing concern however some positive measures such as groundwater extraction control improvement of water use efficiency and south to north water diversion middle route project snwdmrp have alleviated severe groundwater shortage situation in recent years therefore quantifying the contributions of different factors to the deceleration of groundwater table decline contributes to guide groundwater resources in this study in situ groundwater table data climate data and water use data were used to identify the deceleration and driving factors of gwt decline by comprehensively using water table fluctuation wtf method mann kendall mk trend test wavelet analysis methods and random forest regression rfr firstly the mk trend test evaluated the trend of the defined groundwater stress index gsi and groundwater table decline rate gtdr changes indicating the fact that gwt decline was decelerated during 1999 2018 then the wtf method combined with in situ groundwater level data and specific yield were used to derive the monthly groundwater storage anomalies gwsa which revealed a slight gws recovery in the past decade especially a significant increase of gws with a rate of 5 76 mm month since the operation of south to north water diversion middle route project snwdmrp wavelet analysis identified a correlation and coherence between gwsa and precipitation in the time frequency domain furthermore correlation analysis indicated that the deceleration of gwt decline may be attributed to climatic factors e g precipitation temperature the snwdmrp and water supply and use structure the rfr quantitatively identified the greatest contribution of water use e g agricultural and domestic water use to gwt dynamics moreover the effect of snwdmrp is greater than climatic

industry and ecosystems sustaining the global water and food security groundwater accounts for 43 of water resources consumed for agricultural irrigation worldwide siebert et al 2010 more than two billion people in the world use groundwater as the main source of agriculture consumption voss et al 2009 climate change growing population and human activities have changed the distribution and reserves of groundwater resources wang and qin 2017 malekinezhad and banadkooki 2018 moreover groundwater is increasingly threatened by serious shortages caused by overexploitation in the future ojha et al 2015 china is facing a severe groundwater crisis more than 40 of irrigation coming from groundwater while in north and northwest china around 70 of drinking water depends on groundwater qiu 2010 the north china plain ncp is an important grain production base jeong et al 2014 the majority of water used for irrigation and drinking is supplied by groundwater zhao et al 2017 elevated demand for freshwater resources in rapid urbanization has led to groundwater overexploitation resulting in continuous groundwater depletion in ncp over the past few decades li et al 2014 beijing is a densely populated and water scarce megacity ye et al 2018 relying on groundwater for both domestic and agricultural water supply the annual available water resources are less than water demand especially during dry periods the balance of water supply and demand must be met through overexploitation of groundwater zhai et al 2012a which further aggravates groundwater shortage consequently groundwater table gwt continued to decline caused numerous geological and environmental problems e g land subsidence drying up of rivers and lakes and groundwater quality deterioration liu et al 2001 zheng et al 2010 guo et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 the factors influencing gwt include demand factor supply factor and loss factor and the demand factor has the greatest effect zhou et al 2016 which causes water scarcity to evaluate the scarcity of regional or global water resources and their relationship with socio economic development many studies have been conducted on water stress wada et al 2011a wada et al 2011b schlosser et al 2014 which can be used to explore the relationship between human water use and availability however some previous studies on water stress used only a single water resource data zhao et al 2020 and paid less attention to freshwater stored in aquifers which can create significant uncertainty in groundwater stress assessment two main methods were used in the evaluation of groundwater stress 1 quantifying the ratio of groundwater use to availability alcamo et al 1997 voss et al 2009 richey et al 2015 and defining this index as renewable groundwater stress alcamo et al 1997 richey et al 2015 in particular some studies have defined groundwater use as groundwater withdrawal including the return flow while groundwater availability is defined as groundwater recharge döll 2009 wada et al 2010 another indicator groundwater development stress is also defined according to the ratio of above two variables alley et al 2018 2 groundwater stress is expressed by a ratio of groundwater footprint to aquifer area and recycled portion of pumped groundwater and portion of available groundwater used for maintaining environmental flow are considered gleeson et al 2012 the calculation formula was given by q r e a gleeson and wada 2013 where q represents groundwater withdrawal r represents groundwater availability including surface water and groundwater irrigation return flow e represents groundwater for maintaining river ecology and a represents the aquifer area however this method is difficult to determine e thus the calculation of groundwater footprint index is not considered in this study groundwater stress helps to improve our understanding of gws changes among which grace gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite as an effective tool has been widely used to assess groundwater storage gws changes rodell et al 2007 scanlon et al 2012 evaluate groundwater drought index thomas et al 2017 and quantify groundwater stress richey et al 2015 evidence from grace estimated gws changes and identified groundwater depletion in ncp feng et al 2013 which may be attributed to climate variations human activities and relevant policies previous studies have evaluated the effects of different factors e g climate changes pumping and water diversion on gws changes using groundwater flow models or coupled groundwater surface models under specific physical mechanisms scibek et al 2007 li et al 2017 xia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the wavelet analysis has been widely used to analyze the periodicity and correlations in hydrological and climatological time series data charlier et al 2015 huang et al 2016 ouyang et al 2017 and reveal the time and space phase frequency relationship between gws and climate factors charlier et al 2015 resende et al 2019 however some of the limitations associated with numerical simulation include the difficulty of obtaining various parameters and the uncertainty in parameters and conceptual model will bring challenges to simulation and accuracy rojas et al 2008 thus machine learning has inherent benefits of accurately identifying the contributions of different factors on gws sahoo et al 2017 smith and majumdar 2020 kayhomayoon et al 2021 random forest model is widely used in hydrometeorology and water resources and quantifying the influence of various factors on gwt gws with excellent accuracy scanlon et al 2012 smith and majumdar 2020 rfr has the following characteristics 1 excellent accuracy compared with other algorithms 2 processing high dimensional characteristics samples without dimensionality reduction 3 assessing the importance of various variables 4 the estimation of missing data and non equilibrium data is relatively robust which is praised as one of the best algorithms at present iverson et al 2008 in particular rfr can simultaneously evaluate the influence of different independent variables on dependent variables select important characteristic variables and rank the importance of independent variables rodriguez galiano et al 2014 rfr has been widely used in the potential of groundwater spring simulation of groundwater nitrogen pollution rodriguez galiano et al 2014 wheeler et al 2015 ouedraogo et al 2019 the south to north water diversion project was launched in 2002 to alleviate serious water shortage in northern china li et al 2016 the south to north water diversion middle route project snwdmrp diverts water from danjiangkou reservoir into beijing to alleviate beijing s water shortage researchers have studied the impact of snwdmrp on groundwater dynamics yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 due to the effect of snwdmrp groundwater extraction has been reduced and gwt has recovered to varying degrees zhang et al 2020 moreover snwdmrp has the effectiveness of stabilizing beijing s gwt and promoting gws recovery long et al 2020 this study quantitatively identified the effect of snwdmrp on gwt using random forest regression and discussed its impact on the sustainability of groundwater previous studies have mostly focused on the degree of water stress or gwt decline in beijing however few studies paid attention to the evaluation of groundwater resources stress which were usually included in water resources as a whole zhang et al 2012 cheng et al 2019 sun et al 2019 in view of the importance of groundwater in beijing it is essential to determine groundwater stress in addition prior studies focused on gws changes gong et al 2018 the factors influencing gwt decline li et al 2014 and a series of geological environmental problems in beijing however less attention has been paid to groundwater table decline rate gtdr undergoing gratifying changes and the causes of its alleviation it is worth noting that gwt has continued to rise since the operation of snwdmrp currently quantitative identification of the impact of climate human activities and related policies on gws changes is rarely reported this study was mainly aimed at quantitatively identifying the influencing factors of gwt in beijing using mathematical model based on machine learning three major questions have been addressed 1 according to the trend of newly defined two indicators changes gsi and gtdr that characterize the groundwater decline obtained by mk test and sen s slope gwt decline alleviation and gws recovery have been reported 2 using correlation analysis and wavelet analysis the influencing factors of the above indicators were analyzed and the driving factors behind gwt gwsa changes were identified 3 random forest regression rfr model quantitatively identified the influencing factors of gwt changes and evaluated the effect of snwdmrp on groundwater dynamics the research results have important implications for groundwater management in beijing and other similar areas 2 study area and data 2 1 study area beijing located in the north of the ncp is characterized by high in the northwest and low in the southeast in topography and has a warm temperature and semi humid continental monsoon climate the plain area is 20 60 m above sea level and covers an area of 6 338 km2 the average annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 800 mm mostly concentrated in june to september the natural river channel runs through five major water systems from west to east which are juma river yongding river beiyun river chaobai river and jiyun river fig 1 in recent decades the rapid growth of population and industrial development have greatly increased the water consumption which has exceeded the carrying capacity of water resources beijing has been undergoing the water quantity reduction and water quality deterioration issues groundwater is the main source of water supply however due to excessive exploitation of shallow and deep groundwater the average groundwater depth in beijing plain decreased from 14 21 m in 1999 to 24 92 m in 2010 in order to alleviate the water shortage and water quality deterioration issues the utilization of external water resources has been increased correspondingly the use of local water resources has been reduced over the past decade zhao et al 2020 the implementation of some measures such as the operation of snwdmrp the increased use of recycled water and environmental water as well as the increased investment in water conservancy facilities which alleviated the water shortage and the water quality deterioration to a certain extent the snwdmrp was operated in december 2014 starting from the drainage of danjiangkou reservoir and finally reaching beijing by the end of 2019 a total of 5 2 km3 water has been supplied to beijing and 70 has been used for water supply beijing water authority 2019 the operation of snwdmrp has fundamentally changed water supply pattern in beijing and has alleviated continued decline of gwt however the situation remains severe according to water resources bulletin the amount of water resources per capita in beijing in 2018 was 165 m3 beijing water authority 2018 which is only 1 12 of the national per capita water resources ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2018 the dynamic features and calculation results of groundwater balance in beijing indicated that the main recharge source of groundwater is atmospheric precipitation and the main discharge path is artificial exploitation zhou et al 2012 groundwater has been overexploited for a long time especially from 1999 to 2007 when rainfall was 400 mm in consecutive years and surface water resources were seriously insufficient groundwater played a significant role in water supply for domestic agriculture and industry zhang et al 2018 leading to serious groundwater overexploitation and continuous decrease of gwt after 2008 with an increase in precipitation and implementation of groundwater extraction control downward trend of gwt has eased in particular since the operation of snwdmrp in december 2014 gwt has been continuously rising and rising against the precipitation trend for the latter the precipitation has decreased from 2016 to 2018 but gwt has been rising against the trend 2 2 data source data e g climate data water resources

monthly scales beijing water authority 1999 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater stress index gsi in this study gsi was determined by the ratio of annual groundwater withdrawal to availability the groundwater withdrawal refers to groundwater use in different sectors e g agricultural industrial domestic ecological although partial irrigation return flow back into groundwater system in order to calculate the criticality ratio alcamo et al 1997 groundwater withdrawal rather than groundwater use the difference between withdrawal and return flow was used for calculating gsi additionally groundwater availability was defined as the groundwater resources involved in the process of water circulation replenished during the year alcamo et al 1997 specifically refers to the amount of precipitation and surface water recharge to aquifers including precipitation infiltration and infiltration of water bodies in rivers lake reservoirs canal systems canal irrigation fields the groundwater availability data comes from beijing water resources bulletin the calculation formula of gsi was given by 1 gsi g w withdrawal g w availability where gwwithdrawal refers to groundwater withdrawal in different sectors and gwavailability represents groundwater availability groundwater stress state was classified based on different ranges of gsi according to the classification standards of the united nations and some previous studies raskin et al 1997 shiklomanov 1997 groundwater is under high pressure state when gsi is greater than 0 4 3 2 groundwater storage anomaly

calculated by 6 z s 1 var s 0 0 s 0 s 1 var s 0 where var represents the variance of s which was given by 7 var n n 1 2 n 5 t ft ft 1 2 ft 5 18 where n represents the length of time series data and ft represents the frequency of the data occurrence under the given significant level in bilateral trend test supposing the critical value of normal distribution is z1 α 2 when z z1 α 2 it implies that the data accepts the null hypothesis therefore the trend is not statistically significant otherwise when z z 1 α 2 the null hypothesis is invalid and the trend is statistically obvious in this study 95 confidence level z1 α 2 1 96 was used to mk trend test the mk test assumed that data are serially independent however hydrometeorological time series may have autocorrelation which will cause errors in trend test increasing the significance of data yue et al 2002 to eliminate the influence of autocorrelation prewhitening has been frequently used to eliminate autocorrelation in time series with a lag 1 autoregressive ar 1 process before mk test von storch and cannon 1995 yue and wang 2002 and the original time series xt was replaced with a new series by following formula 8 x t x t r 1 x

proposed by breiman is an integrated algorithm composed of decision trees the basic unit is decision tree dt which can be divided into classification tree ct and regression tree rt to deal with classification and regression problems respectively breiman 2001 the bootstrap method was used to extract multiple samples from the original samples with replacement for dt modeling then combine these decision trees and take the average of all dt results as the final regression result the mathematical expression was given by 10 f x i 1 m t i x m where f x represents the response of the dependent variable which refers to gwt in this study ti represents a single dt and represents n dimensional input data of independent variables which refers to precipitation temperature agricultural water use domestic water use gsi and snwdmrp water supply random forest regression rfr model can be used to analyze the explanatory effects of multiple independent variables on dependent variable f x in this study the randomforest program package liaw and wiener 2002 of r software version 3 3 1 was used for rfr analysis and important characteristic variables were selected and the importance of each independent variable was determined given the feature of resampling by putting back of rfr and this study aims to determine the main factors affecting gwt and order their importance therefore the data set does not distinguish between training set and test set in order to highlight its advantages in gwt regression analysis comparison with multiple linear regression mlr was conducted to check its applicability and superiority 3 5 wavelet analysis methods wavelet analysis represents the local characteristics of time series data in time and frequency domain which was widely used to analyze the periodicity and correlations in hydrological and climatological time series data charlier et al 2015 huang et al 2016 ouyang et al 2017 wavelet analysis is composed of a cluster of wavelet functions that oscillate and decay to zero quickly which represent or approximate signals or functions by scaling in frequency domain and translation on the time axis the wavelet function ψ t satisfies the following conditions 11 ψ t dt 0 where ψ t is the mother wavelet function furthermore the wavelet function can be defined as 12 ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a where a is the scale factor b is the translation parameter which is used to determine the position of the wavelet function for continuous scaling factor and translation parameter continuous wavelet transform cwt is widely used in wavelet analysis

results and discussions 4 1 groundwater table gwt and groundwater storage gws decline in the beijing plain 4 1 1 variations of gwt and gws gwt continued to decrease during 1999 2011 fig 2 a whereas a short groundwater recovery occurred in 2012 2013 fig 2b which may attribute to a significant increase in precipitation since the operation of snwdmrp in december 2014 gwt continued to rise rising of 2 72 m during 2015 2018 it is worth noting that the annual precipitation showed a downward trend from 2016 to 2018 but gwt continued to increase gws changes represented a decreasing trend from 1999 to 2014 with the exception of 2012 fig 2d suggesting that the decreasing trend of gws has been alleviated gws showed an upward trend since 2015 suggesting the alleviation of gwt decline and even the phenomenon of rising in recent years groundwater recovery since 2015 may be attributed to both groundwater extraction control and water transfer project snwdmrp the monthly variation characteristics of gwt was analyzed based on monthly groundwater dynamics data 2010 2019 as shown in fig s1 the monthly variation of gwt showed obvious seasonal changes and the gwt continued to rise from 2016 to 2019 with a significant increase from 2018 to 2019 and gwt in some months has risen by 2 m compared with the same period last year monthly gwt changes fig s1 indicated that a continuous rise of gwt occurred in 2012 2013 may be the cause of precipitation and 2017 2019 the combined effect of snwdmrp and groundwater extraction control 4 1 2 temporal variations of gsi and gtdr groundwater withdrawals showed a significant downward trend from 2 676 km3 to 1 626 km3 during 1999 2018 fig 2c the results of mk test and sen s slope estimator method demonstrated that gsi showed a significant downward trend from 2 09 in 1999 to 0 77 in 2018 with the decline rate of 0 054 per year to quantitatively analyze the trend of gwt decline groundwater table decline rate gtdr was calculated by subtracting the groundwater depth of current year from previous year positive and negative difference represents the decrease and rise of gwt respectively a significant downward trend of gtdr was observed which indicated the deceleration of gwt decline however from 1999 to 2014 gtdr was greater than zero except 2012 suggesting that gwt continued to decline which may be caused by continuous drought 1999 2007 and groundwater overexploitation since the operation of snwdmrp negative value of gtdr represented the increase of gwt in particular gwt at the end of 2018 increased by 1 94 m compared with 2017 fig 2a which further confirmed the fact that gwt decline has decelerated and risen for three consecutive years variations of both gtdr and gis indicated that groundwater depletion has been alleviated which may be attributed to the increase of precipitation and the contribution of snwdmrp and was also inseparable from the implementation of related policies e g industrial structure adjustment agricultural and industrial water use efficiency improvement and groundwater extraction control 4 1 3 identification of groundwater recharge events according to previous study masbruch et al 2016 the annual gwt change or slope can be used to represent the dynamic change characteristics of gwt the positive and negative value of slope represent the rise and decline of gwt respectively however in this study the difference of annual groundwater depth was used to represent the slope of gwt which was calculated by subtracting the gwt in the current year from the previous year that is gldr therefore when the slope is positive and negative representing the decline and rise of gwt the groundwater recharge event supplementary information text s2 in the study area was defined that the gwt increased continuously for three years which could better represent its rising characteristics masbruch et al 2016 the reason is that after gwt rises in current year if gwt declines in next year there will be no significant continuous changes in gws which cannot reflect the occurrence of groundwater recharge therefore although gtdr showed a downward trend on the whole during 1999 2018 groundwater recharge events only occurred from 2016 to 2018 fig s2 which may be attributed to both snwdmrp and groundwater extraction control 4 2 variations of the structure of water supply and use the structure of water supply e g surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water denotes water sources utilized by different sectors e g industry agriculture domestic environment the proportion of different water sources embodies the endowment characteristics of local water resources and socioeconomic development while water use structure reflects the distribution of water use understanding the variations of water sources and use contributes to explain the reduction of gwt and gws decline the proportion of surface water for water supply showed obvious decline trend fig 3 from 35 8 in 1999 to 7 7 in 2018 which was a result of strategically water management to meet the water demand in emergencies e g droughts by storing water into reservoirs during 1999 2018 the continuous droughts 1999 2007 caused surface water resources to be attenuated by nearly 60 and surface water available for supply decreased which increased groundwater extraction the proportion of groundwater used for supply continued to increase during 1999 2004 with the highest value in 2004 77 6 which may be attributed to the continuous drought that restricted the supply of surface water and continued to over exploit groundwater then a significant downward trend occurred from 2004 to 2018 down to 41 4 moreover the proportion of recycled water since 2003 and the snwdmrp for water supply since 2008 showed a significant upward trend accounting for 27 4 and 23 5 in 2018 respectively since 2015 water supply from snwdmrp increased significantly from 0 08 km3 in 2014 to 0 93 km3 in 2018 and the proportion of surface water and groundwater for supply decreased by 14 8 from 22 5 to 7 7 and 10 8 from 52 2 to 41 4 respectively the variations were due to two main factors 1 snwdmrp has replaced water resources for domestic and ecological replenishment and 2 conjunctive use of surface water groundwater transferred water and reclaimed water prioritize the use of external water thereby alleviating groundwater pressure the variations of water use structure e g industry agriculture domestic environment were presented in fig 3b a significant downward trend was observed during 1999 2018 in terms of water use and the proportion of industry from 44 2 to 10 7 and agriculture from 25 3 to 8 4 conversely the domestic and environmental water use represented a significant upward trend with an increase from 27 4 and 3 1 in 1999 to 46 8 and 34 1 in 2018 respectively the variations of water use in different sectors were the combined result of urbanization changes in socio economic structure and relevant water policies long et al 2020 previous studies have confirmed that the way and efficiency of irrigation determine groundwater withdrawals scanlon et al 2007 siebert et al 2010 shahdany et al 2018 as well as the degree of groundwater decline in arid or semi arid irrigation areas chen et al 2018 the main source of agricultural water in beijing is groundwater wang and wang 2005 thus the decrease in the proportion of agricultural water reduces the huge demand for groundwater which is mainly due to the upgrading of industrial structure and the increase of effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water zheng et al 2010 the key of irrigation water saving measures is to increase water use efficiency while reducing evaporation cao et al 2013 ecological water use is becoming increasingly important for increasing groundwater recharge by increasing the infiltration replenishment yan et al 2018 water use structure changes showed that ecological water use presented a significant increasing trend with the increase from 0 72 km3 19 2 in 2014 to 1 12 km3 27 2 in 2015 accounting for a third of the total water use in 2018 beijing water authority 2018 and more than 80 was used to replenish rivers and lakes from the perspective of groundwater surplus or deficit except for the four years of 2012 and 2016 2018 groundwater withdrawal was greater than renewable groundwater resources which led to continuous decline of gwt termed as groundwater deficit however in 2012 and 2016 2018 groundwater withdrawal was less than renewable groundwater resources termed groundwater surplus fig s2 although groundwater is in deficit in most years the trend analysis of groundwater surplus and deficit indicated that groundwater deficit showed a decreasing trend especially from 2016 to 2018 when groundwater was in surplus for three consecutive years 4 3 driving factors of groundwater table decline deceleration and groundwater recovery 4 3 1 analysis of the factors affecting gsi and gtdr the correlations analysis between gsi and four factors e g annual precipitation snwdmrp water resources agricultural water use and fraction of groundwater supply showed that gsi was inversely proportional to precipitation and snwdmrp water resources fig 4 a fig 4b however agricultural water use and the fraction of groundwater supply were directly proportional to gsi fig 4c fig 4d in addition the positive linear relationship between gtdr and gsi was observed fig 4e which was attributed to the decrease of gsi caused by the reduction of groundwater withdrawal leads to the increase of water used to restore gws and the gtdr also drop correspondingly in the four years 2008 2016 2018 when gsi is 1 the gtdr is negative suggesting that gwt has risen however gtdr has a negative linear relationship with precipitation snwdmrp water resources and ecological water use the increase of the above three variables leads to the decrease of gtdr representing the rise of gwt gwt decline is partly related to water availability used to restore gws aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 which is renewable groundwater resources increase of groundwater withdrawal enhances the gsi meanwhile water resources available to restore gws decreases gws and gwt declines correspondingly precipitation represents direct groundwater recharge therefore the amount of precipitation may determine the amount of groundwater recharge and availability singh et al 2019 the gtdr is inversely proportional to precipitation due to main factors 1 low precipitation reduced groundwater recharge and availability but high demand needs continuous groundwater extraction 2 when precipitation is low groundwater acted to buffer the agricultural water use increasing the groundwater use and further leads to the increase of gtdr on the contrary when precipitation is large the gtdr decreases correspondingly however groundwater extraction far exceeds the ability of precipitation to recharge the aquifer zhai et al 2012b therefore the increase of precipitation cannot completely alleviate the situation of gwt decline and the key is to reduce groundwater withdrawal kundzewicz and doell 2009 groundwater overexploitation is the main influencing factor leading to gwt decline wada et al 2012 and it is likely to exceed natural replenishment and make a greater contribution to gws decline wu et al 2020 however snwdmrp water resources replacing groundwater and ecological recharge can be understood as indirect groundwater recharge the increase in the water supply of snwdmrp and the amount of reclaimed water alleviates gwt decline to a certain extent fig 3a table 1 the operation of snwdmrp has fundamentally changed water supply structure and alleviated groundwater stress cao et al 2013 liu et al 2020 the effect of snwdmrp on groundwater is manifested in reducing the groundwater withdrawal for domestic use and increasing the ecological water for groundwater recharge kattel et al 2019 on the one hand snwdmrp plays a role of replacing groundwater as water supply yang et al 2018 for example groundwater used for water supply was 1 626 km3 41 4 of total water supply in 2018 beijing water authority 1999 2018 while nearly two thirds of water supply mainly depended on groundwater in 1999 beijing water authority 1999 2018 and the proportion exceeded three quarters in 2004 beijing water authority 1999 2018 this condition has improved significantly on the other hand owing to the ecological benefits of snwdmrp liu 2003 the water used for ecological replenishment increased the groundwater recharge agricultural water use and the fraction of groundwater supply represent groundwater discharge since agricultural irrigation mainly depends on groundwater according to the action plan for the comprehensive control of groundwater over extraction in north china ministry of water resources the comprehensive treatment measure namely one reduction one increase was implemented to address the groundwater over extraction issues one reduction means the groundwater extraction control through water saving and agricultural structure adjustment the changes of agricultural planting structure one increase means to increase the groundwater supply through multiple channels and implement groundwater recharge measures 4 3 2 variation characteristics of groundwater storage anomalies gwsa gwsa showed an upward trend on the whole 0 63 mm month and can be divided into two phases fig 5 the first phase 2010 2015 displayed a fluctuating downward trend which reached 0 96 0 22 mm month the second phase 2015 2019 represented a significant increasing trend which reached 5 76 0 37 mm month the significant increase of gwsa occurred during 2018 2019 which may be attributed to 1 the elevated precipitation 2 70 of the water from snwdmrp was used for water supply by water plants and the rest was stored in large and medium sized reservoirs recharge rivers lakes and groundwater after years of operation the ecological benefits of snwdmrp have gradually emerged 3 increasing replacement of groundwater withdrawal with the snwdmrp groundwater extraction in main emergency water sources has decreased significantly coupled with groundwater extraction control the accumulation of positive effects of multiple factors has led to significant changes in gwsa during 2018 2019 4 3 3 correlation between gwsa and precipitation based on wavelet analysis wavelet analysis methods were used to analyze the correlation between precipitation and gwsa in multi scale time frequency space the xwt results of precipitation fig 6 a showed that the highest power is 10 15 months scale over the entire data period representing the most powerful waveband with the characteristic of approximately annual periodicity in addition the low precipitation periods 6 months scale were around 2016 and 2018 however fig 6b illustrated that the continuous wavelet power spectrum of gwsa has a long period 24 36 months scale in the whole time series and the most powerful waveband approximately 27 35 months scale periodicity occurred in 2016 2019 the xwt of precipitation and gwsa was shown in fig 6c a significant common power area in the 8 10 months band from 2017 to 2019 was observed representing the obvious correlation between precipitation and gwsa in this period in addition the precipitation leads gwsa by a 1 4 period in the phase of time frequency domain the synchronization relationship between gwsa and precipitation was examined as shown in fig 6d the wtc results showed that scattered significant localized coherence were around 2011 2012 and 2016 2018 and 3 5 7 months waveband was observed in 2011 2012 with upward pointing phase arrows indicating that gwsa has a significant coherence correlation with precipitation and the corresponding lagging behind 1 4 period during 2016 2018 the scattered high power spectrum areas of wavelet coherence that are 6 months waveband and 8 10 months waveband were observed 4 4 rfr analysis of groundwater dynamic variations 4 4 1 identification of the importance of factors affecting gwt mlr and rfr were employed to analyze gwt variations feature variables were selected using rfr supplementary information text s3 and more important feature variables were extracted according to the variance interpretation rate corresponding to different feature variables the increase in mean squared error incmse representing the importance of variables was obtained using rfr the greater value of incmse means high importance fig 7 illustrated that agricultural water use is of the greatest importance to gwt and the decreasing order of importance is domestic water use gsi snwdmrp water supply the proportion of groundwater supply and precipitation mlr determines the ranking of each factor according to the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between gwt and each factor as shown in table 2 the ranking of the independent variables by two methods showed a high consistency the top three are agricultural water use domestic water use gsi however the importance of precipitation and snwdmrp is inconsistent in two methods and the effect of temperature on gwt is ranked last figure 8 showed the predicted gwt obtained by mlr and rfr it can be seen that the fitting effect of rfr was better than mlr and the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 837 and 0 914 respectively table s1 illustrated the interpretation variation explained of six independent variables to dependent variables the variation explained of rfr is higher than mlr which is 90 18 and 83 69 respectively this study identified the top two factors affecting groundwater dynamics which were agricultural water use and domestic water use both of which represent the degree of groundwater exploitation this result agrees with the previous studies for example li et al 2014 identified the driving factors and groundwater exploitation has a greater impact on groundwater dynamics than precipitation and other factors similarly zhou et al 2016 revealed that demand factor e g agricultural and domestic water use has a significant role on groundwater dynamic in addition fei et al 2009 found that artificial groundwater exploitation is the main factor in gwt decline therefore groundwater abstraction especially overexploitation affects groundwater dynamics significantly shamsudduha et al 2011 wu et al 2020 4 4 2 effects of snwdmrp on groundwater resources in this study the quantitative identification of factors affecting the gwt by rfr showed that snwdmrp is more important than natural factors e g precipitation and temperature on groundwater dynamics which implied that snwdmrp has a positive effect on alleviating gwt decline and may promote the groundwater recovery which was consistent with previous studies long et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in this study the trend of gwsa showed that the alleviation of gws with a rate of 69 mm year since 2015 zhang et al 2020 found that snwdmrp has a positive effect on the groundwater recovery which showed an increasing trend 0 3 km3 year in ncp however zhang et al focus on the gws recovery in the ncp during 2015 2018 and did not separately characterize the groundwater recovery in beijing because the snwdmrp has different effects on gws in ncp and has the greatest positive effect on beijing cao et al 2013 therefore it is reasonable to estimate gws changes after the operation of snwdmrp in this study although the snwdmrp has a positive effect on groundwater the results of quantitative analysis showed that its impact on groundwater dynamics is less than that of agricultural water use domestic water use and gsi representing the ratio of groundwater withdrawal to availability indicating that snwdmrp has limited effect on alleviating gwt decline kendy et al 2007 consequently relying only on snwdmrp is not enough to fundamentally address the groundwater resources shortage in the short term cao et al 2013 according to the 13th five year plan for water affair development in beijing 13 thwadb beijing water authority 2016 the snwdmrp water supply will continued to be promoted snwdmrp will play an increasingly important role in alleviating groundwater stress and promoting groundwater recovery long et al 2020 in addition limiting increasing water demand improving water efficiency and solving water pollution issues should be paid more attention to given that high proportion of water used in agricultural demand balancing water conservation and food security and considering regional and structural reforms in agricultural sector has become increasingly important 5 implications and limitations 5 1 sustainability of groundwater resources multiple interpretations for groundwater resources sustainability have been reported depending on the balance between recharge and discharge of aquifers and the resulting ecological effects hiscock et al 2002 mays 2013 richey et al 2015 the sustainability represents an inextricably and positively state ranjan 2012 on the other hand groundwater stress aiming to understand the balance between groundwater supply and demand factors inherently indicates the sustainability of groundwater resources richey et al 2015 in the study area groundwater has experienced a long term unsustainable development owing to the overexploitation and continuous drought 1999 2007 fei et al 2007 fei et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 climate variability has increased the uncertainty of water resources because of the uncertainty of hydrological conditions minville et al 2008 kundzewicz et al 2018 for example precipitation and evaporation variations play a crucial role in groundwater dynamic li et al 2014 which may affect the groundwater availability moreover the uncertainty of climate changes makes it challenging to analyze and predict its impact on groundwater resources earman and dettinger 2011 although snwdmrp has contributed to alleviate the continuous decline of gwt and promote gws recovery and sustainability of groundwater resources water diversion cannot provide a simple solution to water resources shortage and the uncertainties of the water diversion project have been reported zhao et al 2020 the danjiangkou reservoir water source region of snwdmrp has reduced its water intake by an average of 17 in recent years zhao et al 2020 the total water supply guarantee rate is greatly affected by climate factors only accounting for 17 6 from 2000 to 2016 liu et al 2018 climate variability may still lead to drought in the water source region and a growing possibility of simultaneous drought in water receiving region and water source region was predicted in 2020 2050 liu et al 2015 which poses challenges to snwdmrp however groundwater resources are developing towards sustainability since the operation of snwdmrp which was attributed to 1 the sustainable groundwater management measures and projects formulated by comprehensively considering social political economic and institutional aspects to reduce the dependence on groundwater zheng et al 2010 yang et al 2018 2 the adjustment of water use structure i e industrial agricultural and the improvement of water use efficiency have alleviated water demand conflicts thereby reducing groundwater withdrawal wei et al 2018 especially the positive impact of changes in agricultural water use on the sustainability of groundwater the groundwater used for agriculture decreased by 29 from 2003 1 38 km3 to 2018 0 45 km3 long et al 2020 the decline was attributed to the improvement of effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water 0 742 in 2018 beijing water statistical yearbook 2018 which achieved the level 0 7 0 8 of developed countries the increase of this coefficient significantly reduced the excessive extraction of groundwater fishman et al 2015 and every increase of 0 05 saves 0 2 km3 zhao et al 2020 the policy guidance plays a positive role in groundwater recovery according to 13th five year plan for water affair development in beijing 13 thwadb beijing water authority 2016 the conjunctive use of local surface water groundwater and water transferred from outside can reduce the groundwater pressure for water supply in addition the implementation of the groundwater protection and pollution prevention and control plan and the replenishment of water sources should be implemented and groundwater protection and management should be strengthened the above analysis showed that groundwater is projected to develop towards sustainability however groundwater resources are still facing a severe situation indicated by gsi 0 4 moreover the growth of population and the rapid development of socio economy will increase the domestic water use and water demand therefore the water resources from snwdmrp should still be utilized efficiently meanwhile the groundwater extraction control and effective measures e g controlling water use and improving water use efficiency in key industries should be implemented 13 thwadb to promote the groundwater sustainability 5 2 uncertainty analysis and limitation there are several limitations that need to be improved in the future this study has insufficient researches on internal physical mechanism of the alleviation of gwt decline driven by natural and human factors and the physical and numerical models have not been established for quantitative characterization although hydrological models integrated different factors help explain the internal mechanism quantitatively identify the contribution of different factors wu et al 2017 and predict gwt and gws changes under the climate variability and human activities however the model usually has limitations and complexity ludwig et al 2009 schoups et al 2008 and uncertainties of climate variability leads to the uncertainties of related parameters in the model her and chaubey 2015 in addition anthropogenic extraction has a greater impact on groundwater than climate changes wu et al 2020 but it is difficult to accurately characterize in hydrological models which are usually expressed as a decrease or increase in the amount of groundwater cao et al 2013 some limitations may come from the data used data used in this study were derived from the statistical data in the beijing municipal water resources bulletin bmwrb which were statistics for the whole beijing city the amount of groundwater availability used to calculate gsi is represented by the annual renewable amount of groundwater resources derived from the bmwrb because the calculation of groundwater availability requires scientific procedures and policy guidance in particular policy guidance e g management goals environmental issues and related regulations and laws usually plays a more important role in the delineation of groundwater availability mace et al 2001 additionally due to the limitation of data the spatial difference of gwt decline alleviation needs to be further studied nevertheless the methods used in this study the fact that gwt decline has slowed down and gws recovery occurred and the identification and quantification of different influencing factors have still achieved good results 6 conclusions this study revealed the fact that gtdr has decelerated from 1999 to 2018 and identified the main driving factors leading to this phenomenon moreover this study assessed the dynamic changes in gsi analyzed the characteristics of gwt decline and gws changes and identified the groundwater recharge event the trend analysis of gsi gtdr and various influencing factors e g precipitation snwdmrp water use was carried out by using mk sen s slope and the correlations between gsi gtdr and various factors were clarified finally the mlr and rfr method were employed to identify the contributions of different factors to gwt and the reasons for natural and human factors to the alleviation of gwt decline were quantitatively evaluated therefore the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the trend analysis of gsi and gtdr obtained by mk trend test and sen s slope estimator revealed the fact that gwt decline has decelerated 2 the wtf method combined with in situ groundwater level data and specific yield derived the monthly gwsa which revealed a slight gws recovery in the past decade especially a significant increase of gws with a rate of 5 76 mm month since the operation of snwdmrp 3 wavelet analysis identified a correlation and coherence between gwsa and precipitation in the time frequency domain precipitation is one of the important factors in gws changes and gws lags behind precipitation 1 4 period 4 the deceleration of gwt decline may be attributed to climatic factors e g precipitation temperature the snwdmrp and water supply and use structure 5 rfr quantitatively identified the contribution of natural factors e g precipitation temperature and anthropic factors snwdmrp agricultural and domestic water use water use has the greatest impact on gwt dynamics and the effect of the snwdmrp is greater than climate factors e g precipitation temperature the results illustrated the main factors influencing the gwt is the over extraction of groundwater just rely on the snwdmrp water supply is not enough to address the serious groundwater shortage in beijing the key to alleviating the groundwater shortage situation lies in the parallel implementation of related measures such as groundwater extraction control improvement of water use efficiency utilization of external water transfer snwdmrp and reasonable adjustment of water use structure which reveals the necessity of building a water saving society credit authorship contribution

3534,drought is a complex and slow moving disaster that is difficult to monitor and define this study therefore aims to demonstrate the characteristics of recent droughts occurring from 2008 to 2015 over south korea using a process based land and hydrologic model weather research and forecasting hydro modeling system wrf hydro to drive the standalone wrf hydro gridded meteorological data 5 km were generated using station based observations and the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism the model was calibrated and evaluated using inflow observations at four locations with dams for 2008 2010 calibration and 2011 2015 evaluation it demonstrated average r2 values of 0 80 and 0 75 respectively while standardized precipitation index is used for calculating meteorological drought using precipitation from prism standardized soil moisture index and standardized streamflow index at different timescales are used to calculate agricultural and hydrological droughts respectively with wrf hydro simulations the correlation coefficients between spi and both ssfi and ssmi were calculated to detect their response times the hydrological and agricultural droughts showed response times 0 5 1 month later than meteorological drought in 2008 2015 agricultural and hydrological drought events occurred 1 6 times per year on average in south korea whereas meteorological droughts occurred 4 3 times per year on average agricultural and hydrological droughts lagged behind meteorological droughts by up to 53 65 and 83 days when using 1 3 and 6 month spi respectively moreover hydrological droughts were less severe than meteorological droughts due to the propagation of drought by attenuation this study demonstrates that wrf hydro can be used to quantitatively determine the different types of drought events and their propagation which could help policy makers manage drought risks keywords wrf hydro drought characteristics drought propagation standardized index 1 introduction recent climate and environmental change have led to an increasing number of disasters worldwide with droughts being the costliest type of disaster affecting a large number of people annually cook et al 2014 on average 6 to 8 billion us dollars is spent annually to mitigate the effects of global and regional drought wilhite 2000 in addition droughts are expected to increase in frequency and severity in the future due to climate change sheffield et al 2012 droughts are often classified into categories such as meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 a meteorological drought is characterized by water shortage due to an imbalance in the precipitation and evaporation cycles whereas an agricultural drought is characterized by the depletion of soil moisture to an extent that crop and pasture yields are affected significantly thober et al 2015 dalezios 2017 zhong et al 2020 conversely hydrological drought occurs when surface or subsurface hydrology are adversely affected for example in the form of low streamflow ground runoff or lake and river levels drought types can change over time over the course of the drought propagation process wang et al 2016 gevaert et al 2018 wu et al 2020 nevertheless different types of droughts tend to interact for example precipitation deficits can propagate into hydrological systems inducing an agricultural drought in irrigated areas from a meteorological drought which further depends on several factors such as soil type storage water retention capacity and evapotranspiration bae et al 2019 van loon 2015 addressed drought propagation as the transition from a meteorological drought to a hydrological drought and identified three features of drought propagation including pooling attenuation and lengthening in addition barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 demonstrated that each drought maintains its own characteristics when propagating to another therefore analyzing the mechanisms via which drought propagation occurs from meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts is essential for water resource management zhao et al 2014 compared meteorological drought standardized precipitation index spi and hydrological drought standardized runoff index sri in the jinghe basin of china using standardized methods established by mckee 1993 they showed that hydrological droughts occur later than meteorological droughts using observed precipitation and runoff data from gauges and stations they also confirmed that drought frequency and duration decreased when propagation occurred from meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts in addition gu et al 2020 examined the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in three regions in china they identified a lag in propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought moreover they showed that meteorological drought duration and severity were amplified when they were propagated from hydrological droughts in the catchments recent studies zhao et al 2014 wu et al 2021 have used various indices at different timescales to demonstrate drought propagation zhao et al 2016 computed drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought using sri over a one month timescale and with different timescales of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei based on a two month timescale exhibited an optimal correlation with sri on a one month timescale moreover a higher correlation coefficient was obtained in the dry season whereas the minimum was observed in the wet season wu et al 2021 estimated drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought for timescales of 1 3 and 6 months they argued that the different timescales applied for the hydrological drought index standardized streamflow index ssfi and meteorological drought index spi had different sensitivities to drought events land surface models lsms are often used to predict and understand the drought characteristics e g shukla and wood 2008 um et al 2018 barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 mehboob et al 2020 lsms have an advantage over satellite data in that they allow long term simulations including those of variables such as root zone soil moisture which are difficult to observe from space shukla and wood 2008 used a physically based semi distributed macro scale variable infiltration capacity vic model to simulate the land surface water balance they then evaluated hydrological drought in the snowmelt region of california their results suggested that monthly and seasonal hydrological drought simulations from the vic model complement meteorological drought prediction and facilitate the depiction of the hydrological aspects of drought barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 estimated meteorological to hydrological drought propagation and soil moisture droughts in spain they showed that precipitation during model formulation can influence hydrological variables such as soil moisture and streamflow the variables influence drought and drought propagation furthermore according to yoo et al 2013 and wang et al 2021 the capacity of monthly spi to capture drought events with short durations such as less than 1 month is limited therefore lsms offer an opportunity to understand drought processes at finer temporal resolutions e g daily than observational data which may be limited in providing all the necessary hydrologic variables consistently over such temporal scales recently the weather research and forecasting hydro modeling system wrf hydro has been developed to improve the simulations of land surface hydrology at a fairly high spatial resolution e g up to 1 km or lower gochis et al 2018 the model has been evaluated based on discharge and streamflow in several regions of the united states lin et al 2018 africa arnault et al 2016 kerandi et al 2018 naabil et al 2017 and mediterranean regions givati et al 2016 givati et al 2016 compared the results of wrf hydro and the hydrological engineering center hydrological modeling system hec hms with multiple atmospheric data sources and the results suggested that the coupled wrf hydro could simulate precipitation well thus improving hydrological forecasts for example in the case of flood and drought warnings some recent studies e g bae et al 2019 sattar et al 2019 have addressed the issue of drought propagation over south korea bae et al 2019 investigated drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological and agricultural droughts using observed precipitation and dam levels they demonstrated the seasonal characteristics of drought propagation during the wet and dry seasons hydrological and agricultural droughts tend to propagate from meteorological droughts in the dry season because a substantial volume of irrigation water is consumed however in the wet season meteorological drought does not cause other droughts because precipitation is used instead of dam stored water sattar et al 2019 estimated the monthly spi and sri with gauge precipitation and precipitation runoff models respectively to analyze the spatial distribution of lag in drought propagation they demonstrated that when the lag time was long the intensity of the meteorological drought was moderate such studies provide limited depictions of drought propagation over south korea therefore the quantitative characteristics of drought propagation need to be demonstrated at finer temporal scales in south korea therefore this study investigated the characteristics of recent droughts and their propagation over south korea using wrf hydro specifically the standalone wrf hydro was applied in south korea by constructing meteorological forcing using the parameter elevation regression on independent model prism and by calibrating the model parameters using dam inflow observations at four selected sites fig 1 this constrained wrf hydro was then used to simulate hydrologic processes over south korea daily precipitation data from observations and daily soil moisture and streamflow data from wrf hydro simulations were used to derive standardized indices at multiple timescales ranging from 1 week to 8 months the standardized indices were estimated from daily data to capture drought over relatively short periods the indices were then used to quantitatively describe the characteristics of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts and their propagation 2 methods and data 2 1 study area this study was carried out in south korea between 33 5 n and 41 n and between 124 5 w and 130 w the study focused on four dam sites soyang chungju yongdam and namgang fig 1 note that there are no upstream dams for the four sites which was required as the wrf hydro does not simulate dam operation in south korea precipitation is concentrated during the wet summer monsoon season the annual average temperature is 12 8 c and the annual precipitation is 1253 2 mm from 2008 to 2015 according to the korea meteorological administration kma the occurrence of extreme drought events has increased in the east asia region including south korea due to the effects of the east asian monsoon zhang and zhou 2015 kim et al 2012 investigated summer precipitation trends in south korea in historical periods using daily precipitation data they showed an increase in summer precipitation and a decrease in the number of dry days from 1973 to 2007 nonetheless kwon et al 2016 showed that south korea has been experiencing four to six year cycles of nationwide droughts since 1960 an extreme drought occurred from 2013 to 2015 when the annual precipitation was significantly lower than the average for two consecutive years the period is considered to be the worst drought in the past 50 years kwon et al 2016 2 2 land and hydrologic modeling system wrf hydro is a hydrological model system that integrates various terrestrial and hydrological processes to simulate water energy and fluxes between the land and atmosphere gochis et al 2018 in this study wrf hydro was operated in standalone mode as a traditional land surface hydrologic modeling system wrf hydro contains several components of the distributed hydrological process and channel flow its main strength is the routing of both saturated subsurface water and excess infiltration capacity in particular excess routed infiltration together with additional exfiltration from saturated soil is not simply removed from the system rather it is allowed to pond on the surface move laterally and reinfiltrate senatore et al 2015 the moisture states are disaggregated from the lsm grid to the high resolution routing grid using a subgrid aggregation disaggregation procedure scheme based on the spatial weighting method and then passed onto the routing routines afterward the variables are passed from the lsm to the routing modules which include the maximum soil moisture for each soil type excess infiltration capacity lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity for each soil type and soil moisture content for each soil layer in this study wrf hydro simulations were performed at a 30 min time step with an lsm grid of 5 km and a routing grid of 500 m over south korea fig 1 first the model was spun up for one year in 2007 the calibration was performed using streamflow data from 2008 to 2010 a period that included normal dry and wet years as detailed in section 2 4 model validation with streamflow was then performed from 2011 to 2015 in this study the run for the entire period from 2008 to 2015 was used to quantify drought characteristics and propagation 2 3 meteorological and land data to drive the standalone wrf hydro meteorological data including surface temperature precipitation humidity wind direction wind speed longwave radiation shortwave radiation and air pressure are required this study used data from the automated surface observing system asos and automatic weather monitoring system aws operated by the kma to generate gridded spatial meteorological data using prism hourly observation data from 76 asos and 388 aws stations fig 1b were used after removing stations with missing data the average distance between each manned asos weather station is approximately 67 km whereas it was 13 km for aws stations aws stations record temperature wind direction wind speed and precipitation as their primary observations certain stations also record atmospheric pressure and humidity asos stations record temperature wind direction wind speed precipitation solar radiation ground surface temperature and soil temperature data prism was used to construct meteorological forcing data every three hours at a 5 km resolution from 2008 to 2015 fig 2 a prism primarily weighs each station point using distance elevation difference aspect difference and oceanic difference between the grid point and station it then performs a simple linear regression for climate elements such as temperature precipitation and humidity at every grid point daly et al 1994 1997 daly 2002 prism has been applied extensively to construct gridded climate data in south korea um et al 2016 um and kim 2017 um and kim 2017 examined spatial variations in the daily averaged maximum and minimum air temperatures in a mountainous region on jeju island in south korea they demonstrated that prism performed reasonably well and the correlation coefficient r2 of temperature between observations and prism simulations ranged from 0 75 to 0 89 furthermore the prism based gridded temperature and precipitation data were compared to those from the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation 2 aphrodite 2 yasutomi et al 2011 from 2008 to 2015 at a 0 25 spatial resolution although we did not compare the two quantitatively due to discrepancies in the spatial resolution the spatial variations in prism were similar to those observed at finer details wrf hydro requires land surface information including information on digital elevation land use leaf area index lai albedo and soil type at the same scale as the lsm grid i e 5 km in this study moreover high resolution fields i e routing grid of 500 m in this study are required for the terrestrial and channel flow stream order and flow direction which are processed from hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds http www hydrosheds org with a spatial resolution of 30 m the observed channel characteristics were obtained from government databases including the river information management geographical information system rimgis http www river go kr water resources management information system wamis http www wamis go kr and the han river flood control office http hrfco go kr based on the collected land data various parameters were estimated according to the stream order the parameters include channel bottom width initial depth of water in the channel side slope of the channel and manning s roughness coefficient table 1 subsequently model calibration was performed as detailed in section 2 4 for model calibration and validation hourly reservoir inflow data of the four dams soyang chungju namgang and yongdam were obtained from wamis fig 1b for further model evaluation the simulated evapotranspiration et and soil moisture which are important components of the water cycle and energy balance of the climate system at various scales zhao and yang 2018 were compared with those from other data products et from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis that is mod16a2 products computed with the modified penman monteith method cleugh et al 2007 are provided at spatial resolutions of 500 m and 1 km ke et al 2016 in this study the 8 day product at a resolution of 500 m was upscaled to the lsm grid 5 km soil moisture data from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci dorigo et al 2017 and from the global land data assimilation system gldas 2 2 rui and beaudoing 2020 were used the esa cci daily surface moisture dataset version 6 1 was used at a resolution of 0 25 however note that it represents soil moisture data at a depth of 2 5 cm and has gaps we also used daily root zone 0 100 cm soil moisture data from gldas at a resolution of 0 25 which were forced by the global meteorological forcing data from princeton university sheffield et al 2006 and then improved with a data assimilation process involving in situ observations and satellite data 2 4 model calibration validation and evaluation the wrf hydro parameters need to be calibrated to simulate streamflow silver et al 2017 yucel et al 2015 manually calibrated three wrf hydro parameters to estimate flash floods using streamflow observations in turkey and identified the most sensitive parameter in the area using manual calibrations givaty et al 2016 also performed manual parameter calibration to improve streamflow simulation with wrf hydro at the ayalon ezra station in israel adjusting the parameters along the length of the catchment area according to the physical characteristics of the basin in addition verri et al 2017 calibrated uncoupled wrf and wrf hydro over the ofran river basin to improve streamflow simulations in italy using the pest software kim et al 2021 calibrated uncoupled wrf hydro in three urban catchments of the dallas fort worth area to capture urban flooding using the ensemble kalman filter implementation of fixed lag smoothing for data assimilation with different resolutions of lsms this study focused on calibrating the parameters to accurately capture the observed streamflow with a calibration period of 2008 2010 and a validation period of 2011 2015 parameters directly related to streamflow were selected including refkdt scaling factor for saturated hydraulic conductivity refdk soil hydraulic parameter ovroughrt scaling factor for overland roughness and slope coefficient governing deep drainage the global parameters i e those stable over the study area were manually calibrated based on 0 5 increment noted as the increment in table 2 from 0 to 3 noted as the range in table 2 the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation rsr r2 and the kling gupta efficiency kge were used to quantify the model prediction accuracy legates and mccabe 1999 santos et al 2018 servat and dezetter 1991 the rsr ranges from 0 with lower values meaning the better model performance the r2 ranges from 1 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match the kge ranges from infinity to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match in general model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if rsr less than 0 7 moriasi et al 2007 r2 0 5 yuan et al 2001 and kge 0 3 knoben et al 2019 the rsr r2 and kge were ranked at the four dam sites r2 and kge were ranked from high to low and rsr was ranked from low to high according to the parameter sets the optimal parameter set was selected using a ranking method the rankings based on the r2 rsr and kge values for each parameter set combination were averaged and the top ranked set of parameters was selected for the present study furthermore we used the accuracy and false alarm rate far to evaluate the model s drought prediction skill which indicate the probability of correct detection and the cases of false detection respectively zhang et al 2021 to evaluate the simulated drought against observed ssfi 1 data based on observed streamflow by wamis higher values of accuracy and lower far values correspond to a better prediction zhu et al 2016 2 5 drought indices for meteorological drought the spi mckee et al 1993 is calculated using precipitation simulated using wrf hydro soil moisture and streamflow are used to calculate the standardized soil moisture index ssmi and ssfi for agricultural and hydrological droughts barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 respectively note that the meteorological and agricultural drought indices were computed based on the areal averages of the gridded precipitation and soil moisture respectively over the study basins and hydrological drought was calculated using the streamflow data at the dam sites the spi designed by mckee et al 1993 was calculated based on long term precipitation data for the desired period the long term data were fitted to a gamma distribution which was then transformed into a normal distribution such that the mean spi for the study location and desired period was zero edwards 1997 gamma distribution is widely used as it is considered to provide a reliable fit for precipitation distribution edwards 1997 moreover spi with a gamma distribution has shown good performance in south korea yoo et al 2013 the same approach was used to calculate ssmi and ssfi for agricultural and hydrological droughts with gamma distribution respectively barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 um et al 2018 furthermore this study estimated standardized indices with daily data to capture drought information over relatively short periods to capture the exact onset and termination days of drought wang et al 2021 following mckee et al 1993 and angelidis et al 2012 the calculations are as follows first the daily sequences of variables i e precipitation soil moisture and streamflow are accumulated at the given timescales as follows x i n t 0 n 1 x i t where x i is the variable at day i and x i k is the cumulative variable over an accumulation timescale of n month which ranges from 1 week i e 0 25 months to 8 months in this study the probability density function of the gamma distribution is formulated as g x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β where α and β are the shape and scale parameters respectively x is the cumulative precipitation and γ α is a gamma function the cumulative probability for a given time is calculated as follows g x 0 x g x d x it is possible to have several zero values in particular for precipitation therefore the cumulative probability function of the gamma distribution in the case of x 0 is modified as follows h x q 1 q g x where q is the probability of zero variables and h x is the cumulative probability of daily variables finally the cumulative probability distribution is normalized to produce standardized indices i e spi ssfi and ssmi as follows standardizedindices t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 t l n 1 h x 2 where c 0 2 55517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 note that the estimated spi ssmi and ssfi with an accumulation timescale of n months are denoted as spi n ssmi n and ssfi n respectively first ssfi 1 and ssmi 1 estimates based on wrf hydro simulation were examined to evaluate the model s drought prediction skill in comparison with the indices derived from other products ssfi with observations and ssmi with esa cci and gldas to characterize historical drought events the occurrence duration frequency severity intensity and timing of the onset and offset of drought events were quantified fig 3 a drought event was defined when the standardized index was less than 1 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 mckee et al 1993 drought duration was defined as the number of days wherein the index was less than 1 and drought frequency was defined as the ratio of the duration to the entire period drought severity and intensity were defined as the average and minimum values of the standardized index during drought events respectively the onset timing of each drought type was compared to explain the lagged timing of droughts the onset of drought and intensity were used to explain the lag and attenuation of drought propagation respectively we estimated the correlation coefficients between different standardized indices at different timescales i e between spi n and ssmi n and between spi n and ssfi n this was conducted to detect the most relevant drought timescales between different drought types wu et al 2020 used a similar approach to determine the relationship between hydrological and meteorological drought at different timescales moreover we summarized drought propagation among the most correlated drought indices through attenuation and lag attenuation is the phenomenon wherein meteorological droughts are attenuated when the storage is high causing a smooth intensity the onsets of agricultural and hydrological droughts occur later than that of meteorological drought a phenomenon called lag van loon et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 constrained wrf hydro wrf hydro was calibrated and evaluated from 2008 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015 respectively using the streamflow data at four sites in south korea fig 4 and table 3 for the calibration period the average r2 kge and rsr values across the four sites were 0 76 0 71 and 0 51 respectively table 3 the values were acceptable based on the thresholds suggested by moriasi et al 2007 for the validation period the average r2 kge and rsr values at the four sites were 0 75 0 70 and 0 68 respectively streamflow at yongdam which is located in the southern part of south korea was relatively well captured by the model as indicated in table 3 the model accuracy at yongdam was the best based on all three metrics during the calibration period and two metrics r2 and kge during the validation period the hydrographs show that wrf hydro tended to overestimate the peak flow in the summer season during the calibration period but it accurately captured the peak flow of the summer season during the validation period the prediction accuracy at soyang was the lowest among the four sites according to the r2 values however the r2 and rsr values remained within an acceptable range during the calibration period in general the streamflow was underestimated compared to the observed inflow at soyang fig 4 the upstream characteristic may be attributed to the distinct results at the two dam sites i e the best performance at yongdam and the worst performance at soyang yongdam is located at a lower elevation with a small upstream area and soyang is located at a high elevation within a forest where complex hydrologic processes such as runoff generation and infiltration may be poorly captured not only in the observation data but also in the model to further evaluate the hydrologic prediction skills of wrf hydro we compared the simulated et soil moisture from wrf hydro with observation data over south korea fig 5 for et fig 5a the r2 between simulated and modis 8 day et was good with a median value of 0 71 we observed that most grids had outliers in the mountainous and coastal areas note that the performances of mod16a2 products are known to be limited under several circumstances e g during the monsoon season owing to extensive cloud cover jang et al 2013 over mountainous areas kiptala et al 2013 however modis data are useful for elucidating hydrological processes especially where complex terrain renders the observation of water flux difficult for soil moisture the first layer of simulated soil moisture and the esa cci soil moisture were compared fig 5b note that the first layer of the model represents a soil depth from 0 cm ground surface to 10 cm and that of the esa cci represents a depth from 2 to 5 cm which limits direct comparisons between the two products nevertheless it is still useful to examine the relationship the median r2 was 0 49 with relatively low values along the coast according to koster et al 2009 substantial work is still required for using satellite based soil moisture and dorigo et al 2017 pointed out that complex topography surface water and urban structure adversely affect eas cci data quality in addition the soil moisture content of gldas was compared fig 5c over most of the area a relatively high r2 was achieved with a median value of 0 52 in general the wrf hydro simulated soil moisture was in agreement with that of gldas however note that both esa cci and gladas 2 2 have a resolution of 0 25 which is larger than the lsm resolution of wrf hydro i e 5 km 3 2 drought prediction skill of wrf hydro the hydrological and agricultural drought indices simulated with the constrained wrf hydro were used to evaluate the model s drought prediction skill in this section table 4 and fig 6 note that the ssfi with observational streamflow is available but the ssmi from data assimilation i e gldas was used here ssmi with the esa cci soil moisture was not used in this section because its data quality is limited and gap filling for estimating the ssmi for model evaluation is beyond the scope of this study we estimated the accuracy and far of the simulated hydrological drought indices against the observational hydrologic indices with the streamflow at the four dam sites table 4 the average accuracy was higher than 0 8 especially at soyang with 0 89 the highest value among the four sites in addition the far was less than 0 2 at all sites and that at chungju was the lowest across the four sites among the four sites namgang had the lowest accuracy values and the highest far which is not captured in the performance measures with r2 kge and rsr in table 3 nevertheless the wrf hydro can accurately capture observed drought events for agricultural drought the wrf hydro simulated and gldas soil moisture drought i e ssmi were examined for extreme drought cases in the northeastern part of south korea from 2014 to 2015 park et al 2015 fig 6 during the period precipitation was only half of the multi year average which led to the lowest inflows to the dams since 1978 park et al 2015 overall the comparisons between wrf hydro and gldas revealed similar spatial trends and captured the expected drought pattens even though wrf hydro is based on a 5 km resolution and gldas has a 0 25 resolution soil moisture drought was captured using wrf hydro from 2014 to 2015 over most of the area the northern part of south korea showed a drought frequency of 30 which was higher than that of other regions the droughts were extreme as intensities of 2 98 and 2 92 were obtained with wrf hydro and gldas respectively according to jung et al 2020 the gldas tends to underestimate ssmi over south korea based on the case of may 2015 which was also observed to some extent in our comparison 3 3 drought characteristics at the four sites in this section the simulated daily hydrologic variables such as streamflow and soil moisture in addition to the observed daily precipitation were used to estimate drought indices at the four dam sites figs 7 and 8 to compare the characteristics of each drought type variations in drought indices over the study period were investigated using spi ssfi and ssmi at different timescales 1 3 and 6 months fig 7 presents the yongdam case as an example since figs s1 s3 of supplementary information present for the other study sites similar to the yongdam the number of drought events per year and the duration of each event are summarized in fig 7 and fig 8 as shown in both fig 7 and the upper panel of fig 8 more meteorological drought events occurred than hydrological and agricultural droughts at most timescales at different sites at a 1 month timescale for example meteorological droughts occurred 3 1 times per year on average across the four sites however the average numbers of hydrological 1 2 and agricultural 1 7 droughts were lower than that of meteorological drought this finding is consistent with that of van loon et al 2012 who demonstrated that the average number of meteorological drought events was approximately three times those of the other types of droughts in spain furthermore the drought durations among the three different types of droughts varied oppositely to the number of drought events the shortest duration was observed for meteorological droughts and the durations of hydrological and agricultural droughts were relatively similar for example at a 1 month timescale the average durations of meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts across the four sites were 53 65 and 83 days respectively lower panel of fig 8 tallaksen et al 2009 reported that in pang catchment area in uk the duration of meteorological droughts was short 1 2 months whereas that of hydrological droughts was longer than that of meteorological drought 4 5 months 3 4 correlations and drought propagation between different types of droughts in this section we explore drought propagation features from meteorological droughts to hydrological and agricultural droughts the correlations between spi and ssfi and spi and ssmi at the timescales from 0 25 months to 8 months were calculated to identify the sets of drought indices with the highest correlations the sets of drought indices were then used to investigate drought propagation features for selected historical drought events correlation analyses between different types of droughts at different timescales were performed as summarized in fig 9 and figs s4 s6 of supplementary information there were high correlations i e dark red colors in the heat maps between the meteorological and hydrological droughts fig 9a at timescales of 3 and 6 months across the four sites and the highest correlation 0 82 was observed between the 6 month spi and 5 5 month ssfi in general spis exhibited strong associations with corresponding ssfis with timescale that was 2 weeks shorter in other words 1 3 and 6 month spis which are commonly used for meteorological drought were strongly associated with 0 5 2 5 and 5 5 month ssfi respectively right panel of fig 9a note that the longer timescales of spis showed higher correlations with the corresponding ssfi with a two week shorter timescale furthermore the correlations between spi and ssmi fig 9b were lower than those between spi and ssfi fig 9a the highest correlations between spi and ssmi at each site were 0 71 0 61 0 72 and 0 68 in the soyang chungju namgang and yongdam basins respectively similar to the relationship between spi and ssfi spis at longer timescales had higher correlations with ssmis based on the correlation analyses the sets of drought indices were determined to investigate drought propagation features in the four selected drought events fig 10 we used 1 3 and 6 month spis and their corresponding agricultural and hydrological drought indices based on the strongest correlations e g 0 5 month ssfi and 0 5 month ssmi with 1 month spi the four drought events at soyang in 2015 chungju in 2013 namgang in 2013 and yongdam in 2013 were selected based on historical drought records as well as the correlation analysis results in the previous section first the time evolution of drought indices and thus drought propagation characteristics are clearly shown using the indices with longer timescales as expected therefore we quantified the drought lag and propagation for the 3 month spi with 2 5 month ssfi and 3 month ssmi and 6 month spi with 5 5 month ssfi and 5 month ssmi all four drought events with 3 and 6 month spis clearly show that hydrological and agricultural droughts lagged slightly after their associated meteorological droughts the average lag between the meteorological and hydrological agricultural droughts ranged from 18 to 32 days from 15 to 42 days for the 3 month spi and from 30 to 60 days from 30 to 60 days for the 6 month spi the longer the timescales of drought indices the greater the lag from meteorological to other droughts in addition we did not observe a clear lag relationship between hydrological and agricultural droughts for example in the case of namgang in 2013 hydrological drought lagged behind agricultural drought and the opposite was observed in the case of chungju in 2013 the lags of spi 3 in this study are consistent with the results of li et al 2018 showing that the lags of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological and agricultural drought in china were 26 8 and 21 3 days respectively however oertel et al 2018 used 6 month spei ssmi and ssfi and showed that propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts lagged by about 1 and 4 months in mexico and chile respectively but no lag occurred for propagation from meteorological to agricultural droughts moreover attenuation was examined by investigating drought intensity with drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts the attenuation was captured in most cases of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought showing an attenuated intensity of 0 5 on average among the timescales the spi 6 cases showed less attenuation at all sites the observation is consistent with the results of bayissa et al 2019 and sohrabi et al 2015 who showed that hydrological drought was less severe than meteorological drought however the attenuation from meteorological to agricultural drought was not observed in most cases in the cases of soyang with spi 1 yongdam with spi 1 and chungju with spi 6 the intensity tended to be amplified during drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought other cases of drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought showed similar intensities we found no previous studies that demonstrated such characteristics of attenuation i e no signals of attenuation from meteorological to agricultural droughts 4 conclusions this study examined drought characteristics using constrained wrf hydro in south korea wrf hydro was calibrated to better simulate streamflow at four selected sites with r2 kge and rsr values between simulated streamflows and observed inflows of 0 76 0 71 and 0 51 respectively averaged across four sites after calibration meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts were examined using standardized indices the accuracy and far of the simulated hydrological drought against observed hydrological drought were 0 87 and 0 13 respectively among the four sites the number of droughts per year and their durations were also examined with commonly used timescale standardized indices i e 1 3 and 6 months meteorological droughts were the shortest in all study areas in addition there were fewer agricultural and hydrological droughts per year 1 9 and 1 4 respectively than meteorological droughts 4 3 the durations of agricultural and hydrological droughts were three times longer than those of meteorological droughts moreover drought propagation characteristics were captured agricultural and hydrological droughts lagged behind meteorological droughts by approximately 3 4 weeks the attenuation of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought was approximately 0 5 on average in some cases but the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought did not show attenuation in south korea obtaining quantitative information through modeling systems could facilitate drought risk management by policymakers wrf hydro has the potential to provide consistent information such as streamflow surface runoff inflow and soil moisture data for water management in particular simulated soil moisture is useful because of the lack of observational data for the variable in addition to soil moisture streamflow surface runoff and subsurface runoff can be used to detect drought and drought propagation this study shows that simulated information with constrained wrf hydro can be used to calculate standardized drought indices which are useful for demonstrating the characteristics of various types of droughts and predicting drought propagation although the calibrated model performance with streamflow was reasonable over south korea the inherent limits of lsms still apply to this study lsms are limited in their capacity to capture observations because of the limited grasp of physical processes potential errors in input forcing and other numerical errors in model operations barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 quintana seguí et al 2020 showed that uncertainties in lsm formulation are a major issue in soil moisture streamflow drought and drought propagation estimation ukkola et al 2016 estimated evaporative drought using 14 lsms and demonstrated the benefits and limitations of lsms despite the limitations of lsms they are a useful tool for estimating drought characteristics in addition this study was limited in that the model was calibrated against the observed streamflow therefore further research is required to improve the prediction skills of wrf hydro by applying it in combination with other observational data sets such as soil moisture credit authorship

3534,drought is a complex and slow moving disaster that is difficult to monitor and define this study therefore aims to demonstrate the characteristics of recent droughts occurring from 2008 to 2015 over south korea using a process based land and hydrologic model weather research and forecasting hydro modeling system wrf hydro to drive the standalone wrf hydro gridded meteorological data 5 km were generated using station based observations and the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism the model was calibrated and evaluated using inflow observations at four locations with dams for 2008 2010 calibration and 2011 2015 evaluation it demonstrated average r2 values of 0 80 and 0 75 respectively while standardized precipitation index is used for calculating meteorological drought using precipitation from prism standardized soil moisture index and standardized streamflow index at different timescales are used to calculate agricultural and hydrological droughts respectively with wrf hydro simulations the correlation coefficients between spi and both ssfi and ssmi were calculated to detect their response times the hydrological and agricultural droughts showed response times 0 5 1 month later than meteorological drought in 2008 2015 agricultural and hydrological drought events occurred 1 6 times per year on average in south korea whereas meteorological droughts occurred 4 3 times per year on average agricultural and hydrological droughts lagged behind meteorological droughts by up to 53 65 and 83 days when using 1 3 and 6 month spi respectively moreover hydrological droughts were less severe than meteorological droughts due to the propagation of drought by attenuation this study demonstrates that wrf hydro can be used to quantitatively determine the different types of drought events and their propagation which could help policy makers manage drought risks keywords wrf hydro drought characteristics drought propagation standardized index 1 introduction recent climate and environmental change have led to an increasing number of disasters worldwide with droughts being the costliest type of disaster affecting a large number of people annually cook et al 2014 on average 6 to 8 billion us dollars is spent annually to mitigate the effects of global and regional drought wilhite 2000 in addition droughts are expected to increase in frequency and severity in the future due to climate change sheffield et al 2012 droughts are often classified into categories such as meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 a meteorological drought is characterized by water shortage due to an imbalance in the precipitation and evaporation cycles whereas an agricultural drought is characterized by the depletion of soil moisture to an extent that crop and pasture yields are affected significantly thober et al 2015 dalezios 2017 zhong et al 2020 conversely hydrological drought occurs when surface or subsurface hydrology are adversely affected for example in the form of low streamflow ground runoff or lake and river levels drought types can change over time over the course of the drought propagation process wang et al 2016 gevaert et al 2018 wu et al 2020 nevertheless different types of droughts tend to interact for example precipitation deficits can propagate into hydrological systems inducing an agricultural drought in irrigated areas from a meteorological drought which further depends on several factors such as soil type storage water retention capacity and evapotranspiration bae et al 2019 van loon 2015 addressed drought propagation as the transition from a meteorological drought to a hydrological drought and identified three features of drought propagation including pooling attenuation and lengthening in addition barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 demonstrated that each drought maintains its own characteristics when propagating to another therefore analyzing the mechanisms via which drought propagation occurs from meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts is essential for water resource management zhao et al 2014 compared meteorological drought standardized precipitation index spi and hydrological drought standardized runoff index sri in the jinghe basin of china using standardized methods established by mckee 1993 they showed that hydrological droughts occur later than meteorological droughts using observed precipitation and runoff data from gauges and stations they also confirmed that drought frequency and duration decreased when propagation occurred from meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts in addition gu et al 2020 examined the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in three regions in china they identified a lag in propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought moreover they showed that meteorological drought duration and severity were amplified when they were propagated from hydrological droughts in the catchments recent studies zhao et al 2014 wu et al 2021 have used various indices at different timescales to demonstrate drought propagation zhao et al 2016 computed drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought using sri over a one month timescale and with different timescales of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei spei based on a two month timescale exhibited an optimal correlation with sri on a one month timescale moreover a higher correlation coefficient was obtained in the dry season whereas the minimum was observed in the wet season wu et al 2021 estimated drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought for timescales of 1 3 and 6 months they argued that the different timescales applied for the hydrological drought index standardized streamflow index ssfi and meteorological drought index spi had different sensitivities to drought events land surface models lsms are often used to predict and understand the drought characteristics e g shukla and wood 2008 um et al 2018 barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 mehboob et al 2020 lsms have an advantage over satellite data in that they allow long term simulations including those of variables such as root zone soil moisture which are difficult to observe from space shukla and wood 2008 used a physically based semi distributed macro scale variable infiltration capacity vic model to simulate the land surface water balance they then evaluated hydrological drought in the snowmelt region of california their results suggested that monthly and seasonal hydrological drought simulations from the vic model complement meteorological drought prediction and facilitate the depiction of the hydrological aspects of drought barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 estimated meteorological to hydrological drought propagation and soil moisture droughts in spain they showed that precipitation during model formulation can influence hydrological variables such as soil moisture and streamflow the variables influence drought and drought propagation furthermore according to yoo et al 2013 and wang et al 2021 the capacity of monthly spi to capture drought events with short durations such as less than 1 month is limited therefore lsms offer an opportunity to understand drought processes at finer temporal resolutions e g daily than observational data which may be limited in providing all the necessary hydrologic variables consistently over such temporal scales recently the weather research and forecasting hydro modeling system wrf hydro has been developed to improve the simulations of land surface hydrology at a fairly high spatial resolution e g up to 1 km or lower gochis et al 2018 the model has been evaluated based on discharge and streamflow in several regions of the united states lin et al 2018 africa arnault et al 2016 kerandi et al 2018 naabil et al 2017 and mediterranean regions givati et al 2016 givati et al 2016 compared the results of wrf hydro and the hydrological engineering center hydrological modeling system hec hms with multiple atmospheric data sources and the results suggested that the coupled wrf hydro could simulate precipitation well thus improving hydrological forecasts for example in the case of flood and drought warnings some recent studies e g bae et al 2019 sattar et al 2019 have addressed the issue of drought propagation over south korea bae et al 2019 investigated drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological and agricultural droughts using observed precipitation and dam levels they demonstrated the seasonal characteristics of drought propagation during the wet and dry seasons hydrological and agricultural droughts tend to propagate from meteorological droughts in the dry season because a substantial volume of irrigation water is consumed however in the wet season meteorological drought does not cause other droughts because precipitation is used instead of dam stored water sattar et al 2019 estimated the monthly spi and sri with gauge precipitation and precipitation runoff models respectively to analyze the spatial distribution of lag in drought propagation they demonstrated that when the lag time was long the intensity of the meteorological drought was moderate such studies provide limited depictions of drought propagation over south korea therefore the quantitative characteristics of drought propagation need to be demonstrated at finer temporal scales in south korea therefore this study investigated the characteristics of recent droughts and their propagation over south korea using wrf hydro specifically the standalone wrf hydro was applied in south korea by constructing meteorological forcing using the parameter elevation regression on independent model prism and by calibrating the model parameters using dam inflow observations at four selected sites fig 1 this constrained wrf hydro was then used to simulate hydrologic processes over south korea daily precipitation data from observations and daily soil moisture and streamflow data from wrf hydro simulations were used to derive standardized indices at multiple timescales ranging from 1 week to 8 months the standardized indices were estimated from daily data to capture drought over relatively short periods the indices were then used to quantitatively describe the characteristics of meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts and their propagation 2 methods and data 2 1 study area this study was carried out in south korea between 33 5 n and 41 n and between 124 5 w and 130 w the study focused on four dam sites soyang chungju yongdam and namgang fig 1 note that there are no upstream dams for the four sites which was required as the wrf hydro does not simulate dam operation in south korea precipitation is concentrated during the wet summer monsoon season the annual average temperature is 12 8 c and the annual precipitation is 1253 2 mm from 2008 to 2015 according to the korea meteorological administration kma the occurrence of extreme drought events has increased in the east asia region including south korea due to the effects of the east asian monsoon zhang and zhou 2015 kim et al 2012 investigated summer precipitation trends in south korea in historical periods using daily precipitation data they showed an increase in summer precipitation and a decrease in the number of dry days from 1973 to 2007 nonetheless kwon et al 2016 showed that south korea has been experiencing four to six year cycles of nationwide droughts since 1960 an extreme drought occurred from 2013 to 2015 when the annual precipitation was significantly lower than the average for two consecutive years the period is considered to be the worst drought in the past 50 years kwon et al 2016 2 2 land and hydrologic modeling system wrf hydro is a hydrological model system that integrates various terrestrial and hydrological processes to simulate water energy and fluxes between the land and atmosphere gochis et al 2018 in this study wrf hydro was operated in standalone mode as a traditional land surface hydrologic modeling system wrf hydro contains several components of the distributed hydrological process and channel flow its main strength is the routing of both saturated subsurface water and excess infiltration capacity in particular excess routed infiltration together with additional exfiltration from saturated soil is not simply removed from the system rather it is allowed to pond on the surface move laterally and reinfiltrate senatore et al 2015 the moisture states are disaggregated from the lsm grid to the high resolution routing grid using a subgrid aggregation disaggregation procedure scheme based on the spatial weighting method and then passed onto the routing routines afterward the variables are passed from the lsm to the routing modules which include the maximum soil moisture for each soil type excess infiltration capacity lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity for each soil type and soil moisture content for each soil layer in this study wrf hydro simulations were performed at a 30 min time step with an lsm grid of 5 km and a routing grid of 500 m over south korea fig 1 first the model was spun up for one year in 2007 the calibration was performed using streamflow data from 2008 to 2010 a period that included normal dry and wet years as detailed in section 2 4 model validation with streamflow was then performed from 2011 to 2015 in this study the run for the entire period from 2008 to 2015 was used to quantify drought characteristics and propagation 2 3 meteorological and land data to drive the standalone wrf hydro meteorological data including surface temperature precipitation humidity wind direction wind speed longwave radiation shortwave radiation and air pressure are required this study used data from the automated surface observing system asos and automatic weather monitoring system aws operated by the kma to generate gridded spatial meteorological data using prism hourly observation data from 76 asos and 388 aws stations fig 1b were used after removing stations with missing data the average distance between each manned asos weather station is approximately 67 km whereas it was 13 km for aws stations aws stations record temperature wind direction wind speed and precipitation as their primary observations certain stations also record atmospheric pressure and humidity asos stations record temperature wind direction wind speed precipitation solar radiation ground surface temperature and soil temperature data prism was used to construct meteorological forcing data every three hours at a 5 km resolution from 2008 to 2015 fig 2 a prism primarily weighs each station point using distance elevation difference aspect difference and oceanic difference between the grid point and station it then performs a simple linear regression for climate elements such as temperature precipitation and humidity at every grid point daly et al 1994 1997 daly 2002 prism has been applied extensively to construct gridded climate data in south korea um et al 2016 um and kim 2017 um and kim 2017 examined spatial variations in the daily averaged maximum and minimum air temperatures in a mountainous region on jeju island in south korea they demonstrated that prism performed reasonably well and the correlation coefficient r2 of temperature between observations and prism simulations ranged from 0 75 to 0 89 furthermore the prism based gridded temperature and precipitation data were compared to those from the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation 2 aphrodite 2 yasutomi et al 2011 from 2008 to 2015 at a 0 25 spatial resolution although we did not compare the two quantitatively due to discrepancies in the spatial resolution the spatial variations in prism were similar to those observed at finer details wrf hydro requires land surface information including information on digital elevation land use leaf area index lai albedo and soil type at the same scale as the lsm grid i e 5 km in this study moreover high resolution fields i e routing grid of 500 m in this study are required for the terrestrial and channel flow stream order and flow direction which are processed from hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds http www hydrosheds org with a spatial resolution of 30 m the observed channel characteristics were obtained from government databases including the river information management geographical information system rimgis http www river go kr water resources management information system wamis http www wamis go kr and the han river flood control office http hrfco go kr based on the collected land data various parameters were estimated according to the stream order the parameters include channel bottom width initial depth of water in the channel side slope of the channel and manning s roughness coefficient table 1 subsequently model calibration was performed as detailed in section 2 4 for model calibration and validation hourly reservoir inflow data of the four dams soyang chungju namgang and yongdam were obtained from wamis fig 1b for further model evaluation the simulated evapotranspiration et and soil moisture which are important components of the water cycle and energy balance of the climate system at various scales zhao and yang 2018 were compared with those from other data products et from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis that is mod16a2 products computed with the modified penman monteith method cleugh et al 2007 are provided at spatial resolutions of 500 m and 1 km ke et al 2016 in this study the 8 day product at a resolution of 500 m was upscaled to the lsm grid 5 km soil moisture data from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci dorigo et al 2017 and from the global land data assimilation system gldas 2 2 rui and beaudoing 2020 were used the esa cci daily surface moisture dataset version 6 1 was used at a resolution of 0 25 however note that it represents soil moisture data at a depth of 2 5 cm and has gaps we also used daily root zone 0 100 cm soil moisture data from gldas at a resolution of 0 25 which were forced by the global meteorological forcing data from princeton university sheffield et al 2006 and then improved with a data assimilation process involving in situ observations and satellite data 2 4 model calibration validation and evaluation the wrf hydro parameters need to be calibrated to simulate streamflow silver et al 2017 yucel et al 2015 manually calibrated three wrf hydro parameters to estimate flash floods using streamflow observations in turkey and identified the most sensitive parameter in the area using manual calibrations givaty et al 2016 also performed manual parameter calibration to improve streamflow simulation with wrf hydro at the ayalon ezra station in israel adjusting the parameters along the length of the catchment area according to the physical characteristics of the basin in addition verri et al 2017 calibrated uncoupled wrf and wrf hydro over the ofran river basin to improve streamflow simulations in italy using the pest software kim et al 2021 calibrated uncoupled wrf hydro in three urban catchments of the dallas fort worth area to capture urban flooding using the ensemble kalman filter implementation of fixed lag smoothing for data assimilation with different resolutions of lsms this study focused on calibrating the parameters to accurately capture the observed streamflow with a calibration period of 2008 2010 and a validation period of 2011 2015 parameters directly related to streamflow were selected including refkdt scaling factor for saturated hydraulic conductivity refdk soil hydraulic parameter ovroughrt scaling factor for overland roughness and slope coefficient governing deep drainage the global parameters i e those stable over the study area were manually calibrated based on 0 5 increment noted as the increment in table 2 from 0 to 3 noted as the range in table 2 the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation rsr r2 and the kling gupta efficiency kge were used to quantify the model prediction accuracy legates and mccabe 1999 santos et al 2018 servat and dezetter 1991 the rsr ranges from 0 with lower values meaning the better model performance the r2 ranges from 1 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match the kge ranges from infinity to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match in general model simulation can be judged as satisfactory if rsr less than 0 7 moriasi et al 2007 r2 0 5 yuan et al 2001 and kge 0 3 knoben et al 2019 the rsr r2 and kge were ranked at the four dam sites r2 and kge were ranked from high to low and rsr was ranked from low to high according to the parameter sets the optimal parameter set was selected using a ranking method the rankings based on the r2 rsr and kge values for each parameter set combination were averaged and the top ranked set of parameters was selected for the present study furthermore we used the accuracy and false alarm rate far to evaluate the model s drought prediction skill which indicate the probability of correct detection and the cases of false detection respectively zhang et al 2021 to evaluate the simulated drought against observed ssfi 1 data based on observed streamflow by wamis higher values of accuracy and lower far values correspond to a better prediction zhu et al 2016 2 5 drought indices for meteorological drought the spi mckee et al 1993 is calculated using precipitation simulated using wrf hydro soil moisture and streamflow are used to calculate the standardized soil moisture index ssmi and ssfi for agricultural and hydrological droughts barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 respectively note that the meteorological and agricultural drought indices were computed based on the areal averages of the gridded precipitation and soil moisture respectively over the study basins and hydrological drought was calculated using the streamflow data at the dam sites the spi designed by mckee et al 1993 was calculated based on long term precipitation data for the desired period the long term data were fitted to a gamma distribution which was then transformed into a normal distribution such that the mean spi for the study location and desired period was zero edwards 1997 gamma distribution is widely used as it is considered to provide a reliable fit for precipitation distribution edwards 1997 moreover spi with a gamma distribution has shown good performance in south korea yoo et al 2013 the same approach was used to calculate ssmi and ssfi for agricultural and hydrological droughts with gamma distribution respectively barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 um et al 2018 furthermore this study estimated standardized indices with daily data to capture drought information over relatively short periods to capture the exact onset and termination days of drought wang et al 2021 following mckee et al 1993 and angelidis et al 2012 the calculations are as follows first the daily sequences of variables i e precipitation soil moisture and streamflow are accumulated at the given timescales as follows x i n t 0 n 1 x i t where x i is the variable at day i and x i k is the cumulative variable over an accumulation timescale of n month which ranges from 1 week i e 0 25 months to 8 months in this study the probability density function of the gamma distribution is formulated as g x 1 β α γ α x α 1 e x β where α and β are the shape and scale parameters respectively x is the cumulative precipitation and γ α is a gamma function the cumulative probability for a given time is calculated as follows g x 0 x g x d x it is possible to have several zero values in particular for precipitation therefore the cumulative probability function of the gamma distribution in the case of x 0 is modified as follows h x q 1 q g x where q is the probability of zero variables and h x is the cumulative probability of daily variables finally the cumulative probability distribution is normalized to produce standardized indices i e spi ssfi and ssmi as follows standardizedindices t c 0 c 1 t c 2 t 2 1 d 1 t d 2 t 2 d 3 t 3 t l n 1 h x 2 where c 0 2 55517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 and d 3 0 001308 note that the estimated spi ssmi and ssfi with an accumulation timescale of n months are denoted as spi n ssmi n and ssfi n respectively first ssfi 1 and ssmi 1 estimates based on wrf hydro simulation were examined to evaluate the model s drought prediction skill in comparison with the indices derived from other products ssfi with observations and ssmi with esa cci and gldas to characterize historical drought events the occurrence duration frequency severity intensity and timing of the onset and offset of drought events were quantified fig 3 a drought event was defined when the standardized index was less than 1 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 mckee et al 1993 drought duration was defined as the number of days wherein the index was less than 1 and drought frequency was defined as the ratio of the duration to the entire period drought severity and intensity were defined as the average and minimum values of the standardized index during drought events respectively the onset timing of each drought type was compared to explain the lagged timing of droughts the onset of drought and intensity were used to explain the lag and attenuation of drought propagation respectively we estimated the correlation coefficients between different standardized indices at different timescales i e between spi n and ssmi n and between spi n and ssfi n this was conducted to detect the most relevant drought timescales between different drought types wu et al 2020 used a similar approach to determine the relationship between hydrological and meteorological drought at different timescales moreover we summarized drought propagation among the most correlated drought indices through attenuation and lag attenuation is the phenomenon wherein meteorological droughts are attenuated when the storage is high causing a smooth intensity the onsets of agricultural and hydrological droughts occur later than that of meteorological drought a phenomenon called lag van loon et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 constrained wrf hydro wrf hydro was calibrated and evaluated from 2008 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015 respectively using the streamflow data at four sites in south korea fig 4 and table 3 for the calibration period the average r2 kge and rsr values across the four sites were 0 76 0 71 and 0 51 respectively table 3 the values were acceptable based on the thresholds suggested by moriasi et al 2007 for the validation period the average r2 kge and rsr values at the four sites were 0 75 0 70 and 0 68 respectively streamflow at yongdam which is located in the southern part of south korea was relatively well captured by the model as indicated in table 3 the model accuracy at yongdam was the best based on all three metrics during the calibration period and two metrics r2 and kge during the validation period the hydrographs show that wrf hydro tended to overestimate the peak flow in the summer season during the calibration period but it accurately captured the peak flow of the summer season during the validation period the prediction accuracy at soyang was the lowest among the four sites according to the r2 values however the r2 and rsr values remained within an acceptable range during the calibration period in general the streamflow was underestimated compared to the observed inflow at soyang fig 4 the upstream characteristic may be attributed to the distinct results at the two dam sites i e the best performance at yongdam and the worst performance at soyang yongdam is located at a lower elevation with a small upstream area and soyang is located at a high elevation within a forest where complex hydrologic processes such as runoff generation and infiltration may be poorly captured not only in the observation data but also in the model to further evaluate the hydrologic prediction skills of wrf hydro we compared the simulated et soil moisture from wrf hydro with observation data over south korea fig 5 for et fig 5a the r2 between simulated and modis 8 day et was good with a median value of 0 71 we observed that most grids had outliers in the mountainous and coastal areas note that the performances of mod16a2 products are known to be limited under several circumstances e g during the monsoon season owing to extensive cloud cover jang et al 2013 over mountainous areas kiptala et al 2013 however modis data are useful for elucidating hydrological processes especially where complex terrain renders the observation of water flux difficult for soil moisture the first layer of simulated soil moisture and the esa cci soil moisture were compared fig 5b note that the first layer of the model represents a soil depth from 0 cm ground surface to 10 cm and that of the esa cci represents a depth from 2 to 5 cm which limits direct comparisons between the two products nevertheless it is still useful to examine the relationship the median r2 was 0 49 with relatively low values along the coast according to koster et al 2009 substantial work is still required for using satellite based soil moisture and dorigo et al 2017 pointed out that complex topography surface water and urban structure adversely affect eas cci data quality in addition the soil moisture content of gldas was compared fig 5c over most of the area a relatively high r2 was achieved with a median value of 0 52 in general the wrf hydro simulated soil moisture was in agreement with that of gldas however note that both esa cci and gladas 2 2 have a resolution of 0 25 which is larger than the lsm resolution of wrf hydro i e 5 km 3 2 drought prediction skill of wrf hydro the hydrological and agricultural drought indices simulated with the constrained wrf hydro were used to evaluate the model s drought prediction skill in this section table 4 and fig 6 note that the ssfi with observational streamflow is available but the ssmi from data assimilation i e gldas was used here ssmi with the esa cci soil moisture was not used in this section because its data quality is limited and gap filling for estimating the ssmi for model evaluation is beyond the scope of this study we estimated the accuracy and far of the simulated hydrological drought indices against the observational hydrologic indices with the streamflow at the four dam sites table 4 the average accuracy was higher than 0 8 especially at soyang with 0 89 the highest value among the four sites in addition the far was less than 0 2 at all sites and that at chungju was the lowest across the four sites among the four sites namgang had the lowest accuracy values and the highest far which is not captured in the performance measures with r2 kge and rsr in table 3 nevertheless the wrf hydro can accurately capture observed drought events for agricultural drought the wrf hydro simulated and gldas soil moisture drought i e ssmi were examined for extreme drought cases in the northeastern part of south korea from 2014 to 2015 park et al 2015 fig 6 during the period precipitation was only half of the multi year average which led to the lowest inflows to the dams since 1978 park et al 2015 overall the comparisons between wrf hydro and gldas revealed similar spatial trends and captured the expected drought pattens even though wrf hydro is based on a 5 km resolution and gldas has a 0 25 resolution soil moisture drought was captured using wrf hydro from 2014 to 2015 over most of the area the northern part of south korea showed a drought frequency of 30 which was higher than that of other regions the droughts were extreme as intensities of 2 98 and 2 92 were obtained with wrf hydro and gldas respectively according to jung et al 2020 the gldas tends to underestimate ssmi over south korea based on the case of may 2015 which was also observed to some extent in our comparison 3 3 drought characteristics at the four sites in this section the simulated daily hydrologic variables such as streamflow and soil moisture in addition to the observed daily precipitation were used to estimate drought indices at the four dam sites figs 7 and 8 to compare the characteristics of each drought type variations in drought indices over the study period were investigated using spi ssfi and ssmi at different timescales 1 3 and 6 months fig 7 presents the yongdam case as an example since figs s1 s3 of supplementary information present for the other study sites similar to the yongdam the number of drought events per year and the duration of each event are summarized in fig 7 and fig 8 as shown in both fig 7 and the upper panel of fig 8 more meteorological drought events occurred than hydrological and agricultural droughts at most timescales at different sites at a 1 month timescale for example meteorological droughts occurred 3 1 times per year on average across the four sites however the average numbers of hydrological 1 2 and agricultural 1 7 droughts were lower than that of meteorological drought this finding is consistent with that of van loon et al 2012 who demonstrated that the average number of meteorological drought events was approximately three times those of the other types of droughts in spain furthermore the drought durations among the three different types of droughts varied oppositely to the number of drought events the shortest duration was observed for meteorological droughts and the durations of hydrological and agricultural droughts were relatively similar for example at a 1 month timescale the average durations of meteorological hydrological and agricultural droughts across the four sites were 53 65 and 83 days respectively lower panel of fig 8 tallaksen et al 2009 reported that in pang catchment area in uk the duration of meteorological droughts was short 1 2 months whereas that of hydrological droughts was longer than that of meteorological drought 4 5 months 3 4 correlations and drought propagation between different types of droughts in this section we explore drought propagation features from meteorological droughts to hydrological and agricultural droughts the correlations between spi and ssfi and spi and ssmi at the timescales from 0 25 months to 8 months were calculated to identify the sets of drought indices with the highest correlations the sets of drought indices were then used to investigate drought propagation features for selected historical drought events correlation analyses between different types of droughts at different timescales were performed as summarized in fig 9 and figs s4 s6 of supplementary information there were high correlations i e dark red colors in the heat maps between the meteorological and hydrological droughts fig 9a at timescales of 3 and 6 months across the four sites and the highest correlation 0 82 was observed between the 6 month spi and 5 5 month ssfi in general spis exhibited strong associations with corresponding ssfis with timescale that was 2 weeks shorter in other words 1 3 and 6 month spis which are commonly used for meteorological drought were strongly associated with 0 5 2 5 and 5 5 month ssfi respectively right panel of fig 9a note that the longer timescales of spis showed higher correlations with the corresponding ssfi with a two week shorter timescale furthermore the correlations between spi and ssmi fig 9b were lower than those between spi and ssfi fig 9a the highest correlations between spi and ssmi at each site were 0 71 0 61 0 72 and 0 68 in the soyang chungju namgang and yongdam basins respectively similar to the relationship between spi and ssfi spis at longer timescales had higher correlations with ssmis based on the correlation analyses the sets of drought indices were determined to investigate drought propagation features in the four selected drought events fig 10 we used 1 3 and 6 month spis and their corresponding agricultural and hydrological drought indices based on the strongest correlations e g 0 5 month ssfi and 0 5 month ssmi with 1 month spi the four drought events at soyang in 2015 chungju in 2013 namgang in 2013 and yongdam in 2013 were selected based on historical drought records as well as the correlation analysis results in the previous section first the time evolution of drought indices and thus drought propagation characteristics are clearly shown using the indices with longer timescales as expected therefore we quantified the drought lag and propagation for the 3 month spi with 2 5 month ssfi and 3 month ssmi and 6 month spi with 5 5 month ssfi and 5 month ssmi all four drought events with 3 and 6 month spis clearly show that hydrological and agricultural droughts lagged slightly after their associated meteorological droughts the average lag between the meteorological and hydrological agricultural droughts ranged from 18 to 32 days from 15 to 42 days for the 3 month spi and from 30 to 60 days from 30 to 60 days for the 6 month spi the longer the timescales of drought indices the greater the lag from meteorological to other droughts in addition we did not observe a clear lag relationship between hydrological and agricultural droughts for example in the case of namgang in 2013 hydrological drought lagged behind agricultural drought and the opposite was observed in the case of chungju in 2013 the lags of spi 3 in this study are consistent with the results of li et al 2018 showing that the lags of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological and agricultural drought in china were 26 8 and 21 3 days respectively however oertel et al 2018 used 6 month spei ssmi and ssfi and showed that propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts lagged by about 1 and 4 months in mexico and chile respectively but no lag occurred for propagation from meteorological to agricultural droughts moreover attenuation was examined by investigating drought intensity with drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural and hydrological droughts the attenuation was captured in most cases of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought showing an attenuated intensity of 0 5 on average among the timescales the spi 6 cases showed less attenuation at all sites the observation is consistent with the results of bayissa et al 2019 and sohrabi et al 2015 who showed that hydrological drought was less severe than meteorological drought however the attenuation from meteorological to agricultural drought was not observed in most cases in the cases of soyang with spi 1 yongdam with spi 1 and chungju with spi 6 the intensity tended to be amplified during drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought other cases of drought propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought showed similar intensities we found no previous studies that demonstrated such characteristics of attenuation i e no signals of attenuation from meteorological to agricultural droughts 4 conclusions this study examined drought characteristics using constrained wrf hydro in south korea wrf hydro was calibrated to better simulate streamflow at four selected sites with r2 kge and rsr values between simulated streamflows and observed inflows of 0 76 0 71 and 0 51 respectively averaged across four sites after calibration meteorological agricultural and hydrological droughts were examined using standardized indices the accuracy and far of the simulated hydrological drought against observed hydrological drought were 0 87 and 0 13 respectively among the four sites the number of droughts per year and their durations were also examined with commonly used timescale standardized indices i e 1 3 and 6 months meteorological droughts were the shortest in all study areas in addition there were fewer agricultural and hydrological droughts per year 1 9 and 1 4 respectively than meteorological droughts 4 3 the durations of agricultural and hydrological droughts were three times longer than those of meteorological droughts moreover drought propagation characteristics were captured agricultural and hydrological droughts lagged behind meteorological droughts by approximately 3 4 weeks the attenuation of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought was approximately 0 5 on average in some cases but the propagation from meteorological to agricultural drought did not show attenuation in south korea obtaining quantitative information through modeling systems could facilitate drought risk management by policymakers wrf hydro has the potential to provide consistent information such as streamflow surface runoff inflow and soil moisture data for water management in particular simulated soil moisture is useful because of the lack of observational data for the variable in addition to soil moisture streamflow surface runoff and subsurface runoff can be used to detect drought and drought propagation this study shows that simulated information with constrained wrf hydro can be used to calculate standardized drought indices which are useful for demonstrating the characteristics of various types of droughts and predicting drought propagation although the calibrated model performance with streamflow was reasonable over south korea the inherent limits of lsms still apply to this study lsms are limited in their capacity to capture observations because of the limited grasp of physical processes potential errors in input forcing and other numerical errors in model operations barella ortiz and quintana seguí 2019 quintana seguí et al 2020 showed that uncertainties in lsm formulation are a major issue in soil moisture streamflow drought and drought propagation estimation ukkola et al 2016 estimated evaporative drought using 14 lsms and demonstrated the benefits and limitations of lsms despite the limitations of lsms they are a useful tool for estimating drought characteristics in addition this study was limited in that the model was calibrated against the observed streamflow therefore further research is required to improve the prediction skills of wrf hydro by applying it in combination with other observational data sets such as soil moisture credit authorship
