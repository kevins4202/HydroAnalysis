materials such as textiles papers and leather the production of dye containing wastewater has predominantly been attributed to textile manufacturing during the dyeing process in producing colored fabric the dye dissolved in water is imparted to the fabric whereas the remaining dye containing water is discharged into various water bodies as wastewater 1 2 one of the common dyes in the textile industry is methylene blue mb due to its deep blue appearance 3 4 the presence of mb in water bodies has been known to be hazardous the dark colored mb restricts the direct penetration of light into the water body hence prohibiting the growth of aquatic life 5 6 additionally the exposure of humans to mb may cause vomiting chest pain hard breathing and fast heartbeat 7 given such complications it is imperative to treat mb wastewater before its discharge into the water bodies the treatment of wastewater can be categorized into three groups biological treatment chemical treatment and physical treatment 8 biological treatment involving the use of microorganisms is the most economical however the method is time consuming given the inevitably long retention time for microbial degradation moreover its efficiency is lacking due to the complex molecular structure of mb 9 10 as for chemical treatment coagulation is widely used for wastewater treatment 11 although its relative effectiveness and shorter operation time chemical treatment suffers from drawbacks such as the need for costly chemicals and difficulty in handling the resultant sludge 12 lastly physical treatment is the most feasible effective and simplest wastewater treatment method 13 14 adsorption a physical treatment method with the use of activated carbon ac has been applied for decades in wastewater treatment efforts have been undertaken to replace ac with a more sustainable adsorbent such as one synthesized from agricultural waste 15 16 the palm oil industry is the largest agricultural industry in malaysia its 4 7 million hectares of palm oil plantations and 416 operating oil mills are estimated to produce 13 97 million tonnes of oil palm frond opf constituting to the largest biomass in the industry 17 opf is produced during the pruning of oil palm fresh fruit bunch it is left in palm oil plantations for soil conservation structurally opf has been found to comprise a high carbohydrate rich in simple sugars 18 in this regard gupta et al 19 have proposed a new graphene based adsorbent with superior adsorption capacity with sugar as the natural carbon source besides khan et al 20 had synthesized graphene sand hybrid stacked on inorganic sand support as adsorbent using date syrup as a carbon source it was reported that the adsorbent had successfully removed 99 methyl violet and 93 congo red dye with an initial dye concentration of 200 mg l 1 even though these adsorbents have shown much potential in the adsorption based treatment process the sustainability of entailing sugar and date syrup for such engineering practices remains questionable considering the generation of agricultural waste from palm oil mills in the context of malaysia and the need of more sustainable carbon sources for the synthesis of graphene based adsorbents opf a biomass waste from palm oil industry with high sugar content has the potential to be used as the carbon source for the synthesis of graphene based adsorbent transferring the graphene based adsorbent synthesis process into a more sustainable engineering practice the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of opf juice as a natural carbon source for the synthesis of graphene shell composite gsc a new generation of graphene based adsorbents using oil palm kernel shell as the base material the effect of synthetic mb solution concentration and gsc mass towards the adsorption performance was studied in which the synthetic mb solution concentration was varied from 1 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 whereas the mass of gsc was manipulated from 5 g to 20 g subsequently equilibrium isotherm and kinetic isotherm were used to understand the adsorption mechanism pathways and to explain the dependence of adsorbent s surface properties towards the adsorption performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fresh opf was collected from the east mill sime darby plantation carey island malaysia the fresh opf was stored at 4 c to prevent microbial biodegradation prior to the adsorption studies sulphuric acid h2so4 was procured from r m marketing uk while mb was purchased from merck germany 2 2 gsc synthesis from opf opf was squeezed with the sugarcane machine to extract the opf juice around 10 l of opf juice was obtained through the pressing of 25 kg fresh opf pressed opf juice was filtered with 0 2μm whatman membrane nylon filter to produce extracted opf juice for gsc synthesis 21 then 1 l opf juice and 60 ml h2so4 were mixed in a beaker and heated at 260 c for 6 h to concentrate the mixture this resultant concentrated mixture was then mixed with 300 g oil palm kernel shell 300 μ m 600 μ m and stirred well subsequently the coated oil palm kernel shell was laid in the crucible and dried in the furnace with a programmed thermal setting as described in our previous research study 22 the synthesized shell composite was then cooled to room temperature the gsc was rinsed with distilled water to obtain neutral ph before drying in the oven 2 3 characterization of the gsc the surface morphology of the synthesized gsc was examined through scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss sigma prior to the sem analysis a thin layer of gold was coated on the synthesized gsc the sem micrograph was captured at an accelerating voltage of 3 kv and at the magnification of 2 5 k the chemical composition on the surface of gsc was analyzed using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx oxford inca pentafetx3 oxford uk meanwhile the crystallinity of the synthesized gsc was examined through the x ray diffraction xrd bruker german the xrd spectrum was completed at a 2θ scan range of 5 80 2 4 adsorption performance study 2 4 1 effect of synthetic mb solution concentration synthetic mb solutions were prepared at different concentrations 1 00 mg l 1 1 50 mg l 1 5 00 mg l 1 10 00 mg l 1 15 00 mg l 1 and 20 00 mg l 1 22 for each concentration a working volume of 250 ml was added into a conical flask to which 20 g of gsc was then added the conical flask with the mixture was placed on an isothermal shaker and shaken at 200 rpm for 20 h under room temperature the synthetic mb solution was sampled and analyzed at 20 min intervals for the first 1 h then at 1 h intervals for the next 7 h and lastly at 2 h intervals for the following 12 h the concentration of the solutions was analyzed through a uv vis spectrophotometer at the wavelength λmax of 664 nm the amount of mb adsorbed onto gsc at time t qt mg g 1 was evaluated through eq 1 23 1 q t c o c t v w where co is the initial concentration of the synthetic mb solution mg l 1 ct is the concentration of the synthetic mb solution at time t mg l 1 w is the weight of gsc g and v is the volume of the synthetic mb solution l 2 4 2 effect of gsc mass four conical flasks were prepared each with 250 ml of the synthetic mb solution with a concentration of 20 mg l 1 for each of the flasks different masses of gsc were added 5 g 10 g 15 g and 20 g 22 each flask with the mixture was placed on an isothermal shaker and shaken at 200 rpm for 20 h under room temperature the synthetic mb solution was sampled and analyzed at 20 min intervals for the first 1 h then at 1 h intervals for the next 7 h and lastly at 2 h intervals for the following 12 h the concentration of the synthetic mb solution was analyzed through a uv vis spectrophotometer λmax 664 nm similarly the amount of mb adsorbed onto gsc at time t was evaluated through eq 1 2 5 adsorption model 2 5 1 equilibrium isotherm two equilibrium isotherms langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm were used in this study as most of the adsorption of organic pollutants mb dye follows the freundlich model 47 and langmuir model 36 the remaining followed temkin model 2 4 sips model 1 57 dubinin radushkevich d r model and gab model 24 the langmuir isotherm characterises the development of a mono layer adsorbate on the surface of an adsorbent in which further adsorption will not occur when the active sites on the surface have been occupied by the adsorbate the linear langmuir isotherm is expressed by eq 2 25 2 c e q e 1 q o k c c e q o where ce is the concentration of the adsorbate solution at equilibrium mg l 1 qe is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent mg g 1 qo is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g 1 and kc is the langmuir constant l mg 1 the freundlich isotherm characterises a heterogeneous adsorption in which an adsorbate can be continuously adsorbed onto the surface of an adsorbent even when its active sites have been previously occupied by an adsorbate the linear freundlich isotherm is expressed by eq 3 26 3 log q e log k 1 n log c e where qe is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent mg g 1 ce is the concentration of the adsorbate solution at equilibrium mg l 1 k is the adsorption capacity and 1 n is the adsorption intensity 2 5 2 kinetic isotherm the pseudo first order isotherm characterises the adsorption of an adsorbate onto the surface of an adsorbent by physisorption such adhesion is attributed to the surface contact between the adsorbate and the adsorbent greater surface contact contributes to stronger adhesion the linear pseudo first order isotherm is expressed by eq 4 27 4 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 302 t where qe is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent mg g 1 qt is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed at time t mg g 1 and k1 is the rate constant the pseudo second order isotherm characterises the adsorption of an adsorbate onto the surface of an adsorbent by chemisorption such adhesion is attributed to the formation of chemical bonding between the adsorbate and the adsorbent the linear pseudo second order isotherm is expressed by eq 5 28 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q t where qe is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed per unit mass of the adsorbent mg g 1 qt is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed at time t mg g 1 and k2 is the rate constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 gsc characteristics the sem micrograph reveals the rough and irregularly shaped surfaces of the gsc under 2 5 k magnification and 10 k magnification fig 1 such roughness and irregularity of the surfaces are advantageous for an adsorbent they promote not only the adhesion of the adsorbate onto the active sites but also the subsequent removal of the mb ions from the synthetic mb solution 29 besides the cluster structure and porous nanosheet structure were observed on the gsc surface at higher magnification it is hypothesized that cluster structure and porous nanosheet structure would provide higher adsorption activity which in good agreement with the findings obtained by farghali et al 30 table 1 presents the elemental weight percent wt obtained from edx analysis the synthesized gsc indicated the presence of mainly carbon oxygen and silica with 46 7 30 1 12 9 wt respectively the edx analysis shows a high content of carbon owing to the conversion of carbon source in the opf juice into graphene during carbonization and is in agreement with the literature reported 31 the xrd spectrum of the gsc reveals a noticeably high spike at 25 fig 2 this observation suggests that the carbon source in the opf juice has been converted into graphene for the synthesis of the gsc this finding corroborates that by dubey et al 23 who found that the peak representing graphene in the xrd spectrum was observed between 20 and 27 besides fig 2 indicates that the diffraction peaks are low and broad probably due to small gsc particle size and incomplete inner structure formation 32 in addition a small peak at 43 indicates the presence of amorphous carbon with a less ordered structure supports the observation in fig 1 33 the xrd analysis has confirmed the successful synthesis of gsc a new generation graphene based adsorbents with opf juice as the natural carbon source and oil palm kernel shell as the base material 3 2 adsorption performance study 3 2 1 effect of the concentration of the synthetic mb solution to elucidate the effect of the concentration of the synthetic mb solution two parameters were examined the amount of mb adsorbed onto the gsc at different times during adsorption fig 3 and the percentage of mb removal at different times during adsorption fig 4 fig 3 illustrates the duration taken for the gsc to be saturated with mb ions hence desorption regeneration of gsc is needed as the adsorbent has no longer affective in adsorption beyond saturation as seen rapid adsorption occurred in the initial stage given the abundance of active sites available on the gsc surface 34 35 this postulation is reflected by the steep gradient in the adsorption profile in the initial stage of the process with time the active sites on the gsc surface were progressively occupied by the mb ions the gradient of the adsorption profile was thus reduced and reached a plateau when equilibrium was attained for the adsorption the adsorption capacity is the amount of mb ions adsorbed onto the gsc upon equilibrium 29 36 as presented in fig 3 the adsorption capacity improved with increasing concentrations of the synthetic mb solution the highest adsorption capacity is exhibited by the adsorption with the use of 20 mg l 1 synthetic mb solution the highest concentration two reasons underlie this firstly the high concentrations of the synthetic mb solution implies more mb ions and thus a stronger driving force for occupying the active sites of the gsc surface 37 38 additionally the strong driving force offsets the resistance between the solid phase gsc surface and the aqueous phase synthetic mb solution to a greater extent on the other hand the time needed to attain equilibrium in the adsorption becomes progressively longer with increasing concentrations of the synthetic mb solution 4 7 h for 1 00 mg l 1 8 h for 1 50 mg l 1 and for 5 00 mg l 1 9 h for 10 00 mg l 1 and for 15 00 mg l 1 and 12 h for 20 00 mg l 1 this was because the greater amount of mb ions in the synthetic mb solutions with high concentrations necessitated a longer time for the ions to bind and occupy the active sites available on the gsc surface 39 40 at the end of the 20 h adsorption more than 80 of the mb ions in the synthetic mb solution were removed fig 4 regardless of the concentration of the synthetic mb solution in use this result has demonstrated the effectiveness of the gsc in treating dye containing wastewater at different concentrations for visual inspection photographs of the synthetic mb solutions before and after the 20 h were taken fig s1 the synthetic mb solution changed into a transparent solution after 20 h of adsorption further suggesting the effectiveness of the gsc in removing mb ions from the synthetic mb solution 3 2 2 effect of the gsc mass to elucidate the effect of the gsc mass two parameters were examined the amount of mb adsorbed onto the gsc at different times during adsorption fig 5 and the percentage of mb removal at different times during adsorption fig 6 as illustrated in fig 5 the lower adsorption capacity was attained through the higher gsc mass for the adsorption probably due to the greater number of active sites which competed for the adhesion of mb ions 41 42 given the higher gsc mass as seen that the amount of mb being adsorbed at time t qt mg g for 10 g has reached stagnant stage at 14 h indicate adsorption equilibrium was achieved 31 the lower adsorption capacity for higher gsc mass was observed probably due to the agglomeration of gsc at high adsorbent concentration 43 additionally the majority of the active sites were not fully occupied by mb ions even at the end of the 20 h adsorption as with the effect of the concentration of the synthetic mb solution the time needed to attain equilibrium in the adsorption becomes progressively shorter with increasing gsc masses 16 h for 5 g 14 h for 10 g and for 15 g and 10 h for 20 g this was because the mb ions in the synthetic mb solution could be adsorbed on the greater number of available active sites for higher gsc masses within a shorter time giving rise to a shorter equilibrium time higher percentages of mb removal were achieved with increasing gsc masses used in adsorption 44 this could be attributed to the greater availability of active sites for the removal of mb ions from the synthetic mb solution photographs of the solutions before and after the 20 h adsorption fig s3 corroborated the analytical results presented in fig 6 the deep blue color of the synthetic mb solution was greatly reduced by adsorption with the use of 20 g gsc 3 3 adsorption model 3 3 1 equilibrium isotherm two isotherms the langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm were used in this study to characterise the interactions between the solid phase the adsorbent gsc and the aqueous phase the synthetic mb solution at equilibrium experimental data attained from the adsorption performance study in examining the effect of synthetic mb solution concentration and the effect of gsc mass were respectively fitted into both the langmuir isotherm fig s3 and freundlich isotherm fig s4 table 2 outlines the isotherm related constants and the correlation coefficient r2 of both isotherms for the adsorption performance study the linear plots fig s3 and fig s4 demonstrate the good fit between the experimental data and the isotherms the findings as summarised in table 2 suggest that for the effect of the concentrations of the synthetic mb solutions the freundlich isotherm fit better to the experimental data as reflected by its larger r2 value on the other hand for the effect of the gsc masses both the isotherms fit the experimental data with similar r2 values accordingly it can be concluded that the adsorption involving interactions between the gsc and the mb ions at equilibrium was supported by the freundlich isotherm 45 as implied by the freundlich isotherm the uptake of the mb ions by the gsc was due to the multilayer adsorption in which mb ions approaching the active sites on the gsc surface would continually be adsorbed onto it until equilibrium was achieved this result was supported by dubey et al 23 who suggested that the majority of the natural adsorbents were attached onto the surface through multilayer adsorption additionally the constant for the freundlich isotherm n denotes the favorability of adsorption it is favorable when the value of n is in the range of 1 n 10 46 based on computation from the freundlich isotherm the values of n for examining the effect of the concentrations of the synthetic mb solutions and the effect of the gsc masses were 1 2085 and 1 7486 respectively as the resultant value of n was in the range of 1 n 10 it is suggested that the adsorption through gsc has been feasible and efficient for mb removal from the dye containing wastewater 3 3 2 kinetic isotherm kinetic data for the adsorption in this study were verified with the use of the pseudo first order isotherm and pseudo second order isotherm table 3 outlines the parameters related to both isotherms and correlation coefficient r2 in examining the effect of the concentrations of the synthetic mb solutions table 4 outlines the parameters related to both isotherms and correlation coefficient r2 in examining the effect of the gsc masses for both parameters concentrations of synthetic mb solutions and gsc masses the kinetic data for adsorption exhibit a better fit with the pseudo second order isotherm as reflected by its larger r2 value than its pseudo first order counterpart the pseudo second order isotherm explains that adsorption mechanistically involves the gsc as the adsorbent for the removal of mb ions through chemisorption 47 48 chemical bonds formed as soon as mb ions approached the active sites on the gsc surface 22 such strong bonding through the sharing or exchange of electrons makes gsc an ideal adsorbent for dye wastewater treatment the rate constants k2 of the pseudo second order isotherm increased from 0 771 g mg 1 min 1 to 3 544 g mg 1 min 1 with an increase in gsc mass indicating that the sorption system process reached equilibrium faster at high adsorbent this may be due to an increase in the probability of collision between active surface binding sites and the adsorbate at high adsorbent 49 in addition the calculated values of qeq for gsc 0 773 mg g 1 in the pseudo second order isotherm is closer to their experimental values 0 755 mg g 1 the results confirmed the pseudo second order isotherm is more appropriate for adsorption kinetic data 3 4 comparison of graphene based adsorbent table 5 compares the mb adsorption capability using various graphene based adsorbent as seen gsc synthesized from this study has higher adsorption capability compared to the previous study using palm oil mill effluent pome as carbon source probably due to higher carbon content and lower impurity 22 however gsc synthesized from this study has relatively low adsorption capacity compared to other graphene based adsorbents such as multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts pristine graphene and graphene oxide go this could be due to the clustered structure of gsc adsorbent that has a comparatively lower effective surface area for adsorption compared to the graphene sheet that has more open up surfaces for adsorption 50 hence less amount of mb can be accommodated by the bundled structure of the graphene layer coated on the oil palm kernel shell in order to reduce the clustered structure of the graphene layer it is suggested to use oil palm kernel shell of smaller particle size to allow complete wrapping and interlinked network of graphene layer covering the shell particles 51 besides it is observed that functional groups play a vital role in adsorption performance the adsorption capacity of sulfonated graphene and sulfonated go improved for 19 and 225 from its pristine forms respectively the functional groups help in the binding of the dye molecules through weak electrostatic interaction or van der waals forces therefore it is suggested to improve the adsorption capacity of gsc through surface functionalization 4 conclusion a new generation of graphene based adsorbent with opf juice as the natural carbon source and oil palm kernel shell as the base material was successfully synthesized in this study the fade off of the synthetic mb solution from deep blue towards the completion of the adsorption performance study confirmed the applicability and effectiveness of the synthesized gsc in treating dye containing wastewater the study showed that the superior adsorption capacity of gsc could be attained through increasing the concentration of the synthetic mb solution and decreasing the gsc mass the highest adsorption capacity was realized through the use of a 20 mg l 1 synthetic mb solution and 20 g gsc the resultant freundlich isotherm fitted well with the equilibrium adsorption data suggesting that the uptake of mb ions by the gsc was due to multilayer adsorption in which the mb ions approaching the gsc surface would continually be adsorbed onto the active sites until the equilibrium was achieved upon approaching the active sites on the gsc surface for the removal of mb ions from the dye containing wastewater chemical bonds were formed as described by the pseudo second order isotherm in conclusion the gsc synthesized from a natural carbon source and agricultural biomass was an adsorbent with promising potential for sustainable engineering practices for wastewater treatment future studies should focus on the optimization of gsc through particle size and surface functionalization as well as adsorption parameters declaration

is the rate constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 gsc characteristics the sem micrograph reveals the rough and irregularly shaped surfaces of the gsc under 2 5 k magnification and 10 k magnification fig 1 such roughness and irregularity of the surfaces are advantageous for an adsorbent they promote not only the adhesion of the adsorbate onto the active sites but also the subsequent removal of the mb ions from the synthetic mb solution 29 besides the cluster structure and porous nanosheet structure were observed on the gsc surface at higher magnification it is hypothesized that cluster structure and porous nanosheet structure would provide higher adsorption activity which in good agreement with the findings obtained by farghali et al 30 table 1 presents the elemental weight percent wt obtained from edx analysis the synthesized gsc indicated the presence of mainly carbon oxygen and silica with 46 7 30 1 12 9 wt respectively the edx analysis shows a high content of carbon owing to the conversion of carbon source in the opf juice into graphene during carbonization and is in agreement with the literature reported 31 the xrd spectrum of the gsc reveals a noticeably high spike at 25 fig 2 this observation suggests that the carbon source in the opf juice has been converted into graphene for the synthesis of the gsc this finding corroborates that by dubey et al 23 who found that the peak representing graphene in the xrd spectrum was observed between 20 and 27 besides fig 2 indicates that the diffraction peaks are low and broad probably due to small gsc particle size and incomplete inner structure formation 32 in addition a small peak at 43 indicates the presence of amorphous carbon with a less ordered structure supports the observation in fig 1 33 the xrd analysis has confirmed the successful synthesis of gsc a new generation graphene based adsorbents with opf juice as the natural carbon source and oil palm kernel shell as the base material 3 2 adsorption performance study 3 2 1 effect of the concentration of the synthetic mb solution to elucidate the effect of the concentration of the synthetic mb solution two parameters were examined the amount of mb adsorbed onto the gsc at different times during adsorption fig 3 and the percentage of mb removal at different times during adsorption fig 4 fig 3 illustrates the duration taken for the gsc to be saturated with mb ions hence desorption regeneration of gsc is needed as the adsorbent has no longer affective in adsorption beyond saturation as seen rapid adsorption occurred in the initial stage given the abundance of active sites available on the gsc surface 34 35 this postulation is reflected by the steep gradient in the adsorption profile in the initial stage of the process with time the active sites on the gsc surface were progressively occupied by the mb ions the gradient of the adsorption profile was thus reduced and reached a plateau when equilibrium was attained for the adsorption the adsorption capacity is the amount of mb ions adsorbed onto the gsc upon equilibrium 29 36 as presented in fig 3 the adsorption capacity improved with increasing concentrations of the synthetic mb solution the highest adsorption capacity is exhibited by the adsorption with the use of 20 mg l 1 synthetic mb solution the highest concentration two reasons underlie this firstly the high concentrations of the synthetic mb solution implies more mb ions and thus a stronger driving force for occupying the active sites of the gsc surface 37 38 additionally the strong driving force offsets the resistance between the solid phase gsc surface and the aqueous phase synthetic mb solution to a greater extent on the other hand the time needed to attain equilibrium in the adsorption becomes progressively longer with increasing concentrations of the synthetic mb solution 4 7 h for 1 00 mg l 1 8 h for 1 50 mg l 1 and for 5 00 mg l 1 9 h for 10 00 mg l 1 and for 15 00 mg l 1 and 12 h for 20 00 mg l 1 this was because the greater amount of mb ions in the synthetic mb solutions with high concentrations necessitated a longer time for the ions to bind and occupy the active sites available on the gsc surface 39 40 at the end of the 20 h adsorption more than 80 of the mb ions in the synthetic mb solution were removed fig 4 regardless of the concentration of the synthetic mb solution in use this result has demonstrated the effectiveness of the gsc in treating dye containing wastewater at different concentrations for visual inspection photographs of the synthetic mb solutions before and after the 20 h were taken fig s1 the synthetic mb solution changed into a transparent solution after 20 h of adsorption further suggesting the effectiveness of the gsc in removing mb ions from the synthetic mb solution 3 2 2 effect of the gsc mass to elucidate the effect of the gsc mass two parameters were examined the amount of mb adsorbed onto the gsc at different times during adsorption fig 5 and the percentage of mb removal at different times during adsorption fig 6 as illustrated in fig 5 the lower adsorption capacity was attained through the higher gsc mass for the adsorption probably due to the greater number of active sites which competed for the adhesion of mb ions 41 42 given the higher gsc mass as seen that the amount of mb being adsorbed at time t qt mg g for 10 g has reached stagnant stage at 14 h indicate adsorption equilibrium was achieved 31 the lower adsorption capacity for higher gsc mass was observed probably due to the agglomeration of gsc at high adsorbent concentration 43 additionally the majority of the active sites were not fully occupied by mb ions even at the end of the 20 h adsorption as with the effect of the concentration of the synthetic mb solution the time needed to attain equilibrium in the adsorption becomes progressively shorter with increasing gsc masses 16 h for 5 g 14 h for 10 g and for 15 g and 10 h for 20 g this was because the mb ions in the synthetic mb solution could be adsorbed on the greater number of available active sites for higher gsc masses within a shorter time giving rise to a shorter equilibrium time higher percentages of mb removal were achieved with increasing gsc masses used in adsorption 44 this could be attributed to the greater availability of active sites for the removal of mb ions from the synthetic mb solution photographs of the solutions before and after the 20 h adsorption fig s3 corroborated the analytical results presented in fig 6 the deep blue color of the synthetic mb solution was greatly reduced by adsorption with the use of 20 g gsc 3 3 adsorption model 3 3 1 equilibrium isotherm two isotherms the langmuir isotherm and freundlich isotherm were used in this study to characterise the interactions between the solid phase the adsorbent gsc and the aqueous phase the synthetic mb solution at equilibrium experimental data attained from the adsorption performance study in examining the effect of synthetic mb solution concentration and the effect of gsc mass were respectively fitted into both the langmuir isotherm fig s3 and freundlich isotherm fig s4 table 2 outlines the isotherm related constants and the correlation coefficient r2 of both isotherms for the adsorption performance study the linear plots fig s3 and fig s4 demonstrate the good fit between the experimental data and the isotherms the findings as summarised in table 2 suggest that for the effect of the concentrations of the synthetic mb solutions the freundlich isotherm fit better to the experimental data as reflected by its larger r2 value on the other hand for the effect of the gsc masses both the isotherms fit the experimental data with similar r2 values accordingly it can be concluded that the adsorption involving interactions between the gsc and the mb ions at equilibrium was supported by the freundlich isotherm 45 as implied by the freundlich isotherm the uptake of the mb ions by the gsc was due to the multilayer adsorption in which mb ions approaching the active sites on the gsc surface would continually be adsorbed onto it until equilibrium was achieved this result was supported by dubey et al 23 who suggested that the majority of the natural adsorbents were attached onto the surface through multilayer adsorption additionally the constant for the freundlich isotherm n denotes the favorability of adsorption it is favorable when the value of n is in the range of 1 n 10 46 based on computation from the freundlich isotherm the values of n for examining the effect of the concentrations of the synthetic mb solutions and the effect of the gsc masses were 1 2085 and 1 7486 respectively as the resultant value of n was in the range of 1 n 10 it is suggested that the adsorption through gsc has been feasible and efficient for mb removal from the dye containing wastewater 3 3 2 kinetic isotherm kinetic data for the adsorption in this study were verified with the use of the pseudo first order isotherm and pseudo second order isotherm table 3 outlines the parameters related to both isotherms and correlation coefficient r2 in examining the effect of the concentrations of the synthetic mb solutions table 4 outlines the parameters related to both isotherms and correlation coefficient r2 in examining the effect of the gsc masses for both parameters concentrations of synthetic mb solutions and gsc masses the kinetic data for adsorption exhibit a better fit with the pseudo second order isotherm as reflected by its larger r2 value than its pseudo first order counterpart the pseudo second order isotherm explains that adsorption mechanistically involves the gsc as the adsorbent for the removal of mb ions through chemisorption 47 48 chemical bonds formed as soon as mb ions approached the active sites on the gsc surface 22 such strong bonding through the sharing or exchange of electrons makes gsc an ideal adsorbent for dye wastewater treatment the rate constants k2 of the pseudo second order isotherm increased from 0 771 g mg 1 min 1 to 3 544 g mg 1 min 1 with an increase in gsc mass indicating that the sorption system process reached equilibrium faster at high adsorbent this may be due to an increase in the probability of collision between active surface binding sites and the adsorbate at high adsorbent 49 in addition the calculated values of qeq for gsc 0 773 mg g 1 in the pseudo second order isotherm is closer to their experimental values 0 755 mg g 1 the results confirmed the pseudo second order isotherm is more appropriate for adsorption kinetic data 3 4 comparison of graphene based adsorbent table 5 compares the mb adsorption capability using various graphene based adsorbent as seen gsc synthesized from this study has higher adsorption capability compared to the previous study using palm oil mill effluent pome as carbon source probably due to higher carbon content and lower impurity 22 however gsc synthesized from this study has relatively low adsorption capacity compared to other graphene based adsorbents such as multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts pristine graphene and graphene oxide go this could be due to the clustered structure of gsc adsorbent that has a comparatively lower effective surface area for adsorption compared to the graphene sheet that has more open up surfaces for adsorption 50 hence less amount of mb can be accommodated by the bundled structure of the graphene layer coated on the oil palm kernel shell in order to reduce the clustered structure of the graphene layer it is suggested to use oil palm kernel shell of smaller particle size to allow complete wrapping and interlinked network of graphene layer covering the shell particles 51 besides it is observed that functional groups play a vital role in adsorption performance the adsorption capacity of sulfonated graphene and sulfonated go improved for 19 and 225 from its pristine forms respectively the functional groups help in the binding of the dye molecules through weak electrostatic interaction or van der waals forces therefore it is suggested to improve the adsorption capacity of gsc through surface functionalization 4 conclusion a new generation of graphene based adsorbent with opf juice as the natural carbon source and oil palm kernel shell as the base material was successfully synthesized in this study the fade off of the synthetic mb solution from deep blue towards the completion of the adsorption performance study confirmed the applicability and effectiveness of the synthesized gsc in treating dye containing wastewater the study showed that the superior adsorption capacity of gsc could be attained through increasing the concentration of the synthetic mb solution and decreasing the gsc mass the highest adsorption capacity was realized through the use of a 20 mg l 1 synthetic mb solution and 20 g gsc the resultant freundlich isotherm fitted well with the equilibrium adsorption data suggesting that the uptake of mb ions by the gsc was due to multilayer adsorption in which the mb ions approaching the gsc surface would continually be adsorbed onto the active sites until the equilibrium was achieved upon approaching the active sites on the gsc surface for the removal of mb ions from the dye containing wastewater chemical bonds were formed as described by the pseudo second order isotherm in conclusion the gsc synthesized from a natural carbon source and agricultural biomass was an adsorbent with promising potential for sustainable engineering practices for wastewater treatment future studies should focus on the optimization of gsc through particle size and surface functionalization as well as adsorption parameters declaration

14036,the reverse osmosis concentrate roc of textile wastewater produced in the process of the reverse osmosis usually has a high concentration of salts and organic matters and is hard to be biodegraded in this study forward osmosis process was used for reusing roc of real textile wastewater and the effect of sodium chloride nacl and ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 on the water flux and the recovery of roc were then investigated the results showed that the water recovery could reach 90 when 2 m nacl was used as ds the calcium carbonate caco3 scaling could be both observed using nacl and nh4hco3 as ds compared to the ds of nacl the caco3 precipitation occurred much earlier when nh4hco3 was used as ds due to the reverse diffusion of hco3 the concentration of ca2 in the concentrated roc was significantly lower than 3 mg l although the fo membrane was covered by caco3 scaling the water flux was slightly affected by it in addition the water flux showed no difference through four cycles of fo tests during which the fo membrane was not cleaned after each cycle of test this finding provided the possibility of applying fo process for the near zero liquid discharge of textile wastewater keywords forward osmosis calcium carbonate scaling textile wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate roc zero liquid discharge zld 1 introduction the textile industry is one of the main industries in china and textile effluents have been identified as one of the most polluting and largest wastewaters many approaches have been used to treat and reuse the textile effluents since the environment is seriously polluted and the clean water is scarce all over the world reverse osmosis as one of the membrane separation technologies has been widely used in wastewater treatment despite the advantage of good rejection reverse osmosis also produces the concentrated wastewater which is called reverse osmosis concentrate roc generally roc is characterized by its high salinity and high organics if roc is directly discharged into the natural environment it will cause severe secondary pollution in recent years zero liquid discharge zld or near zld was proposed to eliminate liquid waste and thus to reduce the risk of pollutions 1 in order to reduce the volume of roc many methods have been used to reuse it such as advanced oxidation membrane separation technology thermal processes and so on 2 7 to eliminate the need for follow up disposal the volume of roc should be minimized as much as possible to achieve the near zld nowadays thermal processes and membrane technology have been commonly used as zld approaches although mechanical vapor recompression mvr is an efficient brine concentrator which can decrease the energy consumption compared to the conventional thermal destination technologies such as multieffect distillation it is still energy intensive besides the existence of ca2 and mg2 in roc will cause severe scaling for mvr system in terms of electrical potential driven membrane technology such as electrodialysis it has high rejection for dissolved ions but can t remove organic matters by contrast forward osmosis fo is a low energy process utilizing the osmotic pressure difference as driving force and it has been studied to treat highly salinity and highly organic wastewater such as industrial wastewater landfill leachate and so on besides many studies focused on seawater desalination and wastewater reuse by using fo process 8 10 for the treatment and reuse of textile wastewater only the synthetic textile wastewater has been studied by a hybrid system of integrating fo with coagulation flocculation cf 11 for the reverse osmosis concentrate roc of real textile wastewater not only the salinity of the feed increased but also the hardness and the concentration of the organic substances were much higher therefore it remains unknown that if the fo concentrated roc could be increased by about 10 times as that for the synthetic textile wastewater on the other hand the existence of high concentration of calcium and sulfate ions in the feed solution might cause severe inorganic fouling such as gypsum scaling 12 13 or calcium carbonate 14 15 generally tfc membrane caused more severe flux decline than cta membrane when gypsum scaling occurred and was difficult to be removed 13 this could be attributed to the gypsum bulk crystallization with deposition on cta membrane while surface crystallization via carboxylic functional groups on tfc membrane 12 16 when nh4hco3 was used as ds a new calcium carbonate scaling phenomenon was observed in the seawater fo desalination process causing a significant decline of the water flux and the scaling was hard to be removed by osmotic backwashing 14 if the fo process is used for roc of real textile wastewater to our best knowledge it is still unknown for the characteristic of membrane fouling including not only its effect on the flux decline but also the scaling reversibility and the scaling mechanism of this process in this study we investigate the potential of forward osmosis process for reusing reverse osmosis concentrate roc of textile wastewater and the flowchart was proposed as shown in fig 1 nacl and nh4hco3 were used as draw solutions to investigate not only the water flux and rejection of pollutants in roc but also the water recovery of roc the concentration of ca2 and toc in the roc during the fo water reclamation was measured to explore the change of roc quality and to find out the exact ca2 concentration when scaling began to occur finally the fouling and the reversibility of fo membrane were analyzed to elucidate the scaling mechanisms for roc treatment by fo 2 materials and methods 2 1 roc characteristics the reverse osmosis concentrate roc of textile wastewater was obtained from a textile wastewater treatment plant in zhejiang province of china and the quality of roc in this plant fluctuated as shown in table 1 in order to prevent the growth of bacteria the roc was preserved in refrigerator at 4 2 2 fo membrane and experimental setup the fo membrane obtained from hydration technology innovation hti usa was cellulose triacetate membrane cta and the functional groups of c o c c o and c o could be detected on the membrane surface 17 the fo experiments were conducted in a bench scale membrane filtration module this membrane module consisted of two identical structured channels whose dimensions were 10 cm long 3 cm wide and 2 mm deep and the effective membrane surface area was 30 cm2 two variable speed peristaltic pumps longer pump bt300 2 j china were used to generate 8 2 cm s 1 cross flows on both fo membrane sides sodium chloride nacl and ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 were prepared as draw solutions the experiments used 1 l roc as feed solution fs and 3 l 1 m or 2 m nacl and nh4hco3 as draw solution ds and the temperature of both solutions was kept at 25 1 by two heating rods gol 25 w china the weight of draw solution was continuously monitored for the determination of permeate flux after each cycle the fo system was cleaned by pure water for three times 2 3 fo tests for reclamation to investigate the recovery of roc by fo 1 m and 2 m nacl or nh4hco3 were used as ds according to han et al the recovery of the synthetic textile wastewater could reach 90 when using fo process as treatment technology 11 therefore each test stopped when the recovery rate reached 90 and for those that recovery rate could not reach 90 stopped when the water flux dropped to 1 lmh the water flux jw was calculated as 1 j w δ v a δ t where δ v is the volume of permeate water a is the effective membrane area and δ t is the measured time the reverse salts flux js was calculated as 2 j s c t f v t f c 0 f v 0 f a δ t where c 0 f and c t f are the initial salt concentration and the final salt concentration in feed solutions respectively v 0 f and v t f are feed solutions volume at the beginning and at the end of experiment respectively the water recovery re was calculated as 3 r e δ v v 0 f 100 the membrane rejection rate rd was calculated as 4 r d 1 v t d c t d v 0 d c o d v 0 f c o f 100 where c 0 d and c t d are the initial salt concentration and the final salt concentration in draw solutions respectively v 0 d and v t d are draw solutions volume at the beginning and at the end of experiment respectively 2 4 fouling tests in order to find out the effect of scaling on water flux the baselines were prepared by using di water and nacl solutions as feed solutions and the nacl solution was used to simulate the roc which had the same salinity as it to investigate the long term fouling 4 cycles were performed using the same fo membrane and the fouled membrane was not cleaned after each cycle for the ds of 2 m nacl each cycle stopped when the water recovery reached 90 while each circle stopped at 1 lmh when 2 m nh4hco3 was used as ds for it could not reach the recovery of 90 after 4 circles the fo membrane was flushed by di water at 24 6 cm s 1 cross flows for 1 h and then the active layer was analyzed by sem to investigate the reversibility of scaling 2 5 analytical methods the total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan was employed to measure the toc and inorganic carbon ic concentration in roc the concentration of metal ions was measured separately by atomic absorption spectrometer agilent technologies usa and anions were measured by ion chromatograph thermo fisher usa the reverse draw solute in fs from draw solution of nh4hco3 was detected by ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and inorganic carbon the concentration of ammonia nitrogen was measured by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry the foulants on the fo membrane was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd analyzer bruker d8 advance germany the surface morphologies of fo membrane and the scaling layer were finally analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem su8010 hitachi japan with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of draw solutions on fo for water reclamation from textile roc the first test was designed to investigate the effect of draw solutions on treating reverse osmosis concentrate roc of textile wastewater as shown in fig 2 the initial water flux when using di water as feed solution was 12 6 lmh nacl as ds and 10 2 lmh nh4hco3 as ds respectively indicating the difference in osmotic pressure of both draw solutions according to mcginnis et al 18 the nh3 co2 could be prepared by mixing nh4hco3 and ammonium hydroxide nh4oh to improve the solubility which could generate higher osmotic pressures meanwhile the decline tendency of water flux when using nh4hco3 as ds was much faster which might be attributed to the higher reverse salt flux shown in fig 2 b the reverse salts caused the driving force decrease and severe internal concentration polarization icp which led to faster flux decline 14 in terms of roc used as fs the initial water flux were 10 2 lmh and 7 4 lmh respectively when 1 m nacl and 1 m nh4hco3 were used as ds and then dropped to 7 6 lmh 25 5 decrease and 5 6 lmh 24 3 decrease after 10 h compared to feed solutions of the di water the initial fo flux was lower when roc was used as fs this was attributed to the fact that the osmotic pressure of roc was higher than di water which led to the lower osmotic pressure difference between both sides of fo membrane the decline tendency of water flux using roc as feed solution was basically consistent for those two draw solutions this might be attributed to 1 membrane fouling was not severe during such a short duration test 2 the hco3 from ds of nh4hco3 diffused into fs and then co3 2 combined with ca2 to form precipitations which alleviated the decline of osmotic pressure difference caused by reverse salts 3 2 water reclamation from roc and membrane fouling to investigate the recovery of roc the long term fo tests were then performed using 1 m 2 m nacl and nh4hco3 as draw solutions as shown in fig 3 a the initial water flux was 10 4 lmh and then dropped to 1 lmh after about 53 h when 1 m nacl was used as ds while the initial water flux was 7 4 lmh and then dropped to 1 lmh after about 46 h when using 1 m nh4hco3 as draw solution as shown in fig 3 b when the 1 m and 2 m nacl were used as ds the recovery rates were about 82 and up to 90 respectively when the 1 m and 2 m nh4hco3 were used as draw solutions the recovery rates were about 56 and 71 respectively the results showed that nacl was more effective to reclaim roc for nacl solution could produce higher osmotic pressure and lower reverse salts flux after the operation the quality and volume of concentrated roc were analyzed when 2 m nacl and nh4hco3 were used as ds shown in fig 3 c the black dotted line and red dotted line in fig 3 c represented the concentrate ratio of roc volume which was 10 and 3 4 respectively for ds of nacl and nh4hco3 as results the apparent concentrate ratio of volume and ions in roc was significantly higher when 2 m nacl was used as ds due to the higher recovery besides the apparent concentrate ratio of na and cl was higher than that of volume which could be attributed to the reverse salts from ds as for the ds of nh4hco3 the apparent concentrate ratio of anions was higher than that of cations the reason for this might be the diffusion flux of nh4 through fo membrane was relatively higher than hco3 which is comparable with previous studies 14 19 according to the solution diffusion mechanism and ion exchange mechanism the feed solutions and draw solutions need to exchange the ions to maintain electroneutrality 20 the obvious grey white pollutants could be found on the surface of fo membrane when the fo process was finished to investigate the membrane fouling the active layers of pristine membrane and fouling one were characterized by fesem as shown in fig 4 from the sem image of fouling membrane it could be found that there were irregular foulants attached upon the surface of cta membrane when nacl was used as ds while the foulants on the membrane were more regular and the particle size was larger when nh4hco3 was used as ds o ca and c were the major elements in both foulants which was further characterized by energy dispersive spectrometer eds shown in fig 4 c furthermore the foulants were analyzed by xrd shown in fig 5 which indicated that they were calcite thus the main component of foulants on the active layer was caco3 whereas the organic fouling was not significant as reported the organic fouling was not severe and less significant when roc was used as fs 21 and dye fouling was mild under fo mode 11 commonly there are three polymorphs of caco3 which are calcite aragonite and vaterite the crystal forms of caco3 are spherical needle like cubic and so on according to the literature the calcium carbonate scaling on the active layer was needle like when nh3 co2 was used as draw solution 14 15 different from our studies in which the crystal form of calcium carbonate scaling was relatively irregular this might be due to the difference in ca2 concentration and the presence of antiscalant and organic compounds in the roc which all have effects on the morphology of calcium carbonate particles it has been reported that the antiscalant addition can change the calcium carbonate particle size and the shape of precipitate 22 besides the presence of organics and inorganics could also change the shape of caco3 crystals 23 24 3 3 the quality of roc during fo process because the roc was constantly concentrated during the fo operation and the caco3 precipitations occurred it was necessary to analyze the quality of roc during the long term operation thus the concentration of ca2 tds and toc were measured at intervals as shown in fig 6 when nacl was used as ds the concentration of ca2 increased steadily to about 404 mg l after 25 h and then declined sharply to about 114 mg l which was similar to the initial concentration of ca2 in roc the concentration of ca2 in feed solution kept rising due to the concentrated fs and then deceased with the precipitation of caco3 however the decline was developed after 3 h when the ds was nh4hco3 and the concentration of ca2 maintained at a level which was lower than 3 mg l the reason for this result was that when hco3 was used as ds the reverse salts of hco3 from ds increased the concentration of hco3 and co3 2 in roc which might shorten the formation time of caco3 this result indicated that although the feed recovery could not reach 90 the significant lower concentration of ca2 in concentrated roc when nh3hco3 was used as ds could alleviate the caco3 scaling in subsequent thermal process since the roc was constantly concentrated the concentration of tds in the feed solution increased steadily while that in ds decreased slightly and their decline tendency were almost the same for both ds of nacl and nh4hco3 as shown in fig 6 b the concentrations of tds in both fs were almost the same till the operation time of 18 h when the concentration of tds for ds of nacl exceeded that of nh4hco3 it suggested that the effect of concentration was greater than the effect of reverse salts diffusion as a result the flux decline of the fo process might mainly due to the concentration of the feed solution at the later period of the operation which would be verified as shown in section 4 for the concentration of toc in fs as shown in fig 6 c it also showed the same tendency as tds in fs i e after the operation time of 18 h the increase of toc became more rapid for the ds of nacl therefore the concentration effect for the ds of nacl became more significant not only on the roc quality but also the flux decline at the later period of fo operation 3 4 effect of membrane fouling on water flux in order to investigate the effects of membrane fouling on water flux the 6 5 0 8 g l nacl solution which had the same salinity with roc was used to simulate the tds of roc and the water flux was shown in fig 7 the results showed that there was almost no difference between water flux of roc and nacl solution which indicated that the caco3 scaling had little effect on water flux according to the literature 14 the caco3 on the active layer could significantly reduce the water flux and was not effectively removed by backwashing most of researches showed that calcium scaling would cause severe water flux decline especially when the fo membrane was tfc membrane the carboxyl functional groups on tfc membrane surface could form complexes with ca2 while the hydroxyls groups on cta membrane surface do not have interactions with ca2 13 as cta membrane was used in this work the roc for ds of both nacl and nh4hco3 showed almost the same flux decline as that of the simulated nacl solution and the caco3 scaling showed almost no effect on the flux decline as shown in fig 7 to investigate the effects of long term caco3 scaling on water flux four cycles were then performed under the same conditions and after each cycle the fouled membrane was not cleaned as shown in fig 8 the initial water flux and the decline tendency of each cycle was almost the same when nacl was used as ds when the nh4hco3 was used as ds the initial water flux was decreased with the time while the decline tendency of water flux was almost the same most studies showed that the existence of ca2 in fs would cause severe membrane fouling and made the water flux decrease especially when the tfc membrane was used as fo membrane 13 the results in this work again showed that caco3 scaling on the membrane surface had little effect on water flux which might be due to that the cta membrane was significantly calcium resistance 25 besides the concentration of ca2 was not high so the precipitated particles were relatively not dense for the fouled fo membrane it was almost fully recovered after water flushing the membrane surface was almost clean and only a few particles were observed on the membrane surface after hydraulic cleaning it was reported that the initial water flux of synthetic textile wastewater could be restored by 98 when the fouled fo membrane was physically flushed by freshwater after each test 11 the fouling layer could be readily removed by hydrodynamic shear forces 26 as a result the scaling mechanism in this work was proposed as shown in fig 9 for the ds of nacl the caco3 precipitate formed due to the concentration of fs and ca2 and co3 2 in roc combined together and deposited on the membrane surface because the co3 2 in roc was limited the concentration of ca2 could not constantly decrease however for the ds of nh4hco3 the concentration of ca2 declined earlier due to the reverse salts of hco3 from ds because of the constantly reverse diffusion the concentration of ca2 could decrease to a relatively lower level due to the formation of caco3 as results the concentration of ca2 in concentrated roc when nh4hco3 was used as ds was significantly lower compared to the ds of nacl which was benefit to the following thermal process 4 conclusions this study presented the effect of forward osmosis on textile roc treatment and calcium carbonate scaling in fo process the feed recovery of roc were 56 and 71 respectively when 1 m and 2 m nh4hco3 were used as ds significantly lower than that of 81 and 90 when 1 m and 2 m nacl were used as ds respectively the fouling on the fo membrane was then characterized by sem eds and xrd and it was found that the main pollutant was calcium carbonate due to the reverse diffusion of hco3 in ds of nh4hco3 the calcium carbonate precipitation was occurred earlier than that ds of nacl and the concentration of ca2 in roc remained at about 1 mg l at the end of process much lower than that of nacl ds which was about 114 mg l in addition it was found that the membrane fouling could not affect water flux significantly according to the comparison between the roc and nacl solution with the same salinity of roc as feed solutions the four cycles tests further verify that the calcium carbonate scaling could only cause the mild decline of initiate water flux and had little effect on average water flux since the calcium carbonate scaling could be easily removed by hydraulic flushing fo process has

14036,the reverse osmosis concentrate roc of textile wastewater produced in the process of the reverse osmosis usually has a high concentration of salts and organic matters and is hard to be biodegraded in this study forward osmosis process was used for reusing roc of real textile wastewater and the effect of sodium chloride nacl and ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 on the water flux and the recovery of roc were then investigated the results showed that the water recovery could reach 90 when 2 m nacl was used as ds the calcium carbonate caco3 scaling could be both observed using nacl and nh4hco3 as ds compared to the ds of nacl the caco3 precipitation occurred much earlier when nh4hco3 was used as ds due to the reverse diffusion of hco3 the concentration of ca2 in the concentrated roc was significantly lower than 3 mg l although the fo membrane was covered by caco3 scaling the water flux was slightly affected by it in addition the water flux showed no difference through four cycles of fo tests during which the fo membrane was not cleaned after each cycle of test this finding provided the possibility of applying fo process for the near zero liquid discharge of textile wastewater keywords forward osmosis calcium carbonate scaling textile wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate roc zero liquid discharge zld 1 introduction the textile industry is one of the main industries in china and textile effluents have been identified as one of the most polluting and largest wastewaters many approaches have been used to treat and reuse the textile effluents since the environment is seriously polluted and the clean water is scarce all over the world reverse osmosis as one of the membrane separation technologies has been widely used in wastewater treatment despite the advantage of good rejection reverse osmosis also produces the concentrated wastewater which is called reverse osmosis concentrate roc generally roc is characterized by its high salinity and high organics if roc is directly discharged into the natural environment it will cause severe secondary pollution in recent years zero liquid discharge zld or near zld was proposed to eliminate liquid waste and thus to reduce the risk of pollutions 1 in order to reduce the volume of roc many methods have been used to reuse it such as advanced oxidation membrane separation technology thermal processes and so on 2 7 to eliminate the need for follow up disposal the volume of roc should be minimized as much as possible to achieve the near zld nowadays thermal processes and membrane technology have been commonly used as zld approaches although mechanical vapor recompression mvr is an efficient brine concentrator which can decrease the energy consumption compared to the conventional thermal destination technologies such as multieffect distillation it is still energy intensive besides the existence of ca2 and mg2 in roc will cause severe scaling for mvr system in terms of electrical potential driven membrane technology such as electrodialysis it has high rejection for dissolved ions but can t remove organic matters by contrast forward osmosis fo is a low energy process utilizing the osmotic pressure difference as driving force and it has been studied to treat highly salinity and highly organic wastewater such as industrial wastewater landfill leachate and so on besides many studies focused on seawater desalination and wastewater reuse by using fo process 8 10 for the treatment and reuse of textile wastewater only the synthetic textile wastewater has been studied by a hybrid system of integrating fo with coagulation flocculation cf 11 for the reverse osmosis concentrate roc of real textile wastewater not only the salinity of the feed increased but also the hardness and the concentration of the organic substances were much higher therefore it remains unknown that if the fo concentrated roc could be increased by about 10 times as that for the synthetic textile wastewater on the other hand the existence of high concentration of calcium and sulfate ions in the feed solution might cause severe inorganic fouling such as gypsum scaling 12 13 or calcium carbonate 14 15 generally tfc membrane caused more severe flux decline than cta membrane when gypsum scaling occurred and was difficult to be removed 13 this could be attributed to the gypsum bulk crystallization with deposition on cta membrane while surface crystallization via carboxylic functional groups on tfc membrane 12 16 when nh4hco3 was used as ds a new calcium carbonate scaling phenomenon was observed in the seawater fo desalination process causing a significant decline of the water flux and the scaling was hard to be removed by osmotic backwashing 14 if the fo process is used for roc of real textile wastewater to our best knowledge it is still unknown for the characteristic of membrane fouling including not only its effect on the flux decline but also the scaling reversibility and the scaling mechanism of this process in this study we investigate the potential of forward osmosis process for reusing reverse osmosis concentrate roc of textile wastewater and the flowchart was proposed as shown in fig 1 nacl and nh4hco3 were used as draw solutions to investigate not only the water flux and rejection of pollutants in roc but also the water recovery of roc the concentration of ca2 and toc in the roc during the fo water reclamation was measured to explore the change of roc quality and to find out the exact ca2 concentration when scaling began to occur finally the fouling and the reversibility of fo membrane were analyzed to elucidate the scaling mechanisms for roc treatment by fo 2 materials and methods 2 1 roc characteristics the reverse osmosis concentrate roc of textile wastewater was obtained from a textile wastewater treatment plant in zhejiang province of china and the quality of roc in this plant fluctuated as shown in table 1 in order to prevent the growth of bacteria the roc was preserved in refrigerator at 4 2 2 fo membrane and experimental setup the fo membrane obtained from hydration technology innovation hti usa was cellulose triacetate membrane cta and the functional groups of c o c c o and c o could be detected on the membrane surface 17 the fo experiments were conducted in a bench scale membrane filtration module this membrane module consisted of two identical structured channels whose dimensions were 10 cm long 3 cm wide and 2 mm deep and the effective membrane surface area was 30 cm2 two variable speed peristaltic pumps longer pump bt300 2 j china were used to generate 8 2 cm s 1 cross flows on both fo membrane sides sodium chloride nacl and ammonium bicarbonate nh4hco3 were prepared as draw solutions the experiments used 1 l roc as feed solution fs and 3 l 1 m or 2 m nacl and nh4hco3 as draw solution ds and the temperature of both solutions was kept at 25 1 by two heating rods gol 25 w china the weight of draw solution was continuously monitored for the determination of permeate flux after each cycle the fo system was cleaned by pure water for three times 2 3 fo tests for reclamation to investigate the recovery of roc by fo 1 m and 2 m nacl or nh4hco3 were used as ds according to han et al the recovery of the synthetic textile wastewater could reach 90 when using fo process as treatment technology 11 therefore each test stopped when the recovery rate reached 90 and for those that recovery rate could not reach 90 stopped when the water flux dropped to 1 lmh the water flux jw was calculated as 1 j w δ v a δ t where δ v is the volume of permeate water a is the effective membrane area and δ t is the measured time the reverse salts flux js was calculated as 2 j s c t f v t f c 0 f v 0 f a δ t where c 0 f and c t f are the initial salt concentration and the final salt concentration in feed solutions respectively v 0 f and v t f are feed solutions volume at the beginning and at the end of experiment respectively the water recovery re was calculated as 3 r e δ v v 0 f 100 the membrane rejection rate rd was calculated as 4 r d 1 v t d c t d v 0 d c o d v 0 f c o f 100 where c 0 d and c t d are the initial salt concentration and the final salt concentration in draw solutions respectively v 0 d and v t d are draw solutions volume at the beginning and at the end of experiment respectively 2 4 fouling tests in order to find out the effect of scaling on water flux the baselines were prepared by using di water and nacl solutions as feed solutions and the nacl solution was used to simulate the roc which had the same salinity as it to investigate the long term fouling 4 cycles were performed using the same fo membrane and the fouled membrane was not cleaned after each cycle for the ds of 2 m nacl each cycle stopped when the water recovery reached 90 while each circle stopped at 1 lmh when 2 m nh4hco3 was used as ds for it could not reach the recovery of 90 after 4 circles the fo membrane was flushed by di water at 24 6 cm s 1 cross flows for 1 h and then the active layer was analyzed by sem to investigate the reversibility of scaling 2 5 analytical methods the total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan was employed to measure the toc and inorganic carbon ic concentration in roc the concentration of metal ions was measured separately by atomic absorption spectrometer agilent technologies usa and anions were measured by ion chromatograph thermo fisher usa the reverse draw solute in fs from draw solution of nh4hco3 was detected by ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and inorganic carbon the concentration of ammonia nitrogen was measured by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry the foulants on the fo membrane was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd analyzer bruker d8 advance germany the surface morphologies of fo membrane and the scaling layer were finally analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem su8010 hitachi japan with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of draw solutions on fo for water reclamation from textile roc the first test was designed to investigate the effect of draw solutions on treating reverse osmosis concentrate roc of textile wastewater as shown in fig 2 the initial water flux when using di water as feed solution was 12 6 lmh nacl as ds and 10 2 lmh nh4hco3 as ds respectively indicating the difference in osmotic pressure of both draw solutions according to mcginnis et al 18 the nh3 co2 could be prepared by mixing nh4hco3 and ammonium hydroxide nh4oh to improve the solubility which could generate higher osmotic pressures meanwhile the decline tendency of water flux when using nh4hco3 as ds was much faster which might be attributed to the higher reverse salt flux shown in fig 2 b the reverse salts caused the driving force decrease and severe internal concentration polarization icp which led to faster flux decline 14 in terms of roc used as fs the initial water flux were 10 2 lmh and 7 4 lmh respectively when 1 m nacl and 1 m nh4hco3 were used as ds and then dropped to 7 6 lmh 25 5 decrease and 5 6 lmh 24 3 decrease after 10 h compared to feed solutions of the di water the initial fo flux was lower when roc was used as fs this was attributed to the fact that the osmotic pressure of roc was higher than di water which led to the lower osmotic pressure difference between both sides of fo membrane the decline tendency of water flux using roc as feed solution was basically consistent for those two draw solutions this might be attributed to 1 membrane fouling was not severe during such a short duration test 2 the hco3 from ds of nh4hco3 diffused into fs and then co3 2 combined with ca2 to form precipitations which alleviated the decline of osmotic pressure difference caused by reverse salts 3 2 water reclamation from roc and membrane fouling to investigate the recovery of roc the long term fo tests were then performed using 1 m 2 m nacl and nh4hco3 as draw solutions as shown in fig 3 a the initial water flux was 10 4 lmh and then dropped to 1 lmh after about 53 h when 1 m nacl was used as ds while the initial water flux was 7 4 lmh and then dropped to 1 lmh after about 46 h when using 1 m nh4hco3 as draw solution as shown in fig 3 b when the 1 m and 2 m nacl were used as ds the recovery rates were about 82 and up to 90 respectively when the 1 m and 2 m nh4hco3 were used as draw solutions the recovery rates were about 56 and 71 respectively the results showed that nacl was more effective to reclaim roc for nacl solution could produce higher osmotic pressure and lower reverse salts flux after the operation the quality and volume of concentrated roc were analyzed when 2 m nacl and nh4hco3 were used as ds shown in fig 3 c the black dotted line and red dotted line in fig 3 c represented the concentrate ratio of roc volume which was 10 and 3 4 respectively for ds of nacl and nh4hco3 as results the apparent concentrate ratio of volume and ions in roc was significantly higher when 2 m nacl was used as ds due to the higher recovery besides the apparent concentrate ratio of na and cl was higher than that of volume which could be attributed to the reverse salts from ds as for the ds of nh4hco3 the apparent concentrate ratio of anions was higher than that of cations the reason for this might be the diffusion flux of nh4 through fo membrane was relatively higher than hco3 which is comparable with previous studies 14 19 according to the solution diffusion mechanism and ion exchange mechanism the feed solutions and draw solutions need to exchange the ions to maintain electroneutrality 20 the obvious grey white pollutants could be found on the surface of fo membrane when the fo process was finished to investigate the membrane fouling the active layers of pristine membrane and fouling one were characterized by fesem as shown in fig 4 from the sem image of fouling membrane it could be found that there were irregular foulants attached upon the surface of cta membrane when nacl was used as ds while the foulants on the membrane were more regular and the particle size was larger when nh4hco3 was used as ds o ca and c were the major elements in both foulants which was further characterized by energy dispersive spectrometer eds shown in fig 4 c furthermore the foulants were analyzed by xrd shown in fig 5 which indicated that they were calcite thus the main component of foulants on the active layer was caco3 whereas the organic fouling was not significant as reported the organic fouling was not severe and less significant when roc was used as fs 21 and dye fouling was mild under fo mode 11 commonly there are three polymorphs of caco3 which are calcite aragonite and vaterite the crystal forms of caco3 are spherical needle like cubic and so on according to the literature the calcium carbonate scaling on the active layer was needle like when nh3 co2 was used as draw solution 14 15 different from our studies in which the crystal form of calcium carbonate scaling was relatively irregular this might be due to the difference in ca2 concentration and the presence of antiscalant and organic compounds in the roc which all have effects on the morphology of calcium carbonate particles it has been reported that the antiscalant addition can change the calcium carbonate particle size and the shape of precipitate 22 besides the presence of organics and inorganics could also change the shape of caco3 crystals 23 24 3 3 the quality of roc during fo process because the roc was constantly concentrated during the fo operation and the caco3 precipitations occurred it was necessary to analyze the quality of roc during the long term operation thus the concentration of ca2 tds and toc were measured at intervals as shown in fig 6 when nacl was used as ds the concentration of ca2 increased steadily to about 404 mg l after 25 h and then declined sharply to about 114 mg l which was similar to the initial concentration of ca2 in roc the concentration of ca2 in feed solution kept rising due to the concentrated fs and then deceased with the precipitation of caco3 however the decline was developed after 3 h when the ds was nh4hco3 and the concentration of ca2 maintained at a level which was lower than 3 mg l the reason for this result was that when hco3 was used as ds the reverse salts of hco3 from ds increased the concentration of hco3 and co3 2 in roc which might shorten the formation time of caco3 this result indicated that although the feed recovery could not reach 90 the significant lower concentration of ca2 in concentrated roc when nh3hco3 was used as ds could alleviate the caco3 scaling in subsequent thermal process since the roc was constantly concentrated the concentration of tds in the feed solution increased steadily while that in ds decreased slightly and their decline tendency were almost the same for both ds of nacl and nh4hco3 as shown in fig 6 b the concentrations of tds in both fs were almost the same till the operation time of 18 h when the concentration of tds for ds of nacl exceeded that of nh4hco3 it suggested that the effect of concentration was greater than the effect of reverse salts diffusion as a result the flux decline of the fo process might mainly due to the concentration of the feed solution at the later period of the operation which would be verified as shown in section 4 for the concentration of toc in fs as shown in fig 6 c it also showed the same tendency as tds in fs i e after the operation time of 18 h the increase of toc became more rapid for the ds of nacl therefore the concentration effect for the ds of nacl became more significant not only on the roc quality but also the flux decline at the later period of fo operation 3 4 effect of membrane fouling on water flux in order to investigate the effects of membrane fouling on water flux the 6 5 0 8 g l nacl solution which had the same salinity with roc was used to simulate the tds of roc and the water flux was shown in fig 7 the results showed that there was almost no difference between water flux of roc and nacl solution which indicated that the caco3 scaling had little effect on water flux according to the literature 14 the caco3 on the active layer could significantly reduce the water flux and was not effectively removed by backwashing most of researches showed that calcium scaling would cause severe water flux decline especially when the fo membrane was tfc membrane the carboxyl functional groups on tfc membrane surface could form complexes with ca2 while the hydroxyls groups on cta membrane surface do not have interactions with ca2 13 as cta membrane was used in this work the roc for ds of both nacl and nh4hco3 showed almost the same flux decline as that of the simulated nacl solution and the caco3 scaling showed almost no effect on the flux decline as shown in fig 7 to investigate the effects of long term caco3 scaling on water flux four cycles were then performed under the same conditions and after each cycle the fouled membrane was not cleaned as shown in fig 8 the initial water flux and the decline tendency of each cycle was almost the same when nacl was used as ds when the nh4hco3 was used as ds the initial water flux was decreased with the time while the decline tendency of water flux was almost the same most studies showed that the existence of ca2 in fs would cause severe membrane fouling and made the water flux decrease especially when the tfc membrane was used as fo membrane 13 the results in this work again showed that caco3 scaling on the membrane surface had little effect on water flux which might be due to that the cta membrane was significantly calcium resistance 25 besides the concentration of ca2 was not high so the precipitated particles were relatively not dense for the fouled fo membrane it was almost fully recovered after water flushing the membrane surface was almost clean and only a few particles were observed on the membrane surface after hydraulic cleaning it was reported that the initial water flux of synthetic textile wastewater could be restored by 98 when the fouled fo membrane was physically flushed by freshwater after each test 11 the fouling layer could be readily removed by hydrodynamic shear forces 26 as a result the scaling mechanism in this work was proposed as shown in fig 9 for the ds of nacl the caco3 precipitate formed due to the concentration of fs and ca2 and co3 2 in roc combined together and deposited on the membrane surface because the co3 2 in roc was limited the concentration of ca2 could not constantly decrease however for the ds of nh4hco3 the concentration of ca2 declined earlier due to the reverse salts of hco3 from ds because of the constantly reverse diffusion the concentration of ca2 could decrease to a relatively lower level due to the formation of caco3 as results the concentration of ca2 in concentrated roc when nh4hco3 was used as ds was significantly lower compared to the ds of nacl which was benefit to the following thermal process 4 conclusions this study presented the effect of forward osmosis on textile roc treatment and calcium carbonate scaling in fo process the feed recovery of roc were 56 and 71 respectively when 1 m and 2 m nh4hco3 were used as ds significantly lower than that of 81 and 90 when 1 m and 2 m nacl were used as ds respectively the fouling on the fo membrane was then characterized by sem eds and xrd and it was found that the main pollutant was calcium carbonate due to the reverse diffusion of hco3 in ds of nh4hco3 the calcium carbonate precipitation was occurred earlier than that ds of nacl and the concentration of ca2 in roc remained at about 1 mg l at the end of process much lower than that of nacl ds which was about 114 mg l in addition it was found that the membrane fouling could not affect water flux significantly according to the comparison between the roc and nacl solution with the same salinity of roc as feed solutions the four cycles tests further verify that the calcium carbonate scaling could only cause the mild decline of initiate water flux and had little effect on average water flux since the calcium carbonate scaling could be easily removed by hydraulic flushing fo process has potential to treat and reclaim roc of textile wastewater and rocs from other industries for the objective of near zero liquid discharge declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest is

14037,the removal mechanisms of ciprofloxacin cip in an aqueous solution using the persulfate ps oxidation system activated by zero valent metals zvms such as zero valent iron zvi zero valent aluminum zva and zero valent copper zvc were compared the cip removal followed the pseudo first order kinetics in all the ps oxidation processes mediated by the zvms the influence of factors of the ps oxidation system such as ph and concentrations of both zvms and ps was analyzed our results indicate that zvi ps process resulted in the highest removal of cip at 84 5 1 3 kobs 29 8 10 3 min 1 within 60 min with pho of 3 0 a molar dosage of ps at 2 25 mm and concentration of zvi at 126 mg l 1 however cip was only removed to the extent of 73 3 2 5 with kobs 21 9 10 3 min 1 by zva ps with pho of 3 0 ps o 2 25 mm and concentration of zva at 81 mg l 1 finally for zvc ps system the removal efficiency of cip was lowest at 59 9 3 2 with constant rate kobs 15 10 3 min 1 when optimum conditions were initial ph of 4 0 ps o 2 25 mm and dosage of zvc at 192 mg l 1 based on x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra fe2 and fe3 ions from zvi al3 ions from zva and cu and cu2 ions from zvc were released by ps oxidation moreover active radicals ho so4 determined as primary agents to total oxidation performance were generated through the activation of ps by intermediate ion metals keywords ciprofloxacin persulfate oxidation zero valent iron zero valent aluminum zero valent copper mechanism 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip whose essential characteristics are listed in table 1 is a popular second generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic for treating bacterial infections that cause diseases in both humans and animals 1 as the primary usage of cip is oral some cip is always excreted via urine in unmetabolized form from the patients bodies 2 as a consequence this antibiotic usually enters the environment through untreated sludge wastewater effluent urban runoff to nearby streams etc 3 according to a number of studies residual cip is predominantly found in hospital wastewater for instance rodriguez mozar et al reported that the amount of cip in hospital wastewater near the ter river in spain was over 13 μg l 1 4 cip was also found in the incoming water and outgoing treated water in 11 sweden sewage treatment plants with concentrations of 1 41 μg l 1 and 0 06 μg l 1 respectively 5 in vietnam cip was found in rural hospital wastewater in hanoi and hochiminh city at a high concentration of 87 3 μg l 1 in the influent and 53 3 μg l 1 in the outgoing treated wastewater 6 furthermore the highest amount of cip in the wastewater from the entire pharmaceutical industry in vietnam has been detected at 50 mg l 1 7 although cip in the groundwater surface water and wastewater only constitutes micropollutants it can lead to the development of quinolone resistant bacteria and pose a danger to the ecological system and human health 1 therefore the presence of hazardous cip compound in the sources of aquaculture hospital effluents and pharmacy wastewater is a serious threat to the environment and its treatment deserves urgent attention the traditional treatment systems such as coagulation sedimentation and biological process suffer from numerous disadvantages when they are used for the degradation of micropollutants hence advanced oxidation processes aops based on free radicals ho and so4 have been developed with a high degree of urgency for effective treatment of residual antibiotics in the environment 10 12 there are many methods to generate free radicals from persulfate ps for the degradation of antibiotics for example those involving heat activation 13 15 transition metal ions 16 18 ultrasonics 19 bases 20 uv light 13 21 22 and activated carbon 23 24 compared to the other methods zero valent metals zvms namely zero valent iron zvi zero valent aluminum zva zero valent copper zvc and zero valent zinc zvz were proven to be active catalysts by supplying transition metal ions in aops for removing the contaminants in the environment 25 numerous reports have described the advantage of zvms for example their ability to be used in treating the different pollutants in the soil and various water resources such as groundwater 26 surface water 16 and wastewater 27 in addition the zvms are highly reactive and cost effective 27 previously a few research studies focused on the application of zvi in ps mediation for degrading antibiotics 16 28 however the research has been quite limited on the removal of antibiotics when the catalyst was replaced by zva or zvc in this study three zvms namely zvi zva and zvc were employed to remove cip from an aqueous solution under ambient conditions using the ps oxidation process the primary goals of this research are 1 to compare the factors influencing the cip removal by ps oxidation mediated by zvms i e zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps under various operational conditions such as ph ps dosage zvm molar concentration and initial cip molar concentration and 2 to investigate through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd spectra the catalytic ability of zvi zva and zvc in activating ps to remove cip and the mechanism involved therein 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ciprofloxacin c17h18fn3o3 98 fe zvi al zva cu zvc 99

the cip solution and then dissolving it in an ultrasonic bath vwra142 0307 vwr singapore each of the zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps treatment tests used 200 ml of the cip solution the initial solution s ph

the functional groups on the surface of the zvms before and after the reaction were detected by ftir spectroscopy at 400 4000 cm 1 bruker tensor ii ftir germany the xrd patterns of the zvms were

at a scanning rate of 88 2θ min the cip removal process followed the pseudo first order kinetics equation given below 1 ln c c 0 k o b s t where c is the amount of cip mg l 1 at a given time t co is the initial cip concentration mg l 1 kobs is the pseudo first order constant min 1 and t is the time of reaction min 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial ph of the solution the effect of the initial ph of the solution on cip reduction was determined over a ph range of 3 0 10 0 as illustrated in fig 1 it was clear that the three ps systems zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps favored acidic conditions the optimum ph was 3 0 for ps oxidation activated by zvi kobs 9 8 10 3 min 1 and zva kobs 9 4 10 3 min 1 while the optimum ph was 4 0 for the ps oxidation activated by zvc ps kobs 9 2 10 3 min 1 this phenomenon is described through eqs 2 6 2 fe0 2h fe2 h2 3 fe2 s2o8 2 fe3 so4 so4 2 k 2 0 10 m 1 s 1 4 2al0 s2o8 2 6h 1 5o2 2al3 2so4 3h2o 5 2cu0 2h 2cu h2 6 cu s2o8 2 cu2 so4 so4 2 7 so4 h2o so4 2 ho h through the reactions described by eqs 2 4 and 5 it may be observed that ps significantly expedites the corrosion of zvm and the generation of metal ions fe2 al3 and cu this leads to the retention of these metal ions as well as limitation of hydroxide precipitates i e al oh 3 fe oh 3 and cu oh 2 formation thus these reactions produce active radicals ho so4 following eq 2 7 30 31 kobs of the zvi ps system at a ph of 3 0 was 9 8 10 3 min 1 which was the highest furthermore it was almost the same as that at a ph of 4 0 9 7 10 3 min 1 however when ph was increased to 5 0 the amount of cip degradation was drastically decreased to 41 with an obvious drop in kobs to about 7 8 10 3 min 1 similarly in the case of the zva ps system kobs was slightly decreased from 9 2 10 3 to 8 8 10 3 min 1 as the ph value was varied from 4 0 6 0 during the aop based sulfate radical oxidation at a ph of 7 0 the removal of cip was significantly reduced to 38 this could be explained by the precipitation of fe2 and al3 ions following eqs 9 and 10 at different ph values according to balintova and petrilakova 2011 fe2 is oxidized to fe3 by oxygen and subsequently it produces the precipitate fe oh 3 at ph values of 3 5 and above eqs 8 and 9 while aluminum precipitated in the ph range of 4 0 5 5 eq 10 32 as seen in fig 1d there was a significant decline in all the three systems final ph below 4 0 since the initial ph was from 3 to 6 of zva ps and ph before and after reaction was 4 0 and 3 45 respectively for the zvi ps system this leads indirectly to justify the absolute utilization of h to dissolve the oxide coating on aluminum particles releasing transition iron and aluminum ions 8 fe2 o2 fe3 o2 9 fe3 3oh fe oh 3 10 al3 3oh al oh 3 11 2al oh 3 al2o3 3h2o 12 cu oh cuoh 13 2cuoh cu2o h2o in the zvc ps system when ph was below 4 0 the significant decrease in the cip removal to 42 6 might be attributed to the unavailability of the adsorption process at the surface of zvc its surface had a positive charge at ph below ph point zero charge phpzc 3 14 33 whereas cip also transforms into a positive ion cip at the same ph value the efficiency of cip degradation was the highest at 44 8 kobs 9 2 10 3 min 1 at ph 4 0 however kobs again reduced at ph 7 0 the reason for this behavior was that there was a shortage of h ions to corrode the zvc layer and hence the generated cu would be instantly limited by oh via eqs 11 and 12 33 in a neutral condition the ability of cip degradation was not only by the aop based on ho and so4 radicals but also on the adsorption process the adsorption took place because oxygen atoms of the keto and carboxylic groups of the cip structure were linked to the roughened surfaces of zvi zva and zvc as well as producing strong complexes with dissolving metal ions 34 the peak intensity of co 1635 cm 1 seen in the ftir spectra of all the zvms fig 2 was slightly increased after the treatment however the adsorption process played a negligible role in degrading cip in zvms ps this phenomenon was indicated that the dissolving the passive oxide layer from zvms surface and zvms surface area were limited in neutral conditions 35 36 compare to zva and zvc the peak intensity changes 1635 cm 1 of zvi was higher due to a higher sorption capacity cip into hydrous ferric oxides produced of the zvi surface corrosion 34 in an alkaline condition the efficiency of cip removal was significantly reduced with kobs 3 6 10 3 5 0 10 3 and 2 8 10 3 min 1 for zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps respectively owing to the production of less active radicals firstly the growth of the metal hydroxide layer covering the zvm surfaces in basic environments decreased the reactive surface area for the production of so4 and ho radicals moreover the primary active radical in these aops was hydroxyl radical ho formed at a ph of 10 0 following eq 13 villegas guzman et al 2017 showed that so4 2 could limit the ho oxidation in reaction because of the generation of less active species 37 3 2 effect of dosage of zvms zvi zva zvc the influence of the initial zvms dosage on the removal of cip by the three systems namely zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps is depicted in fig 3 as shown in the figure the cip reduction fitted the pseudo first order kinetics well as seen ps alone did not remove cip due to the lack of dosage of ps and the durable structure of this antibiotic 22 when the concentration of zvi was increased from 42 mg l 1 to 126 mg l 1 the corresponding kobs increased from 11 4 10 3 min 1 to 13 9 10 3 min 1 subsequently as the concentration of zvi was further increased to 252 mg l 1 kobs of the cip degradation dropped to 10 2 10 3 min 1 similarly for the zva ps and zvc ps systems kobs peaked at 13 2 10 3 min 1 and 12 9 10 3 min 1 respectively as the concentration of zva and zvc rose to 81 mg l 1 and 192 mg l 1 as further additions to the dosages of zva and zvc were made to bring 121 5 mg l 1 and 288 mg l 1 kobs decreased to 11 8 10 3and 10 4 10 3 min 1 for cip zva and cip zvc respectively this phenomenon may be explained by the fact that the excess zvm moles would supply more active species and generate a large number of electrons and after the quenching of the free radicals the limitation of cip removal follows eqs 14 15 30 33 at the same time fig 3 d illustrates that metal ions total fe al3 and cu2 were released after the treatment duration of 60 min as the dosage of zvi and zvc were increased from 42 to 252 mg l 1 and 48 288 mg l 1 the final total fe and cu2 concentrations increased dramatically from 8 9 10 3 to 57 0 10 3 mm and 2 0 10 3 to 18 0 10 3 mm respectively however the residual al3 after the aop attained a peak of 47 0 10 3 mm with the concentration of zva at 81 mg l 1 as dosage of zva increased to 121 5 mg l 1 amount of al 3 reduced slightly at 45 8 10 3 mm according 38 al3 in aqueous solution be produced by zva corrosion in zva ps system in acidic environment influenced in ph of solution and dosage of ps moreover the final value of ph 2 86 at dosage zva of 121 5 mg l 1 was higher than of those 2 56 at concentration of zva of 81 mg l 1 data did not show it revealed that more floccules al hydr oxide produced on surface of zva thus residual al3 after reaction decreased as the dosage of zva rise from 81 mg l 1 to 121 5 mg l 1 14 fe2 so4 fe3 so4 2 15 cu so4 cu2 so4 2 3 3 effect of ps s2o8 2 concentration ps plays an important role in the generation of radicals in the zvm activated ps oxidation in our experiments the initial concentrations of cip were fixed at 30 μm and the zvms participated by for 126 mg l 1 of zvi dosage of zva at 81 mg l 1 and 192 mg l 1 of zvc the influence of ps concentration on the degradation of cip was analyzed under different concentration of ps i e 0 mm 0 45 mm 0 75 mm 1 5 mm 2 25 mm and 3 mm with the results displayed in fig 4 for any concentration of ps the reduction of cip followed the pseudo first order kinetics the results illustrated that lower cip reduction was observed by zvms alone as compared to zvms ps system as shown in fig 4 only 11 8 and 3 82 removal of cip was observed in the zvi zva and zvc system respectively after 60 min of reaction the degradation of cip occurred due to zvms surface adsorption and reduction 35 it has been widely established that the cip removal rate would increase as the concentration of ps increased kobs for zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps typically increased and reached the highest values of about 29 8 10 3 21 9 10 3 and 15 0 10 3 min 1 respectively corresponding to a concentration of ps of 2 25 mm nonetheless when the concentration of ps continued to rise to 3 mm the corresponding kobs decreased to 27 4 10 3 20 7 10 3 and 14 10 3 min 1 for zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps respectively this phenomenon could be explained by the reaction between s2o8 2 and so4 eq 16 39 and the recoupling between the two so4 ions eq 17 40 it leads to a reduction of the effectiveness of cip oxidation 16 s2o8 2 so4 s2o8 so4 2 17 so4 so4 s2o8 2 in fig 4 d the residual ps at 60 min was displayed after the complete degradation of cip in general residual ps concentrations i e after the treatment with the zvc ps system was the highest for all dosage of ps from 0 45 to 3 mm at 0 45 μm 1487 5 μm among all the three zvm activated ps oxidations moreover the percentage of ps consumption at optimum conditions during 60 min decreased in the order zvi ps zva ps zvc ps the corresponding numbers were 84 5 1 3 73 3 2 5 and 59 9 3 2 for zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps respectively therefore the efficiency of cip degradation of zvi ps was the highest among the three systems considered 3 4 effect of initial cip table 2 illustrates the effect of the initial dosage of cip cip 0 on the zvm activated ps initial concentrations of cip of 3 μm 15 μm 30 μm 60 μm were investigated the concentration of ps was at 2 25 mm and dosage of zvi zva and zvc were 126 mg l 1 81 mg l 1 and 192 mg l 1 respectively all the reactions followed the pseudo first order patterns well the kobs values of the three aops were decreased when cip 0 was increased from 3 to 60 μm and followed the order zvc ps zva ps zvi ps i e 18 8 10 3 23 2 10 3 35 1 10 3 min 1 respectively in theory the total active radical so4 ho yields were constant once the ps dose was kept constant under the corresponding conditions as a consequence the efficiency of the cip reduction decreased when the initial cip concentration was increased during the reaction time 41 overall zvi displayed the more efficient of cip reduction than zva and zvc as mentioned in previous research 42 43 the surface oxide film of zva was not only thicker than that of zvi but also it was difficult completely to remove after persulfate oxidation reaction thus zva required more challenging surface reactions and hence the ability of zva ps to remove cip was lower than that of the zvi ps system for zvc ps system the oxidation of zvc to cu was slow causing the lowest in the rate of degradation of cip as fig 3 d concentration of ion copper was less about three fold than concentration of ion iron as well as a concentration of ion aluminum in solution after treatment 3 5 identification of reactive radicals initially two active radicals i e so4 and ho were produced during the zvm mediated decomposition of ps through radical reaction characteristics meoh and tba were set as common quenching substances to study their inhibition impact on the cip removal 31 44 45 these alcohols were added at a specific concentration of 30 mm that corresponded to a 1000 1 m ratio of probe compounds versus the initial contaminant cip these results identified from the quenching reactions are illustrated in table 3 when tba and meoh were applied to the experimental solutions the cip degradation of the zvi activated ps system markedly decreased by 43 2 and 8 5 respectively the corresponding values with zva activated ps system were 38 7 and 14 respectively finally with zvc activated ps system the corresponding figures were 27 5 and 8 2 respectively it is known that tba was used as ho quencher with the reactivity of the oh tba system ktba ho 3 8 108 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 46 but as ineffective for so4 ktba so4 4 105 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 47 while meoh could scavenge both ho kmeoh ho 109 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 46 and so4 kmeoh so4 1 1 107 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 47 as a consequence the presence of 30 mm of meoh almost significantly inhibited the removal of cip in the zvms ps system which illustrates that so4 was one of the main reactive radicals besides ho can be produced by so4 via eq 7 which was indicated by the inhibition of cip removal with the addition of 30 mm tba these results conclude that both ho and so4 contributed to the total removal of cip it should be indicated that the findings achieved in this research are similar to those reported in the research by 33 45 3 6 analysis of released metal ions using xrd and ftir xrd and ftir analyses were performed to study the mechanism of ps activation by zvms in the degradation of cip in all the three systems namely zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps and the results are displayed in figs 5 7 in fig 5 a which shows the xrd patterns of the initial and after the reaction zvi for the zvi ps system the peaks of fe appeared at 2θ 44 7 65 0 and 82 3 which fit well with the standard xrd spectrum of fe jcpds no 36 0696 48 49 however the peak intensity of fe or zvi after the reaction was decreased meanwhile iron ions were released from zvi into the persulfate oxidation system and resulted in the generation of so4 and ho following eqs 2 3 and 7 a weak peak was produced which is similar to that of lepidocrocite jcpds 08 0098 at 27 2 moreover the bending vibration of oh modes in γ feooh recorded at approximately 750 cm 1 was evident from the ftir fig 5 b 50 some of the previous studies revealed that iron oxyhydr oxides including magnetite fe3o4 s and goethite α feooh s could appear on the zvi surfaces during the ps oxidation 51 52 some other studies suggested that mixtures of phases such as magnetite maghemite lepidocrocite and goethite were present in the zvi particles under the effect of anion so4 2 in groundwater 26 and during ps decomposition 53 the formation of γ feooh as an oxidation substance is accelerated by regular stirring and addition of abundant oxygen into the solution the results illustrated on the oxide performance suggest that corrosion of zvi is suitable for the generation of iron oxyhydroxide feooh over iron oxides as explained by the reactions given below 54 18 4fe0 3o2 2h2o 4γfeooh s 19 4fe3o4 o2 6h2o 12γfeooh 20 γfe2o3 h2o 2γfeooh the xrd diffraction pattern of the zva ps system before and after the reaction is shown in fig 6 a the characteristic peaks of al at 2θ 38 45 44 95 65 35 and 78 45 which fit jcpds data 04 0787 could be seen at a high initial concentration of zva and the lower diffraction peaks of zva occurred after the reaction interestingly aluminum after treatment product γ al2o3 was detected after the reaction with some tiny peaks at 20 55 corresponding to jcpds 29 0063 the ftir spectrum of zva after the reaction fig 6 b also showed γ al2o3 at low wavenumbers of 759 and 630 cm 1 bending vibrations of the al o al bonds 55 the mechanism of zval surface corrosion in zva ps was explained that zva as the electron donor undergoes a series of corrosion reactions which led to the simultaneous generation of al3 after the reaction the oxide film of zva was not completetly removed and existed as aluminum oxide γ al2o3 in fig 7 a the xrd pattern analysis confirms that the zvc before and after the reaction consisted mainly of metallic copper cu the peaks of cu occurred at 43 316 50 448 and 74 125 jcpds 89 2838 moreover the xrd analysis showed a weaker signal of cu with a small quantity of cuprous oxide cu2o as given by eq 12 and the peaks corresponding to cu2o were at 36 418 42 297 61 344 and 73 526 jcpds 05 0667 furthermore as shown in the ftir spectra fig 5 f the ir peaks from 629 cm 1 to 588 cm 1 were associated with cu i o stretching vibration the appearance of cu2o on the zvc surface suggests that cu i was formed through the ps oxidation reaction zhang et al 2017 investigated the zvc characteristics after the reaction with acetaminophen by the zvc o2 process using the xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra 56 they also confirmed the formation of cu2o on the surface of the zvc particles indicating that cu i had been produced during the oxidation of zvc thus copper ions were released in aop zvc ps to generate active radicals to reduce cip 4 conclusion zvms zvi zva and zvc acted as efficient catalysts to decompose ps for removing cip from an aqueous solution the effects of variables such as dosage of zvms the molar concentration of ps and ph value on the zvms ps system were estimated in terms of cip reduction among the three ps systems zvi ps demanded the shortest reaction time and showed the highest reduction capacity for cip compared to zva ps and zvc ps cip removal completely fitted the pseudo first order pattern a lower ph accelerated the degradation of cip the investigation of the degradation mechanism demonstrated that both ho and so4 which was primarily responsible for the reduction of cip was generated through the aops of the in situ released fe2 fe3 al3 cu and cu2 ions with ps funding this research is funded by thuyloi university

14037,the removal mechanisms of ciprofloxacin cip in an aqueous solution using the persulfate ps oxidation system activated by zero valent metals zvms such as zero valent iron zvi zero valent aluminum zva and zero valent copper zvc were compared the cip removal followed the pseudo first order kinetics in all the ps oxidation processes mediated by the zvms the influence of factors of the ps oxidation system such as ph and concentrations of both zvms and ps was analyzed our results indicate that zvi ps process resulted in the highest removal of cip at 84 5 1 3 kobs 29 8 10 3 min 1 within 60 min with pho of 3 0 a molar dosage of ps at 2 25 mm and concentration of zvi at 126 mg l 1 however cip was only removed to the extent of 73 3 2 5 with kobs 21 9 10 3 min 1 by zva ps with pho of 3 0 ps o 2 25 mm and concentration of zva at 81 mg l 1 finally for zvc ps system the removal efficiency of cip was lowest at 59 9 3 2 with constant rate kobs 15 10 3 min 1 when optimum conditions were initial ph of 4 0 ps o 2 25 mm and dosage of zvc at 192 mg l 1 based on x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra fe2 and fe3 ions from zvi al3 ions from zva and cu and cu2 ions from zvc were released by ps oxidation moreover active radicals ho so4 determined as primary agents to total oxidation performance were generated through the activation of ps by intermediate ion metals keywords ciprofloxacin persulfate oxidation zero valent iron zero valent aluminum zero valent copper mechanism 1 introduction ciprofloxacin cip whose essential characteristics are listed in table 1 is a popular second generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic for treating bacterial infections that cause diseases in both humans and animals 1 as the primary usage of cip is oral some cip is always excreted via urine in unmetabolized form from the patients bodies 2 as a consequence this antibiotic usually enters the environment through untreated sludge wastewater effluent urban runoff to nearby streams etc 3 according to a number of studies residual cip is predominantly found in hospital wastewater for instance rodriguez mozar et al reported that the amount of cip in hospital wastewater near the ter river in spain was over 13 μg l 1 4 cip was also found in the incoming water and outgoing treated water in 11 sweden sewage treatment plants with concentrations of 1 41 μg l 1 and 0 06 μg l 1 respectively 5 in vietnam cip was found in rural hospital wastewater in hanoi and hochiminh city at a high concentration of 87 3 μg l 1 in the influent and 53 3 μg l 1 in the outgoing treated wastewater 6 furthermore the highest amount of cip in the wastewater from the entire pharmaceutical industry in vietnam has been detected at 50 mg l 1 7 although cip in the groundwater surface water and wastewater only constitutes micropollutants it can lead to the development of quinolone resistant bacteria and pose a danger to the ecological system and human health 1 therefore the presence of hazardous cip compound in the sources of aquaculture hospital effluents and pharmacy wastewater is a serious threat to the environment and its treatment deserves urgent attention the traditional treatment systems such as coagulation sedimentation and biological process suffer from numerous disadvantages when they are used for the degradation of micropollutants hence advanced oxidation processes aops based on free radicals ho and so4 have been developed with a high degree of urgency for effective treatment of residual antibiotics in the environment 10 12 there are many methods to generate free radicals from persulfate ps for the degradation of antibiotics for example those involving heat activation 13 15 transition metal ions 16 18 ultrasonics 19 bases 20 uv light 13 21 22 and activated carbon 23 24 compared to the other methods zero valent metals zvms namely zero valent iron zvi zero valent aluminum zva zero valent copper zvc and zero valent zinc zvz were proven to be active catalysts by supplying transition metal ions in aops for removing the contaminants in the environment 25 numerous reports have described the advantage of zvms for example their ability to be used in treating the different pollutants in the soil and various water resources such as groundwater 26 surface water 16 and wastewater 27 in addition the zvms are highly reactive and cost effective 27 previously a few research studies focused on the application of zvi in ps mediation for degrading antibiotics 16 28 however the research has been quite limited on the removal of antibiotics when the catalyst was replaced by zva or zvc in this study three zvms namely zvi zva and zvc were employed to remove cip from an aqueous solution under ambient conditions using the ps oxidation process the primary goals of this research are 1 to compare the factors influencing the cip removal by ps oxidation mediated by zvms i e zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps under various operational conditions such as ph ps dosage zvm molar concentration and initial cip molar concentration and 2 to investigate through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd spectra the catalytic ability of zvi zva and zvc in activating ps to remove cip and the mechanism involved therein 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ciprofloxacin c17h18fn3o3 98 fe zvi al zva cu zvc 99

sigma aldrich germany were used for quenching the aops 2 2 batch experiment procedures firstly a cip stock solution 30 μm was prepared in distilled water by adding two to three drops of h2so4 98 to the cip solution and then dissolving it in an ultrasonic bath vwra142 0307 vwr singapore each of the zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps treatment tests used 200 ml of the cip solution the initial solution s ph was adjusted with 0 1 m h2so4 or 0 1 m naoh the solution specimens were transferred to 250 ml glass erlenmeyer flasks for mixing the solutions completely the flasks were installed on an incubator shaker ks 3000i ika germany that was operated at a constant temperature of 25 c and a shaking speed of 120 rpm reaction samples were obtained at pre defined times with 10 ml syringes and mixed with 1 ml meoh to quench the remaining ps concentration all of the experiments were repeated three times and the error bars displayed in figures represent standard deviations of triplicate measures 2 3 analysis cip was analyzed using an agilent 1200 series high performance liquid chromatography hplc system capell pak c18 column 250 mm 4 6 mm inner diameter for chromatographic separations at room

phase was 0 5 ml min 1 and the detection wavelength was set at 280 nm atomic absorption spectroscopy aas savantaa σ gbc australia was applied to identify the concentration of total iron ions fe 2 and fe 3 aluminum ions al3 and copper ions cu2 according to the standard epa 7000b ps was quantified by a spectrophotometric method as described by 29 to characterize the zvms i e iron aluminum and copper the functional groups on the surface of the zvms before and after the reaction were detected by ftir spectroscopy at 400 4000 cm 1 bruker tensor ii ftir germany the xrd patterns of the zvms were adopted using x pert pro panalytical b v netherlands with a high power cuk α radioactive source wavelength of 0 154 nm created at 40 kv 40 ma all the samples were scanned with a step width of 0 028 2θ at a scanning rate of 88 2θ min the cip removal process followed the pseudo first order kinetics equation given below 1 ln c c 0 k o b s t where c is the amount of cip mg l 1 at a given time t co is the initial cip concentration mg l 1 kobs is the pseudo first order constant min 1 and t is the time of reaction min 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial ph of the solution the effect of the initial ph of the solution on cip reduction was determined over a ph range of 3 0 10 0 as illustrated in fig 1 it was clear that the three ps systems zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps favored acidic conditions the optimum ph was 3 0 for ps oxidation activated by zvi kobs 9 8 10 3 min 1 and zva kobs 9 4 10 3 min 1 while the optimum ph was 4 0 for the ps oxidation activated by zvc ps kobs 9 2 10 3 min 1 this phenomenon is described through eqs 2 6 2 fe0 2h fe2 h2 3 fe2 s2o8 2 fe3 so4 so4 2 k 2 0 10 m 1 s 1 4 2al0 s2o8 2 6h 1 5o2 2al3 2so4 3h2o 5 2cu0 2h 2cu h2 6 cu s2o8 2 cu2 so4 so4 2 7 so4 h2o so4 2 ho h through the reactions described by eqs 2 4 and 5 it may be observed that ps significantly expedites the corrosion of zvm and the generation of metal ions fe2 al3 and cu this leads to the retention of these metal ions as well as limitation of hydroxide precipitates i e al oh 3 fe oh 3 and cu oh 2 formation thus these reactions produce active radicals ho so4 following eq 2 7 30 31 kobs of the zvi ps system at a ph of 3 0 was 9 8 10 3 min 1 which was the highest furthermore it was almost the same as that at a ph of 4 0 9 7 10 3 min 1 however when ph was increased to 5 0 the amount of cip degradation was drastically decreased to 41 with an obvious drop in kobs to about 7 8 10 3 min 1 similarly in the case of the zva ps system kobs was slightly decreased from 9 2 10 3 to 8 8 10 3 min 1 as the ph value was varied from 4 0 6 0 during the aop based sulfate radical oxidation at a ph of 7 0 the removal of cip was significantly reduced to 38 this could be explained by the precipitation of fe2 and al3 ions following eqs 9 and 10 at different ph values according to balintova and petrilakova 2011 fe2 is oxidized to fe3 by oxygen and subsequently it produces the precipitate fe oh 3 at ph values of 3 5 and above eqs 8 and 9 while aluminum precipitated in the ph range of 4 0 5 5 eq 10 32 as seen in fig 1d there was a significant decline in all the three systems final ph below 4 0 since the initial ph was from 3 to 6 of zva ps and ph before and after reaction was 4 0 and 3 45 respectively for the zvi ps system this leads indirectly to justify the absolute utilization of h to dissolve the oxide coating on aluminum particles releasing transition iron and aluminum ions 8 fe2 o2 fe3 o2 9 fe3 3oh fe oh 3 10 al3 3oh al oh 3 11 2al oh 3 al2o3 3h2o 12 cu oh cuoh 13 2cuoh cu2o h2o in the zvc ps system when ph was below 4 0 the significant decrease in the cip removal to 42 6 might be attributed to the unavailability of the adsorption process at the surface of zvc its surface had a positive charge at ph below ph point zero charge phpzc 3 14 33 whereas cip also transforms into a positive ion cip at the same ph value the efficiency of cip degradation was the highest at 44 8 kobs 9 2 10 3 min 1 at ph 4 0 however kobs again reduced at ph 7 0 the reason for this behavior was that there was a shortage of h ions to corrode the zvc layer and hence the generated cu would be instantly limited by oh via eqs 11 and 12 33 in a neutral condition the ability of cip degradation was not only by the aop based on ho and so4 radicals but also on the adsorption process the adsorption took place because oxygen atoms of the keto and carboxylic groups of the cip structure were linked to the roughened surfaces of zvi zva and zvc as well as producing strong complexes with dissolving metal ions 34 the peak intensity of co 1635 cm 1 seen in the ftir spectra of all the zvms fig 2 was slightly increased after the treatment however the adsorption process played a negligible role in degrading cip in zvms ps this phenomenon was indicated that the dissolving the passive oxide layer from zvms surface and zvms surface area were limited in neutral conditions 35 36 compare to zva and zvc the peak intensity changes 1635 cm 1 of zvi was higher due to a higher sorption capacity cip into hydrous ferric oxides produced of the zvi surface corrosion 34 in an alkaline condition the efficiency of cip removal was significantly reduced with kobs 3 6 10 3 5 0 10 3 and 2 8 10 3 min 1 for zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps respectively owing to the production of less active radicals firstly the growth of the metal hydroxide layer covering the zvm surfaces in basic environments decreased the reactive surface area for the production of so4 and ho radicals moreover the primary active radical in these aops was hydroxyl radical ho formed at a ph of 10 0 following eq 13 villegas guzman et al 2017 showed that so4 2 could limit the ho oxidation in reaction because of the generation of less active species 37 3 2 effect of dosage of zvms zvi zva zvc the influence of the initial zvms dosage on the removal of cip by the three systems namely zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps is depicted in fig 3 as shown in the figure the cip reduction fitted the pseudo first order kinetics well as seen ps alone did not remove cip due to the lack of dosage of ps and the durable structure of this antibiotic 22 when the concentration of zvi was increased from 42 mg l 1 to 126 mg l 1 the corresponding kobs increased from 11 4 10 3 min 1 to 13 9 10 3 min 1 subsequently as the concentration of zvi was further increased to 252 mg l 1 kobs of the cip degradation dropped to 10 2 10 3 min 1 similarly for the zva ps and zvc ps systems kobs peaked at 13 2 10 3 min 1 and 12 9 10 3 min 1 respectively as the concentration of zva and zvc rose to 81 mg l 1 and 192 mg l 1 as further additions to the dosages of zva and zvc were made to bring 121 5 mg l 1 and 288 mg l 1 kobs decreased to 11 8 10 3and 10 4 10 3 min 1 for cip zva and cip zvc respectively this phenomenon may be explained by the fact that the excess zvm moles would supply more active species and generate a large number of electrons and after the quenching of the free radicals the limitation of cip removal follows eqs 14 15 30 33 at the same time fig 3 d illustrates that metal ions total fe al3 and cu2 were released after the treatment duration of 60 min as the dosage of zvi and zvc were increased from 42 to 252 mg l 1 and 48 288 mg l 1 the final total fe and cu2 concentrations increased dramatically from 8 9 10 3 to 57 0 10 3 mm and 2 0 10 3 to 18 0 10 3 mm respectively however the residual al3 after the aop attained a peak of 47 0 10 3 mm with the concentration of zva at 81 mg l 1 as dosage of zva increased to 121 5 mg l 1 amount of al 3 reduced slightly at 45 8 10 3 mm according 38 al3 in aqueous solution be produced by zva corrosion in zva ps system in acidic environment influenced in ph of solution and dosage of ps moreover the final value of ph 2 86 at dosage zva of 121 5 mg l 1 was higher than of those 2 56 at concentration of zva of 81 mg l 1 data did not show it revealed that more floccules al hydr oxide produced on surface of zva thus residual al3 after reaction decreased as the dosage of zva rise from 81 mg l 1 to 121 5 mg l 1 14 fe2 so4 fe3 so4 2 15 cu so4 cu2 so4 2 3 3 effect of ps s2o8 2 concentration ps plays an important role in the generation of radicals in the zvm activated ps oxidation in our experiments the initial concentrations of cip were fixed at 30 μm and the zvms participated by for 126 mg l 1 of zvi dosage of zva at 81 mg l 1 and 192 mg l 1 of zvc the influence of ps concentration on the degradation of cip was analyzed under different concentration of ps i e 0 mm 0 45 mm 0 75 mm 1 5 mm 2 25 mm and 3 mm with the results displayed in fig 4 for any concentration of ps the reduction of cip followed the pseudo first order kinetics the results illustrated that lower cip reduction was observed by zvms alone as compared to zvms ps system as shown in fig 4 only 11 8 and 3 82 removal of cip was observed in the zvi zva and zvc system respectively after 60 min of reaction the degradation of cip occurred due to zvms surface adsorption and reduction 35 it has been widely established that the cip removal rate would increase as the concentration of ps increased kobs for zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps typically increased and reached the highest values of about 29 8 10 3 21 9 10 3 and 15 0 10 3 min 1 respectively corresponding to a concentration of ps of 2 25 mm nonetheless when the concentration of ps continued to rise to 3 mm the corresponding kobs decreased to 27 4 10 3 20 7 10 3 and 14 10 3 min 1 for zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps respectively this phenomenon could be explained by the reaction between s2o8 2 and so4 eq 16 39 and the recoupling between the two so4 ions eq 17 40 it leads to a reduction of the effectiveness of cip oxidation 16 s2o8 2 so4 s2o8 so4 2 17 so4 so4 s2o8 2 in fig 4 d the residual ps at 60 min was displayed after the complete degradation of cip in general residual ps concentrations i e after the treatment with the zvc ps system was the highest for all dosage of ps from 0 45 to 3 mm at 0 45 μm 1487 5 μm among all the three zvm activated ps oxidations moreover the percentage of ps consumption at optimum conditions during 60 min decreased in the order zvi ps zva ps zvc ps the corresponding numbers were 84 5 1 3 73 3 2 5 and 59 9 3 2 for zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps respectively therefore the efficiency of cip degradation of zvi ps was the highest among the three systems considered 3 4 effect of initial cip table 2 illustrates the effect of the initial dosage of cip cip 0 on the zvm activated ps initial concentrations of cip of 3 μm 15 μm 30 μm 60 μm were investigated the concentration of ps was at 2 25 mm and dosage of zvi zva and zvc were 126 mg l 1 81 mg l 1 and 192 mg l 1 respectively all the reactions followed the pseudo first order patterns well the kobs values of the three aops were decreased when cip 0 was increased from 3 to 60 μm and followed the order zvc ps zva ps zvi ps i e 18 8 10 3 23 2 10 3 35 1 10 3 min 1 respectively in theory the total active radical so4 ho yields were constant once the ps dose was kept constant under the corresponding conditions as a consequence the efficiency of the cip reduction decreased when the initial cip concentration was increased during the reaction time 41 overall zvi displayed the more efficient of cip reduction than zva and zvc as mentioned in previous research 42 43 the surface oxide film of zva was not only thicker than that of zvi but also it was difficult completely to remove after persulfate oxidation reaction thus zva required more challenging surface reactions and hence the ability of zva ps to remove cip was lower than that of the zvi ps system for zvc ps system the oxidation of zvc to cu was slow causing the lowest in the rate of degradation of cip as fig 3 d concentration of ion copper was less about three fold than concentration of ion iron as well as a concentration of ion aluminum in solution after treatment 3 5 identification of reactive radicals initially two active radicals i e so4 and ho were produced during the zvm mediated decomposition of ps through radical reaction characteristics meoh and tba were set as common quenching substances to study their inhibition impact on the cip removal 31 44 45 these alcohols were added at a specific concentration of 30 mm that corresponded to a 1000 1 m ratio of probe compounds versus the initial contaminant cip these results identified from the quenching reactions are illustrated in table 3 when tba and meoh were applied to the experimental solutions the cip degradation of the zvi activated ps system markedly decreased by 43 2 and 8 5 respectively the corresponding values with zva activated ps system were 38 7 and 14 respectively finally with zvc activated ps system the corresponding figures were 27 5 and 8 2 respectively it is known that tba was used as ho quencher with the reactivity of the oh tba system ktba ho 3 8 108 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 46 but as ineffective for so4 ktba so4 4 105 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 47 while meoh could scavenge both ho kmeoh ho 109 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 46 and so4 kmeoh so4 1 1 107 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 47 as a consequence the presence of 30 mm of meoh almost significantly inhibited the removal of cip in the zvms ps system which illustrates that so4 was one of the main reactive radicals besides ho can be produced by so4 via eq 7 which was indicated by the inhibition of cip removal with the addition of 30 mm tba these results conclude that both ho and so4 contributed to the total removal of cip it should be indicated that the findings achieved in this research are similar to those reported in the research by 33 45 3 6 analysis of released metal ions using xrd and ftir xrd and ftir analyses were performed to study the mechanism of ps activation by zvms in the degradation of cip in all the three systems namely zvi ps zva ps and zvc ps and the results are displayed in figs 5 7 in fig 5 a which shows the xrd patterns of the initial and after the reaction zvi for the zvi ps system the peaks of fe appeared at 2θ 44 7 65 0 and 82 3 which fit well with the standard xrd spectrum of fe jcpds no 36 0696 48 49 however the peak intensity of fe or zvi after the reaction was decreased meanwhile iron ions were released from zvi into the persulfate oxidation system and resulted in the generation of so4 and ho following eqs 2 3 and 7 a weak peak was produced which is similar to that of lepidocrocite jcpds 08 0098 at 27 2 moreover the bending vibration of oh modes in γ feooh recorded at approximately 750 cm 1 was evident from the ftir fig 5 b 50 some of the previous studies revealed that iron oxyhydr oxides including magnetite fe3o4 s and goethite α feooh s could appear on the zvi surfaces during the ps oxidation 51 52 some other studies suggested that mixtures of phases such as magnetite maghemite lepidocrocite and goethite were present in the zvi particles under the effect of anion so4 2 in groundwater 26 and during ps decomposition 53 the formation of γ feooh as an oxidation substance is accelerated by regular stirring and addition of abundant oxygen into the solution the results illustrated on the oxide performance suggest that corrosion of zvi is suitable for the generation of iron oxyhydroxide feooh over iron oxides as explained by the reactions given below 54 18 4fe0 3o2 2h2o 4γfeooh s 19 4fe3o4 o2 6h2o 12γfeooh 20 γfe2o3 h2o 2γfeooh the xrd diffraction pattern of the zva ps system before and after the reaction is shown in fig 6 a the characteristic peaks of al at 2θ 38 45 44 95 65 35 and 78 45 which fit jcpds data 04 0787 could be seen at a high initial concentration of zva and the lower diffraction peaks of zva occurred after the reaction interestingly aluminum after treatment product γ al2o3 was detected after the reaction with some tiny peaks at 20 55 corresponding to jcpds 29 0063 the ftir spectrum of zva after the reaction fig 6 b also showed γ al2o3 at low wavenumbers of 759 and 630 cm 1 bending vibrations of the al o al bonds 55 the mechanism of zval surface corrosion in zva ps was explained that zva as the electron donor undergoes a series of corrosion reactions which led to the simultaneous generation of al3 after the reaction the oxide film of zva was not completetly removed and existed as aluminum oxide γ al2o3 in fig 7 a the xrd pattern analysis confirms that the zvc before and after the reaction consisted mainly of metallic copper cu the peaks of cu occurred at 43 316 50 448 and 74 125 jcpds 89 2838 moreover the xrd analysis showed a weaker signal of cu with a small quantity of cuprous oxide cu2o as given by eq 12 and the peaks corresponding to cu2o were at 36 418 42 297 61 344 and 73 526 jcpds 05 0667 furthermore as shown in the ftir spectra fig 5 f the ir peaks from 629 cm 1 to 588 cm 1 were associated with cu i o stretching vibration the appearance of cu2o on the zvc surface suggests that cu i was formed through the ps oxidation reaction zhang et al 2017 investigated the zvc characteristics after the reaction with acetaminophen by the zvc o2 process using the xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra 56 they also confirmed the formation of cu2o on the surface of the zvc particles indicating that cu i had been produced during the oxidation of zvc thus copper ions were released in aop zvc ps to generate active radicals to reduce cip 4 conclusion zvms zvi zva and zvc acted as efficient catalysts to decompose ps for removing cip from an aqueous solution the effects of variables such as dosage of zvms the molar concentration of ps and ph value on the zvms ps system were estimated in terms of cip reduction among the three ps systems zvi ps demanded the shortest reaction time and showed the highest reduction capacity for cip compared to zva ps and zvc ps cip removal completely fitted the pseudo first order pattern a lower ph accelerated the degradation of cip the investigation of the degradation mechanism demonstrated that both ho and so4 which was primarily responsible for the reduction of cip was generated through the aops of the in situ released fe2 fe3 al3 cu and cu2 ions with ps funding this research is funded by thuyloi university

250 mg l toluene spiked solutions solids liquid s l ratio 1 10 for 6 h in a temperature controlled incubator static equilibrations were performed at 25 c in narrow mouthed 120 ml capacity glass bottles that were crimped with teflon coated septa adsorption experiments were also performed with 2 5 mix at 14 and 19 c to construct van t hoff plot the mix was statically equilibrated with 100 mg l

in the vicinity of barrier to enable the targeted portion of groundwater to flow through prb 3 adsorption capacity rate of adsorption and residence time for contaminant removal by the barrier that can be evaluated from laboratory experiments 4 monitoring strategy and 5 cost of treatment the residence period of the contaminated solution in the barrier t is calculated as 1 r e s i d e n c e p e r i o d t l v where l and v are the travel length and velocity of groundwater flow in the prb the width of the barrier determines the travel length for linear horizontal flow path condition and depends on the relative permeability of the prb and surrounding aquifer medium 17 the velocity of contaminated water flow in the prb can be evaluated from the constant head laboratory test 22 the test involves permeation of the contaminated solution through a saturated prb column under a constant hydraulic gradient i the discharge q cm3 s in the constant head test calculates the velocity of flow v cm s as 22 2 q v a in eq 2 a is the cross sectional area of the compacted column knowing v and l the residence period of the contaminated solution in the prb can be obtained from eq 1 the rate of contaminant removal by the reactive material in the prb can be determined from batch experiments for effective functioning of prb the time required for contaminant removal by the reactive material must be less than the residence period of the contaminant solution in the prb the flow velocity in the prb column also gives the coefficient of permeability k cm s of the barrier as 22 3 v k i the hydraulic gradient is defined as 4 i δ h l in eq 4 δh represents the head loss experienced by groundwater on flowing over length l in the prb the residence period t also determines the thickness of the barrier b according to the equation 17 5 b v t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tcr and sand particles 3 1 1 physico chemical characteristics sand and tcr particles are composed fig 1 of 60 70 medium sized particles 2 to 0 425 mm 12 30 fine sized particles 0 425 to 0 075 mm and 9 17 coarse particles 4 75 to 2 mm respectively 19 sand and tcr particles have specific gravity of 2 66 and 1 16 respectively the surface area of tcr particles correspond to 0 3 m2 g and was unaffected by toluene adsorption zinc concentration in the tclp leachate 0 85 mg l is lesser than its drinking water permissible limit 15 mg l 23 3 1 2 ftir characterization of tcr particles fig 2 depicts the ftir spectrum of tcr particles the peaks at 1031 1067 cm 1 1304 and 1430 cm 1 are assigned to c o c ch2 and ch3 groups of the sbp component 24 25 the peaks at 2845 2913 and 1369 cm 1 are assigned to ch2 groups of isoprene the peak at 821 cm 1 corresponds to the ch group of polyisoprenes 26 the peak at 1534 cm 1 corresponds to coostretching of zinc carboxylate 24 the peaks from 600 821 cm 1 are assigned to different functional groups of poly sulphides ss and disulfides c s s s 25 27 sbp is major constituent of rubber tyres isoprene and polyisoprene are additives to rubber tyres sulfur is added as vulcanization agent while zinc is added as vulcanization activator to rubber tyre 25 the ftir spectrum of toluene adsorbed particles fig 2 shows a prominent peak at 3400 cm 1 which is assigned to the o h stretching of water molecules retained in the air dried specimen toluene molecules exhibit strong peaks at 3032 3068 and 3099 cm 1 and at 1625 cm 1 the said peaks are not observed in fig 2 due to possible interference from oh stretching of water molecules a strong peak is however observed at 1635 cm 1 which is attributed to c c aromatic stretching of toluene 28 30 3 1 3 thermogravimetric and edx analysis tga and edx plots of tcr particles figs 3 and 4 are analysed based on the observations of earlier researchers 25 31 35 the initial weight loss 13 95 160 350 c fig 3 is attributed to volatilization of processing oil plasticizers low molecular weight emulsifiers and antioxidants the notable weight loss 52 66 between 350 and 499 c is attributed to volatilization of sbp constituent the non combustible fraction 33 93 is attributed to presence of carbon black and inorganic additives the elemental edx analysis fig 4 shows the presence of c si s ca zn and fe constituents in the tcr particles in agreement with earlier studies 25 32 33 the tcr specimen table 1 dominates in sbp 52 66 and has a lesser amount of cb 24 53 3 2 adsorption behaviour fig 5 plots the distribution coefficient kc l g as a function of initial toluene concentration for the 0 5 2 5 and 10 mixes the distribution coefficient is defined as 36 6 k c q e c e where qe is the amount of toluene adsorbed mg g by the mix at given co initial toluene concentration and ce is the equilibrium toluene concentration in the solution mg l a greater distribution coefficient implies larger partitioning of the pollutant by the adsorbent 9 the 0 5 2 5 and 10 mixes exhibit peak kc at co values of 25 25 and 7 5 mg l respectively the peak kc values of the 0 5 2 5 and 10 mixes correspond to 3 69 7 91 and 0 86 l g respectively the lower kc of the 10 mix is attributed to aggregation of particles that reduces the surface area for contaminant adsorption the occurrence of peak in the kc co relationship implies that toluene adsorption occurs at energetically heterogenous sites further with increasing surface coverage the toluene molecules are constrained to occupy sites with lower affinity causing a slump in kc in the post peak region the adsorption isotherms of various mixes fig 6 at 25 c reinforce the inference that maximum adsorption capacity is exhibited by the 2 5 mix increase in tcr concentration beyond 2 5 reduces the toluene adsorption capacity from aggregation of tcr particles besides physical effects particle aggregation chemical effects of ion substitution can influence the adsorption behaviour of pollutants 37 the scatchard relationship is derived from the langmuir isotherm 16 38 39 and provides insight into the nature of adsorption process the isotherm is represented as 7 q e c e q m k b q e k b where qe mg g is the amount of toluene adsorbed by the mix at equilibrium ce mg l is the toluene concentration in solution at equilibrium qm is the number of binding sites of the mix mg g and kb l mg is the association constant adsorption of toluene at sites of similar energy results in a singular plot comparatively toluene adsorption at sites with varying binding energies produces multiple plots adsorption of toluene by the mixes exhibit bi linear plots fig 7a c indicating that tcr particles are characterized by heterogenous sites and are amenable to analysis by freundlich isotherm the freundlich model fig 8 describes adsorption at heterogenous surface and is given as 8 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where kf is the distribution coefficient mg g and n is related to the adsorption behaviour all three mixes obey the isotherm fig 8 the r2 values of the 10 2 5 and 0 5 mixes correspond to 0 98 0 86 and 0 96 respectively conformance to freundlich isotherm emphasizes the presence of heterogenous adsorption sites based on the findings of earlier study 16 the cb and sbp components of tcr participate in toluene adsorption the freundlich n parameter of the 0 5 and 10 mixes are unity 1 0 and 0 97 the results imply that toluene absorption capacity of tcr particles is not satisfied at the experimental adsorbate concentrations typical of type c isotherm 40 the n value of 2 5 mix is greater than unity 1 66 which is indicative of a physical adsorption process 41 the freundlich distribution coefficients kf of 10 2 5 and 0 5 mixes are 0 57 3 84 and 3 03 mg g respectively and follow a trend like the kcpeak values nole et al 16 report a much lower kf value for toluene adsorption by tcr particles the 2 5 mix has the largest distribution coefficients kcpeak 7 91 l g and kf 3 84 mg g it is hence identified as the optimal mix for prb construction the 2 5 mix is further examined for kinetics and adsorption thermodynamics 3 3 adsorption kinetics of 2 5 tcr 97 5 sand mix fig 9 plots the lagergren first order plots for toluene adsorption by the 2 5 mix at 25 c 42 9 ln q e q l n q e k 1 t in eq 9 q and qe are the amounts of toluene adsorbed mg g at time t min and equilibrium and k1 is lagergren or pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the pseudo first order plot fig 9a exhibits bilinearity an initial rapid adsorption segment 1 is followed by slower segment separation of lagergren plot fig 9b into two segments segment 1 10 60 min r2 0 99 and segment 2 60 360 min r2 1 give pseudo first order rate constants of 0 097 min 1 and 0 0425 min 1 respectively indicating that stage 1 adsorption is rapid than stage 2 adsorption the qe values adsorption capacity at equilibrium are obtained from the lagergren plot intercepts and correspond to 35 83 mg g qe1 segment 1 and 7 1 mg g qe2 segment 2 respectively fig 9b the sum of qe values 42 93 mg g suggest that stage 1 is responsible for bulk 83 of toluene adsorption while a smaller fraction 17 is adsorbed during stage 2 7 1 mg g fig 10 compares the amounts of toluene adsorbed by unit mass of carbon black and tcr particles 2 5 mix constituent at 25 c the amounts of toluene adsorbed by carbon black particles are 0 46 to 0 91 folds smaller than tcr particles with an average of 0 67 the adsorption average 67 of carbon black particles and stage 1 adsorption value 83 of tcr particles fig 9b are reasonably similar the results suggest that stage 1 adsorption fig 9 is largely contributed by cb component of tcr particles 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics the thermodynamic parameters are obtained from van t hoff eq 10 by using the equilibrium adsorption data of 100 mg l solution at 14 19 and 25 c 10 l n k c δ s o r δ h o r t to render kc dimensionless the ce term eq 6 is expressed as mg g instead of mg l by expressing volume l of toluene solution as mass mg the δh enthalpy change and δs entropy change values are obtained from the slope and intercept of the van t hoff plot fig 11 the free energy change δg is obtained at each temperature as 11 δ g r t l n k c in eqs 10 and 11 r and t are gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and absolute temperature k respectively analysis of van t hoff plot data fig 11 indicates that toluene adsorption by tcr particles is characterized by δh and δs values of 47 06 kj mol and 0 159 kj mol k respectively toluene adsorption is endothermic positive enthalpy apparently as its de hydration in solution requires greater heat 13 than that released on its adsorption in the de hydrated state the positive entropy 0 159 kj mol k indicates that toluene molecules possess greater degree of freedom in the adsorbed phase than in the solution phase apparently the interaction energy between toluene molecules and adsorption sites are weaker than the bonding energy between adsorbate and water molecules in solution leading to their greater degree of freedom positive entropy in the adsorbed state the δg values for toluene adsorption correspond to 0 46 0 40 and 1 30 kj mol at 25 19 and 14 c respectively indicating that higher temperature favors the adsorption process typical of endothermic adsorption 8 the range of δg values indicate that toluene molecules are bound to the adsorption sites by weak van der waals attraction forces 8 the dr equation dubinin radushkevich 8 43 is analyzed by plotting fig 12 the toluene adsorption data of 2 5 tcr sand mix at 25 c as 12 ln q e l n q m β ε 2 in eq 12 qe is the amount of toluene adsorbed at equilibrium qm is the theoretical adsorption capacity of the mix mg g and ε is the polanyi potential j mol 1 that is related to the equilibrium toluene concentration ce as 13 ε r t l n 1 1 c e the adsorption energy e is obtained as 14 e 1 2 β the adsorption energy e kj mol 1 required to transfer one mole of toluene from aqueous solution to the adsorbent site corresponds to 100 j mol that is typical of physical adsorption 42 fig 13 compares the toluene adsorption desorption behavior of the 2 5 mix at 25 c the adsorption plot represents the retention of the non polar solute from 100 mg l toluene solution as function of time the time desorption plot represents release of toluene molecules from tcr particles on prolonged contact with water and 95 water 5 methanol solution methanol was added to water to improve the leachability of hydrophobic toluene molecules the plots show that only about 9 of the adsorbed toluene undergo desorption at equilibrium in both solvents implying that major fraction of the non polar molecules is irreversibly adsorbed by tcr particles the low desorption capacity is probably related to the spatial arrangement of toluene molecules in the adsorbent pores that hinders their release longer contact 192 h of toluene adsorbed tcr particles with water did not enhance extent of desorption fig 13 destruction of porous structure in tcr particles by microbial activity in aqueous environment could lead to significant desorption of toluene during rubber production many toxic microbial inhibiting additives and stabilizers are added to rubber the complex composition and structure of tyre rubber and its additives makes it resistant to natural degradation 44 near irreversibility of toluene adsorption will persist till the pore structure of tcr particles in the contaminated groundwater environment remains unaffected very coarse 60 235 μm coarse 60 6 μm medium 6 0 01 μm and fine 0 01 0 002 μm pore contents characterize the pore size distribution of the tcr particle fig 14 the mean pore volume of tcr particle corresponds to 0 388 cm3 g and is contributed by 0 2311 0 068 0 046 and 0 044 cm3 g of very coarse coarse medium and fine pore contents respectively the medium 6 0 01 μm and fine pores 0 01 0 002 μm are identified in the sem of the tcr sample at 10 000x magnification fig 15 the surface of toluene adsorbed tcr particles fig 16 exhibit similar density of medium and fine pores suggesting that the surface morphology of tcr particles is unaffected by toluene adsorption entrapment of distinct particles metal hydroxides in gelatinous matrix are however observed to affect surface morphology in sem studies 45 despite the dominance of very coarse and coarse pores the near irreversibility of toluene adsorption fig 13 suggests that the hydrocarbon molecules are adsorbed in the medium and fine pores adsorption in pores of different sizes is presumably responsible for the heterogeneity of adsorption sites possibly adsorption in medium pores mainly contribute to segment 1 while adsorption in fine pores largely contribute to segment 2 of the lagergren first order plots fig 9 at adsorption equilibrium qe from segments 1 and 2 of fig 9b toluene molecules occupy 0 0308 cm3 and 0 0061 cm3 per unit mass g of the adsorbent that are smaller than the medium 0 046 cm3 g and fine 0 044 cm3 g pore volumes table 2 compares the toluene adsorption capacity of various adsorbents with that of 2 5 tcr sand mix the tcr sand mix has larger toluene adsorption capacity than modified clays and zeolites the s l solid liquid ratios of the modified clays and zeolites are larger 0 5 g 100 ml to 5 g 100 ml than of the 2 5 tcr sand mix s l ratio 0 25 g 100 ml the contact periods are comparable or larger 1 24 h than of the tcr sand mix 6 h the adsorption temperatures 296 298 k and equipment detection limits 1 5 μg l are mostly similar in both experimental sets the range of initial toluene concentrations used in the tcr sand experiments 1 250 mg l straddle the concentration range used in experiments with modified clays and zeolites 9 150 mg l despite lower s l ratio lesser adsorption sites similar toluene concentration range and temperature the tcr sand mix exhibits a larger toluene adsorption capacity the results imply that tcr particles have greater affinity for toluene molecules the carbon nano tubes and activated c have larger toluene removal capacity 80 1 194 1 mg g than tcr sand mix comparatively mesoporous c has lower adsorption capacity 18 2 mg g than the tcr sand mix the s l ratio of the c adsorbents are lower 0 06 to 0 15 g 100 ml than of the tcr sand mix the initial toluene concentration range 10 442 mg l adsorption temperature 298 303 k are comparable for the two set of adsorbents however larger contact periods are generally employed in experiments with c adsorbent 4 10 48 h despite the lower s l ratio the c adsorbents mostly exhibit larger toluene adsorption capacity than the tcr sand mix the green adsorbent prepared using ostrich bone waste has larger adsorption capacity than the tcr sand mix the s l ratio 1 g 100 ml and contact period 24 h used in experiments with ostrich bone is higher than used in the tcr sand mix experiment the experimental temperature 298 k and initial toluene concentrations 0 5 300 mg l are however comparable the larger toluene removal by the ostrich bone waste could be a combination of higher s l ratio more adsorption sites and superior adsorption affinity for toluene molecules the cost of 1 kg of claytone 40 carbon nano tubes activated carbon and crumb rubber are included in table 2 though tcr sand mix has lower adsorption capacity than carbon nano tubes activated carbon and ostrich bone waste the cost benefits the wide availability of this green adsorbent plus re use of a waste material discarded tyre makes it preferred reactive material for prb construction 3 5 projected performance of unit prb column 3 5 1 residence period of contaminated groundwater in prb for toluene adsorption the permeability of a compacted 2 5 tcr 97 5 sand column was experimentally determined as 2 10 4 cm s the dry density and porosity n of the experimental column diameter 37 8 mm and height 62 0 mm was 1 71 mg m3 and 0 36 respectively 51 considering a cylindrical prb column of unit dimensions diameter thickness 1 m depth 1 m and total volume v 785 400 cm3 the volume of voids vv in the unit prb column is obtained as 15 v v n v where v and n are the total volume and porosity of the unit prb column use of appropriate values for v 785 400 cm3 and n 0 36 in eq 15 gives the volume of voids 1 pore volume as 282 744 cm3 282 744 l at saturation all voids are filled with water the unit prb column would contain 282 744 l of contaminated groundwater the maximum toluene concentration in bengaluru groundwater was 0 15 mg l 17 consequently 42 45 mg of toluene will be present in 1 pv 283 l of the unit prb column the unit prb column would also contain 33 575 g of tcr particles section 3 5 2 yielding q value of 0 00126 mg g 42 45 mg of toluene 33 575 g of tcr particles the slower adsorption rate of segment 2 k2 0 0425 min 1 would determine the rate of toluene removal by tcr particles in the prb hence use of qe 42 93 mg g q 0 00126 mg g and k value 0 0425 min 1 in eq 9 indicates that removal of 42 45 mg of toluene in 283 l of contaminated groundwater by the tcr particles in the unit column will be near instantaneous the residence period t in hours of the contaminated groundwater in the unit prb column is governed by the velocity and length of groundwater flow eq 1 assuming a linear path the travel distance through the voids of the unit prb column is 1 m the flow velocity of contaminated groundwater v through the voids of the unit prb column is obtained from eq 3 assuming a hydraulic gradient of unity the velocity of groundwater flow is identical to permeability of the barrier and corresponds to 2 10 4 cm s use of appropriate l and v values in equation 1 gives residence period of 139 h which is much larger than the time required by prb column to de contaminate single pore volume of contaminated water near instantaneous 3 5 2 treatment capacity of unit prb column the unit prb column diameter 1 m depth 1 m dry density 1 71 g cm3 contains 33 575 kg of tcr particles the qe value of the mix from batch experiments indicated that 1 g of tcr particles can adsorb 42 93 mg of toluene from contaminated water hence 33 575 kg of tcr particles in the unit column can adsorb 1 652 kg of toluene for toluene concentration of 0 15 mg l the tcr particles in the unit prb column can treat 11 013 kl of contaminated groundwater the pore volume of unit prb column corresponds to 283 l eq 15 consequently the unit prb column can treat 38 916 pore volumes of 0 15 mg l toluene contaminated water the role of ph ionic composition of groundwater presence of other btex constituents clogging and degradation of pores of the tcr and sand particles by bacterial growth could possibly alter the treatment capability of the unit prb column the ce versus co plot of 2 5 mix fig 17 indicates that the mix can reduce toluene concentrations below the maximum contaminant level goal 1 mg l up to co values of 10 mg l 4 conclusions the tcr particles are mainly composed of sbp 52 7 and cb 24 5 constituents despite a lesser presence 24 5 the cb component accounts for bulk 83 of toluene adsorption by the tcr sand mix the inverted v shape of the kc versus co plot the bi linear nature of the scatchard plot and the conformance with freundlich isotherm implied that toluene molecules are adsorbed at energetically heterogeneous sites of tcr particles adsorption in different sized pores is responsible for the heterogeneity of adsorption sites toluene adsorption by tcr is an endothermic process as greater energy is expended to de hydrate the non polar molecule in the aqueous solution in comparison to the energy released on adsorption of the dehydrated molecule the weak bonding between toluene and adsorption sites imparted greater freedom to the non polar molecules in the adsorbed phase as illustrated by the positive entropy despite weak bonding bulk 91 of the adsorbed toluene molecules is not released during leaching as the spatial arrangement of toluene molecules in the medium and fine pores of tcr particles hinders desorption based on batch results and unit prb characteristics the 2 5 tcr 97 5 sand column should remediate 38 916 pore volumes of 0 15 mg l toluene contaminated water corresponds to 11 013 k l of contaminated groundwater near instantaneously clogging and degradation of pores of the tcr and sand particles by bacterial growth could possibly alter the treatment capability of the unit prb column declaration of competing interest none

reactive barriers prb the objective is achieved by performing laboratory experiments to identify toluene adsorption capacity and rate of toluene removal of the optimal tcr sand mix adsorption isotherms and kc co relations kc distribution coefficient co initial toluene concentration identified the optimum mix 2 5 tcr 97 5 sand mix for remediation of toluene contaminated water batch experiments showed that toluene adsorption by tcr particles is endothermic and is energetically favoured at higher temperature adsorption of the non polar molecule by tcr particles obeyed bi linear pseudo first order kinetics the carbon black component of tcr particles adsorbed significant amount of toluene during the initial contact period 10 60 min scatchard analysis freundlich isotherm and dr dubinin radushkevich equation indicated that toluene is adsorbed by van der waals attraction at energetically heterogenous sites of tcr particles the near irreversible toluene adsorption in the laboratory experiment is attributed to physical entrapment of the non polar molecules in the medium and fine pores of tcr particles batch experiment results predict that unit prb column constructed with 2 5 tcr 97 5 sand mix can remediate 11 013 k l of toluene contaminated 0 15 mg l groundwater near instantaneously abbreviations btex benzene toluene and ethylbenzene and xylene cb carbon black dr

cb and active charcoal are similar while btex molecules are adsorbed by sbp fraction by van der waals interactions 16 owing to their availability in large volume tcr can serve as an ideal adsorbent for btex compounds approximately 10 billion tyres are discarded worldwide annually 16 and approximately 195 million tyres will be annually produced in india by 2025 studies on btex removal by tcr

granulated activated carbon gac were characterized by significantly high partition coefficients kc 178 8274 ml g the carbon black and polymeric components of ground tyre granules accounted for 60 and 40 of total toluene adsorbed the lower adsorption capacity of cb than gac was attributed to the non activated nature of cb particles variations in ionic strength ph ground tyre particle size and

heat of sorption in nature in a related study toluene and xylene adsorption by tcr and its major constituents have been examined 16 adsorption of the non polar organic compounds was attributed to contributions from cb and sbp components of tcr particles the adsorption data was analysed using freundlich s isotherm and scatchard analysis permeable reactive barriers prb are constructed using a

250 mg l toluene spiked solutions solids liquid s l ratio 1 10 for 6 h in a temperature controlled incubator static equilibrations were performed at 25 c in narrow mouthed 120 ml capacity glass bottles that were crimped with teflon coated septa adsorption experiments were also performed with 2 5 mix at 14 and 19 c to construct van t hoff plot the mix was statically equilibrated with 100 mg l

in the vicinity of barrier to enable the targeted portion of groundwater to flow through prb 3 adsorption capacity rate of adsorption and residence time for contaminant removal by the barrier that can be evaluated from laboratory experiments 4 monitoring strategy and 5 cost of treatment the residence period of the contaminated solution in the barrier t is calculated as 1 r e s i d e n c e p e r i o d t l v where l and v are the travel length and velocity of groundwater flow in the prb the width of the barrier determines the travel length for linear horizontal flow path condition and depends on the relative permeability of the prb and surrounding aquifer medium 17 the velocity of contaminated water flow in the prb can be evaluated from the constant head laboratory test 22 the test involves permeation of the contaminated solution through a saturated prb column under a constant hydraulic gradient i the discharge q cm3 s in the constant head test calculates the velocity of flow v cm s as 22 2 q v a in eq 2 a is the cross sectional area of the compacted column knowing v and l the residence period of the contaminated solution in the prb can be obtained from eq 1 the rate of contaminant removal by the reactive material in the prb can be determined from batch experiments for effective functioning of prb the time required for contaminant removal by the reactive material must be less than the residence period of the contaminant solution in the prb the flow velocity in the prb column also gives the coefficient of permeability k cm s of the barrier as 22 3 v k i the hydraulic gradient is defined as 4 i δ h l in eq 4 δh represents the head loss experienced by groundwater on flowing over length l in the prb the residence period t also determines the thickness of the barrier b according to the equation 17 5 b v t 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tcr and sand particles 3 1 1 physico chemical characteristics sand and tcr particles are composed fig 1 of 60 70 medium sized particles 2 to 0 425 mm 12 30 fine sized particles 0 425 to 0 075 mm and 9 17 coarse particles 4 75 to 2 mm respectively 19 sand and tcr particles have specific gravity of 2 66 and 1 16 respectively the surface area of tcr particles correspond to 0 3 m2 g and was unaffected by toluene adsorption zinc concentration in the tclp leachate 0 85 mg l is lesser than its drinking water permissible limit 15 mg l 23 3 1 2 ftir characterization of tcr particles fig 2 depicts the ftir spectrum of tcr particles the peaks at 1031 1067 cm 1 1304 and 1430 cm 1 are assigned to c o c ch2 and ch3 groups of the sbp component 24 25 the peaks at 2845 2913 and 1369 cm 1 are assigned to ch2 groups of isoprene the peak at 821 cm 1 corresponds to the ch group of polyisoprenes 26 the peak at 1534 cm 1 corresponds to coostretching of zinc carboxylate 24 the peaks from 600 821 cm 1 are assigned to different functional groups of poly sulphides ss and disulfides c s s s 25 27 sbp is major constituent of rubber tyres isoprene and polyisoprene are additives to rubber tyres sulfur is added as vulcanization agent while zinc is added as vulcanization activator to rubber tyre 25 the ftir spectrum of toluene adsorbed particles fig 2 shows a prominent peak at 3400 cm 1 which is assigned to the o h stretching of water molecules retained in the air dried specimen toluene molecules exhibit strong peaks at 3032 3068 and 3099 cm 1 and at 1625 cm 1 the said peaks are not observed in fig 2 due to possible interference from oh stretching of water molecules a strong peak is however observed at 1635 cm 1 which is attributed to c c aromatic stretching of toluene 28 30 3 1 3 thermogravimetric and edx analysis tga and edx plots of tcr particles figs 3 and 4 are analysed based on the observations of earlier researchers 25 31 35 the initial weight loss 13 95 160 350 c fig 3 is attributed to volatilization of processing oil plasticizers low molecular weight emulsifiers and antioxidants the notable weight loss 52 66 between 350 and 499 c is attributed to volatilization of sbp constituent the non combustible fraction 33 93 is attributed to presence of carbon black and inorganic additives the elemental edx analysis fig 4 shows the presence of c si s ca zn and fe constituents in the tcr particles in agreement with earlier studies 25 32 33 the tcr specimen table 1 dominates in sbp 52 66 and has a lesser amount of cb 24 53 3 2 adsorption behaviour fig 5 plots the distribution coefficient kc l g as a function of initial toluene concentration for the 0 5 2 5 and 10 mixes the distribution coefficient is defined as 36 6 k c q e c e where qe is the amount of toluene adsorbed mg g by the mix at given co initial toluene concentration and ce is the equilibrium toluene concentration in the solution mg l a greater distribution coefficient implies larger partitioning of the pollutant by the adsorbent 9 the 0 5 2 5 and 10 mixes exhibit peak kc at co values of 25 25 and 7 5 mg l respectively the peak kc values of the 0 5 2 5 and 10 mixes correspond to 3 69 7 91 and 0 86 l g respectively the lower kc of the 10 mix is attributed to aggregation of particles that reduces the surface area for contaminant adsorption the occurrence of peak in the kc co relationship implies that toluene adsorption occurs at energetically heterogenous sites further with increasing surface coverage the toluene molecules are constrained to occupy sites with lower affinity causing a slump in kc in the post peak region the adsorption isotherms of various mixes fig 6 at 25 c reinforce the inference that maximum adsorption capacity is exhibited by the 2 5 mix increase in tcr concentration beyond 2 5 reduces the toluene adsorption capacity from aggregation of tcr particles besides physical effects particle aggregation chemical effects of ion substitution can influence the adsorption behaviour of pollutants 37 the scatchard relationship is derived from the langmuir isotherm 16 38 39 and provides insight into the nature of adsorption process the isotherm is represented as 7 q e c e q m k b q e k b where qe mg g is the amount of toluene adsorbed by the mix at equilibrium ce mg l is the toluene concentration in solution at equilibrium qm is the number of binding sites of the mix mg g and kb l mg is the association constant adsorption of toluene at sites of similar energy results in a singular plot comparatively toluene adsorption at sites with varying binding energies produces multiple plots adsorption of toluene by the mixes exhibit bi linear plots fig 7a c indicating that tcr particles are characterized by heterogenous sites and are amenable to analysis by freundlich isotherm the freundlich model fig 8 describes adsorption at heterogenous surface and is given as 8 l n q e l n k f 1 n l n c e where kf is the distribution coefficient mg g and n is related to the adsorption behaviour all three mixes obey the isotherm fig 8 the r2 values of the 10 2 5 and 0 5 mixes correspond to 0 98 0 86 and 0 96 respectively conformance to freundlich isotherm emphasizes the presence of heterogenous adsorption sites based on the findings of earlier study 16 the cb and sbp components of tcr participate in toluene adsorption the freundlich n parameter of the 0 5 and 10 mixes are unity 1 0 and 0 97 the results imply that toluene absorption capacity of tcr particles is not satisfied at the experimental adsorbate concentrations typical of type c isotherm 40 the n value of 2 5 mix is greater than unity 1 66 which is indicative of a physical adsorption process 41 the freundlich distribution coefficients kf of 10 2 5 and 0 5 mixes are 0 57 3 84 and 3 03 mg g respectively and follow a trend like the kcpeak values nole et al 16 report a much lower kf value for toluene adsorption by tcr particles the 2 5 mix has the largest distribution coefficients kcpeak 7 91 l g and kf 3 84 mg g it is hence identified as the optimal mix for prb construction the 2 5 mix is further examined for kinetics and adsorption thermodynamics 3 3 adsorption kinetics of 2 5 tcr 97 5 sand mix fig 9 plots the lagergren first order plots for toluene adsorption by the 2 5 mix at 25 c 42 9 ln q e q l n q e k 1 t in eq 9 q and qe are the amounts of toluene adsorbed mg g at time t min and equilibrium and k1 is lagergren or pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the pseudo first order plot fig 9a exhibits bilinearity an initial rapid adsorption segment 1 is followed by slower segment separation of lagergren plot fig 9b into two segments segment 1 10 60 min r2 0 99 and segment 2 60 360 min r2 1 give pseudo first order rate constants of 0 097 min 1 and 0 0425 min 1 respectively indicating that stage 1 adsorption is rapid than stage 2 adsorption the qe values adsorption capacity at equilibrium are obtained from the lagergren plot intercepts and correspond to 35 83 mg g qe1 segment 1 and 7 1 mg g qe2 segment 2 respectively fig 9b the sum of qe values 42 93 mg g suggest that stage 1 is responsible for bulk 83 of toluene adsorption while a smaller fraction 17 is adsorbed during stage 2 7 1 mg g fig 10 compares the amounts of toluene adsorbed by unit mass of carbon black and tcr particles 2 5 mix constituent at 25 c the amounts of toluene adsorbed by carbon black particles are 0 46 to 0 91 folds smaller than tcr particles with an average of 0 67 the adsorption average 67 of carbon black particles and stage 1 adsorption value 83 of tcr particles fig 9b are reasonably similar the results suggest that stage 1 adsorption fig 9 is largely contributed by cb component of tcr particles 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics the thermodynamic parameters are obtained from van t hoff eq 10 by using the equilibrium adsorption data of 100 mg l solution at 14 19 and 25 c 10 l n k c δ s o r δ h o r t to render kc dimensionless the ce term eq 6 is expressed as mg g instead of mg l by expressing volume l of toluene solution as mass mg the δh enthalpy change and δs entropy change values are obtained from the slope and intercept of the van t hoff plot fig 11 the free energy change δg is obtained at each temperature as 11 δ g r t l n k c in eqs 10 and 11 r and t are gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 and absolute temperature k respectively analysis of van t hoff plot data fig 11 indicates that toluene adsorption by tcr particles is characterized by δh and δs values of 47 06 kj mol and 0 159 kj mol k respectively toluene adsorption is endothermic positive enthalpy apparently as its de hydration in solution requires greater heat 13 than that released on its adsorption in the de hydrated state the positive entropy 0 159 kj mol k indicates that toluene molecules possess greater degree of freedom in the adsorbed phase than in the solution phase apparently the interaction energy between toluene molecules and adsorption sites are weaker than the bonding energy between adsorbate and water molecules in solution leading to their greater degree of freedom positive entropy in the adsorbed state the δg values for toluene adsorption correspond to 0 46 0 40 and 1 30 kj mol at 25 19 and 14 c respectively indicating that higher temperature favors the adsorption process typical of endothermic adsorption 8 the range of δg values indicate that toluene molecules are bound to the adsorption sites by weak van der waals attraction forces 8 the dr equation dubinin radushkevich 8 43 is analyzed by plotting fig 12 the toluene adsorption data of 2 5 tcr sand mix at 25 c as 12 ln q e l n q m β ε 2 in eq 12 qe is the amount of toluene adsorbed at equilibrium qm is the theoretical adsorption capacity of the mix mg g and ε is the polanyi potential j mol 1 that is related to the equilibrium toluene concentration ce as 13 ε r t l n 1 1 c e the adsorption energy e is obtained as 14 e 1 2 β the adsorption energy e kj mol 1 required to transfer one mole of toluene from aqueous solution to the adsorbent site corresponds to 100 j mol that is typical of physical adsorption 42 fig 13 compares the toluene adsorption desorption behavior of the 2 5 mix at 25 c the adsorption plot represents the retention of the non polar solute from 100 mg l toluene solution as function of time the time desorption plot represents release of toluene molecules from tcr particles on prolonged contact with water and 95 water 5 methanol solution methanol was added to water to improve the leachability of hydrophobic toluene molecules the plots show that only about 9 of the adsorbed toluene undergo desorption at equilibrium in both solvents implying that major fraction of the non polar molecules is irreversibly adsorbed by tcr particles the low desorption capacity is probably related to the spatial arrangement of toluene molecules in the adsorbent pores that hinders their release longer contact 192 h of toluene adsorbed tcr particles with water did not enhance extent of desorption fig 13 destruction of porous structure in tcr particles by microbial activity in aqueous environment could lead to significant desorption of toluene during rubber production many toxic microbial inhibiting additives and stabilizers are added to rubber the complex composition and structure of tyre rubber and its additives makes it resistant to natural degradation 44 near irreversibility of toluene adsorption will persist till the pore structure of tcr particles in the contaminated groundwater environment remains unaffected very coarse 60 235 μm coarse 60 6 μm medium 6 0 01 μm and fine 0 01 0 002 μm pore contents characterize the pore size distribution of the tcr particle fig 14 the mean pore volume of tcr particle corresponds to 0 388 cm3 g and is contributed by 0 2311 0 068 0 046 and 0 044 cm3 g of very coarse coarse medium and fine pore contents respectively the medium 6 0 01 μm and fine pores 0 01 0 002 μm are identified in the sem of the tcr sample at 10 000x magnification fig 15 the surface of toluene adsorbed tcr particles fig 16 exhibit similar density of medium and fine pores suggesting that the surface morphology of tcr particles is unaffected by toluene adsorption entrapment of distinct particles metal hydroxides in gelatinous matrix are however observed to affect surface morphology in sem studies 45 despite the dominance of very coarse and coarse pores the near irreversibility of toluene adsorption fig 13 suggests that the hydrocarbon molecules are adsorbed in the medium and fine pores adsorption in pores of different sizes is presumably responsible for the heterogeneity of adsorption sites possibly adsorption in medium pores mainly contribute to segment 1 while adsorption in fine pores largely contribute to segment 2 of the lagergren first order plots fig 9 at adsorption equilibrium qe from segments 1 and 2 of fig 9b toluene molecules occupy 0 0308 cm3 and 0 0061 cm3 per unit mass g of the adsorbent that are smaller than the medium 0 046 cm3 g and fine 0 044 cm3 g pore volumes table 2 compares the toluene adsorption capacity of various adsorbents with that of 2 5 tcr sand mix the tcr sand mix has larger toluene adsorption capacity than modified clays and zeolites the s l solid liquid ratios of the modified clays and zeolites are larger 0 5 g 100 ml to 5 g 100 ml than of the 2 5 tcr sand mix s l ratio 0 25 g 100 ml the contact periods are comparable or larger 1 24 h than of the tcr sand mix 6 h the adsorption temperatures 296 298 k and equipment detection limits 1 5 μg l are mostly similar in both experimental sets the range of initial toluene concentrations used in the tcr sand experiments 1 250 mg l straddle the concentration range used in experiments with modified clays and zeolites 9 150 mg l despite lower s l ratio lesser adsorption sites similar toluene concentration range and temperature the tcr sand mix exhibits a larger toluene adsorption capacity the results imply that tcr particles have greater affinity for toluene molecules the carbon nano tubes and activated c have larger toluene removal capacity 80 1 194 1 mg g than tcr sand mix comparatively mesoporous c has lower adsorption capacity 18 2 mg g than the tcr sand mix the s l ratio of the c adsorbents are lower 0 06 to 0 15 g 100 ml than of the tcr sand mix the initial toluene concentration range 10 442 mg l adsorption temperature 298 303 k are comparable for the two set of adsorbents however larger contact periods are generally employed in experiments with c adsorbent 4 10 48 h despite the lower s l ratio the c adsorbents mostly exhibit larger toluene adsorption capacity than the tcr sand mix the green adsorbent prepared using ostrich bone waste has larger adsorption capacity than the tcr sand mix the s l ratio 1 g 100 ml and contact period 24 h used in experiments with ostrich bone is higher than used in the tcr sand mix experiment the experimental temperature 298 k and initial toluene concentrations 0 5 300 mg l are however comparable the larger toluene removal by the ostrich bone waste could be a combination of higher s l ratio more adsorption sites and superior adsorption affinity for toluene molecules the cost of 1 kg of claytone 40 carbon nano tubes activated carbon and crumb rubber are included in table 2 though tcr sand mix has lower adsorption capacity than carbon nano tubes activated carbon and ostrich bone waste the cost benefits the wide availability of this green adsorbent plus re use of a waste material discarded tyre makes it preferred reactive material for prb construction 3 5 projected performance of unit prb column 3 5 1 residence period of contaminated groundwater in prb for toluene adsorption the permeability of a compacted 2 5 tcr 97 5 sand column was experimentally determined as 2 10 4 cm s the dry density and porosity n of the experimental column diameter 37 8 mm and height 62 0 mm was 1 71 mg m3 and 0 36 respectively 51 considering a cylindrical prb column of unit dimensions diameter thickness 1 m depth 1 m and total volume v 785 400 cm3 the volume of voids vv in the unit prb column is obtained as 15 v v n v where v and n are the total volume and porosity of the unit prb column use of appropriate values for v 785 400 cm3 and n 0 36 in eq 15 gives the volume of voids 1 pore volume as 282 744 cm3 282 744 l at saturation all voids are filled with water the unit prb column would contain 282 744 l of contaminated groundwater the maximum toluene concentration in bengaluru groundwater was 0 15 mg l 17 consequently 42 45 mg of toluene will be present in 1 pv 283 l of the unit prb column the unit prb column would also contain 33 575 g of tcr particles section 3 5 2 yielding q value of 0 00126 mg g 42 45 mg of toluene 33 575 g of tcr particles the slower adsorption rate of segment 2 k2 0 0425 min 1 would determine the rate of toluene removal by tcr particles in the prb hence use of qe 42 93 mg g q 0 00126 mg g and k value 0 0425 min 1 in eq 9 indicates that removal of 42 45 mg of toluene in 283 l of contaminated groundwater by the tcr particles in the unit column will be near instantaneous the residence period t in hours of the contaminated groundwater in the unit prb column is governed by the velocity and length of groundwater flow eq 1 assuming a linear path the travel distance through the voids of the unit prb column is 1 m the flow velocity of contaminated groundwater v through the voids of the unit prb column is obtained from eq 3 assuming a hydraulic gradient of unity the velocity of groundwater flow is identical to permeability of the barrier and corresponds to 2 10 4 cm s use of appropriate l and v values in equation 1 gives residence period of 139 h which is much larger than the time required by prb column to de contaminate single pore volume of contaminated water near instantaneous 3 5 2 treatment capacity of unit prb column the unit prb column diameter 1 m depth 1 m dry density 1 71 g cm3 contains 33 575 kg of tcr particles the qe value of the mix from batch experiments indicated that 1 g of tcr particles can adsorb 42 93 mg of toluene from contaminated water hence 33 575 kg of tcr particles in the unit column can adsorb 1 652 kg of toluene for toluene concentration of 0 15 mg l the tcr particles in the unit prb column can treat 11 013 kl of contaminated groundwater the pore volume of unit prb column corresponds to 283 l eq 15 consequently the unit prb column can treat 38 916 pore volumes of 0 15 mg l toluene contaminated water the role of ph ionic composition of groundwater presence of other btex constituents clogging and degradation of pores of the tcr and sand particles by bacterial growth could possibly alter the treatment capability of the unit prb column the ce versus co plot of 2 5 mix fig 17 indicates that the mix can reduce toluene concentrations below the maximum contaminant level goal 1 mg l up to co values of 10 mg l 4 conclusions the tcr particles are mainly composed of sbp 52 7 and cb 24 5 constituents despite a lesser presence 24 5 the cb component accounts for bulk 83 of toluene adsorption by the tcr sand mix the inverted v shape of the kc versus co plot the bi linear nature of the scatchard plot and the conformance with freundlich isotherm implied that toluene molecules are adsorbed at energetically heterogeneous sites of tcr particles adsorption in different sized pores is responsible for the heterogeneity of adsorption sites toluene adsorption by tcr is an endothermic process as greater energy is expended to de hydrate the non polar molecule in the aqueous solution in comparison to the energy released on adsorption of the dehydrated molecule the weak bonding between toluene and adsorption sites imparted greater freedom to the non polar molecules in the adsorbed phase as illustrated by the positive entropy despite weak bonding bulk 91 of the adsorbed toluene molecules is not released during leaching as the spatial arrangement of toluene molecules in the medium and fine pores of tcr particles hinders desorption based on batch results and unit prb characteristics the 2 5 tcr 97 5 sand column should remediate 38 916 pore volumes of 0 15 mg l toluene contaminated water corresponds to 11 013 k l of contaminated groundwater near instantaneously clogging and degradation of pores of the tcr and sand particles by bacterial growth could possibly alter the treatment capability of the unit prb column declaration of competing interest none

introduction in modern society wastewaters constitutes a critical problem in organization of the city infrastructure and also in planning of industrial activities there is an increasing concern over the climate change and energy crisis caused by the globally increasing energy demand while depletion of fossil resources 1 on the other hand scarcity and limited access to water resources worldwide require the preservation of existing resources from possible contamination different human activities contribute to this problem including industrial and agricultural activities in this sense one of the major source of pollution across mediterranean countries are olive mill wastewaters omws generated seasonally during the olive oil extraction process the omws are normally discharged into natural water reservoirs without any pre treatment thus contaminating groundwater resources and causing serious environmental and health problems to humans flora and fauna mainly due to its high organic load content specifically phenolic compounds for this reason the omws pollution is a major concern among the main olive oils producing countries where 30 million m3 of omws are generated annually 2 7 the extraction process of olive oils has evolved over the years from discontinuous to continuous methods in the first method olive oil was obtained by applying hydraulic pressure press method nevertheless the olive oil industry was modernized with the appearance of continuous methods using centrifugal separators at first a process with decanter of three outlets olive oil pomace and wastewater was used from the 1990s in order to reduce the environmental impact generated by this process the number of outlets in the horizontal centrifuge decanter was reduced from three to two one for olive oil and the other for olive pomace and vegetable water plus addition water of process it is important to indicate that in the later process two different types of wastewater are generated wastewater from olives washing wow and wastewater from olive oil washing ooww in the vertical centrifuge currently spain is the world s largest olive oil producer in the world and practically uses the later process martínez nieto et al 8 and hodaifa et al 9 have demonstrated that wastewater from olives washing wow does not present an environmental problem cod 1 g o2 l as it can be directly used for irrigation or reused after simple treatment by physical and chemical methods whereas olive oil washing wastewater ooww constitute a serious environmental problem due to its high organic matter content cod 3 g o2 l up to 15 g o2 l 10 11 chemical biological and integrated technologies were used for the treatment of olive oil industry s wastewater 12 biological method anaerobic digestion appeared to be unsuccessful due to the presence of phenolic compounds and residual oil however processes based on the use of different physicochemical operations can reduced the concentration of phenolic compounds and residual olive oil in wastewater membrane technology and biological treatment were studied for mills in which high volumes and heavy omw 3 were produced whereas chemical oxidation or advanced oxidation processes aops as fenton and photo fenton were recommended for omw 2 wow and ooww 8 9 13 supercritical hydrothermal gasification was also studied due to its suitability to convert into gases all kind of olive mill wastewater 14 currently the use of evaporation ponds is the most widespread practice used for olive mill wastewaters management the microalgae cultivation for sustainable biofuel production has recently gained much interest due to its easy culture rapid growth rate and the production of high added value compounds including non polar triacylglycerol which is the main substrate to produce biodiesel 15 in addition microalgae have great biotechnological potential in the pharmaceutical nutraceutical food and feed industries 16 17 moreover these microorganisms have successfully performed numerous environmental applications such as co2 mitigation wastewater treatment and biofuels production 18 21 the composition of the culture medium is a fundamental factor in the production of biomass with desirable characteristics the relationship between the nutrients concentration and the composition of the biomass is well studied 22 on the other hand the culture medium has a significant effect on the specific growth rate and the maximum level of biomass production the deficiency in an essential nutrient in the culture medium entails the adaptation of the metabolism of the microalgae in response to new external conditions in general changes in the culture medium results in the variation of the biochemical composition of the biomass fundamentally proteins lipids carbohydrates and pigments furthermore various physical and chemical parameters can affect algal growth including light irradiance temperature co2 concentration in the gas phase ph of the culture medium mechanical agitation aeration and salinity this study examines the growth of c pyrenoidosa on culture media based on olive oil washing wastewater ooww with the dual objectives i ooww treatment and ii providing a low cost substrate for algal biomass production which can be used for biofuels production for this purpose different dilutions of ooww from 5 to 100 v v with ultrapure water enriched with urban wastewater from secondary treatment by the addition of the inoculum were used for culture media formation kinetic growth biochemical composition of the final biomass and final water treated quality were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism and photobioreactor all cultures were performed with the green microalga chlorella pyrenoidosa chick strain 8h emerson from the cambridge botanical school algae culture collection stirred batch photobioreactors with 0 5 l working volume dimensions 7 cm diameter 20 cm height in sterile conditions were used the artificial illumination was provided under a light dark cycle 12 h illumination per day from one side of photobioreactors 36 2 2 experimental conditions and procedure the olive oil washing wastewaters ooww used in this work were obtained from an olive oil extraction plant in the province of jaen which uses a continuous centrifugation process with two outlets decanter prior to c pyrenoidosa culture ooww were pre treated by centrifugation to separate the solid phase and filtered sterilized through a glass wool pre filter and cellulose nitrate membrane 0 45 μm pore diameter then the culture media were formed through the preparation of different ooww dilutions 5 10 20 30 50 and 100 of ooww v v all cultures media were prepared with ooww and ultrapure water and enriched with a constant quantity of 10 v v of c pyrenoidosa inoculum to reactors in this sense no direct mixing between ooww and uw was performed to control the inhibitory growth effects of ooww caused mainly by phenolic compounds and residual olive oil in ooww in order to determine the optimum mixing proportions for the formation of the culture medium the inoculum was previously taken from a bubble column that used continuously and treated urban wastewater from secondary treatment as nutrient medium fig 1 the average initial concentration for all the experiments in the photobioreactors at time zero after inoculum addition was 0 0238 g l with a standard deviation equal to 0 0813 g l all experiments were performed in isothermal conditions by using a thermostat control system to maintain a constant temperature inside the photobioreactors the difference of temperature between the inside of the photobioreactors and the thermostat circuit was less than 1 c the common culture conditions maintained over the course of the experiments were ph 8 temperature 25 c without mechanical stirring and aeration rate 1 v v min supplied by sterilized air throughout filtration with fluoropore membrane filter hydrophobic ptfe 0 2 μm

experiments the ph adjustment of the culture media was carried out with the addition of a 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions the biomass concentration x g l chlorophylls a and b total chlorophylls chltotal and carotenoid contents catotal were determined over the course of each experiment at the end of each experiment the algal biomass was separated and washed lipids including fatty acids profile and crude protein crude protein total nitrogen 6 25 22 contents were determined the carbohydrates content was calculated as 100 minus the percentages of proteins lipids pigments and genetic material in all experiments the percentage of genetic material was considered equal to 1 in addition an elemental analysis was carried out on the harvested biomass at the en d of the experiments 3 analytical methods wastewaters used in this work were characterized in terms of ph electric conductivity total solids organic matter phenolic compounds fat matter ash dissolved oxygen bod5 cod total table 1 nitrogen total phosphorus nitrates and nitrites ammonium magnesium copper and chloride table 1 23 26 the ph and electric conductivity values were measured directly using ph meter crison mod glp 22c and a conductimeter crison mod glp31 respectively total solids and ashes were determined by drying and incinerating samples in a stove at temperature of 105 1 c and an oven at 575 25 c respectively the difference between both parameters corresponds to the organic matter percentage the determination of chemical oxygen demand cod and total phenolic compounds tpcs were carried out according to norms iso 8466 1 din 38402 a51 and din 38409 41 27 29 fat matter was determined by a liquid liquid extraction operation using n hexane then solvent separation was carried out by distillation and the fat matter was dried at 105 1 c dissolved oxygen do was measured directly by using an oxymeter crison mod ox192 and the biological oxygen demand bod5 was determined by the difference between dissolved oxygen in sample before and after 5 days in hermetically sealed bottles at 20 c total carbon total organic carbon inorganic carbon tc toc and ic total nitrogen and nitrate and nitrite ions tn and no3 no2 were measured by a total carbon and nitrogen analyzer provided by skalar company mod formacsht and formacstn total phosphorus was determined photometrically by reacting orthophosphate ions in sulfuric acid solution with molybdate ions to form molybdophosphoric acid ascorbic acid reduces this compound to phosphormolybdenum blue nitrate was determined photometrically by reacting nitrate ions in sulphuric and phosphoric solution with 2 6 dimethylphenol dmp to form the compound 4 nitro 2 6 dimethylphenol nitrite ions in acid solution form with the sulphanilic acid a diazonium salt that reacts with the n 1 naftill ethylenediamine dihydrochloride giving a reddish violet azo dye which was determined photometrically ammonium ion nh4 in strong alkaline solution is present entirely as ammonia this reacts with hypochlorite ions to form monochloramine which in turn reacts with 2 chlorphenol or thymol to form indophenol blue this is then determined photometrically at 690 712 nm 30 31 sulphates and chloride were determined photometrically at 420 nm and 450 nm respectively 27 28 copper ions were determined photometrically by reacting ammoniacal medium copper ii ions with cuprizone to form a blue complex magnesium ions in neutral solution form with phthaleins purple a violet dye which is determined photometrically on the other hand biomass concentration x g l was indirectly measured according to camacho et al 30 after cell separation and washing from all samples taken during the course of all experiments a straight line calibration of a600 dry weight g l was performed eq 1 1 x g l 0 331 a600 0 001 the chlorophyll chl and carotenoid contents ca were determined by a photocolorimetric method prior to extraction with acetone at 90 31 crude protein concentration was quantified according to 32 at the end of each experiment the algal biomass harvested was separated and washed twice with ultrapure water then elemental composition and fatty acids profile in the lipid fraction were determined by gas chromatography 33 furthermore the quality of the obtained water treated wastewater at the end of each culture was determined 3 1 calculation and statistical methods the experiments were repeated at least twice and the analytical methods were performed at least three time in order to check the reproducibility of the results mathematical equations and statistical analysis were obtained by using originpro 8 0 program 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of wastewaters used as culture media table 1 shows the characterization of crude ooww urban wastewater from secondary treatment uw inoculum and the mixture of ooww with inoculum oowwenriched the difference in the biochemical composition between ooww and uw can be observed more precisely for electric conductivity ec bod5 cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chloride ions high ec tn tp and chloride values were obtained for the uw when compared to those for the ooww 4 35 10 and 7 times higher in uw respectively this fact support the theory of enriching ooww with uw given its higher content in essential nutrients for microalgae growth such as nitrogen and phosphorus the high ec value 5 47 ms cm in uw is due to the high concentration of inorganic ions such as chloride 1200 mg l similar values of bod5 1358 mg o2 l and cod 1362 mg o2 l in ooww were observed which indicates the biodegradability of organic content the ooww has higher bod5 and cod values when compared to the uw from secondary treatment notwithstanding the ooww has less organic load than indicated in the literature cod from 3 to 15 g o2 l 10 11 this fact is due to the operation mode applied in the olive mill where samples were collected the olive mill respects the cycles of cleaning and water change in the olive washing machines and in the vertical centrifuge where the ooww is obtained in fact the ooww is colourless as the olive mill performs the complete control of the operations throughout the process in order to avoid ooww colouring this allows no light limitation in algal cultures in other words this ooww has physicochemical parameters table 1 far from the typical parameters values of ooww from olive mills indicated in the literature with high cod 3 15 g o2 l and total phenolic compounds values up to 749 0 mg l 10 11 the mixture of inoculum based on uw and ooww allowed the culture media enrichment in this sense the preparation of a culture medium with 90 ooww and 10 inoculum v v allowed nitrogen and phosphorus increase from 7 49 mg l to 40 8 mg l and from 1 63 mg l to 6 97 mg l respectively table 1 in other words the content in macronutrients among others increased in the culture medium for microalga growth 4 2 biomass growth and kinetic parameters for cell growth monitoring cells number and biomass concentration along the cultures were determined the observation of the culture medium by optic microscope along the growth allowed the evaluation of the real state of the culture and the presence of microbial contamination especially with bacteria in addition the determination of cells number enabled to determine the average cell weight fig 2 shows the representation of the biomass concentration versus the corresponding number of cells determined in all the experiments the highest biomass concentration and cell number registered in the cultures were equal to 0 542 g l and 3 65 1010 cells l in addition the average cell weight value of dry weight g l to number of cells cells l was kept constant over the exponential and deceleration phases at 13 pg cell this value is lower than that registered for scenedesmus obliquus cells in different cultures media in which the highest value was determined in the culture medium formed by mixing omw 2 from process with two outlets decanter and with urban wastewater from secondary treatment table 2 the determination of the maximum specific growth rate μm h 1 and biomass productivity pb g l h was performed from the experimentally obtained growth curves fig 3 a in this sense μm was determined in the exponential growth phase according to eq 1 1 ln x x0 μm t a where the slope μm corresponds to the maximum specific growth rate determined in the exponential phase of growth and a is the intercept when x 0 fig 3b shows the variation of μm values when the oowwenriched concentration was varied in the culture medium from 5 to 100 of oowwenriched v v it can be observed that μm values showed a pronounced increase with the augment of the oowwenriched concentration until reaching the maximum μm value equal to 0 0203 1 h in the medium composed of 30 oowwenriched v v then μm values decrease in the most concentrated culture media these results were to be expected due to the presence in the oowwenriched of harmful compounds such as fat matter organic acids and phenolic compounds which are responsible for the toxic and inhibitory effect 34 a number of empirical models have been proposed for the description of substrate limitation and inhibition of microbial growth haldane 35 proposed an equation for uncompetitive inhibition which can be written as 2 μ m μ m max ooww e n r i c h e d k s o o w w e n r i c h e d o o w w e n r i c h e d 2 k i where μm max is the highest value of maximum specific growth rate in absence of inhibition and ks and ki are empirical saturation and inhibition constants respectively the adjustment of the experimental results to this mathematical model has made it possible to determine the different kinetic parameters table 3 the difference between the experimental maximum value of μm and μm max calculated by the model was expected since the last value is a theoretical value in culture without inhibition effect the values of ks 3 56 and ki 84 7 are consistent with the experimental results the parameters of the goodness of the fit were r2 0 990 and sum of squared errors sse 2 14 10 6 when comparing this behaviour with that obtained by hodaifa et al 36 for culture media formed in wastewater from the process using a decanter of two outlets mixture of olives and olive oil washing wastewaters with initial cod 7 1 g o2 l it is observed that a higher μm max value 0 048 1 h was obtained however the fall in μm values is more abrupt with the increase of the wastewater concentration in the culture media μm 0 015 1 h in cultures without dilution in all experiments exponential phase was followed by a linear behaviour during the deceleration growth phase in which cell growth continued at a lower rate fig 3a biomass productivity pb was determined in this phase according to eq 3 3 x pb t c this linear growth period is characteristic for bioprocesses controlled by nutrients availability its appearance is related to the limitation of any nutrient in the culture medium or limited availability of light or co2 37 38 fig 3c shows that the maximum pb value was determined in the 10 oowwenriched culture accordingly a decrease in the pb value with the increase of the oowwenriched concentration in the culture medium can be observed obtaining the lowest pb value in the most concentrated medium 100 oowwenriched similarly to the μm the same light intensity and airflow co2 were supplied to the cultures thus the appearance of this phase might be due to the increase of inhibitory compounds concentration in the culture media coupled by the increase of oowwenriched concentration mainly phenolic compounds in fact several researchers indicated the capacity of c pyrenoidosa to remove phenolic compounds and other pollutants dayana and bakthavatsalam 39 40 demonstrated the capacity of c pyrenoidosa kx686118 to remove phenolic compounds 90 from coal effluents of gasification plants in a similar way the variation in the volumetric biomass productivities versus the oowwenriched was adjusted by the haldane model 35 eq 2 with an acceptable goodness of the fit r2 0 975 and sse 5 96 10 8 table 3 and the obtained data are consisted with that observed experimentally in this case there is a noticeable difference between the values of experimental pb max and those determined by the model this fact might be due to the depletion of one or more nutrients or to the accumulative effect of growth inhibiting compounds in the biomass such as phenolic compounds or due to the covering of cells with a layer of residual fat contained in wastewater which prevents the exchange of nutrients between the cell and the culture medium 36 the first assumption is not possible give that with the increase in the ooww concentration in the culture medium the decrease in the biomass productivity values was greater fig 3c bearing in mind that both μm and pb decreased with the increase in the oowwenriched concentrations in the culture media the accumulative effect of the growth inhibiting compounds becomes more evident in this sense the value of ki in the case of pb variation is lower than that determined for μm table 3 4 3 biomass generation and biochemical composition the variation in the concentration of net biomass and its biochemical composition is dependent on the concentration of oowwenriched in the culture medium fig 4 the net biomass generation x x0 variation 0 135 0 238 g l decrease with the increase of oowwenriched concentrations in the culture media fig 4a this behaviour was expected considering that the increase of oowwenriched concentration in the culture media involves higher values of phenolic compounds and fat matter in the medium that prevents microalgae growth because of their toxic effect fig 4 b and c shows the percentages variation of the cell components pigments proteins carbohydrates and lipids present in the biomass versus the net biomass generation obtained x x0 g l in the cultures the percentages of total chlorophylls chl and total carotenoids ca were increasing with the rise of oowwenriched concentration in the culture medium until reaching the concentration of 30 ooww v v fig 4b then these percentages decreased this behaviour is similar to that registered for maximum specific growth rates and volumetric biomass productivities which means that the generation of pigments is associated to c pyrenoidosa growth in general the percentages of pigments 1 10 0 07 were maintained constant in the final harvested biomass from all cultures nevertheless total chlorophylls and total carotenoids percentages varied while the highest values registered for total chlorophylls 0 96 and total carotenoids 0 24 were determined in the culture with 30 of ooww v v on the other hand the total chlorophylls content in all the cultures was maintained 4 3 0 2 times higher than the total carotenoids independently of the net biomass generation variation in addition fig 4c shows the decrease of total lipid percentages when the increase of net biomass generation opposite behaviour was registered for the carbohydrates percentages while the proteins percentages were maintained constant 44 1 0 9 with the increase of biomass generation this fact was also confirmed by the biomass elemental analysis in which the mean value of nitrogen percentage was equal to 7 1 table 4 these results could be explained considering that the culture media enrichment by nitrogen addition with inoculum at constant percentage equal to 10 v v and the variation of the ooww percentage in the culture media did not affect the final nitrogen content since ooww only have 7 5 mg l table 1 in other words biomass generation was not limited by nitrogen when the ooww percentage was varied in any case all cultures had a deficiency in the availability of nitrogen since the oowwenriched contained only approximately around 40 mg l of total nitrogen this value is 4 times lower than that of the mineral synthetic medium of rodríguez lópez rl 41 with 140 mg n available l which is normally used as control culture for this microalga the highest values of lipids percentages 44 0 51 5 were determined in cultures containing more than 20 of oowwenriched v v while the highest value of carbohydrates percentage 29 4 was determined in the culture with 5 of oowwenriched in this sense wu and miao 42 highlighted that nitrogen is an essential nutrient in many macromolecules such as proteins chlorophylls rna dna and it acts as one of the most essential nutrients for microalgae growth nitrogen limitation or starvation normally result in a decrease in photosynthesis protein and lipid synthesis as well as an increase in carbohydrate formation 42 43 on the other hand n and p are known algal growth limiting factors the optimal value of n p ratio for freshwater algae has been suggested to be in the range of 6 8 10 44 however the n p ratio in this study was approximately 5 9 in the case of the culture medium with 100 ooww enriched nitrogenous matter was mainly composed of inorganic nh4 n in uw the initial nh4 n concentration was approximately 24 1 mg l table 1 algae have a considerable intracellular capacity for storing soluble and organic n molecules nitrogen is rapidly consumed as being indispensable for the regulation of the metabolic pathways it is used to produce amino acids and other organic n containing macromolecules at too high concentrations the nh4 n becomes toxic and can thus inhibit algal growth han et al 45 indicated that nitrogen limitation and high ph conditions constitute an effective method for lipid accumulation in microalgae biomass lipids content in some microalgae such as chlorella sp nannochloris sp and neochloris oleobundans can significantly increase under nitrogen limitation conditions commonly ranging from 30 to 60 46 gardner et al 47 found that the triacylglycerol contents of chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp accumulated faster when the cells were cultured in the controlled high ph however nitrogen limitation or high ph induction had little contribution to the lipid productivity of the cells since the cells grow decelerate under the stress conditions tan et al 48 demonstrated that low molar ratio of n c nitrogen limitation in the culture medium play an important role in lipid accumulation several researchers have indicated that chlorella accumulates more lipids with decreased molar ratios of n c typically at n c ratio of 0 02 0 0109 49 in this study the initial molar ratio of n c was only 0 17 in the 100 oowwenriched indicating no severe nitrogen limitation elemental composition of the harvested biomass at the end of each experiment is recorded in table 4 results indicate that oxygen 43 3 1 6 and carbon 42 2 1 5 were the most abundant elements in biomass followed by nitrogen 7 05 0 15 hydrogen 6 66 0 18 and sulphur 0 84 0 08 as observed no significant differences in the elemental composition of the harvested biomass from the experiments were registered khalid et al 50 proved the ability of c sorokiniana to change its internal elemental composition as a function of the nutrients concentration in culture medium furthermore whitton et al 51 also demonstrated the relationship between microalgae elemental composition and nutrients concentration it was proved for five freshwater microalgae species that those species with high n and low p internal composition were able to uptake ammonium and phosphate more efficiently lastly beuckels et al 52 proved that chlorella and scenedesmus are able to adjust the internal concentration of n and p in biomass according to the n and p concentration in the wastewater medium table 5 lists the composition of fatty acids fas of the lipid fraction of the c pyrenoidosa biomass obtained at the end of each experiment as a percentage w w of the total lipid fraction fas were grouped into saturated sfas monounsaturated mufas and polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas the most abundant group was pufas with an average content of 44 5 sd 2 47 followed by sfas 28 8 on average sd 1 16 and mufas 13 3 on average sd 0 699 within sfas palmitic c16 0 and stearic c18 0 were the most abundant with values ranging from 19 2 100 oowwenriched to 21 9 5 oowwenriched for palmitic and from 6 54 100 oowwenriched to 7 72 5 oowwenriched for stearic oleic acid c18 1 was the major mufas 9 06 on average and the most abundant pufas identified were c18 3 22 5 on average and c18 2n6 15 9 on average meanwhile eicosapentaenoic acid or epa c20 5n3 was detected at low concentrations in all conditions ranging from 0 185 when 100 oowwenriched was used to 1 65 in 10 oowwenriched culture media no docosahexaenoic acid or dha c22 6n3 was found in any condition nutrient starvation temperature ph and light intensity are the main factors affecting fas composition 53 in this sense as ph light intensity and temperature were maintained constant along the cultures the observed differences in the fas composition should be attributed to the differences in nutrients concentration regarding nutrients nitrogen limitation is the major critical compound affecting the lipid metabolism and the proportion between saturated and unsaturated fas besides phosphorous deprivation increase the content of c16 0 and c18 1 in various microalgae species 53 the final biochemical composition of the harvested c pyrenoidosa biomass at the end of the cultures can be seen in fig 5 no variation was observed in the total pigments 1 10 0 07 and crude proteins contents 44 1 0 8 meanwhile total lipids content increase with the increase of oowwenriched in the culture media and it was maintained constant 48 8 3 4 in culture media containing from 30 to 100 of oowwenriched v v opposite behaviour was observed for carbohydrates content which decreased from 29 4 to 2 81 with the oowwenriched increase these behaviours are to be expected given the virtually constant nitrogen availability in the culture media the same uw added to culture media as inoculum and the global variation in nitrogen by the addition of ooww is depreciated since the tn in ooww is only 7 5 mg l nitrogen limitation or starvation normally results in the decrease of photosynthesis proteins and lipids synthesis on the contrary carbohydrate synthesis is increased 43 44 the nitrogen availability in oowwenriched was 4 times lower than that in the control mineral synthetic medium of rodríguez lópez 41 with 140 mg n available l becker 54 determined a crude protein percentage equal to 57 for c pyrenoidosa in synthetic medium which is higher than that obtained in the experiments of this work 44 1 nevertheless the same author obtained a carbohydrate content of 26 and 2 of lipids which are lower than those obtained in this work equal to 29 4 and 51 5 respectively the final harvested biomass could be used in combination with other substrates for biofuels production or maybe as supplementary substrate in the anaerobic digester for biogas production moreover as the least favourable option it could be used for domestic commercial or industrial boilers and as a fuel for generators of electric energy production 4 4 photo bioremediation of urban and olive mill wastewaters table 6 shows the physicochemical characterization of enriched olive mill wastewater without dilution treated and the total removal percentages achieved after the bioprocess applied using c pyrenoidosa in general high elimination percentages 86 were obtained in the main contamination parameters total solid total phenolic compounds and chemical oxygen demand the proposed bioprocess microfiltration plus c pyrenoidosa growth in this work improve the physiochemical characteristics of ooww in this sense the highest elimination percentages registered after the bioprocess were obtained for total solids 98 8 cod 86 3 and tpcs 85 7 furthermore removal percentages equal to 49 7 57 1 48 3 and 47 8 were obtained for no3 so4 2 no2 and mg2 respectively c pyrenoidosa was also able to reduce cu2 41 3 total phosphorus 56 4 and cl 47 1 cod and tpcs remediation was particularly relevant since high organic loads and the presence of antioxidant compounds such as phenolic compounds is not desirable in wastewaters intended to be reused for irrigation or discharged into water public channels in this sense other authors have obtained lower cod elimination levels when using omws as culture media for different microalgae strains markou et al 55 achieved cod elimination percentages ranging from 28 8 66 9 after the culture of spirulina platensis in omw 3 furthermore travieso et al 56 obtained 37 of cod removal from omw 2 after a process based on anaerobic digestion sedimentation and chlorella zofingiensis culture regarding tpcs markou et al 55 demonstrated that the increase of omw 3 concentration in the culture media results in a decrease in the capacity of microalgae to remove phenolic compounds concluding that tpcs degradation depends on their concentration in culture media obtaining removal percentages ranging from 41 9 100 in this sense several studies have demonstrated the ability of microalgae to assimilate nitrogen in different forms being ammonium ions the preferred source since less energy is required 57 the presence of phosphorus in the medium is highly relevant for microalgae cell growth due to its role in metabolism and phosphorylation reactions on the other hand the increase in dissolved oxygen concentration after the microalgae culture indicated a photosynthetic activity instead of a carbon oxidation throughout heterotrophic growth 57 the treated water obtained after the bioprocess was characterized by a high quality since it did not present any toxicity heavy metal or phenolic compounds considering that it comes from the agri food industry quality parameters registered in table 6 indicate that treated water could be used for irrigation discharges to surface water and groundwater or for drinking water if it is passed through some additional operations unit such as ion exchange reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration to adjust its organic or inorganic content in the same way spanish standards for treated omw 2 to use in irrigation established the following parameters ph in the range 6 0 9 0 suspended solids 500 mg kg and cod 1000 mg o2 l in addition the treated water after the process comply with european directive 91 271 eec concerning urban wastewater treatment where cod 125 mg o2 l and tn 10 mg l for treated water discharge into water public channels in contrast european drinking water directive 2015 1787 specifies that drinking water is all water used in any food production process this directive establishes the chemical parameters that determine drinking water quality electric conductivity 2500 μs cm turbidity acceptable to consumers and no abnormal change toc no abnormal change iron 0 2 mg l sulphate 250 mg l sodium 200 mg l and ammonium 0 5 mg l 5 conclusions based on the experimental results obtained in this work it can be concluded that c pyrenoidosa has the capacity to grow in both wastewaters ooww and uw the ooww is characterized by its high organic load and low nitrogen and phosphorus contents essential elements for microalgae growth uw still has good inorganic fraction and low organic matter content this wastewater could supply essential nutrients n and p among others to ooww as a low cost substrate the mixture of different urban and industrial wastewaters enables to design an optimal culture medium for microalgae growth in order to obtain an economic viability biofuels production and efficient wastewaters bioremediation method irrigation or drinking water for its

phosphorus urban wastewater treatment plants with primary natural sedimentation and secondary biological removal treatments are unable to remove the total nitrogen and phosphorus from these

introduction in modern society wastewaters constitutes a critical problem in organization of the city infrastructure and also in planning of industrial activities there is an increasing concern over the climate change and energy crisis caused by the globally increasing energy demand while depletion of fossil resources 1 on the other hand scarcity and limited access to water resources worldwide require the preservation of existing resources from possible contamination different human activities contribute to this problem including industrial and agricultural activities in this sense one of the major source of pollution across mediterranean countries are olive mill wastewaters omws generated seasonally during the olive oil extraction process the omws are normally discharged into natural water reservoirs without any pre treatment thus contaminating groundwater resources and causing serious environmental and health problems to humans flora and fauna mainly due to its high organic load content specifically phenolic compounds for this reason the omws pollution is a major concern among the main olive oils producing countries where 30 million m3 of omws are generated annually 2 7 the extraction process of olive oils has evolved over the years from discontinuous to continuous methods in the first method olive oil was obtained by applying hydraulic pressure press method nevertheless the olive oil industry was modernized with the appearance of continuous methods using centrifugal separators at first a process with decanter of three outlets olive oil pomace and wastewater was used from the 1990s in order to reduce the environmental impact generated by this process the number of outlets in the horizontal centrifuge decanter was reduced from three to two one for olive oil and the other for olive pomace and vegetable water plus addition water of process it is important to indicate that in the later process two different types of wastewater are generated wastewater from olives washing wow and wastewater from olive oil washing ooww in the vertical centrifuge currently spain is the world s largest olive oil producer in the world and practically uses the later process martínez nieto et al 8 and hodaifa et al 9 have demonstrated that wastewater from olives washing wow does not present an environmental problem cod 1 g o2 l as it can be directly used for irrigation or reused after simple treatment by physical and chemical methods whereas olive oil washing wastewater ooww constitute a serious environmental problem due to its high organic matter content cod 3 g o2 l up to 15 g o2 l 10 11 chemical biological and integrated technologies were used for the treatment of olive oil industry s wastewater 12 biological method anaerobic digestion appeared to be unsuccessful due to the presence of phenolic compounds and residual oil however processes based on the use of different physicochemical operations can reduced the concentration of phenolic compounds and residual olive oil in wastewater membrane technology and biological treatment were studied for mills in which high volumes and heavy omw 3 were produced whereas chemical oxidation or advanced oxidation processes aops as fenton and photo fenton were recommended for omw 2 wow and ooww 8 9 13 supercritical hydrothermal gasification was also studied due to its suitability to convert into gases all kind of olive mill wastewater 14 currently the use of evaporation ponds is the most widespread practice used for olive mill wastewaters management the microalgae cultivation for sustainable biofuel production has recently gained much interest due to its easy culture rapid growth rate and the production of high added value compounds including non polar triacylglycerol which is the main substrate to produce biodiesel 15 in addition microalgae have great biotechnological potential in the pharmaceutical nutraceutical food and feed industries 16 17 moreover these microorganisms have successfully performed numerous environmental applications such as co2 mitigation wastewater treatment and biofuels production 18 21 the composition of the culture medium is a fundamental factor in the production of biomass with desirable characteristics the relationship between the nutrients concentration and the composition of the biomass is well studied 22 on the other hand the culture medium has a significant effect on the specific growth rate and the maximum level of biomass production the deficiency in an essential nutrient in the culture medium entails the adaptation of the metabolism of the microalgae in response to new external conditions in general changes in the culture medium results in the variation of the biochemical composition of the biomass fundamentally proteins lipids carbohydrates and pigments furthermore various physical and chemical parameters can affect algal growth including light irradiance temperature co2 concentration in the gas phase ph of the culture medium mechanical agitation aeration and salinity this study examines the growth of c pyrenoidosa on culture media based on olive oil washing wastewater ooww with the dual objectives i ooww treatment and ii providing a low cost substrate for algal biomass production which can be used for biofuels production for this purpose different dilutions of ooww from 5 to 100 v v with ultrapure water enriched with urban wastewater from secondary treatment by the addition of the inoculum were used for culture media formation kinetic growth biochemical composition of the final biomass and final water treated quality were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganism and photobioreactor all cultures were performed with the green microalga chlorella pyrenoidosa chick strain 8h emerson from the cambridge botanical school algae culture collection stirred batch photobioreactors with 0 5 l working volume dimensions 7 cm diameter 20 cm height in sterile conditions were used the artificial illumination was provided under a light dark cycle 12 h illumination per day from one side of photobioreactors 36 2 2 experimental conditions and procedure the olive oil washing wastewaters ooww used in this work were obtained from an olive oil extraction plant in the province of jaen which uses a continuous centrifugation process with two outlets decanter prior to c pyrenoidosa culture ooww were pre treated by centrifugation to separate the solid phase and filtered sterilized through a glass wool pre filter and cellulose nitrate membrane 0 45 μm pore diameter then the culture media were formed through the preparation of different ooww dilutions 5 10 20 30 50 and 100 of ooww v v all cultures media were prepared with ooww and ultrapure water and enriched with a constant quantity of 10 v v of c pyrenoidosa inoculum to reactors in this sense no direct mixing between ooww and uw was performed to control the inhibitory growth effects of ooww caused mainly by phenolic compounds and residual olive oil in ooww in order to determine the optimum mixing proportions for the formation of the culture medium the inoculum was previously taken from a bubble column that used continuously and treated urban wastewater from secondary treatment as nutrient medium fig 1 the average initial concentration for all the experiments in the photobioreactors at time zero after inoculum addition was 0 0238 g l with a standard deviation equal to 0 0813 g l all experiments were performed in isothermal conditions by using a thermostat control system to maintain a constant temperature inside the photobioreactors the difference of temperature between the inside of the photobioreactors and the thermostat circuit was less than 1 c the common culture conditions maintained over the course of the experiments were ph 8 temperature 25 c without mechanical stirring and aeration rate 1 v v min supplied by sterilized air throughout filtration with fluoropore membrane filter hydrophobic ptfe 0 2 μm pore diameter the daily illumination regime was a light dark cycle 12 h 12 h with an initial illumination intensity of 126 2 μe m2 s measured with qsl 2100 bio spherical instruments inc during the experiments the ph adjustment of the culture media was carried out with the addition of a 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solutions the biomass concentration x g l chlorophylls a and b total chlorophylls chltotal and carotenoid contents catotal were determined over the course of each experiment at the end of each experiment the algal biomass was separated and washed lipids including fatty acids profile and crude protein crude protein total nitrogen 6 25 22 contents were determined the carbohydrates content was calculated as 100 minus the percentages of proteins lipids pigments and genetic material in all experiments the percentage of genetic material was considered equal to 1 in addition an elemental analysis was carried out on the harvested biomass at the en d of the experiments 3 analytical methods wastewaters used in this work were characterized in terms of ph electric conductivity total solids organic matter phenolic compounds fat matter ash dissolved oxygen bod5 cod total table 1 nitrogen total phosphorus nitrates and nitrites ammonium magnesium copper and chloride table 1 23 26 the ph and electric conductivity values were measured directly using ph meter crison mod glp 22c and a conductimeter crison mod glp31 respectively total solids and ashes were determined by drying and incinerating samples in a stove at temperature of 105 1 c and an oven at 575 25 c respectively the difference between both parameters corresponds to the organic matter percentage the determination of chemical oxygen demand cod and total phenolic compounds tpcs were carried out according to norms iso 8466 1 din 38402 a51 and din 38409 41 27 29 fat matter was determined by a liquid liquid extraction operation using n hexane then solvent separation was carried out by distillation and the fat matter was dried at 105 1 c dissolved oxygen do was measured directly by using an oxymeter crison mod ox192 and the biological oxygen demand bod5 was determined by the difference between dissolved oxygen in sample before and after 5 days in hermetically sealed bottles at 20 c total carbon total organic carbon inorganic carbon tc toc and ic total nitrogen and nitrate and nitrite ions tn and no3 no2 were measured by a total carbon and nitrogen analyzer provided by skalar company mod formacsht and formacstn total phosphorus was determined photometrically by reacting orthophosphate ions in sulfuric acid solution with molybdate ions to form molybdophosphoric acid ascorbic acid reduces this compound to phosphormolybdenum blue nitrate was determined photometrically by reacting nitrate ions in sulphuric and phosphoric solution with 2 6 dimethylphenol dmp to form the compound 4 nitro 2 6 dimethylphenol nitrite ions in acid solution form with the sulphanilic acid a diazonium salt that reacts with the n 1 naftill ethylenediamine dihydrochloride giving a reddish violet azo dye which was determined photometrically ammonium ion nh4 in strong alkaline solution is present entirely as ammonia this reacts with hypochlorite ions to form monochloramine which in turn reacts with 2 chlorphenol or thymol to form indophenol blue this is then determined photometrically at 690 712 nm 30 31 sulphates and chloride were determined photometrically at 420 nm and 450 nm respectively 27 28 copper ions were determined photometrically by reacting ammoniacal medium copper ii ions with cuprizone to form a blue complex magnesium ions in neutral solution form with phthaleins purple a violet dye which is determined photometrically on the other hand biomass concentration x g l was indirectly measured according to camacho et al 30 after cell separation and washing from all samples taken during the course of all experiments a straight line calibration of a600 dry weight g l was performed eq 1 1 x g l 0 331 a600 0 001 the chlorophyll chl and carotenoid contents ca were determined by a photocolorimetric method prior to extraction with acetone at 90 31 crude protein concentration was quantified according to 32 at the end of each experiment the algal biomass harvested was separated and washed twice with ultrapure water then elemental composition and fatty acids profile in the lipid fraction were determined by gas chromatography 33 furthermore the quality of the obtained water treated wastewater at the end of each culture was determined 3 1 calculation and statistical methods the experiments were repeated at least twice and the analytical methods were performed at least three time in order to check the reproducibility of the results mathematical equations and statistical analysis were obtained by using originpro 8 0 program 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of wastewaters used as culture media table 1 shows the characterization of crude ooww urban wastewater from secondary treatment uw inoculum and the mixture of ooww with inoculum oowwenriched the difference in the biochemical composition between ooww and uw can be observed more precisely for electric conductivity ec bod5 cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and chloride ions high ec tn tp and chloride values were obtained for the uw when compared to those for the ooww 4 35 10 and 7 times higher in uw respectively this fact support the theory of enriching ooww with uw given its higher content in essential nutrients for microalgae growth such as nitrogen and phosphorus the high ec value 5 47 ms cm in uw is due to the high concentration of inorganic ions such as chloride 1200 mg l similar values of bod5 1358 mg o2 l and cod 1362 mg o2 l in ooww were observed which indicates the biodegradability of organic content the ooww has higher bod5 and cod values when compared to the uw from secondary treatment notwithstanding the ooww has less organic load than indicated in the literature cod from 3 to 15 g o2 l 10 11 this fact is due to the operation mode applied in the olive mill where samples were collected the olive mill respects the cycles of cleaning and water change in the olive washing machines and in the vertical centrifuge where the ooww is obtained in fact the ooww is colourless as the olive mill performs the complete control of the operations throughout the process in order to avoid ooww colouring this allows no light limitation in algal cultures in other words this ooww has physicochemical parameters table 1 far from the typical parameters values of ooww from olive mills indicated in the literature with high cod 3 15 g o2 l and total phenolic compounds values up to 749 0 mg l 10 11 the mixture of inoculum based on uw and ooww allowed the culture media enrichment in this sense the preparation of a culture medium with 90 ooww and 10 inoculum v v allowed nitrogen and phosphorus increase from 7 49 mg l to 40 8 mg l and from 1 63 mg l to 6 97 mg l respectively table 1 in other words the content in macronutrients among others increased in the culture medium for microalga growth 4 2 biomass growth and kinetic parameters for cell growth monitoring cells number and biomass concentration along the cultures were determined the observation of the culture medium by optic microscope along the growth allowed the evaluation of the real state of the culture and the presence of microbial contamination especially with bacteria in addition the determination of cells number enabled to determine the average cell weight fig 2 shows the representation of the biomass concentration versus the corresponding number of cells determined in all the experiments the highest biomass concentration and cell number registered in the cultures were equal to 0 542 g l and 3 65 1010 cells l in addition the average cell weight value of dry weight g l to number of cells cells l was kept constant over the exponential and deceleration phases at 13 pg cell this value is lower than that registered for scenedesmus obliquus cells in different cultures media in which the highest value was determined in the culture medium formed by mixing omw 2 from process with two outlets decanter and with urban wastewater from secondary treatment table 2 the determination of the maximum specific growth rate μm h 1 and biomass productivity pb g l h was performed from the experimentally obtained growth curves fig 3 a in this sense μm was determined in the exponential growth phase according to eq 1 1 ln x x0 μm t a where the slope μm corresponds to the maximum specific growth rate determined in the exponential phase of growth and a is the intercept when x 0 fig 3b shows the variation of μm values when the oowwenriched concentration was varied in the culture medium from 5 to 100 of oowwenriched v v it can be observed that μm values showed a pronounced increase with the augment of the oowwenriched concentration until reaching the maximum μm value equal to 0 0203 1 h in the medium composed of 30 oowwenriched v v then μm values decrease in the most concentrated culture media these results were to be expected due to the presence in the oowwenriched of harmful compounds such as fat matter organic acids and phenolic compounds which are responsible for the toxic and inhibitory effect 34 a number of empirical models have been proposed for the description of substrate limitation and inhibition of microbial growth haldane 35 proposed an equation for uncompetitive inhibition which can be written as 2 μ m μ m max ooww e n r i c h e d k s o o w w e n r i c h e d o o w w e n r i c h e d 2 k i where μm max is the highest value of maximum specific growth rate in absence of inhibition and ks and ki are empirical saturation and inhibition constants respectively the adjustment of the experimental results to this mathematical model has made it possible to determine the different kinetic parameters table 3 the difference between the experimental maximum value of μm and μm max calculated by the model was expected since the last value is a theoretical value in culture without inhibition effect the values of ks 3 56 and ki 84 7 are consistent with the experimental results the parameters of the goodness of the fit were r2 0 990 and sum of squared errors sse 2 14 10 6 when comparing this behaviour with that obtained by hodaifa et al 36 for culture media formed in wastewater from the process using a decanter of two outlets mixture of olives and olive oil washing wastewaters with initial cod 7 1 g o2 l it is observed that a higher μm max value 0 048 1 h was obtained however the fall in μm values is more abrupt with the increase of the wastewater concentration in the culture media μm 0 015 1 h in cultures without dilution in all experiments exponential phase was followed by a linear behaviour during the deceleration growth phase in which cell growth continued at a lower rate fig 3a biomass productivity pb was determined in this phase according to eq 3 3 x pb t c this linear growth period is characteristic for bioprocesses controlled by nutrients availability its appearance is related to the limitation of any nutrient in the culture medium or limited availability of light or co2 37 38 fig 3c shows that the maximum pb value was determined in the 10 oowwenriched culture accordingly a decrease in the pb value with the increase of the oowwenriched concentration in the culture medium can be observed obtaining the lowest pb value in the most concentrated medium 100 oowwenriched similarly to the μm the same light intensity and airflow co2 were supplied to the cultures thus the appearance of this phase might be due to the increase of inhibitory compounds concentration in the culture media coupled by the increase of oowwenriched concentration mainly phenolic compounds in fact several researchers indicated the capacity of c pyrenoidosa to remove phenolic compounds and other pollutants dayana and bakthavatsalam 39 40 demonstrated the capacity of c pyrenoidosa kx686118 to remove phenolic compounds 90 from coal effluents of gasification plants in a similar way the variation in the volumetric biomass productivities versus the oowwenriched was adjusted by the haldane model 35 eq 2 with an acceptable goodness of the fit r2 0 975 and sse 5 96 10 8 table 3 and the obtained data are consisted with that observed experimentally in this case there is a noticeable difference between the values of experimental pb max and those determined by the model this fact might be due to the depletion of one or more nutrients or to the accumulative effect of growth inhibiting compounds in the biomass such as phenolic compounds or due to the covering of cells with a layer of residual fat contained in wastewater which prevents the exchange of nutrients between the cell and the culture medium 36 the first assumption is not possible give that with the increase in the ooww concentration in the culture medium the decrease in the biomass productivity values was greater fig 3c bearing in mind that both μm and pb decreased with the increase in the oowwenriched concentrations in the culture media the accumulative effect of the growth inhibiting compounds becomes more evident in this sense the value of ki in the case of pb variation is lower than that determined for μm table 3 4 3 biomass generation and biochemical composition the variation in the concentration of net biomass and its biochemical composition is dependent on the concentration of oowwenriched in the culture medium fig 4 the net biomass generation x x0 variation 0 135 0 238 g l decrease with the increase of oowwenriched concentrations in the culture media fig 4a this behaviour was expected considering that the increase of oowwenriched concentration in the culture media involves higher values of phenolic compounds and fat matter in the medium that prevents microalgae growth because of their toxic effect fig 4 b and c shows the percentages variation of the cell components pigments proteins carbohydrates and lipids present in the biomass versus the net biomass generation obtained x x0 g l in the cultures the percentages of total chlorophylls chl and total carotenoids ca were increasing with the rise of oowwenriched concentration in the culture medium until reaching the concentration of 30 ooww v v fig 4b then these percentages decreased this behaviour is similar to that registered for maximum specific growth rates and volumetric biomass productivities which means that the generation of pigments is associated to c pyrenoidosa growth in general the percentages of pigments 1 10 0 07 were maintained constant in the final harvested biomass from all cultures nevertheless total chlorophylls and total carotenoids percentages varied while the highest values registered for total chlorophylls 0 96 and total carotenoids 0 24 were determined in the culture with 30 of ooww v v on the other hand the total chlorophylls content in all the cultures was maintained 4 3 0 2 times higher than the total carotenoids independently of the net biomass generation variation in addition fig 4c shows the decrease of total lipid percentages when the increase of net biomass generation opposite behaviour was registered for the carbohydrates percentages while the proteins percentages were maintained constant 44 1 0 9 with the increase of biomass generation this fact was also confirmed by the biomass elemental analysis in which the mean value of nitrogen percentage was equal to 7 1 table 4 these results could be explained considering that the culture media enrichment by nitrogen addition with inoculum at constant percentage equal to 10 v v and the variation of the ooww percentage in the culture media did not affect the final nitrogen content since ooww only have 7 5 mg l table 1 in other words biomass generation was not limited by nitrogen when the ooww percentage was varied in any case all cultures had a deficiency in the availability of nitrogen since the oowwenriched contained only approximately around 40 mg l of total nitrogen this value is 4 times lower than that of the mineral synthetic medium of rodríguez lópez rl 41 with 140 mg n available l which is normally used as control culture for this microalga the highest values of lipids percentages 44 0 51 5 were determined in cultures containing more than 20 of oowwenriched v v while the highest value of carbohydrates percentage 29 4 was determined in the culture with 5 of oowwenriched in this sense wu and miao 42 highlighted that nitrogen is an essential nutrient in many macromolecules such as proteins chlorophylls rna dna and it acts as one of the most essential nutrients for microalgae growth nitrogen limitation or starvation normally result in a decrease in photosynthesis protein and lipid synthesis as well as an increase in carbohydrate formation 42 43 on the other hand n and p are known algal growth limiting factors the optimal value of n p ratio for freshwater algae has been suggested to be in the range of 6 8 10 44 however the n p ratio in this study was approximately 5 9 in the case of the culture medium with 100 ooww enriched nitrogenous matter was mainly composed of inorganic nh4 n in uw the initial nh4 n concentration was approximately 24 1 mg l table 1 algae have a considerable intracellular capacity for storing soluble and organic n molecules nitrogen is rapidly consumed as being indispensable for the regulation of the metabolic pathways it is used to produce amino acids and other organic n containing macromolecules at too high concentrations the nh4 n becomes toxic and can thus inhibit algal growth han et al 45 indicated that nitrogen limitation and high ph conditions constitute an effective method for lipid accumulation in microalgae biomass lipids content in some microalgae such as chlorella sp nannochloris sp and neochloris oleobundans can significantly increase under nitrogen limitation conditions commonly ranging from 30 to 60 46 gardner et al 47 found that the triacylglycerol contents of chlorella sp and scenedesmus sp accumulated faster when the cells were cultured in the controlled high ph however nitrogen limitation or high ph induction had little contribution to the lipid productivity of the cells since the cells grow decelerate under the stress conditions tan et al 48 demonstrated that low molar ratio of n c nitrogen limitation in the culture medium play an important role in lipid accumulation several researchers have indicated that chlorella accumulates more lipids with decreased molar ratios of n c typically at n c ratio of 0 02 0 0109 49 in this study the initial molar ratio of n c was only 0 17 in the 100 oowwenriched indicating no severe nitrogen limitation elemental composition of the harvested biomass at the end of each experiment is recorded in table 4 results indicate that oxygen 43 3 1 6 and carbon 42 2 1 5 were the most abundant elements in biomass followed by nitrogen 7 05 0 15 hydrogen 6 66 0 18 and sulphur 0 84 0 08 as observed no significant differences in the elemental composition of the harvested biomass from the experiments were registered khalid et al 50 proved the ability of c sorokiniana to change its internal elemental composition as a function of the nutrients concentration in culture medium furthermore whitton et al 51 also demonstrated the relationship between microalgae elemental composition and nutrients concentration it was proved for five freshwater microalgae species that those species with high n and low p internal composition were able to uptake ammonium and phosphate more efficiently lastly beuckels et al 52 proved that chlorella and scenedesmus are able to adjust the internal concentration of n and p in biomass according to the n and p concentration in the wastewater medium table 5 lists the composition of fatty acids fas of the lipid fraction of the c pyrenoidosa biomass obtained at the end of each experiment as a percentage w w of the total lipid fraction fas were grouped into saturated sfas monounsaturated mufas and polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas the most abundant group was pufas with an average content of 44 5 sd 2 47 followed by sfas 28 8 on average sd 1 16 and mufas 13 3 on average sd 0 699 within sfas palmitic c16 0 and stearic c18 0 were the most abundant with values ranging from 19 2 100 oowwenriched to 21 9 5 oowwenriched for palmitic and from 6 54 100 oowwenriched to 7 72 5 oowwenriched for stearic oleic acid c18 1 was the major mufas 9 06 on average and the most abundant pufas identified were c18 3 22 5 on average and c18 2n6 15 9 on average meanwhile eicosapentaenoic acid or epa c20 5n3 was detected at low concentrations in all conditions ranging from 0 185 when 100 oowwenriched was used to 1 65 in 10 oowwenriched culture media no docosahexaenoic acid or dha c22 6n3 was found in any condition nutrient starvation temperature ph and light intensity are the main factors affecting fas composition 53 in this sense as ph light intensity and temperature were maintained constant along the cultures the observed differences in the fas composition should be attributed to the differences in nutrients concentration regarding nutrients nitrogen limitation is the major critical compound affecting the lipid metabolism and the proportion between saturated and unsaturated fas besides phosphorous deprivation increase the content of c16 0 and c18 1 in various microalgae species 53 the final biochemical composition of the harvested c pyrenoidosa biomass at the end of the cultures can be seen in fig 5 no variation was observed in the total pigments 1 10 0 07 and crude proteins contents 44 1 0 8 meanwhile total lipids content increase with the increase of oowwenriched in the culture media and it was maintained constant 48 8 3 4 in culture media containing from 30 to 100 of oowwenriched v v opposite behaviour was observed for carbohydrates content which decreased from 29 4 to 2 81 with the oowwenriched increase these behaviours are to be expected given the virtually constant nitrogen availability in the culture media the same uw added to culture media as inoculum and the global variation in nitrogen by the addition of ooww is depreciated since the tn in ooww is only 7 5 mg l nitrogen limitation or starvation normally results in the decrease of photosynthesis proteins and lipids synthesis on the contrary carbohydrate synthesis is increased 43 44 the nitrogen availability in oowwenriched was 4 times lower than that in the control mineral synthetic medium of rodríguez lópez 41 with 140 mg n available l becker 54 determined a crude protein percentage equal to 57 for c pyrenoidosa in synthetic medium which is higher than that obtained in the experiments of this work 44 1 nevertheless the same author obtained a carbohydrate content of 26 and 2 of lipids which are lower than those obtained in this work equal to 29 4 and 51 5 respectively the final harvested biomass could be used in combination with other substrates for biofuels production or maybe as supplementary substrate in the anaerobic digester for biogas production moreover as the least favourable option it could be used for domestic commercial or industrial boilers and as a fuel for generators of electric energy production 4 4 photo bioremediation of urban and olive mill wastewaters table 6 shows the physicochemical characterization of enriched olive mill wastewater without dilution treated and the total removal percentages achieved after the bioprocess applied using c pyrenoidosa in general high elimination percentages 86 were obtained in the main contamination parameters total solid total phenolic compounds and chemical oxygen demand the proposed bioprocess microfiltration plus c pyrenoidosa growth in this work improve the physiochemical characteristics of ooww in this sense the highest elimination percentages registered after the bioprocess were obtained for total solids 98 8 cod 86 3 and tpcs 85 7 furthermore removal percentages equal to 49 7 57 1 48 3 and 47 8 were obtained for no3 so4 2 no2 and mg2 respectively c pyrenoidosa was also able to reduce cu2 41 3 total phosphorus 56 4 and cl 47 1 cod and tpcs remediation was particularly relevant since high organic loads and the presence of antioxidant compounds such as phenolic compounds is not desirable in wastewaters intended to be reused for irrigation or discharged into water public channels in this sense other authors have obtained lower cod elimination levels when using omws as culture media for different microalgae strains markou et al 55 achieved cod elimination percentages ranging from 28 8 66 9 after the culture of spirulina platensis in omw 3 furthermore travieso et al 56 obtained 37 of cod removal from omw 2 after a process based on anaerobic digestion sedimentation and chlorella zofingiensis culture regarding tpcs markou et al 55 demonstrated that the increase of omw 3 concentration in the culture media results in a decrease in the capacity of microalgae to remove phenolic compounds concluding that tpcs degradation depends on their concentration in culture media obtaining removal percentages ranging from 41 9 100 in this sense several studies have demonstrated the ability of microalgae to assimilate nitrogen in different forms being ammonium ions the preferred source since less energy is required 57 the presence of phosphorus in the medium is highly relevant for microalgae cell growth due to its role in metabolism and phosphorylation reactions on the other hand the increase in dissolved oxygen concentration after the microalgae culture indicated a photosynthetic activity instead of a carbon oxidation throughout heterotrophic growth 57 the treated water obtained after the bioprocess was characterized by a high quality since it did not present any toxicity heavy metal or phenolic compounds considering that it comes from the agri food industry quality parameters registered in table 6 indicate that treated water could be used for irrigation discharges to surface water and groundwater or for drinking water if it is passed through some additional operations unit such as ion exchange reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration to adjust its organic or inorganic content in the same way spanish standards for treated omw 2 to use in irrigation established the following parameters ph in the range 6 0 9 0 suspended solids 500 mg kg and cod 1000 mg o2 l in addition the treated water after the process comply with european directive 91 271 eec concerning urban wastewater treatment where cod 125 mg o2 l and tn 10 mg l for treated water discharge into water public channels in contrast european drinking water directive 2015 1787 specifies that drinking water is all water used in any food production process this directive establishes the chemical parameters that determine drinking water quality electric conductivity 2500 μs cm turbidity acceptable to consumers and no abnormal change toc no abnormal change iron 0 2 mg l sulphate 250 mg l sodium 200 mg l and ammonium 0 5 mg l 5 conclusions based on the experimental results obtained in this work it can be concluded that c pyrenoidosa has the capacity to grow in both wastewaters ooww and uw the ooww is characterized by its high organic load and low nitrogen and phosphorus contents essential elements for microalgae growth uw still has good inorganic fraction and low organic matter content this wastewater could supply essential nutrients n and p among others to ooww as a low cost substrate the mixture of different urban and industrial wastewaters enables to design an optimal culture medium for microalgae growth in order to obtain an economic viability biofuels production and efficient wastewaters bioremediation method irrigation or drinking water for its recuperation and recirculation which allows a good circular economy in industry and environment the bioprocess studied in this work is a sustainable proposal to explore the combination of different
