6820,forest growth dynamics affect streamflow with changes in actual evapotranspiration aet during forest regeneration using a top down model approach we present a seasonal forest hydrology model that estimates streamflow in forested catchments containing sparse soil and climate data across a 1423 km2 remote study area a rainfall interpolation procedure using available rainfall data and information on terrain was integrated into a new seasonal streamflow model called abcf which uses catchment sapwood area sa as the emergent property that equilibrates with potential evapotranspiration pet and a soil storage threshold that reduces aet below pet when soil water is limiting we produce seasonal estimates of streamflow with nash sutcliffe efficiencies of 0 85 0 87 and 0 91 for three major catchments within the study area a fundamental feature of the top down model approach is the use of lidar data and forest inventory data to model forest structural properties that relate strongly with sa building on our previous work with this modelling framework our representation of eco hydrological properties of the forest has been refined with a more accurate procedure for estimating stand mean sapwood thickness and hence sa and a remotely sensed tree stocking density n of old growth forests to correct the temporal evolution of n as a means to improve sa estimates regional consistency of model parameters shows that the top down modelling framework may be used to estimate streamflow in ungauged catchments using a forest growth model the seasonal model generalised for both water limited and water unlimited forest conditions has significant potential for application in water supply planning and drought security keywords top down model evapotranspiration forest growth forest inventory forest sapwood area streamflow 1 introduction forest hydrology models that spatially quantify vegetation induced trends in streamflow are useful for regulating water allocations with a changing climate improving water accounting after vegetation disturbance evaluating future scenarios for risk mitigation planning and assessing drought security of forested water supply catchments the development of such models may be guided by a bottom up approach which seeks to integrate processes at small scales up to the scale of interest or by a top down approach that describes hydrological behaviours that emerge at the scale of interest the top down approach may either involve stochastic methods that use statistics to identify model structure and parameter estimates directly from data analysis young 2001 or deterministic conceptual modelling methods that emphasise whole system behaviours of emergent properties inferred from available data milly 1994 across a mountainous forested landscape heterogeneity in actual evapotranspiration aet is attributed to the interaction of geomorphic pedogenic and climatic processes as well as disturbance due to pyrogenic anthropogenic and biotic factors the heterogeneous forest structure that eventuates contains key signatures and features of the spatiotemporal aet across the landscape which may be used in a deterministic conceptual model to predict streamflow in ungauged catchments using light detection and ranging lidar data derived eco hydrological properties of the forest structure may provide surrogate information for aet estimates in order to compensate for the sparse soil climate and disturbance history data across many forested regions of the world sutherland et al 2017 lidar data has advanced forest hydrology

and geomorphologic features useful for run off routing maceyka and hansen 2015 allometric equations relating water conducting sapwood area sa with forest stand characteristics have been generated using lidar derived estimates of canopy area lubczynski et al 2017 stem diameter jaskierniak et al 2015a tree height saito et al 2015 vegetation profile mitchell et al 2012b and forest stocking density jaskierniak et al 2015b although these lidar derived forest structural attributes are useful for upscaling aet from tree to catchment level few studies have used lidar data to derive ecohydrological properties across a catchment for predicting streamflow see mitchell et al 2012a and jaskierniak et al 2016 motivated by the rich source of catchment level information on forest dynamics that influence aet in eucalyptus regnans ash forest benyon et al 2015 predicted mean annual streamflow using a relationship between catchment mean sa and mean annual aet derived from experimental catchments jaskierniak et al 2016 applied the sa aet relationship to larger water supply catchments to predict annual streamflow with spatiotemporal sa maps derived from forest inventory data lidar data and forest growth models the annual time steps limited the model s usefulness in water supply planning for drought security as regulation of water allocations and evaluation of future scenarios for risk mitigation are best conducted using seasonal and monthly time steps the ash forest studies in benyon et al 2015 and jaskierniak et al 2016 were undertaken in forested catchments with typically high rainfall and deep soil water storage conditions where average aet may be assumed to equal average potential evapotranspiration pet jaskierniak et al 2016 showed that during severe drought conditions when water availability was reduced a persistent under prediction of annual streamflow occurred the sa aet relationship lacked representation of eco hydrological processes that reduce aet when water becomes limited by climatic and pedologic conditions to address this shortcoming we adopt the deterministic conceptual modelling method that uses spatiotemporal sa estimates to represent the emergent forest structural property that equilibrates with pet and introduce a soil storage threshold to predict aet when available water reduces aet below pet the new top down approach provides a conceptual framework for applications in water limited forests a major impediment to the application of any hydrological model in large mountainous forested catchments is that they are often located in remote regions with steep orography rain shadow effects and sparse rain station coverage this is the case at our study site which includes melbourne s three largest water supply catchments o shannassy upper yarra and thomson totalling 915 km2 with this in mind the development of our seasonal top down deterministic conceptual model has three main objectives the first objective is to develop a spatiotemporal model of monthly rainfall that makes best use of available rain station and terrain information the second objective is to improve the forest growth model s quantification of sa so that the hydrological model more accurately represents the eco hydrological processes the third objective is to generalise the modelling framework for applications in water limited forests whilst extending our modelling approach to seasonal time steps in a parsimonious manner consistent with the top down philosophy apart from making the updated model operationally useful deeper insight at the large scale is expected as to the effect of drought stress on aet we investigate whether the seasonal model addresses the consistent streamflow underestimation during prolonged drought in jaskierniak et al 2016 for operational purposes in ungauged catchments we investigate whether the model parameters exhibit regional consistency these objectives provide structural sub headings in the method results and discussion sections 2 theoretical background this section provides a summary of earlier work using the top down approach using forest sapwood area to infer aet it provides the context for the new developments presented in this study in its simplest form the model structure assumes that annual changes in catchment water yield are largely attributed to annual rainfall variability and changes in eco hydrological processes that influence aet defined as the sum of transpiration interception and evaporation from the forest with this approach jaskierniak et al 2016 constructed a bias corrected lagged rainfall bclr model to simulate streamflow at annual time steps 1 q t θ 1 p t 1 θ 1 p t 1 a e t t p t θ 2 p t obs where q t is simulated catchment annual streamflow mm yr 1 for water year t ae t t is the catchment annual aet mm yr 1 for water year t p t is the catchment annual rainfall mm yr 1 for water year t p t obs is the catchment annual rainfall mm yr 1 for water year t estimated from the network of rain gauges θ1 is a runoff lag coefficient and θ2 is a rainfall bias correction to estimate catchment level aet in ash forest benyon et al 2015 developed an empirical relationship between catchment level sa m2 ha 1 and mean annual aet mm yr 1 2 aet m s a c where m and c were empirically estimated as 96 71 and 441 85 mm which involved averaging streamflow rainfall and forest inventory data over one to four years pre and post disturbance for 15 catchments ranging between 4 and 122 ha eq 2 was empirically derived for ash forested catchments which have deep soils and high rainfall as a result the water use by the vegetation is not limited by water availability in all but the most substantial droughts that affect young ash regrowth found at the lower end of the ash rainfall range as observed in the picaninny catchment clear fell logged in 1971 72 bren et al 2010 slip creek catchment the old growth control for picaninnny did not stop flowing even during the driest part of the drought a consequence of this is that annual aet in eq 2 averaged over one to four years is expected to closely match pet our long term hypothesis is that the linear relationship in eq 2 may be generalised to other forest types that may be subject to limited water availability motivated by eagleson s 1982 notion of ecological optimality we hypothesize that a forest at a particular location develops its sa to equilibrate with the pet and precipitation p at that location in order to maximize its biomass production during periods when water is not limiting we consider sa to be a proxy for the hydraulic architecture that transfers water from the soil to the canopy such that it acts as the emergent property that is controlled by pet in contrast the forest responds to shorter term variability in climate and its influence on soil water by regulating aet relative to pet to estimate catchment level sa benyon et al 2015 used catchment level measurements of mean stem basal area ba µ at 1 3 m height m2 and over storey stocking density n to estimate catchment sa as 3 sa st 100 n π 4 b a μ π st 100 4 π n b a where st is mean sapwood thickness calculated as 4 st α 1 n α 2 where α1 and α 2 are parameters empirically derived using sapwood core samples measured within stands with a known stocking density in order to predict streamflow changes due to wildfire and logging in ash forest jaskierniak et al 2016 estimated the catchment annual aet over time by coupling maps of forest age and lidar based maps of basal area ba and stocking density n with temporal evolution models of ba and n the temporal evolution models allow ba and n to be estimated in years when lidar data are not available the temporal evolution models were derived from permanent growth plot pgp data specifically jaskierniak et al 2016 found that the expected stocking density n t of ash for age t at a particular location can be described by 5 n t n n t 1 n exp t 1 β 0 β 1 t 1 exp t β 0 β 1 t where n is the mean stocking density of old growth ash forest and β 0 and β 1 are calibrated parameters furthermore using pgp data wang and hamilton 2002 found that the temporal evolution of the expected ash ba can be described by 6 ba t ba t 1 t 1 t c 1 exp c 2 1 t 1 t c 1 where bat is the basal area at age t and c1 and c2 are calibrated parameters catchment annual aet is estimated as follows 1 a lidar derived map of n and ba is constructed for a particular year tl for which lidar sensing was conducted 2 using a map of forest age at year tl n t 1 and ba t 1 are obtained for each catchment grid cell with t1 being the forest age in year tl 3 temporal evolution models of n and ba are used to project forward and backwards from year tl to estimate annual nt and bat for each catchment grid cell over the regenerating forest period 4 eqs 2 and 3 are then used to estimate the time series of aett at each catchment grid cell jaskierniak et al 2016 used this procedure to generate spatiotemporal estimates of aett across three forested catchments ranging between 18 and 100 km2 in the maroondah water catchment system and then applied this to the bclr model in eq 1 the resulting top down model required calibration of one parameter to account for runoff carry over into the following year and two parameters to account for bias in estimated catchment rainfall it produced nash sutcliffe efficiency nse statistics between 0 7 and 0 79 the streamflow modelling framework described in this study advances benyon et al 2015 and jaskierniak et al 2016 with the following developments i section 5 2 1 refines the relationship between mean sapwood thickness st and stocking density in eq 4 for improved stand sa estimates ii section 5 2 2 empirically derives stocking density in old growth forest n in eq 5 to more accurately characterize the rate of decay in n during regeneration and iii section 5 3 replaces the annual model in eq 1 with a seasonal conceptual model that uses sa as the emergent property that equilibrates with pet and a soil storage threshold that reduces aet below pet for water limited conditions 3 site description in south eastern australia high rainfall forested catchments supply the bulk of water for large cities and irrigation in rural regions north east catchment management authority 2004 vertessy et al 2001 these catchments are covered by ash type ash and mixed species eucalypt forests msef ash forests are dominated by e regnans e delegatensis and e nitens which are obligate seeders that rely on stand replacing wildfires to regenerate in recent years ash forests have been disturbed by wildfire and logging on an unprecedented scale stimulating large scale changes in forest structure that will have substantial impact on future water yields benyon and lane 2012 haywood 2009 in contrast msef are facultative resprouters that recover from crown scorch wildfire by resprouting from epicormic buds and lignotubers the post wildfire forest dynamics of msef result in recovery of aet to pre disturbance levels within a few to several years following disturbance nolan et al 2015 fig 1 shows the study site is located in melbourne s water supply catchments on the south side of the great dividing range in south eastern victoria australia o shannassy upper yarra and thomson represent the three catchments used to model streamflow in this study their areas total 915 km2 or 64 of the study site whereas rainfall modelling is undertaken across all 16 catchments 1423 km2 of the study site also shown in fig 1 are the three maroondah system catchments coranderrk graceburn and watts which were used in jaskierniak et al 2016 and are used here to evaluate the monthly rainfall model the terrain is steep and deeply incised across the site with elevation across a 1 m resolution digital elevation model dem ranging between 200 m and 1570 m at o shannassy and thomson catchment respectively soils are very deep with permeability as high as 10 m day at the surface and water holding capacity that can exceed 5000 mm davis et al 1996 langford and o shaughnessy 1977 watson et al 1998 historic mean annual p varies substantially ranging from 977 mm yr 1 at aberfeldy the rain shadow region on the leeward eastern side of mt baw baw to 1713 mm yr 1 at mt baw baw bureau of meteorology 2018 the catchments are entirely forested with 46 ash type forest 50 mixed eucalypt forests dominated by e oblique e cypellocarpa e sieberi e dalrympleana e radiate e dives and e viminalis and 4 rainforest predominantly interspersed amongst old growth ash in the o shannassy catchment fig 1 the 1939 wildfires burnt the great majority of ash forest in upper yarra and thomson whereas the 2009 wildfire burnt 85 of the o shannassy catchment 4 data 4 1 hydrology data the o shannassy upper yarra and thomson catchments were gauged in 1901 1913 and 1913 respectively from these records monthly streamflow time series were extracted the mean and standard deviation of each catchment s annual streamflow is 730 226 mm yr 1 455 195 mm yr 1 and 527 173 mm yr 1 respectively the rainfall model is developed across all 16 melbourne water supply catchments total area 1 423 km2 using 127 rainfall stations located within 15 km of the catchment boundaries fig 2 shows the distribution of the rainfall stations the stations consisted of a mixture of tipping bucket gauge providing daily rainfall and bulk gauges visited at random time intervals rainfall data was processed from 1920 prior to that year the coverage of rain stations was judged to be inadequate modelled rainfall across watts graceburn and coranderrk catchments from jaskierniak et al 2016 was also used for comparison with present study monthly pet estimates were obtained from the australian water availability project awap which used the priestley taylor method raupach et al 2011 2009 the awap pet estimates with a spatial resolution of 5 km were used to determine the expected monthly fraction of annual pet over each catchment 4 2 forest inventory data the forest inventory data was obtained from permanent growth plots pgps consisting of 160 mono specific even aged ash stands distributed across victoria each plot site was measured for ba and n between 4 and 19 times at intervals varying from 1 to 6 years the plots were rectangular in shape varying from 0 04 to 0 45 ha the lidar data was captured in 2008 and consisted of approximately 2 pulses per square meter refer to jaskierniak et al 2016 for the flight details and sensor configuration of the data acquisition flights forest age data at the time of lidar capture was compiled using logging history and fire disturbance data tree detection within old growth forests involved the use of nearmap imagery with 8 cm cell resolution the images were captured in april 2011 approx two years after the 2009 wildfire and fig 1 shows the location of the site used 5 methods 5 1 spatial monthly rainfall model a major impediment to the application of any hydrological model in the study catchments is the fact that these catchments are located in remote regions with steep orography rain shadow effects and limited rainfall station coverage this section describes the development of a spatial monthly rainfall model that improves upon the model described in jaskierniak et al 2016 by making better use of terrain information as well as using all available rainfall station data we optimise the use of available rainfall data with a modelling framework that uses the post 1978 and pre 1978 time series data separately due to the diminishing density of gauges available as we move back in time in view of the complexity of approach taken the main steps in monthly rainfall interpolation procedure are summarized before a fuller elaboration in the subsequent sections 1 fill in missing data in the tipping bucket gauge record using nearby gauges and compile monthly rainfall 2 disaggregate bulk gauge records into daily values and compile monthly rainfall 3 identify best predictor of average monthly rainfall from a set of explanatory variables including position buffered topographic indices and net radiation 4 for post 1978 data interpolate monthly rainfall at each catchment 100 m grid cell using the following steps a standardise observed monthly rainfall data to a reference point in the explanatory variable space b use the nearest neighbour algorithm to interpolate standardised rainfall at each catchment grid cell c map the interpolated standardised rainfall to its correct location in the explanatory variable space 5 for pre 1978 rainfall use a regression based on the three most predictive gauges identified from post 1978 data to estimate monthly rainfall at each grid cell 5 1 1 fill in of missing data values prior to developing the spatial rainfall model missing or na data was processed with the objective of creating a suitably accurate monthly record missing data was either filled in if correlations to other gauges were adequate or left as is for tipping bucket gauges fill ins of na values involved least squares regression to relate each subject gauge with each available gauge within 20 km of the subject gauge and an elevation 500 m below or above the subject gauge the strength of the regressions was ordered from largest to smallest using coefficient of determination r2 and the gauge with the strongest relationship was used to fill in missing data using the following set of rules the number of missing measurement days in a calendar month determined the minimum r2 needed for a fill in to occur the rationale for this approach is that with fewer na values in a month a lower r2 can be tolerated to fill in a month s data with this in mind months with more than 25 missing measurements nas required a gauge that related to the subject gauge with r2 greater than 0 95 months with 20 to 25 nas required an r2 greater than 0 85 months with 10 to 20 nas required an r2 greater than 0 75 and months with 0 to 10 nas required an r2 greater than 0 70 all other nas remained unchanged bulk rain gauges had readings taken at random days and represent rainfall since the last measurement the reading recorded at the bulk gauge had to be disaggregated into daily estimates before aggregating the estimates into calendar months using the same fill in of nas procedure outlined for the tipping bucket gauges to disaggregate the bulk gauges all tipping bucket gauges within 20 km of the subject bulk gauge and with an elevation 500 m below or above the bulk gauge were identified the daily values from the tipping bucket gauge records were aggregated using the time periods between readings of the subject bulk gauge the aggregated tipping bucket gauge with the highest r2 regression was then used to disaggregate bulk gauge readings into daily rainfall values 5 1 2 predictor variables to explain spatial variability in rainfall using all data for each calendar month a relationship was generated between the monthly rainfall and a set of explanatory variables jaskierniak et al 2016 used the geographic coordinates and elevation of each gauge to predict the variability in monthly rainfall across the maroondah catchments 153 km2 the substantially more complex terrain across all melbourne water catchments 1423 km2 required further model development to account for steep orography and rain shadow effects as well as using each gauge s geographic coordinates and elevation additional explanatory variables included mean monthly net radiation rn estimated using nyman et al 2014 and a range of buffered topographic indices the nyman et al 2014 method for estimating rn incorporates topographic effects on net radiation in complex terrain to generate topographic indices at each gauge location multiple circular buffers with radius ranging from 0 5 km to 10 km in 0 5 km increments were generated around each gauge the whole study site was gridded using 50 m grid cells and a one metre dem was used to determine each grid cell s mean elevation slope and euclidean distance to the main ridgelines along the great dividing range the 50 m grid cell s mean of each corresponding topographic index was then used to obtain the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding index for each buffered region at each rain gauge location linear regression was used to identify the most predictive explanatory variables for each calendar month the selected buffered explanatory variables were then calculated for all 100 m grid cells across the catchments 5 1 3 interpolating monthly rainfall between gauges prior to 1978 the spatiotemporal distribution of the rainfall time series was not well represented across the great majority of the catchments langford and o shaughnessy 1979 1977 fig 2 shows the number of months of data available at each gauge forest hydrology research in the melbourne water catchments was up scaled in the 1970 s with 63 rain gauges established in the decade preceding 1978 and further 26 rain gauges after 1978 this motivated the use of two different procedures for interpolating monthly rainfall across the catchment because the post 1978 record had the highest density of gauges with almost continuous time series the main model development focussed on this period because the pre 1978 record has a declining gauge coverage as we move back in time a different and less accurate procedure informed by the analysis of the post 1978 analysis was used 5 1 4 post 1978 rainfall estimates post 1978 the natural neighbour nn method was used to spatially interpolate rainfall esri 2011 firstly the predictor variables described in section 5 1 2 were used to standardise the rainfall data in order to remove the influence of location topography and net radiation at each gauge site the standardisation uses the regression relationship to transfer the observed monthly rainfall at a particular gauge to a reference point in the explanatory variable space in other words the regression relationship is used to estimate the rainfall that would be expected if the gauge were relocated to the reference point in the predictor space the objective of the standardisation is to create a standardised rainfall values whose expected value is constant these standardised values were used to generate surfaces with the nn method which uses voronoi tessellation to find the closest subset of station locations to an interpolated location and assigns weights based on proportionate areas to interpolate the values esri 2011 the resulting surface of standardised rainfall was then mapped back from the reference point to the actual coordinates in the predictor space to reinstate the influence of location net radiation and topography on local rainfall this yielded the final monthly rainfall field for each grid cell in the catchment noting that the nn interpolation is restricted to the convex hull of each month s rain gauge locations rainfall could not be interpolated for some months at a small fraction of grid cells in the catchments for these cells we estimate missing monthly rainfall using a linear regression between the cell with the missing estimate and the nearest cell with a continuous time series of rainfall estimates these regressions exploited the fact that cells lying outside the convex hull in some months were inside the convex hull in other months 5 1 5 pre 1978 rainfall estimates the interpolation of rainfall between 1920 and 1978 was considerably more complex because of the changing availability of gauges for each pre 1978 month at each grid cell the three most predictive gauges were identified from up to a maximum of 20 of the nearest available gauges and up to 18 available gauges with the longest time series the 38 gauges were required to have at least 120 months of post 1978 data to make sure the regression against all spatially distributed grid cells was adequate for interpolation to find the most predictive combination of three gauges from a possible 38 gauges required evaluating up to 8436 combinations the r2 was evaluated for each combination of three gauges using the post 1978 estimates for the grid cell and the post 1978 gauge records considering neighbouring grids are likely to have similar gauges representing the highest r2 a two step procedure was used involving primary and secondary grid cells primary cells correspond to every 10th grid cell in a moving window scan that iterated through each row from east to west starting from the southernmost row secondary cells are represented by the remaining cells for each primary cell all combinations of available gauges were evaluated for each month of record for each secondary cell the gauges selected for the last fully evaluated primary cell were used exploiting the high correlation between nearby cells produced a substantial computational saving for cases where the distance between the secondary grid cell and the last fully evaluated primary grid cell was greater than 1 km all combinations of gauges were fully evaluated it is important to note that this procedure was repeated for each pre 1978 month as missing data values meant different predictive gauges were used from month to month 5 2 improved estimation of sapwood area in ash forest the study catchments consist of two distinct forest types ash forest and msef different approaches were used to estimate mean annual aet in each forest type in ash forest eq 2 is used to estimate mean annual aet which is expected to closely match pet except in drought this relies on estimates of catchment level sa m2 ha 1 which is the subject of this section for ash forests originating from the 1939 wildfire which is the dominant ash age class across the study site we used lidar captured in 2008 to calculate ba and n estimates in 2008 in order to estimate sa for each 100 m grid cell in 2008 estimates of ba and n in other years are obtained using eqs 5 and 6 for ash regrowth after logging disturbance forest inventory data was not made available to accurately quantify forest conditions pre and post harvest we therefore assumed that the evolution of ba and n after logging started in the harvest year and followed the trajectories described by eqs 5 and 6 using age specific mean ba and n from all cells with 1939 regrowth ash forest in msef there is insufficient data to derive the equivalent eqs 2 3 5 and 6 fortunately however we can use the approximation described by jaskierniak et al 2016 which exploited the fact there was little logging in the msef within the study catchments and that the only substantial disturbance was due to wildfire considering msef is typically observed to have a rapid recovery after wildfire nolan et al 2015 the annual aet is assumed to be minimally affected following wildfire disturbance hence aet in msef was assumed to be catchment mean annual p minus q using the time series prior to the 1939 wildfire ignoring post 1939 data due to stand replacing ash confounding the assumption addressing the gaps in msef is beyond the scope of this study and the focus of the remainder of this section is on improving sa estimates in ash forest 5 2 1 stand sapwood thickness sapwood area estimates for catchment grid cells are influenced by the methodology used to estimate a forest stand s st for the purpose of calculating st in eq 4 benyon et al 2015 estimated st for each plot stp by measuring the mean st for each tree st t and then averaging over the trees within the plot noting that a large tree with large circumference contributes more to plot sa than a smaller tree with smaller circumference a more accurate estimate of stp assuming the trunk is approximately circular is 7 s t p s a p c p i π 4 d t i 2 d t i 2 s t t i 2 i π d t i s t t i i d t i s t i i d t i where sap is plot sapwood area cp is total tree circumference within the plot dt is tree diameter under bark and the index i refers to the ith tree in the plot for the plot level st data used in benyon et al 2015 we recalculated the st p estimates using eq 7 and then revised the relationship between plot level stocking density n and st p using eq 4 we recalculated plot level sa estimates using the revised st estimates in eq 3 and then revised the aet sa relationship in eq 2 the revised n stp relationship was then used to estimate st for each catchment grid cell using grid cell estimates of n the grid cell sa and aet estimates were then obtained using eq 3 and the revised relationship in eq 2 respectively 5 2 2 old growth stocking density the temporal distribution of sa is dependent on the temporal evolution of n which requires an accurate estimate of old growth stocking density n in eq 5 jaskierniak et al 2016 assumed that n was 25 trees ha 1 using 8 circular plots from benyon and lane 2012 here we revisit this estimate using a larger sample of old growth ash forest in the upper slopes of o shannassy catchment shown in fig 1 the following tree detection procedure was undertaken across the site shown in fig 1 using nearmap imagery with 8 cm cell resolution and a lidar derived canopy height model chm with 1 m cell resolution we manually located all old growth trees within a 588 ha sample area the nearmap images were collected april 2011 approx two years after the 2009 wildfire making the site suitable for visually identifying tree stems visual assessment of the chm identified old growth tree canopies under circumstances where the stem was absent or difficult to decipher in the nearmap imagery the average number of detected trees per ha was used to estimate n in eq 5 5 3 top down model of seasonal streamflow the revised aet sa relationship in eq 2 provides estimates of mean annual aet in ash forest which is expected to closely match pet because water stress is only likely during the more severe droughts to use eq 2 in a seasonal model awap pet data were used to estimate monthly fractions of annual pet at each grid cell across the catchment and the month specific fraction was multiplied by the yearly aet derived using eq 2 in order to produce a month specific aet the monthly time series data was then aggregated into three distinctly different seasons pre winter dry season with increasing rainfall before the wet season january to march wet season april to august and post winter drying period september to december we present two top down modelling approaches that use the seasonal time step in a parsimonious manner 5 3 1 lagged variable approach the first approach extends the lagged variable approach of bclr to seasonal time steps to avoid proliferation of parameters we experimented with a range of lagged formulations removing variables that did not contribute to improved fit of seasonal streamflow we present what we consider to be the most parsimonious lagged seasonal model which will be referred to as mav 2s 8 q t θ 1 p t θ 2 p t 1 p t 2 1 θ 1 θ 2 p t 3 p t 4 θ 3 1 15 i 1 15 p t i a e t t p t θ 4 p t obs where q t is simulated catchment streamflow mm for season t p t obs is the estimated catchment rainfall mm for season t and θ 4 is a rainfall multiplier to compensate for systematic error in estimated catchment rainfall the model uses three lagged rainfall variables the first two introduce short term memory lagging rainfall over four antecedent seasons while the third introduces long term memory using a moving average of rainfall over the previous 15 seasons the lag parameters θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are independent of season to ensure the model remains parsimonious 5 3 2 conceptual storage approach the second approach deals more explicitly with catchment memory by using a conceptual store and explicitly accounts for water stress which as noted is only expected in the severe droughts the store accounts for catchment memory arising from rainfall prior to the current season e g a low store reflects a prolonged dry spell and also provides a simple framework for enabling threshold behaviours in catchment fluxes to maintain parsimony the second approach adopts the abc model vogel and sankarasubramanian 2003 fiering 1967 as the template and uses features from the conceptual two store soil dryness index sdi model kuczera et al 1993 which has been applied to melbourne s catchments with good results this model will be referred to as the abcf model given the aggregation over space and time the abcf model focuses on describing the emergent hydrological properties at the large catchment scales rather than on the hydrologic processes known to occur at fine time and space scales at the heart of the abcf model a conceptual unconstrained store is used to model the catchment water balance 9 s t 1 s t p t a e t t q f t s f t q t q f t s f t where s t is the store depth mm at the beginning of the season with time index t p t is the rainfall mm q f t is the quick flow mm s f t is the slow flow mm and ae t t is the actual evapotranspiration mm the fluxes into and out of the store are 1 rainfall 10 p t θ 6 p t obs where p t obs is the rainfall estimated by the spatial model and θ 6 is a rainfall multiplier to compensate for systematic error in estimated rainfall 2 quickflow 11 q f t θ 1 θ 2 s t p t if s t 0 0 otherwise where s t 1 2 s t s t 1 is the average store depth during time t and θ 1 and θ 2 are quickflow parameters the quickflow is functionally similar to that used in the sdi model which assumes quickflow is

stress parameter conceptually representing the difference in the threshold θ 4 and the wilting point of the soil the sdi model assumed that aet was unaffected by water stress a reasonable assumption in all but the severest droughts in ash dominated forests however in this study a severe prolonged drought was experienced in the latter part of the record justifying inclusion of a water stress function for ash forest moreover the study catchments contain significant stands of msef in which aet is more likely to be modulated by water availability for all three catchments the bclr model was calibrated to annual streamflow while the seasonal models mav 2s and abcf were calibrated to seasonal streamflow furthermore the o shannassy catchment 132 km2 provides an unprecedented opportunity to calibrate the streamflow models to 89 years of pre disturbance streamflow data prior to the 2009 wildfire to quantify changes in streamflow post disturbance the 2009 wildfire burnt 85 of the catchment comprising 54 km2 of old growth ash forest 21 km2 of which experienced stand replacing severe crown scorch we calibrate the abcf model with pre 2009 data and apply the calibrated model to the post 2009 time series by simulating the post 2009 forest as an undisturbed mature aged forest we can estimate actual vegetation induced changes in streamflow using the modelled residual values 6 results 6 1 spatial monthly rainfall model 6 1 1 post 1978 rainfall estimates table 1 describes the regressions used to extrapolate rainfall across the catchments and compares their performance with the modelling approach adopted by jaskierniak et al 2016 it shows that the use of topographic variables within buffers as predictor variables substantially improves upon the skill of regression relationships that only use the geographic coordinates this was the case for all months but the strength of the relationships varied from month to month with weakest regressions in the drier summer months table 1 shows that the most predictive variables were the mean and standard deviation of elevation within 3000 m and 6000 m radial buffers for wetter and drier months respectively the mean and standard deviation of net radiation also performed well during the wetter months using a 100 m grid cell resolution rainfall estimates were interpolated using the explanatory variables in table 1 and the nn method which restricted the interpolation to the convex hull of each month s available rainfall data missing monthly rainfall estimates were most evident along the ridge line of the great dividing range in particular in the thomson catchment with a total of 444 months representing the 38 year long time series of nn surfaces 90 and 95 of the grid cells had less than 13 and 148 missing monthly values respectively a complete spatial time series of monthly rainfall estimates between 1978 and 2015 was generated by filling in na values with a regression procedure involving data from the nearest grid cell with rainfall estimate for the corresponding month with na values fig 2 shows the mean annual rainfall between 1978 and 2015 across all catchments to demonstrate the close association of forest type fig 1 with mean annual rainfall fig 2 table 2 provides a summary of species distribution relative to rainfall 6 1 2 pre 1978 rainfall estimates for pre 1978 rainfall mapping the spatially distributed post 1978 rainfall estimates were coupled with the most predictive set of base stations from the sparse pre 1978 rainfall dataset from the results fig 3 uses mean rainfall estimates for each of the 143 000 grid cells across the catchments to show a strong relationship r2 0 96 between estimated mean annual rainfall pre 1978 and post 1978 as well as a decrease in mean annual rainfall post 1978 compared to pre 1978 estimates 6 2 improving sapwood area estimates with plot level st data fig 4 shows the difference in stp estimates using the method applied in benyon et al 2015 against the annulus methodology presented here it is evident that the original curvilinear relationship has a negative bias between 1 and 12 mean of 5 we applied the revised st n relationship to estimate st across the experimental catchments which in turn was used in eq 3 to estimate sa the revised sa estimates across the experimental catchments of benyon et al 2015 resulted in the following empirical relationship between catchment mean aet and catchment sa 14 aet 89 5 s a 462 2 r 2 0 87 which was then used to estimate aet across the three large water supply catchments in this study the estimate of n in eq 5 involved manually locating 11 573 old growth trees across 588 ha of nearmap imagery which represented an n of 19 7 trees ha 1 6 3 top down model of seasonal streamflow 6 3 1 seasonal model performance table 3 presents fitted parameters and annual and seasonal goodness of fit statistics for the two seasonal and one annual time step models for the seasonal models abcf and mav 2s the seasonal streamflow was aggregated to annual values to compute annual goodness of fit statistics two sets of results are presented for abcf in the first the rainfall multiplier θ 6 is set to 1 while in the second it is calibrated along with the other parameters table 3 shows that the annual nse statistics for the abcf model 0 74 0 88 are superior to the bclr values 0 68 0 75 table 3 also shows that the annual nse statistics for mav 2s and bclr are very similar with mav 2s having an annual nse 0 01 0 02 better than bclr the primary benefit of mav 2s over bclr is that it offers seasonal resolution of streamflow however table 3 shows that abcf 0 85 0 91 has consistently better seasonal nse statistics than mav 2s with the seasonal nse being consistently 0 05 to 0 08 better this is a modest but not insignificant improvement which highlights the advantage of using a storage based model over a model that relies on lagged rainfall 6 3 2 consistency of parameters models that exhibit regional consistency of parameters are candidates for applications in ungauged catchments this section compares the model parameter for the three study catchments the bclr run off carry over parameter θ1 for upper yarra o shannassy and thomson suggests that streamflow at year t is made up of 78 77 and 81 of rainfall from year t respectively and the rest from year t 1 the rainfall modelling procedure also requires negligible scaling as pre 1978 rainfall was multiplied by θ2 values of 0 98 0 99 and 0 95 and post 1978 rainfall was multiplied by θ3 values of 1 03 1 04 and 0 97 respectively resulting in an average of 0 97 and 1 01 for the two multipliers respectively the abcf parameters exhibit less regional consistency than bclr the quickflow parameter θ 1 ranges from 0 15 to 0 18 while the slowflow parameter θ 3 ranges from 0 46 to 0 60 the water stress parameters θ 4 and θ 5 are very similar for upper yarra and thomson but are noticeably greater for o shannassy which is wettest of the three catchments 6 3 3 persistence in annual streamflow residuals jaskierniak et al 2016 found that the bclr model consistently underestimated streamflow during a prolonged drought starting in the mid 1990s in the maroondah catchments this was identified as a potential shortcoming in fig 5 three five and ten year moving averages of annual streamflow residuals are presented for the upper yarra o shannassy and thomson catchments for the bclr mav 2s and abcf models to show no systematic persistence in residuals between catchments 6 3 4 post fire streamflow analysis in o shannassy for the 2009 wildfire disturbance across o shannassy catchment fig 6 shows a the time series of precipitation and b streamflow residual values in the first three years post disturbance the streamflow residuals averaged 198 mm yr 1 this is more than twice the pre fire standard deviation of the streamflow residuals 79 2 mm yr 1 the increase in post disturbance streamflow for the first three years was followed by a reduction in streamflow in the last two years of records as the residuals dropped to an average of 31 mm yr 1 which is well within the pre fire spread the precipitation time series in fig 6 a shows the magnitude of the millennial drought during the 13 years prior to the 2009 wildfire the downward trending annual precipitation over the three decades prior to 2009 emphasises the importance of calibrating the abcf model to 89 years of pre disturbance streamflow data before applying the calibrated abcf model to post 2009 time series 7 discussion 7 1 spatial monthly rainfall model 7 1 1 post 1978 rainfall estimates table 1 shows improved regressions in the rainfall model which are critical for hydrological modelling in remote regions by reducing the magnitude of catchment rainfall errors it is more likely that hydrological models of the study catchments will have higher skill and consistency comparing figs 1 and 2 shows that msef are located in the driest parts of the catchments while ash species e delegatensis and e nitens are located in the wettest regions and e regnans is most commonly found in the middle range of the rainfall distribution using spatially distributed species specific information for msef types table 2 provides a more detailed species distribution relative to rainfall the close association of forest type with mean annual rainfall suggests that variability in water availability across the landscape will influence the forest structure which comprises of ecohydrological properties that regulate forest water use 7 1 2 pre 1978 rainfall estimates in fig 3 the relationship between estimated mean annual rainfall pre and post 1978 suggests that regions with 1000 1500 and 2000 mm yr 1 of pre 1978 rainfall experience a reduced rainfall of 63 121 and 180 mm yr 1 post 1978 this suggests that regions with highest rainfall have experienced the greatest reduction in rainfall over recent decades it is important to be aware of the reduction in rainfall since 1978 as this may have some bearing on the performance of rainfall runoff models which were calibrated to the full record on the assumption that catchment behaviour did not change other than that accounted for by changes to forest structure 7 2 improving sapwood area estimates a major challenge in developing a top down model is to parsimoniously conceptualise an appropriate model structure that allows for physical interpretation of the calibrated results central to our deterministic conceptual model is the representation of forest growth to estimate spatiotemporal sa recognising that st of larger trees contributes more to plot sa than smaller trees with smaller circumference we used eq 7 to improve the plot level st n relationship shown in fig 4 improvements to the physical representation of st in the model framework aims to improve the physical interpretation of the calibrated model parameters such that the calibrated parameters values are more consistent between catchments in order to allow for estimation of streamflow in ungauged catchments the pgp used in this study were established for forest inventory purposes associated with the timber resource and therefore lacked representation of data in very young and mature forests for this reason the forest growth trajectory in mature forests needed improvement using remotely sensed methods for quantifying n which resulted in n of 19 7 trees ha 1 compared to 25 trees ha 1 assumed in jaskierniak et al 2016 this substantial change in n had a negligible influence on streamflow estimates in the case of upper yarra and thomson catchments the area of mature forest was negligible as both catchments experienced stand replacing regeneration across the great majority of ash forest after the 1939 wildfire in the case of the predominantly mature forested catchment o shannassy the stocking density n was largely equal to n throughout the record as a result changing n produced a constant change in aet because the precipitation scalar parameter θ 6 can compensate for this change in aet simulated streamflow does not materially change thus the benefit of improved sa estimates is seen in this case to come from more consistency in the abcf model parameters a critical requirement for application to ungauged catchments striving for an accurate representation of sa is central to the present modelling framework as sa is the emergent property used to explain aet variability across the landscape while we have made improvements we are mindful of shortcomings in the representation of n and ba in young ash forest the upper yarra and thomson catchments experienced stand replacing regeneration across the great majority of ash forest after the 1939 wildfire in fig 5 the negative residual values at the time of this disturbance data off scale provided with values suggest that the quantification of sa in younger forest may be poorly represented the over estimation of streamflow during this period may be associated with underestimation of aet due to the rate of sa growth in the first few years of regeneration the use of pgps with no empirical data representing n and ba for the first decade of growth underscores a need to represent this age class with forest inventory data 7 3 top down models of seasonal streamflow 7 3 1 seasonal model performance the improved fit of the seasonal abcf model 0 85 0 91 is largely attributed to the use of the seasonal time steps which account for the strong seasonality of rainfall and streamflow to a lesser extent the improved fit is also due to the use of an increased number of parameters the abcf model has three more parameters than bclr however one of these θ 2 is consistently zero indicating the fraction of catchment generated quick flow does not depend on storage moreover the goodness of fit statistics are insensitive to two significant figures to whether the rainfall multiplier θ 6 is set to 1 or calibrated hence abcf has effectively only one more parameter than bclr fiering 1967 showed that the abc conceptual storage model could be re expressed in terms of lagged rainfall and aet the inclusion of lagged aet and more lagged rainfall would most likely have improved the seasonal nse of mav 2s however that would run counter to our quest for parsimony we conclude that the abcf model seasonal nse 0 85 0 91 is preferred to mav 2s seasonal nse 0 79 0 82 having substantially better performance with a similar number of parameters 7 3 2 consistency of parameters the bclr run off carry over parameter θ1 in table 3 has values comparable with jaskierniak et al 2016 who reported runoff carry over parameter values of 0 78 0 76 and 0 82 for watts graceburn and coranderrk respectively resulting in an average of 0 78 for the six catchments it is concluded that the runoff carry over parameter exhibits strong regional consistency regional consistency is also evident with the rainfall scalar parameter given catchment rainfall was estimated from 127 rain gauges over 1 423 km2 the bclr rainfall bias corrections parameter θ2 and θ3 in table 3 are relatively small 0 95 to 1 04 evidently the bclr model can provide reasonable streamflow estimates in ungauged catchments using a top down framework consisting of a forest growth model rainfall model sa function and one regional runoff carry over parameter value of 0 78 the abcf model parameters exhibited less regional consistency than the bclr parameters the range of the quickflow parameter θ 1 was 0 152 to 0 185 while for the slowflow parameter θ 3 it was 0 455 to 0 602 for the water stress parameters θ 4 and θ 5 the values for upper yarra and thomson were very similar in contrast the values for o shannassy are markedly higher these differences are consistent with the fact that upper yarra and thomson have lower rainfall than o shannassy and significant msef compared to o shannassy which is dominated ash forest while this variation in parameters is not large this nonetheless suggests the need for model improvements before abcf can be applied in ungauged catchments it is important to strive for a parsimonious model structure when introducing an extra level of model complexity to explain the parameter variability for this reason an improved representation of spatiotemporal sa for all forest types and age classes is paramount in order to improve the physical interpretation of the abcf parameters for applications in ungauged catchments 7 3 3 persistence in annual streamflow residuals the correlation of catchment annual rainfall shows that the two catchments furthest apart o shannassy and thomson are less correlated 0 91 than the other two contiguous pairs of catchments 0 96 with such strong correlations all catchments would experience extreme drought periods and periods of high rainfall in unison and if streamflow residuals were associated with periods of prolonged droughts there should be a strong correlation of residuals during periods of prolonged drought fig 5 shows little consistency in the residual patterns between catchments with the three models exhibiting a more consistent pattern of residuals for a given catchment for example o shannassy upper yarra and thomson had residuals with three and five year moving averages that were respectively more positive neutral and negative during drought period 1998 to 2008 this suggests that the persistence in residuals is probably not due to poor representation of aet during prolonged droughts but rather more likely to be associated with error in the catchment specific rainfall field error in the catchment specific rainfall field is likely to vary depending on the method used to estimate rainfall we compare jaskierniak et al 2016 estimates of annual rainfall for coranderrk graceburn and watts catchments with rainfall estimates for the same catchments using the rainfall modelling method presented in this study fig 7 applying least squares regression for a comparison of the two methods results in r2 of 0 95 0 95 and 0 97 and rmse of 113 70 and 83 mm yr 1 respectively the magnitude of these residuals is similar to the streamflow residuals in fig 5 and table 3 suggesting that the persistence in streamflow residuals may be partially attributed to error in rainfall estimates 7 3 4 post fire streamflow analysis in o shannassy presently there is conflicting evidence on the immediate streamflow response to wildfire in e regnans forest during the first decade after disturbances watson et al 2001 kuczera 1987 kuczera 1987 shows no changes in expected streamflow for the first two years post 1939 wildfire followed by reduced streamflow thereafter whereas watson et al 2001 show in experimental catchments an increase in streamflow that persisted for up to several years before a subsequent decrease in streamflow kuczera 1987 used between seven and 12 years of pre disturbance data to calibrate his model whereas watson et al 2001 used between three and 12 years of data creating uncertainty in post disturbance streamflow response for o shannassy catchment we calibrate the streamflow model with 89 years of pre disturbance streamflow data with five years of post disturbance data our results suggest a small increase in streamflow for the first three years followed by reductions in streamflow in the last two years to levels well within the pre fire spread 7 3 5 generality of the model framework the results have illustrated application of the model framework to a 915 km2 forested region located north east of melbourne australia however the framework itself is considered to be general and applicable to forested catchments in other parts of the world the core hypothesis underpinning the framework is ecological optimality which is that a forest at a particular location develops its sa to equilibrate with the pet and precipitation at that location in order to maximize its biomass production during periods when water is not limiting to apply this framework requires a forest specific relationship between annual pet and sa as well as forest inventory data consisting of ba and n estimates to represent the spatiotemporal changes in forest growth the relationship between pet and sa may be either derived using sap flow sensors to estimate plot scale water use nolan et al 2014 or calibrated to experimental catchments with known sa benyon et al 2015 importantly forest inventory modelling is progressing rapidly with aerial lidar unmanned aerial system uas lidar wallace et al 2012 and global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi using satellite based high resolution laser ranging of earth s forests qi and dubayah 2016 all of which increase the transferability of our framework to other catchments 8 conclusion we present a new top down streamflow modelling framework that uses spatiotemporal sa estimates to represent the emergent forest structural property that equilibrates with pet and introduce a soil storage threshold to predict aet when available water reduces aet below pet the top down approach provides a conceptual framework for applications in both water unlimited and water limited forests and was evaluated using a 915 km2 study site consisting of three catchments the physical interpretation of the calibrated results requires an accurate representation of spatiotemporal sa which was improved with i a more accurate procedure for estimating stand st and hence sa ii and a remotely sensed measure of n to correct the temporal evolution of n a monthly rainfall interpolation procedure was developed over all 1423 km2 of melbourne s forested water supply catchments to optimise the use of the limited number of rain gauges available across a study site characterized with remoteness and high relief we show that the use of terrain information substantially improved upon the accuracy of methods using only geographic coordinates the abcf model produced seasonal nse statistics in the range 0 85 to 0 91 of significance the annual nse statistics for the abcf model 0 74 0 88 are superior to the previously developed annual bclr model 0 68 0 75 highlighting the value of representing the strong seasonality of rainfall and streamflow the bclr model parameters were found to exhibit strong consistency across 6 large water supply catchments this demonstrates the viability of the top down modelling framework to estimate annual streamflow in ungauged catchments however the parameters of the seasonal abcf model showed greater variation across the catchments highlighting the need for further work to achieve stronger regional consistency of parameters forest structural properties are largely influenced by terrain soil climate and disturbance history which in turn also influence aet we demonstrate the use of lidar data and historically measured forest inventory data to characterise the eco hydrological properties of forested catchment with sa estimates a surrogate for aet estimates across the landscape when coupled with the seasonal abcf model the top down framework has significant potential for water supply planning and drought security in ungauged forested catchments with sparse soil and climate data acknowledgement the melbourne water corporation and the australian government funded this study as part of an australian research council arc linkage grant lp160100597 titled remote sensed forest water use in space and time we would also like to thank vicforests for providing the permanent growth plots data used in the forest growth modelling 
6820,forest growth dynamics affect streamflow with changes in actual evapotranspiration aet during forest regeneration using a top down model approach we present a seasonal forest hydrology model that estimates streamflow in forested catchments containing sparse soil and climate data across a 1423 km2 remote study area a rainfall interpolation procedure using available rainfall data and information on terrain was integrated into a new seasonal streamflow model called abcf which uses catchment sapwood area sa as the emergent property that equilibrates with potential evapotranspiration pet and a soil storage threshold that reduces aet below pet when soil water is limiting we produce seasonal estimates of streamflow with nash sutcliffe efficiencies of 0 85 0 87 and 0 91 for three major catchments within the study area a fundamental feature of the top down model approach is the use of lidar data and forest inventory data to model forest structural properties that relate strongly with sa building on our previous work with this modelling framework our representation of eco hydrological properties of the forest has been refined with a more accurate procedure for estimating stand mean sapwood thickness and hence sa and a remotely sensed tree stocking density n of old growth forests to correct the temporal evolution of n as a means to improve sa estimates regional consistency of model parameters shows that the top down modelling framework may be used to estimate streamflow in ungauged catchments using a forest growth model the seasonal model generalised for both water limited and water unlimited forest conditions has significant potential for application in water supply planning and drought security keywords top down model evapotranspiration forest growth forest inventory forest sapwood area streamflow 1 introduction forest hydrology models that spatially quantify vegetation induced trends in streamflow are useful for regulating water allocations with a changing climate improving water accounting after vegetation disturbance evaluating future scenarios for risk mitigation planning and assessing drought security of forested water supply catchments the development of such models may be guided by a bottom up approach which seeks to integrate processes at small scales up to the scale of interest or by a top down approach that describes hydrological behaviours that emerge at the scale of interest the top down approach may either involve stochastic methods that use statistics to identify model structure and parameter estimates directly from data analysis young 2001 or deterministic conceptual modelling methods that emphasise whole system behaviours of emergent properties inferred from available data milly 1994 across a mountainous forested landscape heterogeneity in actual evapotranspiration aet is attributed to the interaction of geomorphic pedogenic and climatic processes as well as disturbance due to pyrogenic anthropogenic and biotic factors the heterogeneous forest structure that eventuates contains key signatures and features of the spatiotemporal aet across the landscape which may be used in a deterministic conceptual model to predict streamflow in ungauged catchments using light detection and ranging lidar data derived eco hydrological properties of the forest structure may provide surrogate information for aet estimates in order to compensate for the sparse soil climate and disturbance history data across many forested regions of the world sutherland et al 2017 lidar data has advanced forest hydrology

and geomorphologic features useful for run off routing maceyka and hansen 2015 allometric equations relating water conducting sapwood area sa with forest stand characteristics have been generated using lidar derived estimates of canopy area lubczynski et al 2017 stem diameter jaskierniak et al 2015a tree height saito et al 2015 vegetation profile mitchell et al 2012b and forest stocking density jaskierniak et al 2015b although these lidar derived forest structural attributes are useful for upscaling aet from tree to catchment level few studies have used lidar data to derive ecohydrological properties across a catchment for predicting streamflow see mitchell et al 2012a and jaskierniak et al 2016 motivated by the rich source of catchment level information on forest dynamics that influence aet in eucalyptus regnans ash forest benyon et al 2015 predicted mean annual streamflow using a relationship between catchment mean sa and mean annual aet derived from experimental catchments jaskierniak et al 2016 applied the sa aet relationship to larger water supply catchments to predict annual streamflow with spatiotemporal sa maps derived from forest inventory data lidar data and forest growth models the annual time steps limited the model s usefulness in water supply planning for drought security as regulation of water allocations and evaluation of future scenarios for risk mitigation are best conducted using seasonal and monthly time steps the ash forest studies in benyon et al 2015 and jaskierniak et al 2016 were undertaken in forested catchments with typically high rainfall and deep soil water storage conditions where average aet may be assumed to equal average potential evapotranspiration pet jaskierniak et al 2016 showed that during severe drought conditions when water availability was reduced a persistent under prediction of annual streamflow occurred the sa aet relationship lacked representation of eco hydrological processes that reduce aet when water becomes limited by climatic and pedologic conditions to address this shortcoming we adopt the deterministic conceptual modelling method that uses spatiotemporal sa estimates to represent the emergent forest structural property that equilibrates with pet and introduce a soil storage threshold to predict aet when available water reduces aet below pet the new top down approach provides a conceptual framework for applications in water limited forests a major impediment to the application of any hydrological model in large mountainous forested catchments is that they are often located in remote regions with steep orography rain shadow effects and sparse rain station coverage this is the case at our study site which includes melbourne s three largest water supply catchments o shannassy upper yarra and thomson totalling 915 km2 with this in mind the development of our seasonal top down deterministic conceptual model has three main objectives the first objective is to develop a spatiotemporal model of monthly rainfall that makes best use of available rain station and terrain information the second objective is to improve the forest growth model s quantification of sa so that the hydrological model more accurately represents the eco hydrological processes the third objective is to generalise the modelling framework for applications in water limited forests whilst extending our modelling approach to seasonal time steps in a parsimonious manner consistent with the top down philosophy apart from making the updated model operationally useful deeper insight at the large scale is expected as to the effect of drought stress on aet we investigate whether the seasonal model addresses the consistent streamflow underestimation during prolonged drought in jaskierniak et al 2016 for operational purposes in ungauged catchments we investigate whether the model parameters exhibit regional consistency these objectives provide structural sub headings in the method results and discussion sections 2 theoretical background this section provides a summary of earlier work using the top down approach using forest sapwood area to infer aet it provides the context for the new developments presented in this study in its simplest form the model structure assumes that annual changes in catchment water yield are largely attributed to annual rainfall variability and changes in eco hydrological processes that influence aet defined as the sum of transpiration interception and evaporation from the forest with this approach jaskierniak et al 2016 constructed a bias corrected lagged rainfall bclr model to simulate streamflow at annual time steps 1 q t θ 1 p t 1 θ 1 p t 1 a e t t p t θ 2 p t obs where q t is simulated catchment annual streamflow mm yr 1 for water year t ae t t is the catchment annual aet mm yr 1 for water year t p t is the catchment annual rainfall mm yr 1 for water year t p t obs is the catchment annual rainfall mm yr 1 for water year t estimated from the network of rain gauges θ1 is a runoff lag coefficient and θ2 is a rainfall bias correction to estimate catchment level aet in ash forest benyon et al 2015 developed an empirical relationship between catchment level sa m2 ha 1 and mean annual aet mm yr 1 2 aet m s a c where m and c were empirically estimated as 96 71 and 441 85 mm which involved averaging streamflow rainfall and forest inventory data over one to four years pre and post disturbance for 15 catchments ranging between 4 and 122 ha eq 2 was empirically derived for ash forested catchments which have deep soils and high rainfall as a result the water use by the vegetation is not limited by water availability in all but the most substantial droughts that affect young ash regrowth found at the lower end of the ash rainfall range as observed in the picaninny catchment clear fell logged in 1971 72 bren et al 2010 slip creek catchment the old growth control for picaninnny did not stop flowing even during the driest part of the drought a consequence of this is that annual aet in eq 2 averaged over one to four years is expected to closely match pet our long term hypothesis is that the linear relationship in eq 2 may be generalised to other forest types that may be subject to limited water availability motivated by eagleson s 1982 notion of ecological optimality we hypothesize that a forest at a particular location develops its sa to equilibrate with the pet and precipitation p at that location in order to maximize its biomass production during periods when water is not limiting we consider sa to be a proxy for the hydraulic architecture that transfers water from the soil to the canopy such that it acts as the emergent property that is controlled by pet in contrast the forest responds to shorter term variability in climate and its influence on soil water by regulating aet relative to pet to estimate catchment level sa benyon et al 2015 used catchment level measurements of mean stem basal area ba µ at 1 3 m height m2 and over storey stocking density n to estimate catchment sa as 3 sa st 100 n π 4 b a μ π st 100 4 π n b a where st is mean sapwood thickness calculated as 4 st α 1 n α 2 where α1 and α 2 are parameters empirically derived using sapwood core samples measured within stands with a known stocking density in order to predict streamflow changes due to wildfire and logging in ash forest jaskierniak et al 2016 estimated the catchment annual aet over time by coupling maps of forest age and lidar based maps of basal area ba and stocking density n with temporal evolution models of ba and n the temporal evolution models allow ba and n to be estimated in years when lidar data are not available the temporal evolution models were derived from permanent growth plot pgp data specifically jaskierniak et al 2016 found that the expected stocking density n t of ash for age t at a particular location can be described by 5 n t n n t 1 n exp t 1 β 0 β 1 t 1 exp t β 0 β 1 t where n is the mean stocking density of old growth ash forest and β 0 and β 1 are calibrated parameters furthermore using pgp data wang and hamilton 2002 found that the temporal evolution of the expected ash ba can be described by 6 ba t ba t 1 t 1 t c 1 exp c 2 1 t 1 t c 1 where bat is the basal area at age t and c1 and c2 are calibrated parameters catchment annual aet is estimated as follows 1 a lidar derived map of n and ba is constructed for a particular year tl for which lidar sensing was conducted 2 using a map of forest age at year tl n t 1 and ba t 1 are obtained for each catchment grid cell with t1 being the forest age in year tl 3 temporal evolution models of n and ba are used to project forward and backwards from year tl to estimate annual nt and bat for each catchment grid cell over the regenerating forest period 4 eqs 2 and 3 are then used to estimate the time series of aett at each catchment grid cell jaskierniak et al 2016 used this procedure to generate spatiotemporal estimates of aett across three forested catchments ranging between 18 and 100 km2 in the maroondah water catchment system and then applied this to the bclr model in eq 1 the resulting top down model required calibration of one parameter to account for runoff carry over into the following year and two parameters to account for bias in estimated catchment rainfall it produced nash sutcliffe efficiency nse statistics between 0 7 and 0 79 the streamflow modelling framework described in this study advances benyon et al 2015 and jaskierniak et al 2016 with the following developments i section 5 2 1 refines the relationship between mean sapwood thickness st and stocking density in eq 4 for improved stand sa estimates ii section 5 2 2 empirically derives stocking density in old growth forest n in eq 5 to more accurately characterize the rate of decay in n during regeneration and iii section 5 3 replaces the annual model in eq 1 with a seasonal conceptual model that uses sa as the emergent property that equilibrates with pet and a soil storage threshold that reduces aet below pet for water limited conditions 3 site description in south eastern australia high rainfall forested catchments supply the bulk of water for large cities and irrigation in rural regions north east catchment management authority 2004 vertessy et al 2001 these catchments are covered by ash type ash and mixed species eucalypt forests msef ash forests are dominated by e regnans e delegatensis and e nitens which are obligate seeders that rely on stand replacing wildfires to regenerate in recent years ash forests have been disturbed by wildfire and logging on an unprecedented scale stimulating large scale changes in forest structure that will have substantial impact on future water yields benyon and lane 2012 haywood 2009 in contrast msef are facultative resprouters that recover from crown scorch wildfire by resprouting from epicormic buds and lignotubers the post wildfire forest dynamics of msef result in recovery of aet to pre disturbance levels within a few to several years following disturbance nolan et al 2015 fig 1 shows the study site is located in melbourne s water supply catchments on the south side of the great dividing range in south eastern victoria australia o shannassy upper yarra and thomson represent the three catchments used to model streamflow in this study their areas total 915 km2 or 64 of the study site whereas rainfall modelling is undertaken across all 16 catchments 1423 km2 of the study site also shown in fig 1 are the three maroondah system catchments coranderrk graceburn and watts which were used in jaskierniak et al 2016 and are used here to evaluate the monthly rainfall model the terrain is steep and deeply incised across the site with elevation across a 1 m resolution digital elevation model dem ranging between 200 m and 1570 m at o shannassy and thomson catchment

2009 wildfire burnt 85 of the o shannassy catchment 4 data 4 1 hydrology data the o shannassy upper yarra and thomson catchments were gauged in 1901 1913 and 1913 respectively from these records monthly streamflow time series were extracted the mean and standard deviation of each catchment s annual streamflow is 730 226 mm yr 1 455 195 mm yr 1 and 527 173 mm yr 1 respectively the rainfall model is developed across all 16 melbourne water supply catchments total area 1 423 km2 using 127 rainfall stations located within 15 km of the catchment boundaries fig 2 shows the distribution of the rainfall stations the stations consisted of a mixture of tipping bucket gauge providing daily rainfall and bulk gauges visited at random time intervals rainfall data was processed from 1920 prior to that year the coverage of rain stations was judged to be inadequate modelled rainfall across watts graceburn and coranderrk catchments from jaskierniak et al 2016 was also used for comparison with present study monthly pet estimates were obtained from the australian water availability project awap which used the priestley taylor method raupach et al 2011 2009 the awap pet estimates with a spatial resolution of 5 km were used to determine the expected monthly fraction of annual pet over each catchment 4 2 forest inventory data the forest inventory data was obtained from permanent growth plots pgps consisting of 160 mono specific even aged ash stands distributed across victoria each plot site was measured for ba and n between 4 and 19 times at intervals varying from 1 to 6 years the plots were rectangular in shape varying from 0 04 to 0 45 ha the lidar data was captured in 2008 and consisted of approximately 2 pulses per square meter refer to jaskierniak et al 2016 for the flight details and sensor configuration of the data acquisition flights forest age data at the time of lidar capture was compiled using logging history and fire disturbance data tree detection within old growth forests involved the use of nearmap imagery with 8 cm cell resolution the images were captured in april 2011 approx two years after the 2009 wildfire and fig 1 shows the location of the site used 5 methods 5 1 spatial monthly rainfall model a major impediment to the application of any hydrological model in the study catchments is the fact that these catchments are located in remote regions with steep orography rain shadow effects and limited rainfall station coverage this section describes the development of a spatial monthly rainfall model that improves upon the model described in jaskierniak et al 2016 by making better use of terrain information as well as using all available rainfall station data we optimise the use of available rainfall data with a modelling framework that uses the post 1978 and pre 1978 time series data separately due to the diminishing density of gauges available as we move back in time in view of the complexity of approach taken the main steps in monthly rainfall interpolation procedure are summarized before a fuller elaboration in the subsequent sections 1 fill in missing data in the tipping bucket gauge record using nearby gauges and compile monthly rainfall 2 disaggregate bulk gauge records into daily values and compile monthly rainfall 3 identify best predictor of average monthly rainfall from a set of explanatory variables including position buffered topographic indices and net radiation 4 for post 1978 data interpolate monthly rainfall at each catchment 100 m grid cell using the following steps a standardise observed monthly rainfall data to a reference point in the explanatory variable space b use the nearest neighbour algorithm to interpolate standardised rainfall at each catchment grid cell c map the interpolated standardised rainfall to its correct location in the explanatory variable space 5 for pre 1978 rainfall use a regression based on the three most predictive gauges identified from post 1978 data to estimate monthly rainfall at each grid cell 5 1 1 fill in of missing data values prior to developing the spatial rainfall model missing or na data was processed with the objective of creating a suitably accurate monthly record missing data was either filled in if correlations to other gauges were adequate or left as is for tipping bucket gauges fill ins of na values involved least squares regression to relate each subject gauge with each available gauge within 20 km of the subject gauge and an elevation 500 m below or above the subject gauge the strength of the regressions was ordered from largest to smallest using coefficient of determination r2 and the gauge with the strongest relationship was used to fill in missing data using the following set of rules the number of missing measurement days in a calendar month determined the minimum r2 needed for a fill in to occur the rationale for this approach is that with fewer na values in a month a lower r2 can be tolerated to fill in a month s data with this in mind months with more than 25 missing measurements nas required a gauge that related to the subject gauge with r2 greater than 0 95 months with 20 to 25 nas required an r2 greater than 0 85 months with 10 to 20 nas required an r2 greater than 0 75 and months with 0 to 10 nas required an r2 greater than 0 70 all other nas remained unchanged bulk rain gauges had readings taken at random days and represent rainfall since the last measurement the reading recorded at the bulk gauge had to be disaggregated into daily estimates before aggregating the estimates into calendar months using the same fill in of nas procedure outlined for the tipping bucket gauges to disaggregate the bulk gauges all tipping bucket gauges within 20 km of the subject bulk gauge and with an elevation 500 m below or above the bulk gauge were identified the daily values from the tipping bucket gauge records were aggregated using the time periods between readings of the subject bulk gauge the aggregated tipping bucket gauge with the highest r2 regression was then used to disaggregate bulk gauge readings into daily rainfall values 5 1 2 predictor variables to explain spatial variability in rainfall using all data for each calendar month a relationship was generated between the monthly rainfall and a set of explanatory variables jaskierniak et al 2016 used the geographic coordinates and elevation of each gauge to predict the variability in monthly rainfall across the maroondah catchments 153 km2 the substantially more complex terrain across all melbourne water catchments 1423 km2 required further model development to account for steep orography and rain shadow effects as well as using each gauge s geographic coordinates and elevation additional explanatory variables included mean monthly net radiation rn estimated using nyman et al 2014 and a range of buffered topographic indices the nyman et al 2014 method for estimating rn incorporates topographic effects on net radiation in complex terrain to generate topographic indices at each gauge location multiple circular buffers with radius ranging from 0 5 km to 10 km in 0 5 km increments were generated around each gauge the whole study site was gridded using 50 m grid cells and a one metre dem was used to determine each grid cell s mean elevation slope and euclidean distance to the main ridgelines along the great dividing range the 50 m grid cell s mean of each corresponding topographic index was then used to obtain the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding index for each buffered region at each rain gauge location linear regression was used to identify the most predictive explanatory variables for each calendar month the selected buffered explanatory variables were then calculated for all 100 m grid cells across the catchments 5 1 3 interpolating monthly rainfall between gauges prior to 1978 the spatiotemporal distribution of the rainfall time series was not well represented across the great majority of the catchments langford and o shaughnessy 1979 1977 fig 2 shows the number of months of data available at each gauge forest hydrology research in the melbourne water catchments was up scaled in the 1970 s with 63 rain gauges established in the decade preceding 1978 and further 26 rain gauges after 1978 this motivated the use of two different procedures for interpolating monthly rainfall across the catchment because the post 1978 record had the highest density of gauges with almost continuous time series the main model development focussed on this period because the pre 1978 record has a declining gauge coverage as we move back in time a different and less accurate procedure informed by the analysis of the post 1978 analysis was used 5 1 4 post 1978 rainfall estimates post 1978 the natural neighbour nn method was used to spatially interpolate rainfall esri 2011 firstly the predictor variables described in section 5 1 2 were used to standardise the rainfall data in order to remove the influence of location topography and net radiation at each gauge site the standardisation uses the regression relationship to transfer the observed monthly rainfall at a particular gauge to a reference point in the explanatory variable space in other words the regression relationship is used to estimate the rainfall that would be expected if the gauge were relocated to the reference point in the predictor space the objective of the standardisation is to create a standardised rainfall values whose expected value is constant these standardised values were used to generate surfaces with the nn method which uses voronoi tessellation to find the closest subset of station locations to an interpolated location and assigns weights based on proportionate areas to interpolate the values esri 2011 the resulting surface of standardised rainfall was then mapped back from the reference point to the actual coordinates in the predictor space to reinstate the influence of location net radiation and topography on local rainfall this yielded the final monthly rainfall field for each grid cell in the catchment noting that the nn interpolation is restricted to the convex hull of each month s rain gauge locations rainfall could not be interpolated for some months at a small fraction of grid cells in the catchments for these cells we estimate missing monthly rainfall using a linear regression between the cell with the missing estimate and the nearest cell with a continuous time series of rainfall estimates these regressions exploited the fact that cells lying outside the convex hull in some months were inside the convex hull in other months 5 1 5 pre 1978 rainfall estimates the interpolation of rainfall between 1920 and 1978 was considerably more complex because of the changing availability of gauges for each pre 1978 month at each grid cell the three most predictive gauges were identified from up to a maximum of 20 of the nearest available gauges and up to 18 available gauges with the longest time series the 38 gauges were required to have at least 120 months of post 1978 data to make sure the regression against all spatially distributed grid cells was adequate for interpolation to find the most predictive combination of three gauges from a possible 38 gauges required evaluating up to 8436 combinations the r2 was evaluated for each combination of three gauges using the post 1978 estimates for the grid cell and the post 1978 gauge records considering neighbouring grids are likely to have similar gauges representing the highest r2 a two step procedure was used involving primary and secondary grid cells primary cells correspond to every 10th grid cell in a moving window scan that iterated through each row from east to west starting from the southernmost row secondary cells are represented by the remaining cells for each primary cell all combinations of available gauges were evaluated for each month of record for each secondary cell the gauges selected for the last fully evaluated primary cell were used exploiting the high correlation between nearby cells produced a substantial computational saving for cases where the distance between the secondary grid cell and the last fully evaluated primary grid cell was greater than 1 km all combinations of gauges were fully evaluated it is important to note that this procedure was repeated for each pre 1978 month as missing data values meant different predictive gauges were used from month to month 5 2 improved estimation of sapwood area in ash forest the study catchments consist of two distinct forest types ash forest and msef different approaches were used to estimate mean annual aet in each forest type in ash forest eq 2 is used to estimate mean annual aet which is expected to closely match pet except in drought this relies on estimates of catchment level sa m2 ha 1 which is the subject of this section for ash forests originating from the 1939 wildfire which is the dominant ash age class across the study site we used lidar captured in 2008 to calculate ba and n estimates in 2008 in order to estimate sa for each 100 m grid cell in 2008 estimates of ba and n in other years are obtained using eqs 5 and 6 for ash regrowth after logging disturbance forest inventory data was not made available to accurately quantify forest conditions pre and post harvest we therefore assumed that the evolution of ba and n after logging started in the harvest year and followed the trajectories described by eqs 5 and 6 using age specific mean ba and n from all cells with 1939 regrowth ash forest in msef there is insufficient data to derive the equivalent eqs 2 3 5 and 6 fortunately however we can use the approximation described by jaskierniak et al 2016 which exploited the fact there was little logging in the msef within the study catchments and that the only substantial disturbance was due to wildfire considering msef is typically observed to have a rapid recovery after wildfire nolan et al 2015 the annual aet is assumed to be minimally affected following wildfire disturbance hence aet in msef was assumed to be catchment mean annual p minus q using the time series prior to the 1939 wildfire ignoring post 1939 data due to stand replacing ash confounding the assumption addressing the gaps in msef is beyond the scope of this study and the focus of the remainder of this section is on improving sa estimates in ash forest 5 2 1 stand sapwood thickness sapwood area estimates for catchment grid cells are influenced by the methodology used to estimate a forest stand s st for the purpose of calculating st in eq 4 benyon et al 2015 estimated st for each plot stp by measuring the mean st for each tree st t and then averaging over the trees within the plot noting that a large tree with large circumference contributes more to plot sa than a smaller tree with smaller circumference a more accurate estimate of stp assuming the trunk is approximately circular is 7 s t p s a p c p i π 4 d t i 2 d t i 2 s t t i 2 i π d t i s t t i i d t i s t i i d t i where sap is plot sapwood area cp is total tree circumference within the plot dt is tree diameter under bark and the index i refers to the ith tree in the plot for the plot level st data used in benyon et al 2015 we recalculated the st p estimates using eq 7 and then revised the relationship between plot level stocking density n and st p using eq 4 we recalculated plot level sa estimates using the revised st estimates in eq 3 and then revised the aet sa relationship in eq 2 the revised n stp relationship was then used to estimate st for each catchment grid cell using grid cell estimates of n the grid cell sa and aet estimates were then obtained using eq 3 and the revised relationship in eq 2 respectively 5 2 2 old growth stocking density the temporal distribution of sa is dependent on the temporal evolution of n which requires an accurate estimate of old growth stocking density n in eq 5 jaskierniak et al 2016 assumed that n was 25 trees ha 1 using 8 circular plots from benyon and lane 2012 here we revisit this estimate using a larger sample of old growth ash forest in the upper slopes of o shannassy catchment shown in fig 1 the following tree detection procedure was undertaken across the site shown in fig 1 using nearmap imagery with 8 cm cell resolution and a lidar derived canopy height model chm with 1 m cell resolution we manually located all old growth trees within a 588 ha sample area the nearmap images were collected april 2011 approx two years after the 2009 wildfire making the site suitable for visually identifying tree stems visual assessment of the chm identified old growth tree canopies under circumstances where the stem was absent or difficult to decipher in the nearmap imagery the average number of detected trees per ha was used to estimate n in eq 5 5 3 top down model of seasonal streamflow the revised aet sa relationship in eq 2 provides estimates of mean annual aet in ash forest which is expected to closely match pet because water stress is only likely during the more severe droughts to use eq 2 in a seasonal model awap pet data were used to estimate monthly fractions of annual pet at each grid cell across the catchment and the month specific fraction was multiplied by the yearly aet derived using eq 2 in order to produce a month specific aet the monthly time series data was then aggregated into three distinctly different seasons pre winter dry season with increasing rainfall before the wet season january to march wet season april to august and post winter drying period september to december we present two top down modelling approaches that use the seasonal time step in a parsimonious manner 5 3 1 lagged variable approach the first approach extends the lagged variable approach of bclr to seasonal time steps to avoid proliferation of parameters we experimented with a range of lagged formulations removing variables that did not contribute to improved fit of seasonal streamflow we present what we consider to be the most parsimonious lagged seasonal model which will be referred to as mav 2s 8 q t θ 1 p t θ 2 p t 1 p t 2 1 θ 1 θ 2 p t 3 p t 4 θ 3 1 15 i 1 15 p t i a e t t p t θ 4 p t obs where q t is simulated catchment streamflow mm for season t p t obs is the estimated catchment rainfall mm for season t and θ 4 is a rainfall multiplier to compensate for systematic error in estimated catchment rainfall the model uses three lagged rainfall variables the first two introduce short term memory lagging rainfall over four antecedent seasons while the third introduces long term memory using a moving average of rainfall over the previous 15 seasons the lag parameters θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are independent of season to ensure the model remains parsimonious 5 3 2 conceptual storage approach the second approach deals more explicitly with catchment memory by using a conceptual store and explicitly accounts for water stress which as noted is only expected in the severe droughts the store accounts for catchment memory arising from rainfall prior to the current season e g a low store reflects a prolonged dry spell and also provides a simple framework for enabling threshold behaviours in catchment fluxes to maintain parsimony the second approach adopts the abc model vogel and sankarasubramanian 2003 fiering 1967 as the template and uses features from the conceptual two store soil dryness index sdi model kuczera et al 1993 which has been applied to melbourne s catchments with good results this model will be referred to as the abcf model given the aggregation over space and time the abcf model focuses on describing the emergent hydrological properties at the large catchment scales rather than on the hydrologic processes known to occur at fine time and space scales at the heart of the abcf model a conceptual unconstrained store is used to model the catchment water balance 9 s t 1 s t p t a e t t q f t s f t q t q f t s f t where s t is the store depth mm at the beginning of the season with time index t p t is the rainfall mm q f t is the quick flow mm s f t is the slow flow mm and ae t t is the actual evapotranspiration mm the fluxes into and out of the store are 1 rainfall 10 p t θ 6 p t obs where p t obs is the rainfall estimated by the spatial model and θ 6 is a rainfall multiplier to compensate for systematic error in estimated rainfall 2 quickflow 11 q f t θ 1 θ 2 s t p t if s t 0 0 otherwise where s t 1 2 s t s t 1 is the average store depth during time t and θ 1 and θ 2 are quickflow parameters the quickflow is functionally similar to that used in the sdi model which assumes quickflow is generated by rainfall falling on a variable saturated area adjacent to streams 3 slowflow 12 s f t θ 3 s t if s t 0 0 otherwise where θ 3 is a slowflow parameter this is functionally similar to slowflow from the sdi groundwater store 4 actual et 13 ae t t pe t t if s t 1 θ 4 pe t t 1 θ 4 s t 1 θ 5 if θ 4 θ 5 s t 1 θ 4 0 otherwise where pe t t is catchment averaged potential evapotranspiration obtained by applying eq 2 to sat estimated at each grid cell in the catchment at time t θ 4 is a store threshold below which water stress leads to a reduction in aet and θ 5 is a stress parameter conceptually representing the difference in the threshold θ 4 and the wilting point of the soil the sdi model assumed that aet was unaffected by water stress a reasonable assumption in all but the severest droughts in ash dominated forests however in this study a severe prolonged drought was experienced in the latter part of the record justifying inclusion of a water stress function for ash forest moreover the study catchments contain significant stands of msef in which aet is more likely to be modulated by water availability for all three catchments the bclr model was calibrated to annual streamflow while the seasonal models mav 2s and abcf were calibrated to seasonal streamflow furthermore the o shannassy catchment 132 km2 provides an unprecedented opportunity to calibrate the streamflow models to 89 years of pre disturbance streamflow data prior to the 2009 wildfire to quantify changes in streamflow post disturbance the 2009 wildfire burnt 85 of the catchment comprising 54 km2 of old growth ash forest 21 km2 of which experienced stand replacing severe crown scorch we calibrate the abcf model with pre 2009 data and apply the calibrated model to the post 2009 time series by simulating the post 2009 forest as an undisturbed mature aged forest we can estimate actual vegetation induced changes in streamflow using the modelled residual values 6 results 6 1 spatial monthly rainfall model 6 1 1 post 1978 rainfall estimates table 1 describes the regressions used to extrapolate rainfall across the catchments and compares their performance with the modelling approach adopted by jaskierniak et al 2016 it shows that the use of topographic variables within buffers as predictor variables substantially improves upon the skill of regression relationships that only use the geographic coordinates this was the case for all months but the strength of the relationships varied from month to month with weakest regressions in the drier summer months table 1 shows that the most predictive variables were the mean and standard deviation of elevation within 3000 m and 6000 m radial buffers for wetter and drier months respectively the mean and standard deviation of net radiation also performed well during the wetter months using a 100 m grid cell resolution rainfall estimates were interpolated using the explanatory variables in table 1 and the nn method which restricted the interpolation to the convex hull of each month s available rainfall data missing monthly rainfall estimates were most evident along the ridge line of the great dividing range in particular in the thomson catchment with a total of 444 months representing the 38 year long time series of nn surfaces 90 and 95 of the grid cells had less than 13 and 148 missing monthly values respectively a complete spatial time series of monthly rainfall estimates between 1978 and 2015 was generated by filling in na values with a regression procedure involving data from the nearest grid cell with rainfall estimate for the corresponding month with na values fig 2 shows the mean annual rainfall between 1978 and 2015 across all catchments to demonstrate the close association of forest type fig 1 with mean annual rainfall fig 2 table 2 provides a summary of species distribution relative to rainfall 6 1 2 pre 1978 rainfall estimates for pre 1978 rainfall mapping the spatially distributed post 1978 rainfall estimates were coupled with the most predictive set of base stations from the sparse pre 1978 rainfall dataset from the results fig 3 uses mean rainfall estimates for each of the 143 000 grid cells across the catchments to show a strong relationship r2 0 96 between estimated mean annual rainfall pre 1978 and post 1978 as well as a decrease in mean annual rainfall post 1978 compared to pre 1978 estimates 6 2 improving sapwood area estimates with plot level st data fig 4 shows the difference in stp estimates using the method applied in benyon et al 2015 against the annulus methodology presented here it is evident that the original curvilinear relationship has a negative bias between 1 and 12 mean of 5 we applied the revised st n relationship to estimate st across the experimental catchments which in turn was used in eq 3 to estimate sa the revised sa estimates across the experimental catchments of benyon et al 2015 resulted in the following empirical relationship between catchment mean aet and catchment sa 14 aet 89 5 s a 462 2 r 2 0 87 which was then used to estimate aet across the three large water supply catchments in this study the estimate of n in eq 5 involved manually locating 11 573 old growth trees across 588 ha of nearmap imagery which represented an n of 19 7 trees ha 1 6 3 top down model of seasonal streamflow 6 3 1 seasonal model performance table 3 presents fitted parameters and annual and seasonal goodness of fit statistics for the two seasonal and one annual time step models for the seasonal models abcf and mav 2s the seasonal streamflow was aggregated to annual values to compute annual goodness of fit statistics two sets of results are presented for abcf in the first the rainfall multiplier θ 6 is set to 1 while in the second it is calibrated along with the other parameters table 3 shows that the annual nse statistics for the abcf model 0 74 0 88 are superior to the bclr values 0 68 0 75 table 3 also shows that the annual nse statistics for mav 2s and bclr are very similar with mav 2s having an annual nse 0 01 0 02 better than bclr the primary benefit of mav 2s over bclr is that it offers seasonal resolution of streamflow however table 3 shows that abcf 0 85 0 91 has consistently better seasonal nse statistics than mav 2s with the seasonal nse being consistently 0 05 to 0 08 better this is a modest but not insignificant improvement which highlights the advantage of using a storage based model over a model that relies on lagged rainfall 6 3 2 consistency of parameters models that exhibit regional consistency of parameters are candidates for applications in ungauged catchments this section compares the model parameter for the three study catchments the bclr run off carry over parameter θ1 for upper yarra o shannassy and thomson suggests that streamflow at year t is made up of 78 77 and 81 of rainfall from year t respectively and the rest from year t 1 the rainfall modelling procedure also requires negligible scaling as pre 1978 rainfall was multiplied by θ2 values of 0 98 0 99 and 0 95 and post 1978 rainfall was multiplied by θ3 values of 1 03 1 04 and 0 97 respectively resulting in an average of 0 97 and 1 01 for the two multipliers respectively the abcf parameters exhibit less regional consistency than bclr the quickflow parameter θ 1 ranges from 0 15 to 0 18 while the slowflow parameter θ 3 ranges from 0 46 to 0 60 the water stress parameters θ 4 and θ 5 are very similar for upper yarra and thomson but are noticeably greater for o shannassy which is wettest of the three catchments 6 3 3 persistence in annual streamflow residuals jaskierniak et al 2016 found that the bclr model consistently underestimated streamflow during a prolonged drought starting in the mid 1990s in the maroondah catchments this was identified as a potential shortcoming in fig 5 three five and ten year moving averages of annual streamflow residuals are presented for the upper yarra o shannassy and thomson catchments for the bclr mav 2s and abcf models to show no systematic persistence in residuals between catchments 6 3 4 post fire streamflow analysis in o shannassy for the 2009 wildfire disturbance across o shannassy catchment fig 6 shows a the time series of precipitation and b streamflow residual values in the first three years post disturbance the streamflow residuals averaged 198 mm yr 1 this is more than twice the pre fire standard deviation of the streamflow residuals 79 2 mm yr 1 the increase in post disturbance streamflow for the first three years was followed by a reduction in streamflow in the last two years of records as the residuals dropped to an average of 31 mm yr 1 which is well within the pre fire spread the precipitation time series in fig 6 a shows the magnitude of the millennial drought during the 13 years prior to the 2009 wildfire the downward trending annual precipitation over the three decades prior to 2009 emphasises the importance of calibrating the abcf model to 89 years of pre disturbance streamflow data before applying the calibrated abcf model to post 2009 time series 7 discussion 7 1 spatial monthly rainfall model 7 1 1 post 1978 rainfall estimates table 1 shows improved regressions in the rainfall model which are critical for hydrological modelling in remote regions by reducing the magnitude of catchment rainfall errors it is more likely that hydrological models of the study catchments will have higher skill and consistency comparing figs 1 and 2 shows that msef are located in the driest parts of the catchments while ash species e delegatensis and e nitens are located in the wettest regions and e regnans is most commonly found in the middle range of the rainfall distribution using spatially distributed species specific information for msef types table 2 provides a more detailed species distribution relative to rainfall the close association of forest type with mean annual rainfall suggests that variability in water availability across the landscape will influence the forest structure which comprises of ecohydrological properties that regulate forest water use 7 1 2 pre 1978 rainfall estimates in fig 3 the relationship between estimated mean annual rainfall pre and post 1978 suggests that regions with 1000 1500 and 2000 mm yr 1 of pre 1978 rainfall experience a reduced rainfall of 63 121 and 180 mm yr 1 post 1978 this suggests that regions with highest rainfall have experienced the greatest reduction in rainfall over recent decades it is important to be aware of the reduction in rainfall since 1978 as this may have some bearing on the performance of rainfall runoff models which were calibrated to the full record on the assumption that catchment behaviour did not change other than that accounted for by changes to forest structure 7 2 improving sapwood area estimates a major challenge in developing a top down model is to parsimoniously conceptualise an appropriate model structure that allows for physical interpretation of the calibrated results central to our deterministic conceptual model is the representation of forest growth to estimate spatiotemporal sa recognising that st of larger trees contributes more to plot sa than smaller trees with smaller circumference we used eq 7 to improve the plot level st n relationship shown in fig 4 improvements to the physical representation of st in the model framework aims to improve the physical interpretation of the calibrated model parameters such that the calibrated parameters values are more consistent between catchments in order to allow for estimation of streamflow in ungauged catchments the pgp used in this study were established for forest inventory purposes associated with the timber resource and therefore lacked representation of data in very young and mature forests for this reason the forest growth trajectory in mature forests needed improvement using remotely sensed methods for quantifying n which resulted in n of 19 7 trees ha 1 compared to 25 trees ha 1 assumed in jaskierniak et al 2016 this substantial change in n had a negligible influence on streamflow estimates in the case of upper yarra and thomson catchments the area of mature forest was negligible as both catchments experienced stand replacing regeneration across the great majority of ash forest after the 1939 wildfire in the case of the predominantly mature forested catchment o shannassy the stocking density n was largely equal to n throughout the record as a result changing n produced a constant change in aet because the precipitation scalar parameter θ 6 can compensate for this change in aet simulated streamflow does not materially change thus the benefit of improved sa estimates is seen in this case to come from more consistency in the abcf model parameters a critical requirement for application to ungauged catchments striving for an accurate representation of sa is central to the present modelling framework as sa is the emergent property used to explain aet variability across the landscape while we have made improvements we are mindful of shortcomings in the representation of n and ba in young ash forest the upper yarra and thomson catchments experienced stand replacing regeneration across the great majority of ash forest after the 1939 wildfire in fig 5 the negative residual values at the time of this disturbance data off scale provided with values suggest that the quantification of sa in younger forest may be poorly represented the over estimation of streamflow during this period may be associated with underestimation of aet due to the rate of sa growth in the first few years of regeneration the use of pgps with no empirical data representing n and ba for the first decade of growth underscores a need to represent this age class with forest inventory data 7 3 top down models of seasonal streamflow 7 3 1 seasonal model performance the improved fit of the seasonal abcf model 0 85 0 91 is largely attributed to the use of the seasonal time steps which account for the strong seasonality of rainfall and streamflow to a lesser extent the improved fit is also due to the use of an increased number of parameters the abcf model has three more parameters than bclr however one of these θ 2 is consistently zero indicating the fraction of catchment generated quick flow does not depend on storage moreover the goodness of fit statistics are insensitive to two significant figures to whether the rainfall multiplier θ 6 is set to 1 or calibrated hence abcf has effectively only one more parameter than bclr fiering 1967 showed that the abc conceptual storage model could be re expressed in terms of lagged rainfall and aet the inclusion of lagged aet and more lagged rainfall would most likely have improved the seasonal nse of mav 2s however that would run counter to our quest for parsimony we conclude that the abcf model seasonal nse 0 85 0 91 is preferred to mav 2s seasonal nse 0 79 0 82 having substantially better performance with a similar number of parameters 7 3 2 consistency of parameters the bclr run off carry over parameter θ1 in table 3 has values comparable with jaskierniak et al 2016 who reported runoff carry over parameter values of 0 78 0 76 and 0 82 for watts graceburn and coranderrk respectively resulting in an average of 0 78 for the six catchments it is concluded that the runoff carry over parameter exhibits strong regional consistency regional consistency is also evident with the rainfall scalar parameter given catchment rainfall was estimated from 127 rain gauges over 1 423 km2 the bclr rainfall bias corrections parameter θ2 and θ3 in table 3 are relatively small 0 95 to 1 04 evidently the bclr model can provide reasonable streamflow estimates in ungauged catchments using a top down framework consisting of a forest growth model rainfall model sa function and one regional runoff carry over parameter value of 0 78 the abcf model parameters exhibited less regional consistency than the bclr parameters the range of the quickflow parameter θ 1 was 0 152 to 0 185 while for the slowflow parameter θ 3 it was 0 455 to 0 602 for the water stress parameters θ 4 and θ 5 the values for upper yarra and thomson were very similar in contrast the values for o shannassy are markedly higher these differences are consistent with the fact that upper yarra and thomson have lower rainfall than o shannassy and significant msef compared to o shannassy which is dominated ash forest while this variation in parameters is not large this nonetheless suggests the need for model improvements before abcf can be applied in ungauged catchments it is important to strive for a parsimonious model structure when introducing an extra level of model complexity to explain the parameter variability for this reason an improved representation of spatiotemporal sa for all forest types and age classes is paramount in order to improve the physical interpretation of the abcf parameters for applications in ungauged catchments 7 3 3 persistence in annual streamflow residuals the correlation of catchment annual rainfall shows that the two catchments furthest apart o shannassy and thomson are less correlated 0 91 than the other two contiguous pairs of catchments 0 96 with such strong correlations all catchments would experience extreme drought periods and periods of high rainfall in unison and if streamflow residuals were associated with periods of prolonged droughts there should be a strong correlation of residuals during periods of prolonged drought fig 5 shows little consistency in the residual patterns between catchments with the three models exhibiting a more consistent pattern of residuals for a given catchment for example o shannassy upper yarra and thomson had residuals with three and five year moving averages that were respectively more positive neutral and negative during drought period 1998 to 2008 this suggests that the persistence in residuals is probably not due to poor representation of aet during prolonged droughts but rather more likely to be associated with error in the catchment specific rainfall field error in the catchment specific rainfall field is likely to vary depending on the method used to estimate rainfall we compare jaskierniak et al 2016 estimates of annual rainfall for coranderrk graceburn and watts catchments with rainfall estimates for the same catchments using the rainfall modelling method presented in this study fig 7 applying least squares regression for a comparison of the two methods results in r2 of 0 95 0 95 and 0 97 and rmse of 113 70 and 83 mm yr 1 respectively the magnitude of these residuals is similar to the streamflow residuals in fig 5 and table 3 suggesting that the persistence in streamflow residuals may be partially attributed to error in rainfall estimates 7 3 4 post fire streamflow analysis in o shannassy presently there is conflicting evidence on the immediate streamflow response to wildfire in e regnans forest during the first decade after disturbances watson et al 2001 kuczera 1987 kuczera 1987 shows no changes in expected streamflow for the first two years post 1939 wildfire followed by reduced streamflow thereafter whereas watson et al 2001 show in experimental catchments an increase in streamflow that persisted for up to several years before a subsequent decrease in streamflow kuczera 1987 used between seven and 12 years of pre disturbance data to calibrate his model whereas watson et al 2001 used between three and 12 years of data creating uncertainty in post disturbance streamflow response for o shannassy catchment we calibrate the streamflow model with 89 years of pre disturbance streamflow data with five years of post disturbance data our results suggest a small increase in streamflow for the first three years followed by reductions in streamflow in the last two years to levels well within the pre fire spread 7 3 5 generality of the model framework the results have illustrated application of the model framework to a 915 km2 forested region located north east of melbourne australia however the framework itself is considered to be general and applicable to forested catchments in other parts of the world the core hypothesis underpinning the framework is ecological optimality which is that a forest at a particular location develops its sa to equilibrate with the pet and precipitation at that location in order to maximize its biomass production during periods when water is not limiting to apply this framework requires a forest specific relationship between annual pet and sa as well as forest inventory data consisting of ba and n estimates to represent the spatiotemporal changes in forest growth the relationship between pet and sa may be either derived using sap flow sensors to estimate plot scale water use nolan et al 2014 or calibrated to experimental catchments with known sa benyon et al 2015 importantly forest inventory modelling is progressing rapidly with aerial lidar unmanned aerial system uas lidar wallace et al 2012 and global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi using satellite based high resolution laser ranging of earth s forests qi and dubayah 2016 all of which increase the transferability of our framework to other catchments 8 conclusion we present a new top down streamflow modelling framework that uses spatiotemporal sa estimates to represent the emergent forest structural property that equilibrates with pet and introduce a soil storage threshold to predict aet when available water reduces aet below pet the top down approach provides a conceptual framework for applications in both water unlimited and water limited forests and was evaluated using a 915 km2 study site consisting of three catchments the physical interpretation of the calibrated results requires an accurate representation of spatiotemporal sa which was improved with i a more accurate procedure for estimating stand st and hence sa ii and a remotely sensed measure of n to correct the temporal evolution of n a monthly rainfall interpolation procedure was developed over all 1423 km2 of melbourne s forested water supply catchments to optimise the use of the limited number of rain gauges available across a study site characterized with remoteness and high relief we show that the use of terrain information substantially improved upon the accuracy of methods using only geographic coordinates the abcf model produced seasonal nse statistics in the range 0 85 to 0 91 of significance the annual nse statistics for the abcf model 0 74 0 88 are superior to the previously developed annual bclr model 0 68 0 75 highlighting the value of representing the strong seasonality of rainfall and streamflow the bclr model parameters were found to exhibit strong consistency across 6 large water supply catchments this demonstrates the viability of the top down modelling framework to estimate annual streamflow in ungauged catchments however the parameters of the seasonal abcf model showed greater variation across the catchments highlighting the need for further work to achieve stronger regional consistency of parameters forest structural properties are largely influenced by terrain soil climate and disturbance history which in turn also influence aet we demonstrate the use of lidar data and historically measured forest inventory data to characterise the eco hydrological properties of forested catchment with sa estimates a surrogate for aet estimates across the landscape when coupled with the seasonal abcf model the top down framework has significant potential for water supply planning and drought security in ungauged forested catchments with sparse soil and climate data acknowledgement the melbourne water corporation and the australian government funded this study as part of an australian research council arc linkage grant lp160100597 titled remote sensed forest water use in space and time we would also like to thank vicforests for providing the permanent growth plots data used in the forest growth modelling 
6821,with intensifying climate change droughts over southwest china swc are drawing increasing interest the droughts of 2009 2011 have attracted special concern however the roles of atmospheric evaporative demand reflected by reference evapotranspiration et0 and precipitation p anomalies in drought evolutions are still unclear to that end we revisited the evolution of the 2009 2011 swc meteorological droughts quantitatively and comprehensively by quantifying the et0 and p impacts in terms of three drought parameters i e drought intensity di area da and duration dd swc experienced the second most severe drought of the 1961 2012 period in 2009 evident differences existed among the drought conditions in different months i e more severe droughts occurred in february march 2009 september 2009 to march 2010 and june october 2011 based on the annual means over drought regions the 2009 and 2011 di da could be attributed to lower p but the p and et0 impacts p et0 and p and et0 which reflects drought occurrence due to their combined impacts only were comparable in 2010 in addition p reduction was responsible for dd during 2009 2011 except in january march which were dominated mostly by p di da was generally dominated by et0 et0 or p and et0 over the three years while p dominated spatially and temporally for the majority of the 36 months for di dd some areas were mainly affected by et0 et0 or p and et0 therefore to better understand drought evolutions and improve drought monitoring and forecasting the impacts of et0 anomalies should be fully considered the results of this study provide an important reference framework for comprehensively understanding the underlying mechanisms of droughts not only in swc but also in other regions around the world keywords drought processes separation method standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index climate anomaly southwest china 1 introduction drought characterized by below normal water availability over a period from several months to a few decades is a complex important and recurrent extreme climate event for a region dai 2011 sheffield et al 2012 a drought usually exerts negative and far reaching impacts on social economic and environmental sectors droughts accompanied by heat waves are estimated to have cost around 210 1 billion u s during 1980 2011 ganguli and ganguly 2016 the 2008 2009 winter drought in northeastern china one of the worst droughts in the past 50 years resulted in more than 10 million people lacking drinking water and economic losses of nearly 2 3 billion wang et al 2011 drought is regarded as one of the most damaging natural disasters wilhite 2000 and is a perennial concern for the public and governments across the globe in recent decades in particular droughts have occurred more frequently with greater intensities and longer durations and have affected larger spatial areas possibly due to intensifying climate change sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 ipcc 2014 trenberth et al 2014 williams et al 2015 therefore the spatiotemporal characteristics underlying mechanisms and related impacts of droughts have been receiving increasing attention on both

2013 an average of approximately 2 1 105 km2 of cropland accounting for nearly 16 7 of the total arable area was impacted by drought annually zhai et al 2017 droughts can happen anywhere in regions with more or less climatological p and anytime in wet or dry months however due to differences in climatological backgrounds and climate change drought variations i e intensity duration frequency and extent differ from region to region zou et al 2005 she and xia 2013 wang and chen 2012 huang et al 2015 choi et al 2016 ma et al 2016 wang et al 2015a b zhang et al 2016 2017a for example using the palmer drought severity index pdsi choi et al 2016 showed that the drought intensity in north china strengthened throughout all seasons during 1979 2005 especially in the summer and fall in recent decades the yellow river has remained below normal levels for long periods of time she and xia 2013 and zero flow has even happened regularly in its lower reaches since the 1970s which implies high drought risk in the yellow river basin huang et al 2015 ma et al 2016 wang et al 2015a b employed the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to explore drought evolution from 1960 to 2010 in northwest china a typically arid region and determined that the region had become wetter on both annual and seasonal scales despite no obvious changes occurring in the pdsi for the entire yangtze river basin during 1961 2005 the middle the lower and upper part s of this basin exhibited statistically significant downward upward trend zhai et al 2010 with drought aggravation in the northern traditionally arid regions of china the southern and eastern wet regions have experienced more frequent and more severe e g higher intensity and more widespread droughts since the beginning of the 21st century liu et al 2012 for example severe droughts occurred in sichuan sc province in the autumns of 2004 and 2007 despite there being thousands of rivers within this region a once in a century drought occurred in 2006 in chongqing cq and a severe and prolonged drought occurred from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 in southwest china swc among these the 2009 2010 drought in swc was believed to be a record breaking event from the perspective of historical meteorological observations during this drought most rivers shrank to 30 80 of their normal volumes and some even dried up completely approximately 21 million people lacked drinking water and economic losses reached nearly 30 billion lu et al 2011 2014 yang et al 2012a b because of the far reaching and devastating impacts of this drought throughout swc the chinese government and academic researchers e g meteorologists hydrologists agriculturalists ecologists and economists have paid particular attention to this event moreover there is general agreement that drought occurrence in swc has become more frequent and intense during the past 50 years and that these trends will continue in the future wang and chen 2012 wang et al 2014a b 2015a b thus to better mitigate increasing drought risks and reduce drought induced losses in swc it is urgent and critically important to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of drought and its relevant underlying mechanisms comprehensively considering the close association between p the major water supply component and drought numerous scholars have worked to identify possible causes of negative p anomalies based on drought generalities and case studies li et al 2009 xu et al 2012 huang et al 2012 yang et al 2012a b zhang et al 2013a b 2014 wang et al 2015a b liu et al 2017a b yang et al 2012a b found that swc p was significantly and positively correlated with the arctic oscillation ao index which suggests that a negative ao phase might correspond to drought in this region xu et al 2012 stated that despite a significant positive relationship between the north atlantic oscillation nao and swc p in boreal winter the nao asymmetrically impacted p i e the nao negative phase could clearly generate a p deficiency but the positive phase could only induce limited increases in p zhang et al 2013a b noted that the concurrent distinctive warm pool during el niño could have created a strongly anomalous cyclone over the western north pacific resulting in a serious reduction in swc p a severe drought in the autumn of 2009 liu et al 2017a b suggested that severe summer and early fall droughts in swc occurred mainly due to negative water vapor transport anomalies from the indo china peninsula channel it is worth noting that the vast majority of studies on swc droughts have focused on p anomalies and their associated mechanisms paying little or no attention to the effects of aed depending on the soil water balance aed can play an important role in soil water losses hobbins et al 2008 which areintimately related to dryness wetness and drought variations furthermore this close relationship has been confirmed around the world hu and willson 2000 dai 2013 ipcc 2014 williams et al 2015 shukla et al 2015 diffenbaugh et al 2015 sun et al 2017a with some researchers warning that ignoring the influence of aed may result in

2013 long et al 2014 wang et al 2014a b cui et al 2015 liu et al 2016 2017a b while these studies have led to improved understanding of drought processes two major unresolved issues remain 1 the role that aed plays in the spatiotemporal evolution of drought and 2 whether droughts are always dependent on p anomalies to address these questions we revisited the 2009 2011 swc meteorological drought evolutions comprehensively and quantitatively by considering the effects of p and aed reflected by et0 in this study the major objectives of this study were as follows 1 to analyze the values of annual and monthly drought parameters i e drought intensity duration and extent during 2009 2011 based on a three month spei spei 3 2 to quantify the respective contributions of anomalous p and et0 based on several sensitivity experiments and a separation method proposed by sun et al 2014 2017b and 3 to address the two unresolved issues in the aforementioned analyses the results of this study allow us to better understand meteorological drought evolutions in response to climate anomalies over swc 2 data and methodology 2 1 study region this study region of swc between 21 and 34 n and 97 110 e mainly includes sc cq guizhou gz yunnan yn and the western part of guangxi wgx province it encompasses a large geographic area with complex landscapes e g the plateau of yn gz and western sc the eastern sc hills the hengduan mountains and the sc basin a typical subtropical monsoon climate prevails across swc with a clearly defined dry wet season over this region regional mean monthly p increases quickly starting in april peaks in july and sharply decreases afterward for the monthly et0 the regional mean has two peaks in may and july during 1961 2012 the annual p et0 is 1000 mm 980 mm and shows large spatial differences with a range from 700 mm 900 mm in western sc northeastern swc to 1400 mm 1000 mm in wgx yn 2 2 data for computing the penman monteith et0 allen et al 1998 and the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and conducting sensitivity experiments we collected monthly meteorological datasets from the china meteorological administration cma mainly including p mm mean maximum and minimum air temperatures c 10 m wind speed m s ssd h mon and relative humidity the datasets span 1960 2012 with observations at 334 sites before using the data two data quality issues of inhomogeneity and missing values were resolved first the pettitt test is employed to check the time series homogeneity wijngaard et al 2003 and variables that cannot pass the significance test p 0 05 are eliminated subsequently the sites with data available for fewer than 10 months each year are also removed the missing values in the records of the other stations are filled using the data from nearby sites with a linear regression after this quality control process data from 269 sites remained fig 1 considering thespatiallyunevenfeatures of these sites which potentially introduce uncertainties into the results e g the regional mean the thiessen polygon method is employed for obtaining the area represented by each site fig 1 in addition the daily ncep ncar reanalysis 1 kalnay et al 1996 dataset during 1960 2012 including wind speed and specific humidity is utilized these data are used to calculate the monthly column integrated water vapor flux from the surface to 300 hpa and divergence during 2009 2011 and their corresponding monthly anomalies relative to the multi year 1961 2012 mean through comparing the monthly anomalies of p against those of water vapor flux and divergence the possible causes of negative p anomalies will be briefly discussed from perspective of the atmospheric circulation patterns 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 computing et0 and spei 3 to date hundreds of approaches for determining aed have been proposed xu and singh 2001 including the use of a water budget e g guitjens 1982 mass transfer e g harbeck 1962 radiation based approaches e g priestley and taylor 1972 temperature based approaches e g thornthwaite 1948 and combinations of these other approaches e g penman and penman monteith allen et al 1998 liu et al 2018 the penman monteith equation considers various climatic variables i e temperature water vapor deficit ssd or net radiation and wind speed which suggests that this method incorporates a comprehensive physical concept of evapotranspiration processes to better reflect the effects of climate anomalies on aed as well as spei 3 or drought we used an equation of the penman monteith type i e the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 56 equation allen et al 1998 to estimate et0 for representing aed this equation is written as follows 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 tave 273 u 2 e s 1 rh δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn mj m2 d is the net radiation at the surface which is closely related to ssd detailed computations are shown in supplementary text s1 g mj m2 d is the soil heat flux density which can be ignored at monthly or longer scales γ kpa c and δ kpa c are the psychometric constant and the rate of change in vapor pressure with temperature respectively u2 m s is the 2 m wind speed converted from the 10 m wind speed rh and es kpa are the relative humidity and saturation vapor pressure respectively and tave c is the mean temperature more information about γ δ es and u2 computations can be found in allen et al 1998 using drought statistics from various yearbooks of meteorological disasters wang and chen 2012 evaluated results from the spei model for swc and found that this index could reproduce the principal meteorological drought features in this region well therefore this index was chosen to represent dryness wetness in swc and to determine the values of drought parameters spei which is based on the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 was proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 it is easy to calculate and can flexibly track dry wet events on various time scales monthly p and et0 data are usually necessary to calculate the climatic water balance d p et0 for a certain month before they are aggregated at various time scales a three parameter log logistic distribution is recommended to fit the d time series for each month an inverse normal function is then used to standardize the probabilities vicente serrano et al 2010 in a certain region negative and positive spei values typically indicate dry and wet conditions respectively in this study we focused on short and medium term meteorological droughts which are closely associated with agricultural droughts as defined by soil moisture hao and singh 2015 wu et al 2015 in our preliminary work not shown here we calculated the correlation coefficients rs of the 1 3 6 9 and 12 month spei with gladas2 0 noah global land data assimilation system version 2 0 with the noah model soil moisture anomalies over swc on a monthly scale and found that the spei 3 corresponded to the largest r which suggests that the spei 3 best represents agricultural drought over swc thus the spei 3 was selected for further analyses monthly et0 and spei 3 time series during 1961 2012 were calculated for 269 sites in swc and then annual p and et0 spei 3 values were obtained by summing averaging the monthly values for each year 2 3 2 separating the respective contributions of p and et0 to spei 3 anomalies it is difficult to separate the respective contributions of p and et0 to spei 3 anomalies because of the compounding effects of these driving factors interactions to resolve this issue sun et al 2014 2017b proposed a new separation method based on several sensitivity experiments this method has been employed for attributing linear trends in streamflow and evapotranspiration in the poyang lake basin of china and et0 in swc notably the original version of the method was developed to quantify the individual contributions of each factor to the linear trends in hydrometeorological parameters thus we have improved this method to satisfy this study s aims of differentiating between the contributions of p and et0 to annual and monthly spei 3 anomalies two validation metrics i e r and scatter plots were selected to evaluate the performance of this improved approach details of the results are presented in section 3 2 1 like the separation method proposed by sun et al 2014 2017b the method developed in this study involves two major procedures i e reasonable sensitivity experiments table 1 and an efficient algorithm eqs 2 and 3 for determining the individual contribution of each factor six i e one control and five sensitivity experiments were designed and conducted with the spei model the control experiment spei ctl was run with all of the original climate variables i e remaining intra and inter annual fluctuations during 1960 2012 as inputs however for the ith sensitivity experiment spei non i the inputs for the 52 year 1961 2012 climatological mean of the ith factor for each month i e only the remaining intra annual fluctuation and the original monthly time series of the other four factors during 1960 2012 were used the sensitivity experiments for p ssd tave u2 and rh are referred to here as spei non p spei non ssd spei non tave spei non u2 and spei non rh respectively given that differences in the log logistic probability distribution parameters exist among these six experiments and thus introduce uncertainties into the results the estimated parameters of the spei model from spei ctl were utilized in running the five sensitivity experiments monthly spei 3 anomalies for each experiment were obtained by subtracting the 52 year mean taking spei non i as an example an equation was established based on the hypothesis that spei anomalies are caused by the remaining factors except for the ith factor represented as follows 2 k i n c i k j k v i k j spei non i where k i n c i k j k is the total contribution to the monthly spei non i spei 3 anomalies at the ith grid during the jth month of the kth year n is the number of sensitivity experiments 5 here and v i k j spei non i is the monthly spei 3 anomalies from the spei non i experiment at the ith grid during the jth month of the kth year we thus obtained a set of simultaneous equations including five unknown numbers i e c i k j p c i k j ssd c i k j tave c i k j u 2 and c i k j rh by solving these equations the contribution of the ith factor at the ith grid during the jth month of the kth year can be computed as follows 3 c i k j k k i n v i k j spei non k n 2 v i k j spei non i n 1 in this study the et0 contribution to spei 3 anomalies was represented as the sum of the respective contributions of ssd tave u2 and rh additionally the separation method described above was employed to quantify the impacts of ssd tave rh and u2 on annual and monthly et0 anomalies in drought regions however it should be noted that the corresponding designations of experiments are different than those for drought attributions details are shown in table s1 2 3 3 quantifying climate anomaly impacts on drought parameters 2 3 3 1 identifying drought parameters in real time a threshold is required to determine whether a given month experiences drought at a certain thiessen grid in this study the drought threshold was set to 1 0 if the monthly spei 3 is 1 0 in a given month drought occurs and vice versa therefore we were able to extract the values of drought parameters i e drought intensity di area da and duration dd from the spei ctl results as follows 4 di i k j spei i k j if spei ctl spei i k j 1 0 di swc k j i 1 269 di i k j a i y i k j a swc a swc i 1 269 a i y i k j 1 if spei ctl spei i k j 1 0 y i k j 0 if spei ctl

spei ctl speii k j are di and spei ctl spei 3 respectively in the jth month of the kth year at the ith grid diswc k j is the swc regional mean di in the jth month of the kth year dii k and ddi k are the annual di and dd respectively at the ith grid in the kth year diswc k ddswc k is the swc regional mean di dd in the kth year dak j is the da in the jth month of the kth year dak is the annual total da in the kth year and aswc is the area of swc based on the above equations and spei ctl spei 3 monthly and annual drought characteristics were identified for further analyses of drought conditions during 2009 2011 2 3 3 2 quantifying climate anomaly impacts considering our major objective of determining climate anomaly impacts on drought characteristics in real time we focused on drought regions during a specific month which could be identified by spei ctl spei 3 1 0 with eq 5 and could thus be represented as a condition of if spei ctl speii k j 1 0 the quantitative impacts of p or et0 on di were estimated as follows 7 x cdi i k j x c i k j if spei ctl spei i k j 1 0 x cdi i k j 1 12 x c i k j 12 x cdi swc k j i 1 269 x cdi i k j a i y i k j a swc x cdi swc k j 1 12 x cdi swc k j 12 where xcdii k j xcdiswc k j is the contribution of the x p or et0 anomaly to di at the ith grid swc in the jth month of the kth year and xcdii k xcdiswc k is the contribution of the x anomaly at the ith grid swc in the kth year by comparing the magnitudes of the p and et0 contributions the dominant contributors can be divided into two types i e with p et0 being dominant with larger magnitudes in contrast to di attribution da and dd are closely associated with whether monthly precipitation or et0 anomaly alone triggers drought namely whether the effect of p or et0 alone plus the multi year mean 1961 2012 monthly spei ctl spei 3 is 1 0 therefore based on the separate contributions of p and et0 alone on monthly spei 3 anomalies we were able to reconstruct a new monthly spei 3 time series by summarizing the multi year mean monthly spei ctl spei 3 and p spei ponly et0 spei et0only contribution which only reflects the p et0 impact then several possible conditions were established specifically for a given drought month i e spei ctl spei 3 1 0 on a certain grid 1 drought disappears in the spei ponly and spei et0only scenarios because spei 3 1 0 thus drought occurrence can be attributed to the summarized contributions of p and et0 2 drought exists in the spei ponly spei et0only scenario rather than in the spei et0only spei ponly scenario thus p et0 is regarded as the major contributor to drought occurrence 3 drought occurs in the spei ponly and spei et0only scenarios which suggests that the impacts from p or et0 alone can induce drought consistently we can define the determinants as four types p and et0 p et0 and p or et0 these four determinants contributions to dd and da can be estimated as follows 8 x cdd i k j 1 12 x i j k x cda k

spei i k j 1 0 or x i j k 0 conditions for dominant of et 0 x i j k 1 if spei ctl spei i k j 1 0 spei p only spei i k j 1 0 spei et 0 only spei i k j 1 0 or x i j k 0 conditions for dominant of p and

spei i k j 1 0 spei et 0 only spei i k j 1 0 or x i j k 0 where xcddi k xcddswc k represents the contribution of x p et0 p and et0 or p or et0 at the ith grid swc dd in the kth year xcdak j is the contribution of x in the jth month of the kth year xcdak is the contribution of x in the kth year and spei ponly speii k j and spei et0only speii k j represent spei 3 from spei ponly and spei et0only in the jth month of the kth year at the ith grid respectively 3 results 3 1 recent climate conditions 3 1 1 p and et0 anomalies during 2009 2011 during 1961 2012 the annual swc p was mostly above normal before 2000 and then became negative afterward fig 2 a1 in a ranking of the 52 year p records the 2009 and 2011p values were the second lowest anomalies of 142 94 mm and lowest anomalies of 163 52 mm respectively followed by the lowest three years running mean during 2009 2011 anomalies of 113 36 mm the time series of the annual swc et0 fig 2b1 demonstrates positive anomalies before 1980 and after 2000 but negative ones between these two periods corresponding to the annual swc p during 2009 2011 positive anomalies of the annual swc et0 fig 2b1 are found with values of approximately 20 mm undoubtedly a higher et0 more water demand and lower p less water supply would be likely to have exacerbated the water deficit over swc during the preceding three years to better understand the p and et0 anomalies over drought regions we also calculated their annual values during 1961 2012 fig 2a1 and b1 for p and et0 respectively it is evident that swc droughts are always accompanied by negative p and positive et0 anomalies interestingly the p and et0 anomalies of swc are closer to those of drought regions since 2005 especially for 2009 2011 which suggests that drought occurred widely and severely over swc in this period the intra annual p et0 anomalies over swc and drought regions during 2009 2011 were plotted as shown in fig 2a2 fig 2b2 to illustrate the drought evolution in those three years obviously both swc and drought regions exhibit different water deficit levels p anomalies 0 for most of the 36 months especially for september november 2009 and july september 2011 with larger anomalies of 20 mm fig 2a2 as indicated in fig 2b2 there generally exists a similar intra annual fluctuation of the et0 anomaly between drought regions and swc characterized by maxima 5 mm in october november 2009 february march 2010 and july october 2011 moreover the drought regions et0 anomalies are always positive for each month consequently intensifying the water deficit by creating more water demand in summary under the combined effects of negative p and positive et0 with higher anomaly magnitudes there is potential for the occurrence of more severe droughts over swc 3 1 2 spei 3 and drought characteristics during 2009 2011 to examine the dry wet conditions and drought characteristics over swc we calculated the annual swc spei 3 and identified relevant drought parameters di da and dd which are shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows that swc was generally wetter spei 3 0 in the 1960s 1990s 2000s and the first half of the 2010s but drier spei 3 0 in other years particularly after 2008 in broad terms similar trends are evident for swc da and dd fluctuations i e slight decreases since the 1990s and then sharp increases from 2000 on fig 3b and c interestingly in spite of the 1960s generally being wetter the driest year in the study period was 1969 based on spei 3 and the three drought parameters and the next driest year was 2009 0 54 yr 0 59 yr 441 aswc and 4 48 mon for spei 3 di da and dd respectively fig 3 however considering the three year running means the most severe drought in swc was found to be in 2009 2011 characterized by the lowest di 0 53 yr and the highest da 384 aswc and dd 4 06 mon mainly because of the lowest higher three year running p et0 fig 4 illustrates the spatial distributions of the annual spei 3 di and dd in 2009 2011 overall swc was drier excluding the mid north of sc in 2009 western sc westernmost yn and the mid south of wgx in 2010 and the northern and southernmost parts of swc in 2011 fig 4a1 3 the driest areas spei 3 0 8 yr were the westernmost and southern areas of swc in 2009 the mid south of swc in 2010 and southeastern sc and northern gz in 2011 it is evident that the overwhelming majority 90 aswc of swc experienced at least once drought from 2009 to 2011 fig 4b1 3 and c1 3 the annual di fig 4b1 3 dd fig 4c1 3 was less greater than 0 6 yr 5 mon over more than 40 aswc for these three years mainly in southern swc in 2009 yn except for the westernmost part and southern gz in 2010 and the mid east of swc in 2011 fig 5 illustrates the monthly evolution of the swc spei 3 and the di and dd of the drought regions during 2009 2011 except for eight months that were slightly wetter during the three year period spei 3 0 5 yr fig 5a swc was drier especially in february march 2009 september 2009 march 2010 and june october 2011 with spei 3 0 5 yr similarly based on the monthly drought regions di 0 5 yr and da 45 aswc the drought was more severe in these months fig 5b and c fig 6 illustrates the spatial distributions of the monthly spei 3 di during 2009 2011 during january and april july of 2009 limited areas in swc had drier conditions drought while larger areas suffered from drier conditions during the remaining months fig 6a in particular more than 50 aswc was subjected to drought in february mainly in southeastern swc and eastern sc fig 6a2 and during october december mainly in southern swc fig 6a10 12 in 2010 a negative spei 3 drought is widely distributed over swc in january may fig 6b1 5 and october fig 6b10 especially with drought regions covering more than 80 aswc in january and february in contrast most of swc was covered by wetter conditions in the other six months fig 6b6 9 b11 and b12 fig 6c1 3 show that more than 70 aswc was wetter during january march of 2011 whereas nearly 90 more than 50 of swc exhibited drier conditions drought in june october fig 6c6 10 however comparable areas of drier and wetter conditions were presented in the remaining months fig 6c4 c5 c11 and b12 3 2 climate anomaly impacts on drought during 2009 2011 3 2 1 performance of the separation method to obtain more accurate results regarding the contribution of each driving factor to the spei 3 anomaly the separation method proposed by sun et al 2014 2017b was further developed and employed in this study the cumulative contributions of each factor were calculated for comparison against monthly and annual spei ctl spei 3 anomalies fig 7 a shows the scatter plot of the annual cumulative contributions and spei ctl spei 3 anomalies averaged over the entirety of swc intuitively each data point of the annual spei ctl spei 3 anomaly vs cumulative contributions is closer to the 1 1 line combining the results for all 52 years a fitted linear equation was derived with a regression coefficient slp of 1 025 and an r of 0 999 we also calculated the annual slp and r at each site as shown in fig 7b and c respectively for an overwhelming majority of the 269 sites the annual slp is between 1 00 and 1 04 with r 0 998 based on these results the annual slp and r quantitatively indicate that this method can accurately identify each driving factor s contribution to annual spei 3 anomalies on regional and site based scales for the time period of 1961 2012 to further examine the robustness of this approach monthly results were also compared fig s1 3 for each month all data points of the monthly spei ctl spei 3 anomaly vs cumulative contributions are very close to the 1 1 line fig s1 with slp and r values ranging from 1 001 to 1 196 and from 0 997 to 0 999 respectively for each site figs s2 and s3 slp r is always between 0 96 and 1 04 0 998 for every month except january and february suggesting that the method as improved in this study also achieves better separation of each factor s contribution to the monthly spei 3 anomalies as a result this improved method with higher accuracy and efficiency proved to be a useful tool for quantifying the contribution of climate anomalies to spei 3 and drought indicators i e di dd and da in this study 3 2 2 contributions to di fig 8 shows the p and et0 anomalies contributions to the annual drought regions di during 2009 2011 overall di was strengthened in response to decreased p increased et0 in those three years with a p et0 contribution of 0 44 yr 0 16 yr in 2009 0 28 yr 0 22 yr in 2010 and 0 44 yr 0 09 yr in 2011 therefore the di in each year can be attributed to a negative p however it should be noted that p and et0 exerted comparable impacts on di in 2010 to understand the spatial distributions of the p and et0 contributions to the annual di in each year their impacts were estimated at each thiessen grid fig 9 in general drought occurrence is accompanied by negative contributions of p and et0 over the whole region in 2009 the p contribution ranged from 1 31 to 0 yr and was generally smaller in sc and cq and larger in other regions especially at the junction of yn gz and wgx 0 7 yr fig 9a1 for the et0 contribution the magnitude was generally lower than 0 5 yr with regions of larger values 0 2 yr in northwestern sc and yn and western wgx fig 9a2 during 2010 except for western sc and southern wgx a larger p contribution 0 2 yr was widely distributed over the remaining regions particularly in southern gz and central yn 0 4 yr fig 9a2 there was a smaller et0 contribution 0 2 yr in most of sc and wgx and in northeastern gz however the et0 contribution was lower than 0 2 yr in the other regions and even exceeded 0 5 yr at the junction of yn gz and wgx fig 9b2 the p contribution during 2011 was lower than 0 6 yr in nearly half of swc mainly in southern sc mid eastern yn and gz excluding the southern part fig 9a3 it is evident that except at the junction of yn sc gz and cq the et0 contribution in an overwhelming majority of swc was higher than 0 2 yr fig 9b3 by comparing the p and et0 contributions we identified the determinants i e p and et0 of di at the thiessen grids fig 9c1 3 the determinant of p to di was extensively distributed over swc from 2009 to 2011 corresponding to area percentages of 83 83 aswc 56 27 aswc and 86 54 aswc respectively additionally the determinant of et0 was mainly located in northwestern swc in 2009 western sc northwestern yn and the junction of yn gz and wgx in 2010 and mid western sc in 2011 fig 5b depicts the intra annual di evolution for all the drought regions with the monthly contributions of p and et0 in january march of 2009 and 2010 the increased et0 had a larger contribution to di than did the decreased p suggesting that et0 was the determinant however di can be attributed to a p reduction from april to december because of the much larger contribution of p for 2011 except in january and february when et0 dominated decreased p was the major contributor of di in the remaining months at each thiessen grid within the drought regions the monthly contributions of p and et0 to di were estimated and the dominants were thus identified fig s4 and table 2 by comparing the area percentages of p and et0 as determinants in each month table 2 the dominant of et0 was found to occupy nearly the entirety of the drought regions in january of 2009 2011 corresponding to the locations in northwestern sc fig s4g1 most of swc except for northern and mid western sc and most of wgx fig s4h1 and the junction of sc and cq fig s4i1 respectively in february the determinant of et0 for the three years had a larger area percentage which generally was manifested in sc and gz drought regions in 2009 fig s4g2 western sc and gz yn and northwestern wgx in 2010 fig s4h2 and mid northern sc in 2011 fig s4i2 except in march of 2011 fig s4i3 there was a comparable larger area percentage of the determinant of et0 in 2009 fig s4g3 2010 fig s4h3 which mainly appeared in northwestern sc and gz and mid northern wgx mid western swc for each of the remaining months the area percentage of the p determinant far outweighed that of et0 figs s4g4 12 s4h4 12 and s4i4 12 3 2 3 contributions to da and dd fig 8b depicts the contributions of p et0 p or et0 and p and et0 to the annual total da during 2009 2011 in 2009 and 2011 the p contribution to da was approximately 290 aswc followed by p and et0 with contributions of 120 aswc moreover the et0 and p or et0 contributions to da were much smaller 33 aswc especially for 2011 with percentages of 5 8 and 0 respectively in contrast the p et0 and p and et0 contributions in 2010 were comparable approximately 100 aswc in january and february of 2009 fig 5c the maximum contribution 10 aswc to monthly da was from p and et0 followed by the et0 contribution of more than 7 aswc in march p and et0 contributed to 28 9 aswc while approximately 10 aswc was determined by p during april 4 9 aswc and 12 6 aswc were controlled by p and p and et0 respectively for each month during may december p corresponded to the largest area percentages with a range of 9 9 to 62 3 aswc during january february of 2010 the major contributor to monthly da was et0 with contributions greater than 31 and p and et0 played a secondary role with contributions of approximately 20 in march the contributions of p and et0 et0 and p were comparable approximately 15 aswc in april 13 8 aswc was dominated by p and less thna 4 aswc corresponded to the et0 or the p and et0 dominants a comparable area percentage 10 aswc from p and et0 and p was detected for may during june december da could always be attributed to p and et0 and p with p having a larger contribution 8 to 16 aswc in january and february of 2011 p and et0 was the major contributor while in the remaining months p generally governed all the drought regions with an area percentage between 6 1 aswc in march and 57 5 aswc in september spatial distributions of the dominants of the monthly da during 2009 2011 are depicted in fig s5 briefly the spatial distributions of the dominants differ from month to month details of the analyses can be found in text s2 as with the contributors to da p reduction was probably responsible for the annual swc dd during 2009 2011 with contributions of 2 90 mon 1 50 mon and 3 20 mon respectively fig 8c p and et0 in 2009 and p and et0 and et0 in 2010 were 1 00 mon and played secondary roles in the annual swc dd while the impacts of et0 not including et0 in 2010 and p or et0 in 2009 2011 were very limited particularly for p or et0 with contributions less than 0 10 mon for all thiessen grids we calculated the p et0 p or et0 and p and et0 contributions to the annual dd from 2009 to 2011 fig 10 in 2009 fig 10a1 the determinant of p with contributions 1 mon to the annual dd was widely distributed over the drought regions moreover its contribution was 4 mon in most of southern swc especially at the junction of yn gz and wgx 5 mon as seen from their contributions 4 mon and spatial extents fig 10a2 3 et0 or p or et0 were dominant only in certain months and regions while most grids had a determinant of p and et0 fig 10a4 its contribution was 3 mon except for several grids in mid western yn 5 mon in 2010 fig 10b1 b2 and b4 p et0 or p and et0 had extensive spatial extents 50 aswc as determinants for annual dd but their contributions generally ranged from 1 to 4 mon as shown in fig 10b2 a very limited spatial extent generally corresponds to a p or et0 dominant with a contribution between 1 and 2 mon compared to each factor s contribution to the annual dd and spatial extent in 2011 fig 10c1 4 there were larger regions with p contributions 4 mon in the middle of swc suggesting that drought occurrences in most of the months of 2011 were closely associated with p despite there having been a greater spatial extent for the dominant of p and et0 its contribution was generally 2 mon which suggests that this factor was critical for drought occurrences in several months fig 10c4 in addition it is very evident that the role of et0 or p or et0 in the 2011 drought occurrences was very limited given the contributions of 1 mon in several grids 4 discussion 4 1 circulation patterns associated with negative p anomalies over swc during 2009 2011 as discussed above negative p anomalies occurred over swc from 2009 to 2011 with the 2009 and 2011p anomalies ranking in the top two events during 1961 2012 additionally negative p anomalies were more obvious during august november 2009 fig 2a2 and fig 11 a and july october 2011 fig 2a2 and fig 11b as a result we chose to focus on these months to briefly examine the possible causes of negative p anomalies from atmospheric circulation patterns fig 11c and d fig 11a shows that negative p anomalies were larger in the middle and southern parts of swc during august november 2009 coincident with concurrent greater di fig 6a8 11 the column integrated water vapor flux indicates a strong cyclonic anomaly over the tropical west pacific with strengthened southwestward water vapor flux anomalies in the middle and southern portions of swc during august november 2009 fig 11c the warm tropical northwest pacific sea surface temperature related to el niño has been proposed as a forcing for this cyclonic anomaly zhang et al 2013a b wang et al 2015a b thereby weakening the transport of moisture from the northwest pacific into swc on the other hand although a weak cyclonic anomaly is located in the east of the bay of bengal fig 11c its poleward water vapor flux anomalies are suppressed in contrast to the reinforced westerly anomalies in the vicinity of the equatorial indian ocean due to the warm tropical northwest pacific sea surface temperature wang et al 2015a b as a result anomalous water vapor flux divergence dominated the middle and south of swc during august november 2009 fig 11c as seen from fig 11d the swc circulation patterns during july october 2011 were to some degree akin to those during august november 2009 that is enhanced northeasterly water vapor flux anomalies associated with an anomalous tropical western pacific low prevailed in the eastern and southern portions of swc southerly water vapor flux anomalies with respect to the weak cyclonic anomaly centered in the east bay of bengal are obviously relaxed fig 11d therefore anomalous water vapor flux divergence is predominant in those regions fig 11d and reduces p notably the spatial patterns of p anomalies are not strictly consistent with those of anomalous water vapor flux and divergence this implies that in addition to the possible causes of moisture transport and atmospheric dynamic anomalies which are closely related to sea surface temperature and the atmosphere s internal variability other forcings e g greenhouse gases aerosols solar activities and topography should also be more or less responsible for anomalous p these factors can directly or indirectly impact p processes via a series of complex physical processes and mechanisms bollasina et al 2011 marvel and bonfils 2013 liao et al 2015 sarojini et al 2016 ning et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 for example greenhouse gases induce global warming and thereby change the hydrological cycle including p liu et al 2015a b c shi et al 2015 through aerosol radiation direct effect and aerosol cloud interactions indirect effect aerosols can contribute to p variations liao et al 2015 and even exert greater impacts on p than do greenhouse gases bollasina et al 2011 as one of the major sources of energy for forcing the climate system any solar variations e g an 11 year solar cycle will be more or less reflected in p van loon and meehl 2012 kodera and shibata 2006 chen et al 2015a zhao et al 2017 p is strongly impacted by topography more complex terrain over swc in fig 1 e g liu et al 2015b c local evapotranspiration e g huang and cui 2015 wei et al 2015 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b and land use cover change e g urbanization chen et al 2015b and deforestation devaraju et al 2015 it should be noted that these influential factors including the natural internal variability of the climate system external forcings and others are not independent but may often be mutually connected through atmospheric circulation and complex physical processes and mechanisms the potential causes of p anomalies are extremely complex therefore to further explore the related explanations we need to quantitatively and comprehensively consider these driving factors and their linkages in future research 4 2 attribution of positive et0 anomalies over drought regions during 2009 2011 despite numerous analyses of long term changes i e linear trends sun et al 2017b in et0 in swc the changes in the magnitude of et0 in the context of droughts and which climate variables control et0 variations have scarcely been investigated to date as noted above we found that both the annual and monthly et0 values averaged over drought regions increase by different rates thereby intensifying the drought to some extent therefore we identified et0 changes over drought regions which should be helpful in understanding drought evolutions well fig 12a suggests that changes in each driving factor i e increased ssd tave and u2 and decreased rh not shown here generally increased the annual et0 over drought regions during the study period however each factor s contribution differed from year to year thus the dominant factor with the largest contribution of positive et0 anomalies exhibited inter annual variations i e negative rh positive u2 negative rh and positive tave and negative rh anomalies contributing primarily in the 1960s 1970 s 1980s and 1991 2012 respectively moreover the contributions of rh and tave were both greater than 10 mm during 2009 2012 which suggests that these two factors play critical roles in the positive anomalies of annual et0 as depicted in fig 12b each factor had an essentially positive contribution to the monthly drought regions et0 except for u2 which had smaller 0 3 mm negative contributions in several months e g june and july 2009 february and may 2010 and april 2011 a comparison of the contributions of each factor shows that the increased tave should be responsible for the positive et0 anomalies in january november 2009 11 mon february and june november 2010 7 mon and june august and october 2011 4 mon while other months have the determinant of decreased rh it is apparent that at the overwhelming majority of grids 90 aswc the annual et0 in the three selected years increased to different degrees i e the larger values 40 mm occurred mainly in western wgx and the junction of yn and gz in 2009 fig 13 a1 throughout yn excluding the west part northwestern wgx and southwestern gz in 2010 fig 13a2 and at the junction of yn sc cq and gz and in northern wgx in 2011 fig 13a3 in the context of drought the annual et0 generally increased due to increased ssd for most grids during 2009 2011 fig 13b1 3 especially for 2011 with an area percentage of more than 90 aswc however the contributions were all smaller than 30 mm as seen in fig 13c1 3 fig 13d1 3 more than 90 nomalies notably there were similar spatial distributions of tave and rh contributions followed by a center of higher values 20 mm in most of wgx in 2009 yn excluding the western parts in 2010 and at the junction of sc yn and cq in 2011 the u2 contribution in each year fig 13e1 3 is spatially complex generally being characterized by nearly 50 aswc with positive impacts table 3 illustrates that on an annual scale more than 80 aswc had the major contributors of tave and rh the area percentage of the tave determinant 70 88 aswc was much larger than that of the rh determinant 17 57 aswc in 2009 but the area percentages of these two factors were comparable approximately 40 aswc despite all of that their distributions differed from year to year in 2009 the tave determinant was widely distributed over swc except in mid western sc northwestern gz some parts of yn and southwestern wgx with the rh determinant fig 13f1 in 2010 the tave determinant was mainly located in northern swc excluding mid western sc and southwestern yn fig 13f2 in 2011 western swc southern cq and western gz basically had the tave determinant fig 13f3 as table 3 shows except in a few months i e july and august 2009 and december 2011 the monthly et0 anomalies over most of the drought regions could be attributed to tave or rh for the period of 2009 2011 essentially the anomalously higher tave or lower rh should be responsible for the positive et0 anomalies over the drought regions on different spatial i e the entire swc and thiessen grid and temporal i e annual and monthly scales while the ssd and u2 contributions are much more limited 4 3 uncertainties there exist some uncertainties in this study mainly because of the constant albedo of the land surface 0 23 here elevated co2 soil properties vegetation drought interaction etc because of the limited availability of solar radiation measurements in swc ssd was selected to estimate rn at the 269 sites using the semi physical formulas proposed by allen et al 1998 shown in supplementary text s1 in these equations an important parameter of land surface albedo is fixed at 0 23 but in practice this parameter exhibits evident spatiotemporal variations with climate conditions soil moisture and land use cover liang et al 1998 zhang et al 2012 mira et al 2015 as a result the assumption of constant albedo may introduces uncertainties into the calculated rn and even into et0 potentially biasing spei 3 based on assumptions of a single leaf stomatal resistance of 100 s m under well watered conditions a sunlit leaf area index lai of 1 44 m2 m2 and a surface resistance of 70 s m allen et al 1998 the fao 56 penman monteith equation was developed from the original penman monteith form nevertheless numerous pieces of evidence from observations and numerical simulations have proven that plant physiology responds directly to increasing co2 levels through changes in stomatal resistance and lai feller 2016 gray and brady 2016 xu et al 2016 paschalis et al 2017 thus there is no doubt that the confidence levels of our results will be impacted by the effects of elevated co2 on vegetation that are not considered by the fao 56 penman monteith in a recent study using drought metrics with et0 estimates from several variants of the penman monteith equation milly and dunne 2016 noted that continental drying might be exaggerated largely because of neglect of the bulk stomatal conductance response to enhanced co2 levels within the penman monteith variants a closer relationship exists between soil moisture which can reflect drought and soil types properties which play important roles in controlling the duration and quantity of water storage in soil layers park et al 2004 reported that differences in the water holding capacity of soil types could explain most spatial variations in soil moisture implying that soil types properties should be integrated into various drought metrics to more accurately characterize drought characteristics vegetation and droughts can interact in a very complex way for instance drought appears to be accompanied by decreased precipitation that leads to lower soil moisture and subsequently influences vegetation by controlling stomatal conductance and lai feller 2016 gray and brady 2016 feller 2016 noted that in drought conditions plant stomata were less open or epicuticular waxes were produced and leaf transpiration therefore decreased furthermore droughts particularly more severe droughts usually induce a higher vapor pressure gradient between leaves and the atmosphere leading to stress on the plant hydraulic system reichstein et al 2013 meir et al 2015 embolism and partial failure of hydraulic transport in the stem and even the potential for vegetation mortality allen et al 2010 scott et al 2010 duan et al 2013 gea izquierdo et al 2014 conversely precipitation received by the land surface et and soil moisture losses are significantly impacted by drought induced vegetation changes or mortality varying drought evolutions teuling et al 2010 in addition several limitations of this study should be kept in mind one widely used drought index on a three month scale i e spei 3 coupled with only the fao 56 penman monteith equation was employed in this study and this approach may potentially influence the universality of our findings e g whether the roles of p and et0 in drought evolutions are consistent among different drought indices on various time scales and for a specific drought index with different potential evapotranspiration formulations considering the complex associations of drought with p and et0 expressing their separate contributions by means of linear equations i e eq 3 may have introduced some uncertainties into our results despite the better performance achieved in quantifying the impacts of p and et0 on spei 3 anomalies thus ignoring the influences of the aforementioned factors may have introduced some degree of uncertainty in the results of the present study however the mechanisms and magnitudes of these incomplete considerations that may influence drought evolutions remain unclear because of the complicated linkages among them therefore more effort should be devoted to this issue in future work to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of drought mechanisms 5 conclusions in this study we utilized the 2009 2011 droughts as an example to investigate p et0 and drought evolution over drought regions the annual and monthly p et0 during 2009 2011 were always lower higher than the climatological values which probably triggered a water deficit and allowed it to persist through the decreasing water supply increasing water demand under the combined effects of larger negative p and positive et0 anomalies in each study year an overwhelming majority of swc experienced at least once drought and the annual di dd was lower greater than 0 6 yr 5 mon over more than 40 aswc moreover the 2009 drought was the second most severe of the 1961 2012 period based on the selected drought parameters on a monthly scale the drought evolution obviously varied from year to year e g the drought severity was stronger in february march 2009 september 2009 march 2010 and june october 2011 to better understand the roles of the p and et0 anomalies in influencing drought evolution we separated their individual contributions to di da and dd for the mean for all of the drought regions the main contributor to annual di da was p during 2009 and 2011 followed by et0 et0 or p and et0 furthermore dd could be attributed to p reduction in each of the three years at the thiessen grid scale in spite of most grids having determinants of p some grids still had et0 et0 or p and et0 as the major contributor to annual di dd on a monthly scale di da in january march can generally be attributed to et0 et0 or p and et0 for the three years while the other months had a dominant p based on a full analysis of the p and et0 contributions to drought parameters the drought occurrence and persistence during 2009 2011 can generally be attributed to p reduction over swc however the et0 impacts were comparable to those of p and even larger in certain regions and periods these findings suggest that et0 is critical in spatiotemporal drought evolutions and even plays a determinant role in summary detailed analyses such as those conducted in this study facilitate a better understanding of the ongoing and intensifying droughts in swc quantitative information e g spatiotemporal differences in drought dominants can be used to improve drought monitoring and forecasting systems more importantly the results of our study provide an important reference framework for understanding droughts and their underlying mechanisms throughout other regions of the globe especially those with intensifying droughts acknowledgements

6821,with intensifying climate change droughts over southwest china swc are drawing increasing interest the droughts of 2009 2011 have attracted special concern however the roles of atmospheric evaporative demand reflected by reference evapotranspiration et0 and precipitation p anomalies in drought evolutions are still unclear to that end we revisited the evolution of the 2009 2011 swc meteorological droughts quantitatively and comprehensively by quantifying the et0 and p impacts in terms of three drought parameters i e drought intensity di area da and duration dd swc experienced the second most severe drought of the 1961 2012 period in 2009 evident differences existed among the drought conditions in different months i e more severe droughts occurred in february march 2009 september 2009 to march 2010 and june october 2011 based on the annual means over drought regions the 2009 and 2011 di da could be attributed to lower p but the p and et0 impacts p et0 and p and et0 which reflects drought occurrence due to their combined impacts only were comparable in 2010 in addition p reduction was responsible for dd during 2009 2011 except in january march which were dominated mostly by p di da was generally dominated by et0 et0 or p and et0 over the three years while p dominated spatially and temporally for the majority of the 36 months for di dd some areas were mainly affected by et0 et0 or p and et0 therefore to better understand drought evolutions and improve drought monitoring and forecasting the impacts of et0 anomalies should be fully considered the results of this study provide an important reference framework for comprehensively understanding the underlying mechanisms of droughts not only in swc but also in other regions around the world keywords drought processes separation method standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index climate anomaly southwest china 1 introduction drought characterized by below normal water availability over a period from several months to a few decades is a complex important and recurrent extreme climate event for a region dai 2011 sheffield et al 2012 a drought usually exerts negative and far reaching impacts on social economic and environmental sectors droughts accompanied by heat waves are estimated to have cost around 210 1 billion u s during 1980 2011 ganguli and ganguly 2016 the 2008 2009 winter drought in northeastern china one of the worst droughts in the past 50 years resulted in more than 10 million people lacking drinking water and economic losses of nearly 2 3 billion wang et al 2011 drought is regarded as one of the most damaging natural disasters wilhite 2000 and is a perennial concern for the public and governments across the globe in recent decades in particular droughts have occurred more frequently with greater intensities and longer durations and have affected larger spatial areas possibly due to intensifying climate change sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 ipcc 2014 trenberth et al 2014 williams et al 2015 therefore the spatiotemporal characteristics underlying mechanisms and related impacts of droughts have been receiving increasing attention on both regional and global scales examples include the spatiotemporal trends of droughts in the u s ganguli and ganguly 2016 china yu et al 2014 and europe spinoni et al 2017 the linkage between droughts and

impacts on the u s ecosystem sun et al 2015 and the water energy nexus in texas scanlon et al 2013 various natural disasters and drought in particular have affected china frequently between 1949 and 2013 an average of approximately 2 1 105 km2 of cropland accounting for nearly 16 7 of the total arable area was impacted by drought annually zhai et al 2017 droughts can happen anywhere in regions with more or less climatological p and anytime in wet or dry months however due to differences in climatological backgrounds and climate change drought variations i e intensity duration frequency and extent differ from region to region zou et al 2005 she and xia 2013 wang and chen 2012 huang et al 2015 choi et al 2016 ma et al 2016 wang et al 2015a b zhang et al 2016 2017a for example using the palmer drought severity index pdsi choi et al 2016 showed that the drought intensity in north china strengthened throughout all seasons during 1979 2005 especially in the summer and fall in recent decades the yellow river has remained below normal levels for long periods of time she and xia 2013 and zero flow has even happened regularly in its lower reaches since the 1970s which implies high drought risk in the yellow river basin huang et al 2015 ma et al 2016 wang et al 2015a b employed the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to explore drought evolution from 1960 to 2010 in northwest china a typically arid region and determined that the region had become wetter on both annual and seasonal scales despite no obvious changes occurring in the pdsi for the entire yangtze river basin during 1961 2005 the middle the lower and upper part s of this basin exhibited statistically significant downward upward trend zhai et al 2010 with drought aggravation in the northern traditionally arid regions of china the southern and eastern wet regions have experienced more frequent and more severe e g higher intensity and more widespread droughts since the beginning of the 21st century liu et al 2012 for example severe droughts occurred in sichuan sc province in the autumns of 2004 and 2007 despite there being thousands of rivers within this region a once in a century drought occurred in 2006 in chongqing cq and a severe and prolonged drought occurred from the autumn of 2009 to the spring of 2010 in southwest china swc among these the 2009 2010 drought in swc was believed to be a record breaking event from the perspective of historical meteorological observations during this drought most rivers shrank to 30 80 of their normal volumes and some even dried up completely approximately 21 million people lacked drinking water and economic losses reached nearly 30 billion lu et al 2011 2014 yang et al 2012a b because of the far reaching and devastating impacts of this drought throughout swc the chinese government and academic researchers e g meteorologists hydrologists agriculturalists ecologists and economists have paid particular attention to this event moreover there is general agreement that drought occurrence in swc has become more frequent and intense during the past 50 years and that these trends will continue in the future wang and chen 2012 wang et al 2014a b 2015a b thus to better mitigate increasing drought risks and reduce drought induced losses in swc it is urgent and critically important to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of drought and its relevant underlying mechanisms comprehensively considering the close association between p the major water supply component and drought numerous scholars have worked to identify possible causes of negative p anomalies based on drought generalities and case studies li et al 2009 xu et al 2012 huang et al 2012 yang et al 2012a b zhang et al 2013a b 2014 wang et al 2015a b liu et al 2017a b yang et al 2012a b found that swc p was significantly and positively correlated with the arctic oscillation ao index which suggests that a negative ao phase might correspond to drought in this region xu et al 2012 stated that despite a significant positive relationship between the north atlantic oscillation nao and swc p in boreal winter the nao asymmetrically impacted p i e the nao negative phase could clearly generate a p deficiency but the positive phase could only induce limited increases in p zhang et al 2013a b noted that the concurrent distinctive warm pool during el niño could have created a strongly anomalous cyclone over the western north pacific resulting in a serious reduction in swc p a severe drought in the autumn of 2009 liu et al 2017a b suggested that severe summer and early fall droughts in swc occurred mainly due to negative water vapor transport anomalies from the indo china peninsula channel it is worth noting that the vast majority of studies on swc droughts have focused on p anomalies and their associated mechanisms paying little or no attention to the effects of aed depending on the soil water balance aed can play an important role in soil water losses hobbins et al 2008 which areintimately related to dryness wetness and drought variations furthermore this close relationship has been confirmed around the world hu and willson 2000 dai 2013 ipcc 2014 williams et al 2015 shukla et al 2015 diffenbaugh et al 2015 sun et al 2017a with some researchers warning that ignoring the influence of aed may result in

consequences for the region s environment and various socioeconomic sectors a number of studies have been conducted on these events using a variety of drought indices e g yang et al 2012a b yan et al 2013 long et al 2014 wang et al 2014a b cui et al 2015 liu et al 2016 2017a b while these studies have led to improved understanding of drought processes two major unresolved issues remain 1 the role that aed plays in the spatiotemporal evolution of drought and 2 whether droughts are always dependent on p anomalies to address these questions we revisited the 2009 2011 swc meteorological drought evolutions comprehensively and quantitatively by considering the effects of p and aed reflected by et0 in this study the major objectives of this study were as follows 1 to analyze the values of annual and monthly drought parameters i e drought intensity duration and extent during 2009 2011 based on a three month spei spei 3 2 to quantify the respective contributions of anomalous p and et0 based on several sensitivity experiments and a separation method proposed by sun et al 2014 2017b and 3 to address the two unresolved issues in the aforementioned analyses the results of this study allow us to better understand meteorological drought evolutions in response to climate anomalies over swc 2 data and methodology 2 1 study region this study region of swc between 21 and 34 n and 97 110 e mainly includes sc cq guizhou gz yunnan yn and the western part of guangxi wgx province it encompasses a large geographic area with complex landscapes e g the plateau of yn gz and western sc the eastern sc hills the hengduan mountains and the sc basin a typical subtropical monsoon climate prevails across swc with a clearly defined dry wet season over this region regional mean monthly p increases quickly starting in april peaks in july and sharply decreases afterward for the monthly et0 the regional mean has two peaks in may and july during 1961 2012 the annual p et0 is 1000 mm 980 mm and shows large spatial differences with a range from 700 mm 900 mm in western sc northeastern swc to 1400 mm 1000 mm in wgx yn 2 2 data for computing the penman monteith et0 allen et al 1998 and the spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and conducting sensitivity experiments we collected monthly meteorological datasets from the china meteorological administration cma mainly including p mm mean maximum and minimum air temperatures c 10 m wind speed m s ssd h mon and relative humidity the datasets span 1960 2012 with observations at 334 sites before using the data two data quality issues of inhomogeneity and missing values were resolved first the pettitt test is employed to check the time series homogeneity wijngaard et al 2003 and variables that cannot pass the significance test p 0 05 are eliminated subsequently the sites with data available for fewer than 10 months each year are also removed the missing values in the records of the other stations are filled using the data from nearby sites with a linear regression after this quality control process data from 269 sites remained fig 1 considering thespatiallyunevenfeatures of these sites which potentially introduce uncertainties into the results e g the regional mean the thiessen polygon method is employed for obtaining the area represented by each site fig 1 in addition the daily ncep ncar reanalysis 1 kalnay et al 1996 dataset during 1960 2012 including wind speed and specific humidity is utilized these data are used to calculate the monthly column integrated water vapor flux from the surface to 300 hpa and divergence during 2009 2011 and their corresponding monthly anomalies relative to the multi year 1961 2012 mean through comparing the monthly anomalies of p against those of water vapor flux and divergence the possible causes of negative p anomalies will be briefly discussed from perspective of the atmospheric circulation patterns 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 computing et0 and spei 3 to date hundreds of approaches for determining aed have been proposed xu and singh 2001 including the use of a water budget e g guitjens 1982 mass transfer e g harbeck 1962 radiation based approaches e g priestley and taylor 1972 temperature based approaches e g thornthwaite 1948 and combinations of these other approaches e g penman and penman monteith allen et al 1998 liu et al 2018 the penman monteith equation considers various climatic variables i e temperature water vapor deficit ssd or net radiation and wind speed which suggests that this method incorporates a comprehensive physical concept of evapotranspiration processes to better reflect the effects of climate anomalies on aed as well as spei 3 or drought we used an equation of the penman monteith type i e the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 56 equation allen et al 1998 to estimate et0 for representing aed this equation is written as follows 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 tave 273 u 2 e s 1 rh δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn mj m2 d is the net radiation at the surface which is closely related to ssd detailed computations are shown in supplementary text s1 g mj m2 d is the soil heat flux density which can be ignored at monthly or longer scales γ kpa c and δ kpa c are the psychometric constant and the rate of change in vapor pressure with temperature respectively u2 m s is the 2 m wind speed converted from the 10 m wind speed rh and es kpa are the relative humidity and saturation vapor pressure respectively and tave c is the mean temperature more information about γ δ es and u2 computations can be found in allen et al 1998 using drought statistics from various yearbooks of meteorological disasters wang and chen 2012 evaluated results from the spei model for swc and found that this index could reproduce the principal meteorological drought features in this region well therefore this index was chosen to represent dryness wetness in swc and to determine the values of drought parameters spei which is based on the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 was proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 it is easy to calculate and can flexibly track dry wet events on various time scales monthly p and et0 data are usually necessary to calculate the climatic water balance d p et0 for a certain month before they are aggregated at various time scales a three parameter log logistic distribution is recommended to fit the d time series for each month an inverse normal function is then used to standardize the probabilities vicente serrano et al 2010 in a certain region negative and positive spei values typically indicate dry and wet conditions respectively in this study we focused on short and medium term meteorological droughts which are closely associated with agricultural droughts as defined by soil moisture hao and singh 2015 wu et al 2015 in our preliminary work not shown here we calculated the correlation coefficients rs of the 1 3 6 9 and 12 month spei with gladas2 0 noah global land data assimilation system version 2 0 with the noah model soil moisture anomalies over swc on a monthly scale and found that the spei 3 corresponded to the largest r which suggests that the spei 3 best represents agricultural drought over swc thus the spei 3 was selected for further analyses monthly et0 and spei 3 time series during 1961 2012 were calculated for 269 sites in swc and then annual p and et0 spei 3 values were obtained by summing averaging the monthly values for each year 2 3 2 separating the respective contributions of p and et0 to spei 3 anomalies it is difficult to separate the respective contributions of p and et0 to spei 3 anomalies because of the compounding effects of these driving factors interactions to resolve this issue sun et al 2014 2017b proposed a new separation method based on several sensitivity experiments this method has been employed for attributing linear trends in streamflow and evapotranspiration in the poyang lake basin of china and et0 in swc notably the original version of the method was developed to quantify the individual contributions of each factor to the linear trends in hydrometeorological parameters thus we have improved this method to satisfy this study s aims of differentiating between the contributions of p and et0 to annual and monthly spei 3 anomalies two validation metrics i e r and scatter plots were selected to evaluate the performance of this improved approach details of the results are presented in section 3 2 1 like the separation method proposed by sun et al 2014 2017b the method developed in this study involves two major procedures i e reasonable sensitivity experiments table 1 and an efficient algorithm eqs 2 and 3 for determining the individual contribution of each factor six i e one control and five sensitivity experiments were designed and conducted with the spei model the control experiment spei ctl was run with all of the original climate variables i e remaining intra and inter annual fluctuations during 1960 2012 as inputs however for the ith sensitivity experiment spei non i the inputs for the 52 year 1961 2012 climatological mean of the ith factor for each month i e only the remaining intra annual fluctuation and the original monthly time series of the other four factors during 1960 2012 were used the sensitivity experiments for p ssd tave u2 and rh are referred to here as spei non p spei non ssd spei non tave spei non u2 and spei non rh respectively given that differences in the log logistic probability distribution parameters exist among these six experiments and thus introduce uncertainties into the results the estimated parameters of the spei model from spei ctl were utilized in running the five sensitivity experiments monthly spei 3 anomalies for each experiment were obtained by subtracting the 52 year mean taking spei non i as an example an equation was established based on the hypothesis that spei anomalies are caused by the remaining factors except for the ith factor represented as follows 2 k i n c i k j k v i k j spei non i where k i n c i k j k is the total contribution to the monthly spei non i spei 3 anomalies at the ith grid during the jth month of the kth year n is the number of sensitivity experiments 5 here and v i k j spei non i is the monthly spei 3 anomalies from the spei non i experiment at the ith grid during the jth month of the kth year we thus obtained a set of simultaneous equations including five unknown numbers i e c i k j p c i k j ssd c i k j tave c i k j u 2 and c i k j rh by solving these equations the contribution of the ith factor at the ith grid during the jth month of the kth year can be computed as follows 3 c i k j k k i n v i k j spei non k n 2 v i k j spei non i n 1 in this study the et0 contribution to spei 3 anomalies was represented as the sum of the respective contributions of ssd tave u2 and rh additionally the separation method described above was employed to quantify the impacts of ssd tave rh and u2 on annual and monthly et0 anomalies in drought regions however it should be noted that the corresponding designations of experiments are different than those for drought attributions details are shown in table s1 2 3 3 quantifying climate anomaly impacts on drought parameters 2 3 3 1 identifying drought parameters in real time a threshold is required to determine whether a given month experiences drought at a certain thiessen grid in this study the drought threshold was set to 1 0 if the monthly spei 3 is 1 0 in a given month drought occurs and vice versa therefore we were able to extract the values of drought parameters i e drought intensity di area da and duration dd from the spei ctl results as follows 4 di i k j spei i k j if spei ctl spei i k j 1 0 di swc k j i 1 269 di i k j a i y i k j a swc a swc i 1 269 a i y i k j 1 if spei ctl spei i k j 1 0 y i k j 0 if spei ctl spei i k j 1 0 di i k j 1 12 di i k j 12 di swc k j 1 12 di swc k j 12 5 da k j i 1 269 a i y i k j a swc da k j 1 12 da k j 6 dd i k i 1 269 y i k j dd swc k j 1 12 dd i k a i a swc where dii k j and spei ctl speii k j are di and spei ctl spei 3 respectively in the jth month of the kth year at the ith grid diswc k j is the swc regional mean di in the jth month of the kth year dii k and ddi k are the annual di and dd respectively at the ith grid in the kth year diswc k ddswc k is the swc regional mean di dd in the kth year dak j is the da in the jth month of the kth year dak is the annual total da in the kth year and aswc is the area of swc based on the above equations and spei ctl spei 3 monthly and annual drought characteristics were identified for further analyses of drought conditions during 2009 2011 2 3 3 2 quantifying climate anomaly impacts considering our major objective of determining climate anomaly impacts on drought characteristics in real time we focused on drought regions during a specific month which could be identified by spei ctl spei 3 1 0 with eq 5 and could thus be represented as a condition of if spei ctl speii k j 1 0 the quantitative impacts of p or et0 on di were estimated as follows 7 x cdi i k j x c i k j if spei ctl spei i k j 1 0 x cdi i k j 1 12 x c i k j 12 x cdi swc k j i 1 269 x cdi i k j a i y i k j a swc x cdi swc k j 1 12 x cdi swc k j 12 where xcdii k j xcdiswc k j is the contribution of the x p or et0 anomaly to di at the ith grid swc in the jth month of the kth year and xcdii k xcdiswc k is the contribution of the x anomaly at the ith grid swc in the kth year by comparing the magnitudes of the p and et0 contributions the dominant contributors can be divided into two types i e with p et0 being dominant with larger magnitudes in contrast to di attribution da and dd are closely associated with whether monthly precipitation or et0 anomaly alone triggers drought namely whether the effect of p or et0 alone plus the multi year mean 1961 2012 monthly spei ctl spei 3 is 1 0 therefore based on the separate contributions of p and et0 alone on monthly spei 3 anomalies we were able to reconstruct a new monthly spei 3 time series by summarizing the multi year mean monthly spei ctl spei 3 and p spei ponly et0 spei et0only contribution which only reflects the p et0 impact then several possible conditions were established specifically for a given drought month i e spei ctl spei 3 1 0 on a certain grid 1 drought disappears in the spei ponly and spei et0only scenarios because spei 3 1 0 thus drought occurrence can be attributed to the summarized contributions of p and et0 2 drought exists in the spei ponly spei et0only scenario rather than in the spei et0only spei ponly scenario thus p et0 is regarded as the major contributor to drought occurrence 3 drought occurs in the spei ponly and spei et0only scenarios which suggests that the impacts from p or et0 alone can induce drought consistently we can define the determinants as four types p and et0 p et0 and p or et0 these four determinants contributions to dd and da can be estimated as follows 8 x cdd i k j 1 12 x i j k x cda k

contribution of x in the jth month of the kth year xcdak is the contribution of x in the kth year and spei ponly speii k j and spei et0only speii k j represent spei 3 from spei ponly and spei et0only in the jth month of the kth year at the ith grid respectively 3 results 3 1 recent climate conditions 3 1 1 p and et0 anomalies during 2009 2011 during 1961 2012 the annual swc p was mostly above normal before 2000 and then became negative afterward fig 2 a1 in a ranking of the 52 year p records the 2009 and 2011p values were the second lowest anomalies of 142 94 mm and lowest anomalies of 163 52 mm respectively followed by the lowest three years running mean during 2009 2011 anomalies of 113 36 mm the time series of the annual swc et0 fig 2b1 demonstrates positive anomalies before 1980 and after 2000 but negative ones between these two periods corresponding to the annual swc p during 2009 2011 positive anomalies of the annual swc et0 fig 2b1 are found with values of approximately 20 mm undoubtedly a higher et0 more water demand and lower p less water supply would be likely to have exacerbated the water deficit over swc during the preceding three years to better understand the p and et0 anomalies over drought regions we also calculated their annual values during 1961 2012 fig 2a1 and b1 for p and et0 respectively it is evident that swc droughts are always accompanied by negative p and positive et0 anomalies interestingly the p and et0 anomalies of swc are closer to those of drought regions since 2005 especially for 2009 2011 which suggests that drought occurred widely and severely over swc in this period the intra annual p et0 anomalies over swc and drought regions during 2009 2011 were plotted as shown in fig 2a2 fig 2b2 to illustrate the drought evolution in those three years obviously both swc and drought regions exhibit different water deficit levels p anomalies 0 for most of the 36 months especially for september november 2009 and july september 2011 with larger anomalies of 20 mm fig 2a2 as indicated in fig 2b2 there generally exists a similar intra annual fluctuation of the et0 anomaly between drought regions and swc characterized by maxima 5 mm in october november 2009 february march 2010 and july october 2011 moreover the drought regions et0 anomalies are always positive for each month consequently intensifying the water deficit by creating more water demand in summary under the combined effects of negative p and positive et0 with higher anomaly magnitudes there is potential for the occurrence of more severe droughts over swc 3 1 2 spei 3 and drought characteristics during 2009 2011 to examine the dry wet conditions and drought characteristics over swc we calculated the annual swc spei 3 and identified relevant drought parameters di da and dd which are shown in fig 3 fig 3a shows that swc was generally wetter spei 3 0 in the 1960s 1990s 2000s and the first half of the 2010s but drier spei 3 0 in other years particularly after 2008 in broad terms similar trends are evident for swc da and dd fluctuations i e slight decreases since the 1990s and then sharp increases from 2000 on fig 3b and c interestingly in spite of the 1960s generally being wetter the driest year in the study period was 1969 based on spei 3 and the three drought parameters and the next driest year was 2009 0 54 yr 0 59 yr 441 aswc and 4 48 mon for spei 3 di da and dd respectively fig 3 however considering the three year running means the most severe drought in swc was found to be in 2009 2011 characterized by the lowest di 0 53 yr and the highest da 384 aswc and dd 4 06 mon mainly because of the lowest higher three year running p et0 fig 4 illustrates the spatial distributions of the annual spei 3 di and dd in 2009 2011 overall swc was drier excluding the mid north of sc in 2009 western sc westernmost yn and the mid south of wgx in 2010 and the northern and southernmost parts of swc in 2011 fig 4a1 3 the driest areas spei 3 0 8 yr were the westernmost and southern areas of swc in 2009 the mid south of swc in 2010 and southeastern sc and northern gz in 2011 it is evident that the overwhelming majority 90 aswc of swc experienced at least once drought from 2009 to 2011 fig 4b1 3 and c1 3 the annual di fig 4b1 3 dd fig 4c1 3 was less greater than 0 6 yr 5 mon over more than 40 aswc for these three years mainly in southern swc in 2009 yn except for the westernmost part and southern gz in 2010 and the mid east of swc in 2011 fig 5 illustrates the monthly evolution of the swc spei 3 and the di and dd of the drought regions during 2009 2011 except for eight months that were slightly wetter during the three year period spei 3 0 5 yr fig 5a swc was drier especially in february march 2009 september 2009 march 2010 and june october 2011 with spei 3 0 5 yr similarly based on the monthly drought regions di 0 5 yr and da 45 aswc the drought was more severe in these months fig 5b and c fig 6 illustrates the spatial distributions of the monthly spei 3 di during 2009 2011 during january and april july of 2009 limited areas in swc had drier conditions drought while larger areas suffered from drier conditions during the remaining months fig 6a in particular more than 50 aswc was subjected to drought in february mainly in southeastern swc and eastern sc fig 6a2 and during october december mainly in southern swc fig 6a10 12 in 2010 a negative spei 3 drought is widely distributed over swc in january may fig 6b1 5 and october fig 6b10 especially with drought regions covering more than 80 aswc in january and february in contrast most of swc was covered by wetter conditions in the other six months fig 6b6 9 b11 and b12 fig 6c1 3 show that more than 70 aswc was wetter during january march of 2011 whereas nearly 90 more than 50 of swc exhibited drier conditions drought in june october fig 6c6 10 however comparable areas of drier and wetter conditions were presented in the remaining months fig 6c4 c5 c11 and b12 3 2 climate anomaly impacts on drought during 2009 2011 3 2 1 performance of the separation method to obtain more accurate results regarding the contribution of each driving factor to the spei 3 anomaly the separation method proposed by sun et al 2014 2017b was further developed and employed in this study the cumulative contributions of each factor were calculated for comparison against monthly and annual spei ctl spei 3 anomalies fig 7 a shows the scatter plot of the annual cumulative contributions and spei ctl spei 3 anomalies averaged over the entirety of swc intuitively each data point of the annual spei ctl spei 3 anomaly vs cumulative contributions is closer to the 1 1 line combining the results for all 52 years a fitted linear equation was derived with a regression coefficient slp of 1 025 and an r of 0 999 we also calculated the annual slp and r at each site as shown in fig 7b and c respectively for an overwhelming majority of the 269 sites the annual slp is between 1 00 and 1 04 with r 0 998 based on these results the annual slp and r quantitatively indicate that this method can accurately identify each driving factor s contribution to annual spei 3 anomalies on regional and site based scales for the time period of 1961 2012 to further examine the robustness of this approach monthly results were also compared fig s1 3 for each month all data points of the monthly spei ctl spei 3 anomaly vs cumulative contributions are very close to the 1 1 line fig s1 with slp and r values ranging from 1 001 to 1 196 and from 0 997 to 0 999 respectively for each site figs s2 and s3 slp r is always between 0 96 and 1 04 0 998 for every month except january and february suggesting that the method as improved in this study also achieves better separation of each factor s contribution to the monthly spei 3 anomalies as a result this improved method with higher accuracy and efficiency proved to be a useful tool for quantifying the contribution of climate anomalies to spei 3 and drought indicators i e di dd and da in this study 3 2 2 contributions to di fig 8 shows the p and et0 anomalies contributions to the annual drought regions di during 2009 2011 overall di was strengthened in response to decreased p increased et0 in those three years with a p et0 contribution of 0 44 yr 0 16 yr in 2009 0 28 yr 0 22 yr in 2010 and 0 44 yr 0 09 yr in 2011 therefore the di in each year can be attributed to a negative p however it should be noted that p and et0 exerted comparable impacts on di in 2010 to understand the spatial distributions of the p and et0 contributions to the annual di in each year their impacts were estimated at each thiessen grid fig 9 in general drought occurrence is accompanied by negative contributions of p and et0 over the whole region in 2009 the p contribution ranged from 1 31 to 0 yr and was generally smaller in sc and cq and larger in other regions especially at the junction of yn gz and wgx 0 7 yr fig 9a1 for the et0 contribution the magnitude was generally lower than 0 5 yr with regions of larger values 0 2 yr in northwestern sc and yn and western wgx fig 9a2 during 2010 except for western sc and southern wgx a larger p contribution 0 2 yr was widely distributed over the remaining regions particularly in southern gz and central yn 0 4 yr fig 9a2 there was a smaller et0 contribution 0 2 yr in most of sc and wgx and in northeastern gz however the et0 contribution was lower than 0 2 yr in the other regions and even exceeded 0 5 yr at the junction of yn gz and wgx fig 9b2 the p contribution during 2011 was lower than 0 6 yr in nearly half of swc mainly in southern sc mid eastern yn and gz excluding the southern part fig 9a3 it is evident that except at the junction of yn sc gz and cq the et0 contribution in an overwhelming majority of swc was higher than 0 2 yr fig 9b3 by comparing the p and et0 contributions we identified the determinants i e p and et0 of di at the thiessen grids fig 9c1 3 the determinant of p to di was extensively distributed over swc from 2009 to 2011 corresponding to area percentages of 83 83 aswc 56 27 aswc and 86 54 aswc respectively additionally the determinant of et0 was mainly located in northwestern swc in 2009 western sc northwestern yn and the junction of yn gz and wgx in 2010 and mid western sc in 2011 fig 5b depicts the intra annual di evolution for all the drought regions with the monthly contributions of p and et0 in january march of 2009 and 2010 the increased et0 had a larger contribution to di than did the decreased p suggesting that et0 was the determinant however di can be attributed to a p reduction from april to december because of the much larger contribution of p for 2011 except in january and february when et0 dominated decreased p was the major contributor of di in the remaining months at each thiessen grid within the drought regions the monthly contributions of p and et0 to di were estimated and the dominants were thus identified fig s4 and table 2 by comparing the area percentages of p and et0 as determinants in each month table 2 the dominant of et0 was found to occupy nearly the entirety of the drought regions in january of 2009 2011 corresponding to the locations in northwestern sc fig s4g1 most of swc except for northern and mid western sc and most of wgx fig s4h1 and the junction of sc and cq fig s4i1 respectively in february the determinant of et0 for the three years had a larger area percentage which generally was manifested in sc and gz drought regions in 2009 fig s4g2 western sc and gz yn and northwestern wgx in 2010 fig s4h2 and mid northern sc in 2011 fig s4i2 except in march of 2011 fig s4i3 there was a comparable larger area percentage of the determinant of et0 in 2009 fig s4g3 2010 fig s4h3 which mainly appeared in northwestern sc and gz and mid northern wgx mid western swc for each of the remaining months the area percentage of the p determinant far outweighed that of et0 figs s4g4 12 s4h4 12 and s4i4 12 3 2 3 contributions to da and dd fig 8b depicts the contributions of p et0 p or et0 and p and et0 to the annual total da during 2009 2011 in 2009 and 2011 the p contribution to da was approximately 290 aswc followed by p and et0 with contributions of 120 aswc moreover the et0 and p or et0 contributions to da were much smaller 33 aswc especially for 2011 with percentages of 5 8 and 0 respectively in contrast the p et0 and p and et0 contributions in 2010 were comparable approximately 100 aswc in january and february of 2009 fig 5c the maximum contribution 10 aswc to monthly da was from p and et0 followed by the et0 contribution of more than 7 aswc in march p and et0 contributed to 28 9 aswc while approximately 10 aswc was determined by p during april 4 9 aswc and 12 6 aswc were controlled by p and p and et0 respectively for each month during may december p corresponded to the largest area percentages with a range of 9 9 to 62 3 aswc during january february of 2010 the major contributor to monthly da was et0 with contributions greater than 31 and p and et0 played a secondary role with contributions of approximately 20 in march the contributions of p and et0 et0 and p were comparable approximately 15 aswc in april 13 8 aswc was dominated by p and less thna 4 aswc corresponded to the et0 or the p and et0 dominants a comparable area percentage 10 aswc from p and et0 and p was detected for may during june december da could always be attributed to p and et0 and p with p having a larger contribution 8 to 16 aswc in january and february of 2011 p and et0 was the major contributor while in the remaining months p generally governed all the drought regions with an area percentage between 6 1 aswc in march and 57 5 aswc in september spatial distributions of the dominants of the monthly da during 2009 2011 are depicted in fig s5 briefly the spatial distributions of the dominants differ from month to month details of the analyses can be found in text s2 as with the contributors to da p reduction was probably responsible for the annual swc dd during 2009 2011 with contributions of 2 90 mon 1 50 mon and 3 20 mon respectively fig 8c p and et0 in 2009 and p and et0 and et0 in 2010 were 1 00 mon and played secondary roles in the annual swc dd while the impacts of et0 not including et0 in 2010 and p or et0 in 2009 2011 were very limited particularly for p or et0 with contributions less than 0 10 mon for all thiessen grids we calculated the p et0 p or et0 and p and et0 contributions to the annual dd from 2009 to 2011 fig 10 in 2009 fig 10a1 the determinant of p with contributions 1 mon to the annual dd was widely distributed over the drought regions moreover its contribution was 4 mon in most of southern swc especially at the junction of yn gz and wgx 5 mon as seen from their contributions 4 mon and spatial extents fig 10a2 3 et0 or p or et0 were dominant only in certain months and regions while most grids had a determinant of p and et0 fig 10a4 its contribution was 3 mon except for several grids in mid western yn 5 mon in 2010 fig 10b1 b2 and b4 p et0 or p and et0 had extensive spatial extents 50 aswc as determinants for annual dd but their contributions generally ranged from 1 to 4 mon as shown in fig 10b2 a very limited spatial extent generally corresponds to a p or et0 dominant with a contribution between 1 and 2 mon compared to each factor s contribution to the annual dd and spatial extent in 2011 fig 10c1 4 there were larger regions with p contributions 4 mon in the middle of swc suggesting that drought occurrences in most of the months of 2011 were closely associated with p despite there having been a greater spatial extent for the dominant of p and et0 its contribution was generally 2 mon which suggests that this factor was critical for drought occurrences in several months fig 10c4 in addition it is very evident that the role of et0 or p or et0 in the 2011 drought occurrences was very limited given the contributions of 1 mon in several grids 4 discussion 4 1 circulation patterns associated with negative p anomalies over swc during 2009 2011 as discussed above negative p anomalies occurred over swc from 2009 to 2011 with the 2009 and 2011p anomalies ranking in the top two events during 1961 2012 additionally negative p anomalies were more obvious during august november 2009 fig 2a2 and fig 11 a and july october 2011 fig 2a2 and fig 11b as a result we chose to focus on these months to briefly examine the possible causes of negative p anomalies from atmospheric circulation patterns fig 11c and d fig 11a shows that negative p anomalies were larger in the middle and southern parts of swc during august november 2009 coincident with concurrent greater di fig 6a8 11 the column integrated water vapor flux indicates a strong cyclonic anomaly over the tropical west pacific with strengthened southwestward water vapor flux anomalies in the middle and southern portions of swc during august november 2009 fig 11c the warm tropical northwest pacific sea surface temperature related to el niño has been proposed as a forcing for this cyclonic anomaly zhang et al 2013a b wang et al 2015a b thereby weakening the transport of moisture from the northwest pacific into swc on the other hand although a weak cyclonic anomaly is located in the east of the bay of bengal fig 11c its poleward water vapor flux anomalies are suppressed in contrast to the reinforced westerly anomalies in the vicinity of the equatorial indian ocean due to the warm tropical northwest pacific sea surface temperature wang et al 2015a b as a result anomalous water vapor flux divergence dominated the middle and south of swc during august november 2009 fig 11c as seen from fig 11d the swc circulation patterns during july october 2011 were to some degree akin to those during august november 2009 that is enhanced northeasterly water vapor flux anomalies associated with an anomalous tropical western pacific low prevailed in the eastern and southern portions of swc southerly water vapor flux anomalies with respect to the weak cyclonic anomaly centered in the east bay of bengal are obviously relaxed fig 11d therefore anomalous water vapor flux divergence is predominant in those regions fig 11d and reduces p notably the spatial patterns of p anomalies are not strictly consistent with those of anomalous water vapor flux and divergence this implies that in addition to the possible causes of moisture transport and atmospheric dynamic anomalies which are closely related to sea surface temperature and the atmosphere s internal variability other forcings e g greenhouse gases aerosols solar activities and topography should also be more or less responsible for anomalous p these factors can directly or indirectly impact p processes via a series of complex physical processes and mechanisms bollasina et al 2011 marvel and bonfils 2013 liao et al 2015 sarojini et al 2016 ning et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 for example greenhouse gases induce global warming and thereby change the hydrological cycle including p liu et al 2015a b c shi et al 2015 through aerosol radiation direct effect and aerosol cloud interactions indirect effect aerosols can contribute to p variations liao et al 2015 and even exert greater impacts on p than do greenhouse gases bollasina et al 2011 as one of the major sources of energy for forcing the climate system any solar variations e g an 11 year solar cycle will be more or less reflected in p van loon and meehl 2012 kodera and shibata 2006 chen et al 2015a zhao et al 2017 p is strongly impacted by topography more complex terrain over swc in fig 1 e g liu et al 2015b c local evapotranspiration e g huang and cui 2015 wei et al 2015 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b and land use cover change e g urbanization chen et al 2015b and deforestation devaraju et al 2015 it should be noted that these influential factors including the natural internal variability of the climate system external forcings and others are not independent but may often be mutually connected through atmospheric circulation and complex physical processes and mechanisms the potential causes of p anomalies are extremely complex therefore to further explore the related explanations we need to quantitatively and comprehensively consider these driving factors and their linkages in future research 4 2 attribution of positive et0 anomalies over drought regions during 2009 2011 despite numerous analyses of long term changes i e linear trends sun et al 2017b in et0 in swc the changes in the magnitude of et0 in the context of droughts and which climate variables control et0 variations have scarcely been investigated to date as noted above we found that both the annual and monthly et0 values averaged over drought regions increase by different rates thereby intensifying the drought to some extent therefore we identified et0 changes over drought regions which should be helpful in understanding drought evolutions well fig 12a suggests that changes in each driving factor i e increased ssd tave and u2 and decreased rh not shown here generally increased the annual et0 over drought regions during the study period however each factor s contribution differed from year to year thus the dominant factor with the largest contribution of positive et0 anomalies exhibited inter annual variations i e negative rh positive u2 negative rh and positive tave and negative rh anomalies contributing primarily in the 1960s 1970 s 1980s and 1991 2012 respectively moreover the contributions of rh and tave were both greater than 10 mm during 2009 2012 which suggests that these two factors play critical roles in the positive anomalies of annual et0 as depicted in fig 12b each factor had an essentially positive contribution to the monthly drought regions et0 except for u2 which had smaller 0 3 mm negative contributions in several months e g june and july 2009 february and may 2010 and april 2011 a comparison of the contributions of each factor shows that the increased tave should be responsible for the positive et0 anomalies in january november 2009 11 mon february and june november 2010 7 mon and june august and october 2011 4 mon while other months have the determinant of decreased rh it is apparent that at the overwhelming majority of grids 90 aswc the annual et0 in the three selected years increased to different degrees i e the larger values 40 mm occurred mainly in western wgx and the junction of yn and gz in 2009 fig 13 a1 throughout yn excluding the west part northwestern wgx and southwestern gz in 2010 fig 13a2 and at the junction of yn sc cq and gz and in northern wgx in 2011 fig 13a3 in the context of drought the annual et0 generally increased due to increased ssd for most grids during 2009 2011 fig 13b1 3 especially for 2011 with an area percentage of more than 90 aswc however the contributions were all smaller than 30 mm as seen in fig 13c1 3 fig 13d1 3 more than 90 nomalies notably there were similar spatial distributions of tave and rh contributions followed by a center of higher values 20 mm in most of wgx in 2009 yn excluding the western parts in 2010 and at the junction of sc yn and cq in 2011 the u2 contribution in each year fig 13e1 3 is spatially complex generally being characterized by nearly 50 aswc with positive impacts table 3 illustrates that on an annual scale more than 80 aswc had the major contributors of tave and rh the area percentage of the tave determinant 70 88 aswc was much larger than that of the rh determinant 17 57 aswc in 2009 but the area percentages of these two factors were comparable approximately 40 aswc despite all of that their distributions differed from year to year in 2009 the tave determinant was widely distributed over swc except in mid western sc northwestern gz some parts of yn and southwestern wgx with the rh determinant fig 13f1 in 2010 the tave determinant was mainly located in northern swc excluding mid western sc and southwestern yn fig 13f2 in 2011 western swc southern cq and western gz basically had the tave determinant fig 13f3 as table 3 shows except in a few months i e july and august 2009 and december 2011 the monthly et0 anomalies over most of the drought regions could be attributed to tave or rh for the period of 2009 2011 essentially the anomalously higher tave or lower rh should be responsible for the positive et0 anomalies over the drought regions on different spatial i e the entire swc and thiessen grid and temporal i e annual and monthly scales while the ssd and u2 contributions are much more limited 4 3 uncertainties there exist some uncertainties in this study mainly because of the constant albedo of the land surface 0 23 here elevated co2 soil properties vegetation drought interaction etc because of the limited availability of solar radiation measurements in swc ssd was selected to estimate rn at the 269 sites using the semi physical formulas proposed by allen et al 1998 shown in supplementary text s1 in these equations an important parameter of land surface albedo is fixed at 0 23 but in practice this parameter exhibits evident spatiotemporal variations with climate conditions soil moisture and land use cover liang et al 1998 zhang et al 2012 mira et al 2015 as a result the assumption of constant albedo may introduces uncertainties into the calculated rn and even into et0 potentially biasing spei 3 based on assumptions of a single leaf stomatal resistance of 100 s m under well watered conditions a sunlit leaf area index lai of 1 44 m2 m2 and a surface resistance of 70 s m allen et al 1998 the fao 56 penman monteith equation was developed from the original penman monteith form nevertheless numerous pieces of evidence from observations and numerical simulations have proven that plant physiology responds directly to increasing co2 levels through changes in stomatal resistance and lai feller 2016 gray and brady 2016 xu et al 2016 paschalis et al 2017 thus there is no doubt that the confidence levels of our results will be impacted by the effects of elevated co2 on vegetation that are not considered by the fao 56 penman monteith in a recent study using drought metrics with et0 estimates from several variants of the penman monteith equation milly and dunne 2016 noted that continental drying might be exaggerated largely because of neglect of the bulk stomatal conductance response to enhanced co2 levels within the penman monteith variants a closer relationship exists between soil moisture which can reflect drought and soil types properties which play important roles in controlling the duration and quantity of water storage in soil layers park et al 2004 reported that differences in the water holding capacity of soil types could explain most spatial variations in soil moisture implying that soil types properties should be integrated into various drought metrics to more accurately characterize drought characteristics vegetation and droughts can interact in a very complex way for instance drought appears to be accompanied by decreased precipitation that leads to lower soil moisture and subsequently influences vegetation by controlling stomatal conductance and lai feller 2016 gray and brady 2016 feller 2016 noted that in drought conditions plant stomata were less open or epicuticular waxes were produced and leaf transpiration therefore decreased furthermore droughts particularly more severe droughts usually induce a higher vapor pressure gradient between leaves and the atmosphere leading to stress on the plant hydraulic system reichstein et al 2013 meir et al 2015 embolism and partial failure of hydraulic transport in the stem and even the potential for vegetation mortality allen et al 2010 scott et al 2010 duan et al 2013 gea izquierdo et al 2014 conversely precipitation received by the land surface et and soil moisture losses are significantly impacted by drought induced vegetation changes or mortality varying drought evolutions teuling et al 2010 in addition several limitations of this study should be kept in mind one widely used drought index on a three month scale i e spei 3 coupled with only the fao 56 penman monteith equation was employed in this study and this approach may potentially influence the universality of our findings e g whether the roles of p and et0 in drought evolutions are consistent among different drought indices on various time scales and for a specific drought index with different potential evapotranspiration formulations considering the complex associations of drought with p and et0 expressing their separate contributions by means of linear equations i e eq 3 may have introduced some uncertainties into our results despite the better performance achieved in quantifying the impacts of p and et0 on spei 3 anomalies thus ignoring the influences of the aforementioned factors may have introduced some degree of uncertainty in the results of the present study however the mechanisms and magnitudes of these incomplete considerations that may influence drought evolutions remain unclear because of the complicated linkages among them therefore more effort should be devoted to this issue in future work to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of drought mechanisms 5 conclusions in this study we utilized the 2009 2011 droughts as an example to investigate p et0 and drought evolution over drought regions the annual and monthly p et0 during 2009 2011 were always lower higher than the climatological values which probably triggered a water deficit and allowed it to persist through the decreasing water supply increasing water demand under the combined effects of larger negative p and positive et0 anomalies in each study year an overwhelming majority of swc experienced at least once drought and the annual di dd was lower greater than 0 6 yr 5 mon over more than 40 aswc moreover the 2009 drought was the second most severe of the 1961 2012 period based on the selected drought parameters on a monthly scale the drought evolution obviously varied from year to year e g the drought severity was stronger in february march 2009 september 2009 march 2010 and june october 2011 to better understand the roles of the p and et0 anomalies in influencing drought evolution we separated their individual contributions to di da and dd for the mean for all of the drought regions the main contributor to annual di da was p during 2009 and 2011 followed by et0 et0 or p and et0 furthermore dd could be attributed to p reduction in each of the three years at the thiessen grid scale in spite of most grids having determinants of p some grids still had et0 et0 or p and et0 as the major contributor to annual di dd on a monthly scale di da in january march can generally be attributed to et0 et0 or p and et0 for the three years while the other months had a dominant p based on a full analysis of the p and et0 contributions to drought parameters the drought occurrence and persistence during 2009 2011 can generally be attributed to p reduction over swc however the et0 impacts were comparable to those of p and even larger in certain regions and periods these findings suggest that et0 is critical in spatiotemporal drought evolutions and even plays a determinant role in summary detailed analyses such as those conducted in this study facilitate a better understanding of the ongoing and intensifying droughts in swc quantitative information e g spatiotemporal differences in drought dominants can be used to improve drought monitoring and forecasting systems more importantly the results of our study provide an important reference framework for understanding droughts and their underlying mechanisms throughout other regions of the globe especially those with intensifying droughts acknowledgements

6822,salt dissolved in soil water is transported upward to the soil surface through capillary rise from shallow groundwater leading to salt accumulation near the surface and salinization of wetlands in arid regions however it is not clear how the mechanism and feedback for evapotranspiration induces salt accumulation and precipitation here we developed a model to simulate the transport of water solutes and heat and measured the meteorological hydrological and hydraulic parameters of soil using field experiments to calibrate the model for riparian and saltmarsh wetlands in northwestern china the results showed that the annual atmospheric precipitation averaged 125 3 10 2 mm in two types of wetlands the evapotranspiration depth to the groundwater and soil salinity averaged 587 7 mm yr 1 85 4 5 4 cm and 29 80 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland while 637 2 mmyr 1 129 7 15 1 cm and 63 64 g kg 1 in the saltmarsh wetland respectively we found that the flux of liquid water flux of water vapor salinity and efflorescence had maximum values of 1 23 mm day 1 0 22 mm day 1 104 16 g kg 1 and 2 10 cm in the riparian wetland respectively versus 1 28 mm day 1 0 32 mm day 1 202 02 g kg 1 and 3 70 cm in the saltmarsh wetland our simulations show that the salinity increases significantly with increasing evapotranspiration soil temperature saturated water content and groundwater depth in the saltmarsh wetland but that the effects of saturated water content and groundwater depth were small in the riparian wetland as a result of these factors the efflorescence pattern exhibited characteristic seasonal and inter annual variability in which complex interactions among atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater and river water provided the long term driving forces for water flow and salt transport we found that the increasing efflorescence disrupted evaporation more than subflorescence which reduced the soil porosity and possibly affected water vapor transport keywords salt accumulation salt efflorescence atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater 1 introduction wetlands are important components of the ecosystems in arid regions where they significantly affect ecosystem structure and function as well as the ecological balance castañeda and herrero 2008 on the one hand these wetlands provide critical habitat for waterfowl and a refuge for endangered species on the other hand they perform water purification control desertification and moderate the climate unfortunately during the past century the hydrological regimes of these wetlands have been greatly altered by climate change and human activity as a result many of the arid wetlands have disappeared or become degraded li and zhao 2010 for example the area of desert oasis wetlands in china s heihe river basin was reduced from 280 96 km2 in 1990 to 172 91 km2 in 2000 this process led to significant environmental and ecological problems nielsen et al 2003 jolly et al 2008 such as exacerbated salinization and desertification huckelbridge et al 2010 fensham et al 2011 gran et al 2011 these changes have seriously threatened the stability of oases and agricultural development in arid regions therefore it has become increasingly urgent to prevent or mitigate the development of salinization and promote the restoration of degraded wetlands in arid regions of the world including those in china cooper et al 2006 castañeda and herrero 2008 the hydrological conditions and chemical characteristics are the primary factors that determine the type formation maintenance or degradation of a wetland crosbie et al 2009 bijoor et al 2011 glenn et al 2012 atmospheric precipitation is rare in arid regions and the infiltration of groundwater is the dominant water source in arid wetlands liu et al 2014 so that the soil s high water content due to capillary forces with the shallow water table facilitate evapotranspiration moreover evapotranspiration is an important water loss process that determines the water balance and energy exchange in wetland ecosystems gentine et al 2007 lafleur 2008 borin et al 2011 liu et al 2014 with continuous evapotranspiration salts are transported towards the soil surface through capillary rise from shallow groundwater xu et al 2005 2013 and salt accumulation in the forms of efflorescence and subflorescence causes soil salinization of arid wetlands e g huckelbridge et al 2010 fensham et al 2011 thus evapotranspiration has been recognized as an important driver for flows of water solutes and heat between the near surface soil layers and the atmosphere rose et al 2005 fujimaki et al 2006 gran et al 2011 zhanget al 2014 numerous studies indicate that the influences of evapotranspiration on salt accumulation are more complex as it is not only affected by water saturation but also salt concentration precipitation in soils e g nachshon et al 2011b for example fujimaki et al 2006 nachshonet al 2011b and zhanget al 2014 investigated the impact of evaporation on salt accumulation from a saline soil column and discussed the combined effect of heterogeneous media and salt precipitation on evaporation from soils zimmerman et al 2006 found that continuous evapotranspiration resulted in accumulation of salt and the formation of a saline boundary layer in the okavango delta geng and boufadel 2015 researched the impacts of evaporation on subsurface flow and salt accumulation in a tidally influenced beach in the gulf of mexico and the results showed that evaporation almost doubled the pore water salinity in the inter tidal zone in comparison to the case with no evaporation however the contribution of evapotranspiration to salt accumulation has not been thoroughly investigated especially in arid wetlands this process is complicated by the fact that subsequent atmospheric precipitation dilutes the evaporation induced saline plume that rises near the soil surface and causes the plume to migrate downward which simultaneously alters the pore water content and salt distribution moreover the variations of atmospheric precipitation and groundwater fluctuations affect the processes of salt accumulation dilution and desalination van der kamp et al 2003 johnson et al 2004 consequently the transport of soluble salts into and out of the wetlands is influenced by complex interactions among atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater that are highly variable and complex in both space and time van der kamp and hayashi 2009 wang et al 2009 heagle et al 2013 therefore to improve soil salinization in arid wetland ecosystems it is important to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the transport of water solutes and heat within soils and to reveal the feedback among these processes that lead to evapotranspiration induced salt accumulation and desalination induced by atmospheric precipitation salt accumulation and precipitation induced by evapotranspiration with shallow groundwater has been observed in a range of wetland environments including the swamps of botswana s okavango delta brazil s pantanal barbiero et al 2002 prairie wetlands in north america arndt and richardson 1993 australian floodplains and floodplain wetlands in south africa salt efflorescence impedes the transport of water vapor and reduces the evaporation rate by creating an impermeable layer at the soil surface thereby blocking flows of air and water much like a straw or gravel mulch fujimaki et al 2006 nachshon et al 2011a simultaneously the salt crystal developed between soil grains during subflorescence change the soil s porosity permeability to liquid water the water retention curve and heat conductivity but it is not clear how significantly such changes affect the evaporation process zhang et al 2014 therefore the field measurement was conducted in two types of wetland in arid northern china and a model was developed to simulate the transport of water solutes and heat our specific objectives were 1 to calibrate the model parameters by measuring data of the hydrological and hydraulic parameters 2 to simulate the variations of volumetric water content salinity soil temperature liquid water flux water vapor flux 3 to discuss the interaction among atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater depth and salt efflorescence we present the results of these measurements and model simulations to explore the mechanism and feedback that drive evapotranspiration induced salt

boundary conditions we used the depth to groundwater as the bottom boundary of the soil profile there was no noticeable surface runoff during the study period the top boundary conditions were defined

dimensional unsaturated partially saturated or fully saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2013 in contrast the sutra model simulates variably saturated density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport and couples the liquid water and solute transport equations hughes and sanford 2004 incorporates the mass of solid salt to solve the drawback for the precipitation and dissolution rates of salt for the hydrus 1d program we therefore coupled the two models to more fully describe soil processes by replacing the hydrus 1d solute transport algorithms with the sutra model s algorithms thereby allowing the model to simulate the impacts of groundwater and evapotranspiration on the precipitation and dissolution of salt in the arid wetlands the hydrus 1d model solves water flow eqs 1 5 and heat transport eq 10 the salt precipitation modeled by eqs 6 8 was simulated by sutra using the water flow and the solute concentration eqs 15 17 we calibrated the hydrus 1d model using the volumetric water contents θ and the soil salinity measured from soil profiles in the riparian and the saltmarsh wetland the calibration period was from 2012 to 2014 and the verification period was from 2014 to 2017 the soil hydraulic properties and the residual and saturated water contents θ r and θ s were measured in the laboratory from soil samples that were extracted from the observation plots the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was evaluated in the field the parameters α n and l were optimized using the levenberg marquardt method that was incorporated in hydrus 1d the hydraulic parameters were measured by a field experiment in the riparian wetland and the saltmarsh wetland table 1 3 study sites and data collection 3 1 study area the study area is located in the middle of

3 2 measurements 3 2 1 soil moisture salinity and groundwater measurements the field experiments were conducted in the riparian wetland and the saltmarsh wetland from 2011 to 2017 we measured the volumetric soil water content and the electrical conductivity ec dsm 1 using five ech2o 10 dielectric probes decagon devices pullman wa usa buried at five depths below the soil surface 20 40 60 80 and

to 31 20 mm fig 3 a respectively atmospheric precipitation had obvious seasonal variation mainly concentrated in summer and summer atmospheric precipitation accounted for more than 60 of annual atmospheric precipitation et increased from may to reach its maximum value in july and then decreased to its minimum value in october the measured et averaged 587 7 mm yr 1 and 637 2 mm yr 1 and the simulated et averaged 615 3 mm yr 1 and 643 4 mm yr 1 in the riparian wetland and the saltmarsh wetland respectively fig 3a groundwater depth fluctuated near the average value 85 4 5 4 cm in the riparian wetland with the maximum of 102 3 cm fig 3b whereas groundwater depth increased significantly from may in the saltmarsh wetland reaching maximum of 156 6 cm in august its average depth was 129 7 15 1 cm fig 3c moreover the measured thicknesses of the efflorescence averaged 1 32 0 35 cm and 2 19 0 65 cm with the maximum thicknesses of 2 10 cm and 3 70 cm in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland respectively fig 3b c however the simulated efflorescence averaged 1 43 0 21 and 2 45 0 63 cm at the soil surface in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland respectively fig 3b c energy partitioning showed a clear seasonal and inter annual variability the parameters in energy fluxes were best described by a unimodal curve fig 3d e the net radiation rn averaged6 83 5 45 and 7 39 4 83 mj m 2 d 1 in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland with the maximum values 18 43 and 19 68 mj m 2 d 1 in the summer and minimum values close to zero in spring and winter soil heat flux g averaged 0 05 0 78 mj m 2 d 1 ranging from 1 61 to 2 03 mj m 2 d 1 in the riparian wetland whereas the g averaged 1 11 2 46 mj m 2 d 1 ranging from 3 77 to 8 76 mj m 2 d 1in the saltmarsh wetland the temporal variation of the latent heat flux λet followed the pattern of change of rn with an average value of 3 62 4 13 and 4 33 3 61 mj m 2 d 1 and the maximum value of λet 17 16 and 17 55 mj m 2 d 1 occurred in august due to higher atmospheric precipitation and above ground biomass the sensible heat flux h averaged 3 24 3 10 and 1 96 1 68 mj m 2 d 1 with a maximum of 13 3 and 9 86 mj m 2 d 1 occurring in july in a word the rn were accounted for 53 04 and 58 69 by the λet 37 48 and 26 47 by the h and 10 74 and 14 99 by the g in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland respectively during the freezing period the moisture content near the soil surface decreased significantly but there was after only a small difference in deeper layers the minimum value was about 10 when the soil was completely frozen in early february the surface soil began to melt and soil moisture content increased to 33 and 29 in the riparian wetland fig 4 a and the saltmarsh wetland fig 4d soils respectively at the beginning of the growth season early april to late june soil moisture was stable however soil moisture decreased sharply during the middle and late growing season late june to late september during the study period the soil moisture increased gradually with the increase of soil depth soil moisture at depths of 10 20 40 60 and 80 cm averaged 26 27 28 32 and 39 in the riparian wetland and 24 25 27 34 and 37 in the saltmarsh wetland after the freezing period the soil temperature increased gradually from the surface to the deep soil fig 4b e during the melting period soil temperature changed very little and remained near a steady state the range is between 1 22 0 35 and 2 21 0 25 c in the riparian wetland between 1 56 0 59 and 2 41 0 35 c in the saltmarsh wetland respectively during the growing season soil temperature increased greatly from april to reach its maximum value in august and then decreased to its minimum value in october with an annual average of 10 16 c in the riparian wetland fig 4b and 11 04 c in the saltmarsh wetland fig 4e during the study period soil salinity followed a trend similar to that of soil moisture fig 4c f with annual averages of 29 80 and 63 64 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland respectively during the freezing period the surface salt was frozen but desalination occurred with the surface salinity decreasing from 30 62 31 g kg 1 to 18 18 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland and from 64 94 g kg 1 to about 42 62 g kg 1 in the saltmarsh wetland however the surface salinity gradually increased during the melting period due to release of the salt and salt accumulation and precipitation occurred near the soil surface due to continuous evapotranspiration the surface salinity reached maximum values of 150 66 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland fig 4c and 250 64 g kg 1 in the saltmarsh wetland fig 4f 4 2 simulation of water solute and heat transport we simulated the soil volumetric water content and temperature with the hydrus 1d model to solve the water flow and heat transport equations to determine the prediction accuracy for the salt concentration and precipitation we simulated the salt precipitation using sutra with the water flow and the solute concentration equations the temporal changes of the volumetric water content salinity and soil temperature agreed well between the simulated and the measured values in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland figs 5 6 at the beginning of the melting period in april when the surface soil horizons began to thaw the water content remained relatively high at 31 and 35 in the riparian wetland and the saltmarsh wetland respectively figs 5a 6a thereafter salt accumulated due to continuous evapotranspiration and reached maximum values of 104 16 and 202 02 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland respectively figs 5b 6b however the salinity decreased significantly with the rising water level and the dilution created by rain during the rainy season figs 5c 6c as evapotranspiration continued fluxes of liquid water and water vapor started to move upward to compensate for the water loss at the soil surface and the water vapor flux became a high proportion of the total water flux in wetland consequently salt accumulation and precipitation occurred in the upper soil layer again and a salt crust formed at the surface i e efflorescence this barrier kept the underlying soil wetter for a longer period of time and allowed more salt to accumulate below the crust therefore a second salinity peak occurred when evapotranspiration was the highest in july the maximum value of salinity liquid water flux and water vapor flux were 78 42 g kg 1 1 23 mm day 1 and 0 22 mm day 1 in the riparian wetland fig 5b d e while their maximum value were 150 0 g kg 1 1 28 mm day 1 and 0 32 mm day 1 in the saltmarsh wetland respectively fig 6b d e simultaneously the solid salt began to occupy the pore spaces between the soil particles i e subflorescence thereby reducing the porosity with an average porosity of 50 75 7 28 in the riparian wetland and 43 58 3 80 in the saltmarsh wetland table 2 in addition the tortuosity factor increased greatly with increasing depth in the soil with an average of 0 14 0 06 in the riparian wetland fig 5f and 0 09 0 09 mm in the saltmarsh wetland fig 6f thus the tortuosity factor decreased with increasing salinity figs 5b f 6b f the measured volumetric water contents matched the predicted values well r 2 0 74 p 0 05 at five depths below the soil surface for both the riparian wetland fig 7 a and the saltmarsh wetland fig 7d the slope of the linear relationship is statistically equal to 1 0 the mean relative errors mres and rmses were 8 6 and 0 04 m3m 3 respectively for the riparian wetland versus 9 9 and 0 04 m3m 3 for the saltmarsh wetland the relationships between measured and predicted soil temperatures were similarly good at five depths below the soil surface with mre of 24 and rmse 1 20 c for the riparian wetland fig 7b versus 25 1 and 1 99 c in the saltmarsh wetland fig 7e with r 2 0 98 in both cases thus the hydrus 1d model accurately predicted the soil volumetric water content and soil temperature in both ecosystems we also compared the simulated and measured values of the salinity at five depths below the soil surface in the riparian wetland fig 7c and saltmarsh wetland fig 7f the linear relationship between the measured and predicted values was compared with the 1 1 line and again found good fits r 2 0 94 p 0 05 mre was 11 2 and rmse was 4 23 g kg 1 for the riparian wetland versus 7 3 and 5 31 g kg 1 for the saltmarsh wetland thus the sutra model predicted salinity accurately for both ecosystems 4 3 the mechanisms of salt accumulation and precipitation to explore the mechanisms and feedbacks that underlie evapotranspiration induced salt accumulation and precipitation we simulated the variations of salinity across different gradients of saturated water content fig 8 evapotranspiration fig 9 and groundwater depth fig 10 using the coupled hydrus 1d and sutra model generally river water provides a horizontal flow that dilutes the salinity and leaches salt into river water in the riparian wetland so the effect of saturated water content on the salinity was not significant the moderate level of saturated water content θ 70 θ s yielded the greatest salinity and the salinity was lowest when the soil was close to saturated θ 90 θ s this is likely to be directly related to the diffusion of water vapor with the increase of soil depth the salinity gradually decreased when soil depth was less than 20 cm but the salinity had not significantly change with the continuous increase of the soil depth in the riparian wetland however the salinity increased greatly with increasing saturated water content in the saltmarsh wetland fig 8b probably because inflows of water that would dilute the salinity were much lower in the saltmarsh wetland with the increase of soil depth the salinity gradually decreased when the depth was less than 60 cm but the salinity had a slight change with the continuous increase of the soil depth the evapotranspiration was generally greater than the flow of liquid water leading to salt transport from the groundwater to the surface with increasing liquid water saturation therefore the salinity increased with increasing evapotranspiration in both ecosystems fig 9 on one hand the fluxes of liquid water and water vapor usually increased with a rising water level in arid wetland leading to salt transport towards the surface and an increased concentration on the other hand as groundwater becomes shallower groundwater dilute salt leading to a decreased concentration therefore a low salinity corresponds to a shallower water level in the riparian wetland fig 10a because groundwater has a strong dilution of salt however the deep soil layers have higher salinity in the saltmarsh wetland than riparian wetland and the water table is also much deeper in the saltmarsh wetland than riparian wetland therefore a rise in groundwater level would bring the saline water to the surface worsening the salinity problem in the saltmarsh wetland instead of dilution as occurred in the riparian wetland fig 10b 5 discussion 5 1 evapotranspiration induced salt accumulation and precipitation the wetlands in arid regions of china are characterized by low atmospheric precipitation and intense evapotranspiration that greatly exceeds the atmospheric precipitation liu et al 2014 2017 the wetlands therefore typically undergo cycles of wetting and drying that result in transient interactions between the groundwater and surface water humphries et al 2011 in which the hydrological changes present a very complex process with a highly non linearity and uncertainty in arid wetlands groundwater can be an important source of both water and salts in arid wetlands shah et al 2011 van der zeeet al 2014 the shallow groundwater contains dissolved salts that were transported via capillary rise to create an induced flow toward the root zone and salt accumulates and precipitates near the soil surface due to the continuous evapotranspiration scherer 2004 guglielmini et al 2008 shokri et al 2010 consequently wetlands in arid regions always have a risk of secondary salinization caused by this upward water flow huckelbridge et al 2010 van der zeeet al 2014 therefore the relationship between salt accumulation and atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater depth has both important theoretical value for studies of soil processes and high practical significance to improve secondary salinization in arid regions several researchers have investigated the characteristics of salt accumulation near the soil surface within the vadose zone especially in arid regions e g nachshon et al 2011b in arid wetlands salt precipitates in the form of salt efflorescence when the salinity exceeds the salt s solubility many studies have indicated that salt distribution and precipitation patterns depend significantly on the salinity norouzi rad and shokri 2012 and that the concentration gradient generates a flow into and around the plume of highly saline water shah et al 2011 assumed that salinization results from poor quality groundwater caused by capillary upward flow variations of atmospheric precipitation can be critical for modeling water and salt fluxes marion et al 2008 generally atmospheric precipitation induced freshwater infiltration into the soil which dilutes the salinity of the highly saline plumes and drives them downward it can also dissolve and resolubilize precipitated salts this phenomenon would greatly affect water flows and salinitys in our arid wetlands fig 3 in the riparian wetland rivers are a continuous source of water both for groundwater and for the wetland the depth to the groundwater in the riparian wetland had only slight fluctuation so the groundwater did not greatly affect the spatial and temporal variation of salt efflorescence fig 3b therefore the interaction between atmospheric precipitation and evapotranspiration provided an important driving force for water flow and salt efflorescence in the riparian wetland which changed in response to the atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration cycle in the saltmarsh the depth to groundwater showed distinct seasonality fig 3c salinity in the root zone increased with increasing capillary flow when the groundwater becomes shallower and the thickness of the salt efflorescence varied in response to changes in the depth of the groundwater in the saltmarsh wetland therefore our results demonstrated a dynamic response of water flow and salinity to the combined effects of groundwater evapotranspiration and atmospheric precipitation in the saltmarsh wetland salt efflorescence in the riparian wetland was much lower than that in the saltmarsh wetland because groundwater diluted the salinity for example the first peak of salt efflorescence in april was 2 06 cm in the riparian wetland and 3 95 cm in the saltmarsh wetland and the second peaks in august were 1 65 and 3 80 cm respectively fig 3b c therefore the mechanisms of salt migration accumulation and desalination differed between the two ecosystems and the efflorescence pattern showed different seasonal and inter annual variability because the temporal dynamics cannot be simply explained as the result of dilution by atmospheric precipitation and subsequent enrichment by evapotranspiration instead the long term interactions among groundwater evapotranspiration and atmospheric precipitation determine these dynamics 5 2 feedback between salt subflorescenceand the water flow and evapotranspiration the pore water in a soil commonly contains dissolved substances under natural conditions so understanding the dynamics and impacts of salt accumulation and precipitation to evapotranspiration is crucial for preventing or mitigating salinization nachshon et al 2011b unfortunately soil efflorescence is a complicated hydrothermal process rose et al 2005 gran et al 2011 the structure of the soil pores inevitably changes when salts precipitate and form crystals at the soil surface and this changes both the thermal and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the soil thereby complicating the modeling of soil porosity van der zee et al 2014 in the present study soil efflorescence and subflorescence progressively reduced the soil s pore space with increasing solute concentration so the porosity decreased to 13 1 and 18 5 relative to the original porosity in the riparian and saltmarsh wetland respectively table 2 we found that efflorescence impeded evapotranspiration in much the same way as mulching i e by forming a barrier to the movement of water vapor in contrast subflorescence reduces the subsurface pore space in which the water vapor moves from this we hypothesize that subflorescence reduced the evaporation rate from the soil pores because the porosity reduction when the soil water was extremely saline did not completely obstruct the water vapor flow shimojimaet al 1996 reported that the evaporation rate from silica sands and glass beads saturated with a 0 3 molal nacl solution i e 0 3 mol of salt per kilogram of water decreased by 70 and 30 respectively compared to the evaporation rate with pure water zhang et al 2014 also found that evaporation decreased with increasing depth of solid salt in the soil column numerous studies indicated that the effect of efflorescence on evaporation depends on the thickness of the efflorescence and on the potential evaporation rates and water saturation near the soil surface fujimaki et al 2006 in theory evaporation from a brine surface will be less than that from a freshwater surface because the dissolved salts lower the free energy of the water molecules and hence decrease the saturation vapor pressure above the brine lensky et al 2005 kelly and selker 2001 concluded that water activity decreased in the saline portion leading to a decrease in the vapor pressure gradient that drives the flux of water vapor 6 conclusions the mechanisms and feedbacks of salt accumulation and precipitation is important for improving soil salinization in arid wetlands in the current study we found that the processes of salt accumulation dilution and desalination occurred in the soils of arid wetlands the salinity increased with increasing evapotranspiration and the moderate level of saturated water content yielded the greatest salinity in the riparian wetland whereas the salinity increased greatly with increasing saturated water content in the saltmarsh wetland a low salinity correspond to a shallower water level because groundwater has a strong dilution of salt in the riparian wetland while the trend is different in the saltmarsh wetland therefore salt efflorescence showed different seasonal and inter annual variability because the temporal dynamics cannot be simply explained as the result of dilution by atmospheric precipitation and subsequent enrichment by evapotranspiration therefore the long term interactions among groundwater evapotranspiration and atmospheric precipitation determined salt efflorescence in the saltmarsh wetland while groundwater did not greatly affect the spatial and temporal variation of salt efflorescence in the riparian wetland moreover subflorescence reduced the evaporation rate from the soil pores because the porosity reduction acknowledgments

6822,salt dissolved in soil water is transported upward to the soil surface through capillary rise from shallow groundwater leading to salt accumulation near the surface and salinization of wetlands in arid regions however it is not clear how the mechanism and feedback for evapotranspiration induces salt accumulation and precipitation here we developed a model to simulate the transport of water solutes and heat and measured the meteorological hydrological and hydraulic parameters of soil using field experiments to calibrate the model for riparian and saltmarsh wetlands in northwestern china the results showed that the annual atmospheric precipitation averaged 125 3 10 2 mm in two types of wetlands the evapotranspiration depth to the groundwater and soil salinity averaged 587 7 mm yr 1 85 4 5 4 cm and 29 80 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland while 637 2 mmyr 1 129 7 15 1 cm and 63 64 g kg 1 in the saltmarsh wetland respectively we found that the flux of liquid water flux of water vapor salinity and efflorescence had maximum values of 1 23 mm day 1 0 22 mm day 1 104 16 g kg 1 and 2 10 cm in the riparian wetland respectively versus 1 28 mm day 1 0 32 mm day 1 202 02 g kg 1 and 3 70 cm in the saltmarsh wetland our simulations show that the salinity increases significantly with increasing evapotranspiration soil temperature saturated water content and groundwater depth in the saltmarsh wetland but that the effects of saturated water content and groundwater depth were small in the riparian wetland as a result of these factors the efflorescence pattern exhibited characteristic seasonal and inter annual variability in which complex interactions among atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater and river water provided the long term driving forces for water flow and salt transport we found that the increasing efflorescence disrupted evaporation more than subflorescence which reduced the soil porosity and possibly affected water vapor transport keywords salt accumulation salt efflorescence atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater 1 introduction wetlands are important components of the ecosystems in arid regions where they significantly affect ecosystem structure and function as well as the ecological balance castañeda and herrero 2008 on the one hand these wetlands provide critical habitat for waterfowl and a refuge for endangered species on the other hand they perform water purification control desertification and moderate the climate unfortunately during the past century the hydrological regimes of these wetlands have been greatly altered by climate change and human activity as a result many of the arid wetlands have disappeared or become degraded li and zhao 2010 for example the area of desert oasis wetlands in china s heihe river basin was reduced from 280 96 km2 in 1990 to 172 91 km2 in 2000 this process led to significant environmental and ecological problems nielsen et al 2003 jolly et al 2008 such as exacerbated salinization and desertification huckelbridge et al 2010 fensham et al 2011 gran et al 2011 these changes have seriously threatened the stability of oases and agricultural development in arid regions therefore it has become increasingly urgent to prevent or mitigate the development of salinization and promote the restoration of degraded wetlands in arid regions of the world including those in china cooper et al 2006 castañeda and herrero 2008 the hydrological conditions and chemical characteristics are the primary factors that determine the type formation maintenance or degradation of a wetland crosbie et al 2009 bijoor et al 2011 glenn et al 2012 atmospheric precipitation is rare in arid regions and the infiltration of groundwater is the dominant water source in arid wetlands liu et al 2014 so that the soil s high water content due to capillary forces with the shallow water table facilitate evapotranspiration moreover evapotranspiration is an important water loss process that determines the water balance and energy exchange in wetland ecosystems gentine et al 2007 lafleur 2008 borin et al 2011 liu et al 2014 with continuous evapotranspiration salts are transported towards the soil surface through capillary rise from shallow groundwater xu et al 2005 2013 and salt accumulation in the forms of efflorescence and subflorescence causes soil salinization of arid wetlands e g huckelbridge et al 2010 fensham et al 2011 thus evapotranspiration has been recognized as an important driver for flows of water solutes and heat between the near surface soil layers and the atmosphere rose et al 2005 fujimaki et al 2006 gran et al 2011 zhanget al 2014 numerous studies indicate that the influences of evapotranspiration on salt accumulation are more complex as it is not only affected by water saturation but also salt concentration precipitation in soils e g nachshon et al 2011b for example fujimaki et al 2006 nachshonet al 2011b and zhanget al 2014 investigated the impact of evaporation on salt accumulation from a saline soil column and discussed the combined effect of heterogeneous media and salt precipitation on evaporation from soils zimmerman et al 2006 found that continuous evapotranspiration resulted in accumulation of salt and the formation of a saline boundary layer in the okavango delta geng and boufadel 2015 researched the impacts of evaporation on subsurface flow and salt accumulation in a tidally influenced beach in the gulf of mexico and the results showed that evaporation almost doubled the pore water salinity in the inter tidal zone in comparison to the case with no evaporation however the contribution of evapotranspiration to salt accumulation has not been thoroughly investigated especially in arid wetlands this process is complicated by the fact that subsequent atmospheric precipitation dilutes the evaporation induced saline plume that rises near the soil surface and causes the plume to migrate downward which simultaneously alters the pore water content and salt distribution moreover the variations of atmospheric precipitation and groundwater fluctuations affect the processes of salt accumulation dilution and desalination van der kamp et al 2003 johnson et al 2004 consequently the transport of soluble salts into and out of the wetlands is influenced by complex interactions among atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater that are highly variable and complex in both space and time van der kamp and hayashi 2009 wang et al 2009 heagle et al 2013 therefore to improve soil salinization in arid wetland ecosystems it is important to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the transport of water solutes and heat within soils and to reveal the feedback among these processes that lead to evapotranspiration induced salt accumulation and desalination induced by atmospheric precipitation salt accumulation and precipitation induced by evapotranspiration with shallow groundwater has been observed in a range of wetland environments including the swamps of botswana s okavango delta brazil s pantanal barbiero et al 2002 prairie wetlands in north america arndt and richardson 1993 australian floodplains and floodplain wetlands in south africa salt efflorescence impedes the transport of water vapor and reduces the evaporation rate by creating an impermeable layer at the soil surface thereby blocking flows of air and water much like a straw or gravel mulch fujimaki et al 2006 nachshon et al 2011a simultaneously the salt crystal developed between soil grains during subflorescence change the soil s porosity permeability to liquid water the water retention curve and heat conductivity but it is not clear how significantly such changes affect the evaporation process zhang et al 2014 therefore the field measurement was conducted in two types of wetland in arid northern china and a model was developed to simulate the transport of water solutes and heat our specific objectives were 1 to calibrate the model parameters by measuring data of the hydrological and hydraulic parameters 2 to simulate the variations of volumetric water content salinity soil temperature liquid water flux water vapor flux 3 to discuss the interaction among atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration groundwater depth and salt efflorescence we present the results of these measurements and model simulations to explore the mechanism and feedback that drive evapotranspiration induced salt

dimensional unsaturated partially saturated or fully saturated porous media šimůnek et al 2013 in contrast the sutra model simulates variably saturated density dependent groundwater flow and solute transport and couples the liquid water and solute transport equations hughes and sanford 2004 incorporates the mass of solid salt to solve the drawback for the precipitation and dissolution rates of salt for the hydrus 1d program we therefore coupled the two models to more fully describe soil processes by replacing the hydrus 1d solute transport algorithms with the sutra model s algorithms thereby allowing the model to simulate the impacts of groundwater and evapotranspiration on the precipitation and dissolution of salt in the arid wetlands the hydrus 1d model solves water flow eqs 1 5 and heat transport eq 10 the salt precipitation modeled by eqs 6 8 was simulated by sutra using the water flow and the solute concentration eqs 15 17 we calibrated the hydrus 1d model using the volumetric water contents θ and the soil salinity measured from soil profiles in the riparian and the saltmarsh wetland the calibration period was from 2012 to 2014 and the verification period was

at the beginning of the growth season early april to late june soil moisture was stable however soil moisture decreased sharply during the middle and late growing season late june to late september during the study period the soil moisture increased gradually with the increase of soil depth soil moisture at depths of 10 20 40 60 and 80 cm averaged 26 27 28 32 and 39 in the riparian wetland and 24 25 27 34 and 37 in the saltmarsh wetland after the freezing period the soil temperature increased gradually from the surface to the deep soil fig 4b e during the melting period soil temperature changed very little and remained near a steady state the range is between 1 22 0 35 and 2 21 0 25 c in the riparian wetland between 1 56 0 59 and 2 41 0 35 c in the saltmarsh wetland respectively during the growing season soil temperature increased greatly from april to reach its maximum value in august and then decreased to its minimum value in october with an annual average of 10 16 c in the riparian wetland fig 4b and 11 04 c in the saltmarsh wetland fig 4e during the study period soil salinity followed a trend similar to that of soil moisture fig 4c f with annual averages of 29 80 and 63 64 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland respectively during the freezing period the surface salt was frozen but desalination occurred with the surface salinity decreasing from 30 62 31 g kg 1 to 18 18 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland and from 64 94 g kg 1 to about 42 62 g kg 1 in the saltmarsh wetland however the surface salinity gradually increased during the melting period due to release of the salt and salt accumulation and precipitation occurred near the soil surface due to continuous evapotranspiration the surface salinity reached maximum values of 150 66 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland fig 4c and 250 64 g kg 1 in the saltmarsh wetland fig 4f 4 2 simulation of water solute and heat transport we simulated the soil volumetric water content and temperature with the hydrus 1d model to solve the water flow and heat transport equations to determine the prediction accuracy for the salt concentration and precipitation we simulated the salt precipitation using sutra with the water flow and the solute concentration equations the temporal changes of the volumetric water content salinity and soil temperature agreed well between the simulated and the measured values in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland figs 5 6 at the beginning of the melting period in april when the surface soil horizons began to thaw the water content remained relatively high at 31 and 35 in the riparian wetland and the saltmarsh wetland respectively figs 5a 6a thereafter salt accumulated due to continuous evapotranspiration and reached maximum values of 104 16 and 202 02 g kg 1 in the riparian wetland and saltmarsh wetland respectively figs 5b 6b however the salinity decreased significantly with the rising water level and the dilution created by rain during the rainy season figs 5c 6c as evapotranspiration continued fluxes of liquid water and water vapor started to move upward to compensate for the water loss at the soil surface and the water vapor flux became a high proportion of the total water flux in wetland consequently salt accumulation and precipitation occurred in the upper soil layer again and a salt crust formed at the surface i e efflorescence this barrier kept the underlying soil wetter for a longer period of time and allowed more salt to accumulate below the crust therefore a second salinity peak occurred when evapotranspiration was the highest in july the maximum value of salinity liquid water flux and water vapor flux were 78 42 g kg 1 1 23 mm day 1 and 0 22 mm day 1 in the riparian wetland fig 5b d e while their maximum value were 150 0 g kg 1 1 28 mm day 1 and 0 32 mm day 1 in the saltmarsh wetland respectively fig 6b d e simultaneously the solid salt began to occupy the pore spaces between the soil particles i e subflorescence thereby reducing the porosity with an average porosity of 50 75 7 28 in the riparian wetland and 43 58 3 80 in the saltmarsh wetland table 2 in addition the tortuosity factor increased greatly with increasing depth in the soil with an average of 0 14 0 06 in the riparian wetland fig 5f and 0 09 0 09 mm in the saltmarsh wetland fig 6f thus the tortuosity factor decreased with increasing salinity figs 5b f 6b f the measured volumetric water contents matched the predicted values well r 2 0 74 p 0 05 at five depths below the soil surface for both the riparian wetland fig 7 a and the saltmarsh wetland fig 7d the slope of the linear relationship is statistically equal to 1 0 the mean relative errors mres and rmses were 8 6 and 0 04 m3m 3 respectively for the riparian wetland versus 9 9 and 0 04 m3m 3 for the saltmarsh wetland the relationships between measured and predicted soil temperatures were similarly good at five depths below the soil surface with mre of 24 and rmse 1 20 c for the riparian wetland fig 7b versus 25 1 and 1 99 c in the saltmarsh wetland fig 7e with r 2 0 98 in both cases thus the hydrus 1d model accurately predicted the soil volumetric water content and soil temperature in both ecosystems we also compared the simulated and measured values of the salinity at five depths below the soil surface in the riparian wetland fig 7c and saltmarsh wetland fig 7f the linear relationship between the measured and predicted values was compared with the 1 1 line and again found good fits r 2 0 94 p 0 05 mre was 11 2 and rmse was 4 23 g kg 1 for the riparian wetland versus 7 3 and 5 31 g kg 1 for the saltmarsh wetland thus the sutra model predicted salinity accurately for both ecosystems 4 3 the mechanisms of salt accumulation and precipitation to explore the mechanisms and feedbacks that underlie evapotranspiration induced salt accumulation and precipitation we simulated the variations of salinity across different gradients of saturated water content fig 8 evapotranspiration fig 9 and groundwater depth fig 10 using the coupled hydrus 1d and sutra model generally river water provides a horizontal flow that dilutes the salinity and leaches salt into river water in the riparian wetland so the effect of saturated water content on the salinity was not significant the moderate level of saturated water content θ 70 θ s yielded the greatest salinity and the salinity was lowest when the soil was close to saturated θ 90 θ s this is likely to be directly related to the diffusion of water vapor with the increase of soil depth the salinity gradually decreased when soil depth was less than 20 cm but the salinity had not significantly change with the continuous increase of the soil depth in the riparian wetland however the salinity increased greatly with increasing saturated water content in the saltmarsh wetland fig 8b probably because inflows of water that would dilute the salinity were much lower in the saltmarsh wetland with the increase of soil depth the salinity gradually decreased when the depth was less than 60 cm but the salinity had a slight change with the continuous increase of the soil depth the evapotranspiration was generally greater than the flow of liquid water leading to salt transport from the groundwater to the surface with increasing liquid water saturation therefore the salinity increased with increasing evapotranspiration in both ecosystems fig 9 on one hand the fluxes of liquid water and water vapor usually increased with a rising water level in arid wetland leading to salt transport towards the surface and an increased concentration on the other hand as groundwater becomes shallower groundwater dilute salt leading to a decreased concentration therefore a low salinity corresponds to a shallower water level in the riparian wetland fig 10a because groundwater has a strong dilution of salt however the deep soil layers have higher salinity in the saltmarsh wetland than riparian wetland and the water table is also much deeper in the saltmarsh wetland than riparian wetland therefore a rise in groundwater level would bring the saline water to the surface worsening the salinity problem in the saltmarsh wetland instead of dilution as occurred in the riparian wetland fig 10b 5 discussion 5 1 evapotranspiration induced salt accumulation and precipitation the wetlands in arid regions of china are characterized by low atmospheric precipitation and intense evapotranspiration that greatly exceeds the atmospheric precipitation liu et al 2014 2017 the wetlands therefore typically undergo cycles of wetting and drying that result in transient interactions between the groundwater and surface water humphries et al 2011 in which the hydrological changes present a very complex process with a highly non linearity and uncertainty in arid wetlands groundwater can be an important source of both water and salts in arid wetlands shah et al 2011 van der zeeet al 2014 the shallow groundwater contains dissolved salts that were transported via capillary rise to create an induced flow toward the root zone and salt accumulates and precipitates near the soil surface due to the continuous evapotranspiration scherer 2004 guglielmini et al 2008 shokri et al 2010 consequently wetlands in arid regions always have a risk of secondary salinization caused by this upward water flow huckelbridge et al 2010 van der zeeet al 2014 therefore the relationship between salt accumulation and atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration and groundwater depth has both important theoretical value for studies of soil processes and high practical significance to improve secondary salinization in arid regions several researchers have investigated the characteristics of salt accumulation near the soil surface within the vadose zone especially in arid regions e g nachshon et al 2011b in arid wetlands salt precipitates in the form of salt efflorescence when the salinity exceeds the salt s solubility many studies have indicated that salt distribution and precipitation patterns depend significantly on the salinity norouzi rad and shokri 2012 and that the concentration gradient generates a flow into and around the plume of highly saline water shah et al 2011 assumed that salinization results from poor quality groundwater caused by capillary upward flow variations of atmospheric precipitation can be critical for modeling water and salt fluxes marion et al 2008 generally atmospheric precipitation induced freshwater infiltration into the soil which dilutes the salinity of the highly saline plumes and drives them downward it can also dissolve and resolubilize precipitated salts this phenomenon would greatly affect water flows and salinitys in our arid wetlands fig 3 in the riparian wetland rivers are a continuous source of water both for groundwater and for the wetland the depth to the groundwater in the riparian wetland had only slight fluctuation so the groundwater did not greatly affect the spatial and temporal variation of salt efflorescence fig 3b therefore the interaction between atmospheric precipitation and evapotranspiration provided an important driving force for water flow and salt efflorescence in the riparian wetland which changed in response to the atmospheric precipitation evapotranspiration cycle in the saltmarsh the depth to groundwater showed distinct seasonality fig 3c salinity in the root zone increased with increasing capillary flow when the groundwater becomes shallower and the thickness of the salt efflorescence varied in response to changes in the depth of the groundwater in the saltmarsh wetland therefore our results demonstrated a dynamic response of water flow and salinity to the combined effects of groundwater evapotranspiration and atmospheric precipitation in the saltmarsh wetland salt efflorescence in the riparian wetland was much lower than that in the saltmarsh wetland because groundwater diluted the salinity for example the first peak of salt efflorescence in april was 2 06 cm in the riparian wetland and 3 95 cm in the saltmarsh wetland and the second peaks in august were 1 65 and 3 80 cm respectively fig 3b c therefore the mechanisms of salt migration accumulation and desalination differed between the two ecosystems and the efflorescence pattern showed different seasonal and inter annual variability because the temporal dynamics cannot be simply explained as the result of dilution by atmospheric precipitation and subsequent enrichment by evapotranspiration instead the long term interactions among groundwater evapotranspiration and atmospheric precipitation determine these dynamics 5 2 feedback between salt subflorescenceand the water flow and evapotranspiration the pore water in a soil commonly contains dissolved substances under natural conditions so understanding the dynamics and impacts of salt accumulation and precipitation to evapotranspiration is crucial for preventing or mitigating salinization nachshon et al 2011b unfortunately soil efflorescence is a complicated hydrothermal process rose et al 2005 gran et al 2011 the structure of the soil pores inevitably changes when salts precipitate and form crystals at the soil surface and this changes both the thermal and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the soil thereby complicating the modeling of soil porosity van der zee et al 2014 in the present study soil efflorescence and subflorescence progressively reduced the soil s pore space with increasing solute concentration so the porosity decreased to 13 1 and 18 5 relative to the original porosity in the riparian and saltmarsh wetland respectively table 2 we found that efflorescence impeded evapotranspiration in much the same way as mulching i e by forming a barrier to the movement of water vapor in contrast subflorescence reduces the subsurface pore space in which the water vapor moves from this we hypothesize that subflorescence reduced the evaporation rate from the soil pores because the porosity reduction when the soil water was extremely saline did not completely obstruct the water vapor flow shimojimaet al 1996 reported that the evaporation rate from silica sands and glass beads saturated with a 0 3 molal nacl solution i e 0 3 mol of salt per kilogram of water decreased by 70 and 30 respectively compared to the evaporation rate with pure water zhang et al 2014 also found that evaporation decreased with increasing depth of solid salt in the soil column numerous studies indicated that the effect of efflorescence on evaporation depends on the thickness of the efflorescence and on the potential evaporation rates and water saturation near the soil surface fujimaki et al 2006 in theory evaporation from a brine surface will be less than that from a freshwater surface because the dissolved salts lower the free energy of the water molecules and hence decrease the saturation vapor pressure above the brine lensky et al 2005 kelly and selker 2001 concluded that water activity decreased in the saline portion leading to a decrease in the vapor pressure gradient that drives the flux of water vapor 6 conclusions the mechanisms and feedbacks of salt accumulation and precipitation is important for improving soil salinization in arid wetlands in the current study we found that the processes of salt accumulation dilution and desalination occurred in the soils of arid wetlands the salinity increased with increasing evapotranspiration and the moderate level of saturated water content yielded the greatest salinity in the riparian wetland whereas the salinity increased greatly with increasing saturated water content in the saltmarsh wetland a low salinity correspond to a shallower water level because groundwater has a strong dilution of salt in the riparian wetland while the trend is different in the saltmarsh wetland therefore salt efflorescence showed different seasonal and inter annual variability because the temporal dynamics cannot be simply explained as the result of dilution by atmospheric precipitation and subsequent enrichment by evapotranspiration therefore the long term interactions among groundwater evapotranspiration and atmospheric precipitation determined salt efflorescence in the saltmarsh wetland while groundwater did not greatly affect the spatial and temporal variation of salt efflorescence in the riparian wetland moreover subflorescence reduced the evaporation rate from the soil pores because the porosity reduction acknowledgments

6823,for the last several decades great efforts have been put into converting point precipitation into mean areal precipitation in the design of hydraulic and hydrologic infrastructures the ratio between point and areal precipitation called the areal reduction factor arf has been identified to vary significantly depending on a variety of factors with some factors remaining to be undiscovered in this paper we highlight the influence of internal spatial variability of storms on the arf value for this we employ a storm identification algorithm on the radar composite data to identify a total of 54 758 elliptically shaped extreme storms over the six year study period then we investigate the relationship between the various storm characteristics to their arf value our findings are as follow first we confirm a widely accepted notion that arf generally increases with the duration and it is inversely related to the storm area second we discover that spatial variability within storm e g the coefficient of variation of radar image pixel rainfall values is a very strong predictor of the arf value along with area and duration last the difference of arf values between storms that have elliptical shapes and those that are circular over the same area is about 20 on average these findings inform that the current design framework of areal rainfall estimation will be improved by incorporating the information on the rainfall spatial variability and storm shape keywords radar rainfall areal reduction factor spatial variability 1 introduction converting point precipitation observed at a ground gauge into areal precipitation averaged over a spatial domain and estimating the ratio between them the areal reduction factor arf has been extensively studied with respect to the design of hydraulic and hydrologic infrastructures for the last several decades rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 omolayo 1993 bacchi and ranzi 1996 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 asquith and famiglietti 2000 yoo et al 2007 svensson and jones 2010 barbero et al 2014 pavlovic et al 2016 the concept of arf is essential not only because point precipitation can only be valid within a limited area but also because areal precipitation tends to be smaller than point precipitation as the domain area becomes larger many empirical and analytical methods for estimating arf have been developed rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 omolayo 1993 bacchi and ranzi 1996 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 asquith and famiglietti 2000 svensson and jones 2010 barbero et al 2014 pavlovic et al 2016 analytical methods focus on developing theoretical relationship between the point rainfall and areal rainfall based on a mathematical framework with set of hypothesis made on spatial correlation structure rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 omolayo 1993 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 crossing properties bacchi and ranzi 1996 concepts of scaling relationships and self affinity de michele et al 2001 veneziano and langousis 2005 veneziano et al 2006 and storm movement bengtsson and niemczynowicz 1986 in contrast empirical methods are often used to provide practical design guidelines on areal rainfall estimation while making no assumptions on spatial or temporal rainfall structures depending on how one chooses rainfall areas the approaches of deriving arf can be also categorized into a fixed area approach which normally focuses on rain gauge networks within a fixed area like a watershed and a storm centered approach in which the area used for computing the arfs is not fixed but varies depending on individual rainfall events omolayo 1993 asquith and famiglietti 2000 pietersen et al 2015 both approaches have advantages and disadvantages omolayo 1993 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 olivera et al 2008 one of the drawbacks of the fixed area approach is that it does not reflect the spatial rainfall structure of storms that concurrently influence multiple gauges located in a watershed in other words it assumes the spatial structure is secured by design rainfall values occurring at different times which are independently estimated at each of the gauges in the watershed omolayo 1993 olivera et al 2008 on the other hand the storm centered approach overcomes this drawback because such a spatial structure of storms can be directly extracted from two dimensional precipitation fields the latter approach however requires high resolution precipitation images that can be obtained through weather radar or highly dense ground gage network wright et al 2014 capable of reflecting storm spatial structures sufficiently which becomes possible through either a precipitation gauge network with an extremely high density or a remotely sensed measurement of which accuracy is still under debate arfs estimated by these approaches have been found to vary significantly depending on a variety of factors related to rainfall characteristics and patterns e g convective showers frontal rainfall or storms generated at the center of low pressure cyclones physical characteristics of a watershed e g altitude topography or urbanization and data resolutions interpolation methods and algorithms used to derive the arfs svensson and jones 2010 specifically the factors are weather type huff and shipp 1969 skaugen 1997 wright et al 2014 lee et al 2015 storm shape olivera et al 2008 lee et al 2015 seasons huff and shipp 1969 allen

veneziano and langousis 2005 and the data or methodology adopted asquith and famiglietti 2000 allen and degaetano 2005b numerous studies have been conducted with the information described above however there have been no studies that explore the direct effect of the spatial variability within a storm on arfs despite its importance in the computation of areal rainfall identifying the precise spatiotemporal variability of precipitation and its extremes has not yet been achievable with on site networks of rain gauge stations because the gauge networks are still too sparse inaccurately estimated areal rainfall and the corresponding arf values may eventually result in biased consequences on the expected watershed response e g streamflow flood peak borga 2002 jasper et al 2002 ivanov

hydrogeomorphic responses to rainfall these adverse impacts can be exacerbated when the spatio temporal rainfall characteristics are as complex as in our study area where multiple rainfall mechanisms exist simultaneously such as convectional frontal orographic and convergent lifting lee et al 2016 the development of remote sensing techniques and instruments have accelerated the possibility and thus many efforts have been made to employ the data in estimating arfs bacchi and ranzi 1996 durrans et al 2002 allen and degaetano 2005a lombardo et al 2006 olivera et al 2008 overeem et al 2010 ercan and goodall 2012 in this study we attempt to employ radar composite field data with 1 km 1 km resolution quantitatively characterize the degree of spatial variability of the storm compute the storm centered arfs in either circular or elliptical forms and investigate the factors affecting their variabilities this study targets a 99 720 km2 domain of south korea in which the causes of precipitation are very complex a storm identification and tracking algorithm cho et al 2011 cho et al 2013 is employed to detect the best elliptical shapes in the center of the storms tens of thousands of elliptical samples of various size are distinguished and analyzed this large number of storm ellipses will be beneficial in comprehensively determining the role of the spatial variability of rainfall on arf estimation and pinpointing new factors affecting this calculation 2 storm identification procedure and methodology first we must identify the individual storms to be used for arf analysis since storms vary greatly in time and space and their variability is highly unpredictable we attempt to first determine storm centers that contain specific time and location information we then identify the elliptical shapes i e aspect orientation and size encompassing the storm centers determined at that time and location last we perform a filtering process to identify statistically independent storm ellipses to be considered for further analysis in this study we focus on large rainfall events e g rainfall at storm center is greater than the point rainfall of 10 year frequency to make this process easier we assumed that the extreme events can be captured by looking at the pixels of radar image if their accumulated rainfall volume with a given temporal duration exceeds a specific threshold over the entire period 09 17 2007 12 31 2012 a detailed description of this process is provided in the following paragraph and an associated flow chart is illustrated in fig 1 the first step in identifying each storm and computing its arf is to build a time series at every radar pixel 1 km 1 km spatial resolution within south korea given the radar quantitative precipitation estimation mohr and vaughan 1979 cho et al 2006 kma 2013 ye et al 2015 since this estimation is limited by the radar s 10 minute temporal resolution a time series is reconstructed for a duration interval by utilizing the accumulated rainfall depths during the interval and moving the interval window by 10 min over time e g fig s1 for a duration of 1 h for the entire period used in this study the total number of temporal grids in the reconstructed time series for the duration of 1 3 6 12 24 and 72 h is 278203 278191 278173 278137 278065 and 277777 respectively if these temporal grids were combined with the spatial grids i e the 106 735 rainfall cells of the domain the total number of possible storms would extend up to the order of eleven so we have attempted to reduce the number of storms for simplicity by selecting extreme storms only the second step is to find storm centers that correspond spatially and temporally with the extreme storms this step is especially important because arfs are primarily used to reflect the characteristics of extreme storms in designing flood defense systems for this we first assume that extreme storms should contain at least one of the extreme pixels that have rainfall depths greater than 10 year frequency rainfall and lower than 200 year frequency rainfall see fig s2 some pixels with extremely large rainfall values are considered to be subject to large uncertainty caused by non meteorological targets e g flying objects ground clutter chaff etc other than rainfall note that the rainfall value recorded for one pixel of radar image is assumed to be equivalent as that measured at an in situ point location inside the pixel even though some studies suggest that a large variability may reside over this small pixel area of 1 km2 peleg et al 2018 the information about rainfall depth duration and frequency at every pixel used in the above step is obtained from the official korea precipitation frequency data server website http www k idf re kr and can be seen in fig s2 identified storm centers need to be reviewed to eliminate instances of overlap in time if consecutive storm centers are then evaluated as superimposed in time only the center with the greatest accumulated rainfall will be selected for further analysis fig s3 demonstrates this process which represents the time series of the accumulated rainfall at a given pixel even though all storms in fig s3 exceed the frequency threshold our algorithm may exclude some storms e g the blue one in fig s3 if the time intervals between any consecutive storms are smaller than the given duration this exclusion algorithm ensures maximum storms that do not overlap over time for a given pixel from the storm database the next step is to identify elliptical shape of the storm center that fits the selected rainfall radar image and maximizes a rainfall volume within the storm identifying the proper storm shape could be considered a six dimensional time location vector aspect orientation and size optimization problem however if the time and location were independently selected as described in the previous step and the storm area were determined a priori the thirteen areas of 10 30 80 150 250 380 530 700 900 1250 2000 4000 8000 km2 are used in this study which encompasses from small convective storms causing local urban floods to large frontal storms exceeding the size of big watersheds finding the storm becomes a two dimensional optimization problem involving the aspect ratio r which is the ratio of the diameter of the major axis to that of the minor axis and the inclination angle θ which is the angle between the diameter of the major axis and the east axis these parameters can be optimized given the objective function 1 i r x y r θ r i where ri is a rainfall volume mm of the i th cell belonging to r x y r θ which is a series of rainfall depths corresponding to the cells within a storm defined at x y the coordinate x y of the i th cell center within the elliptical storm satisfies the following equation in the orthogonal coordinates system as 2 x cos θ y sin θ 2 r 2 x sin θ y cos θ 2 a π r 2 1 where a is the area of ellipse m2 attaining an optimum solution with multi dimension and multi modality is generally complex and demanding thus we applied an optimization algorithm named isolated speciation based particle swarm optimization cho et al 2011 one of the heuristic methods this algorithm enhances its efficiency by avoiding concentrations of particles through both deterministic and stochastic sampling and by preventing unnecessary function evaluations for the concentrated particles it assists in identifying multiple local optima in complex multi modal problems cho et al 2011 if one zooms out from a pixel to the 2 dimensional space with given areas the aforementioned process however cannot completely guarantee any spatial or spatiotemporal independency of the identified storms for example one notes the case in which frontal storms move fast in space without significant change of spatiotemporal characteristics it is challenging to conclude whether the frontal storms identified in multiple pixels are independent this complexity cannot be addressed by the temporal storm separation algorithm in step 2 for this reason we analyzed the geometric and geographic characteristics of the storms overlapping in time and space by adopting an additional process of k means clustering of which input variables include not only the spatiotemporal proximity i e the centers locating within the given areas and occurring within the given durations but also shape characteristics e g inclination angle and aspect ratio of the storms a number of storms belonging to the same cluster have similar geometric and geographic characteristics see fig s4 for the ranges of values for each cluster and thus a single representative storm with the median arf values is selected for each cluster in conclusion this analysis identified 54 758 clusters corresponding to 1 519 storm centers as a result the number of storms used in the analysis was reduced from 2 218 905 to 54 758 which is 2 47 of all storm ellipses initially identified by our algorithm for the optimized elliptical storms e g fig 2 the arf is computed as 3 arf δ a a 0 r i r 0 where a0 is the area of an elliptical storm m2 δa is the area of radar cells i e 1 km 1 km and r0 is the maximum rainfall depth of an ellipse mm 3 study domain and radar precipitation data the korean peninsula belonging to the east asian monsoon region was chosen as a study domain due to its complex spatiotemporal variation in precipitation patterns such a heterogeneity is mainly driven by its geographical features i e by the difference in specific heat capacity between the asian continent and the pacific ocean resulting in the substantial seasonality of wind direction front formation and corresponding moisture variations wet summers and dry winters in addition there is a clear regional tendency of rainfall characteristics in the study area this regionality is caused by the following reasons quasi stationary fronts causing the monsoon season in july to august tend to approach from the southern coast of korean peninsula move toward the north and then comes back to the southern coast orographic rainfall is highly concentrated on the western side of the long eastern mountainous area stretching through north south direction typhoon paths are more likely pass through the southern part of korean peninsula thus examining the spatiotemporal characteristics of rainfall patterns with a weather radar is indeed important presently eleven weather radars fig 3 operated by the korea meteorological administration kma provide coverage to the entire south korean peninsula the peninsula s first weather radar began taking measurements in september 1969 in seoul in 1985 the first nationwide radar network system was established consisting of five c band doppler radars in gwanaksan gudeoksan gosan donghae and osungsan in late 1990 five more radars were added in baengnyeongdo jindo gwangdeoksan myeonbongsan and sungsan to help resolve the terrain blockage occurring in the mountainous regions and provide better monitoring of storms yoo et al 2016 a total of eight s band and three c band radars were employed for this study to construct the composite field of rainfall with some areas of terrain blockage and cones of silence being filled by means of an interpolation technique nimr 1994 wrc 2010 the ground echoes and anomalous propagation in radars were removed using a fuzzy logic approach cho et al 2006 ye et al 2015 and the composite radar field was performed by mosaics of reflectivity data over the overlapped coverage of radars mohr and vaughan 1979 lee et al 2010 in this study radar composite data from the september 17th 2007 to the december 31st 2012 was used published and freely available from the kma website https data kma go kr data rmt rmtlist do code 11 pgmno 62 which includes spatial distributions of the precipitation intensities quantitatively estimated from radar composites 4 results and analysis 4 1 radar rainfall results and comparison with gauge networks fig s1 shows the time series of hourly rainfall extracted from radar composite fields using the methodology described in step one and the rainfall duration curves computed with the hourly data that exceeded the threshold of 1 mm h due to the nature of spatially distributed radar rainfall fields the time series can be extracted spatially for the entire korean region i e 106 735 grid cells but in this figure the time series in the ten representative areas see fig 3 are illustrated and compared with those observed at the gauge networks for simplicity there is a consistency in the overall patterns of the hyetographs see the left side plots of fig s1 and the rainfall duration curves see the right side plots of fig s1 at all locations although there exist some deviations in the intensity of rainfall at some locations e g seosan or jecheon and the number of rainy days not shown since this study is being conducted on relatively larger events among the continuous rainfall events it is meaningful to further compare the extreme values because the radar covers a larger area than a point at a gauge location and represents an average value over the area we would expect that rainy days would be detected more frequently and that extreme rainfall could be dispersed over more than one point of rainfall measurement our results correspond well with this prediction indicating that rainy hours with greater than 1 mm rainfall are better detected by radar than by gauges 5 5 vs 2 7 on average over the ten locations additionally for extreme rainfall events radar estimated precipitation is lower than the observations at gauge locations and this tendency is more prominent on an hourly scale than a daily scale see fig 4 and fig s5 and s6 fig 5 shows the value its frequency and timing of the maximum rainfall depth over the entire time period in the korean domain as expected as rainfall duration increases so does maximum rainfall volume relatively heavy rainfall occurred in the northern region the west coast and the south coast while a small amount of rain fell in the inland region of the southeast the corresponding frequency of the maximum rainfall is also illustrated in fig 5d f confirming that areas greater than the 10 year frequency are limited few regions are larger than the 200 year frequency and the northwest region near seoul has a large frequency most heavy rainfall events were concentrated in july and august when convective rains frontal jangma and typhoons arise the maximum rainfall events that occur over a short duration i e hourly often happen in august june and september but they are not sustained for a long period of time these phenomena are most pronounced in august for most areas in this study note maximum rainfall events specified at daily and hourly scale occur on different dates as is evident in fig 5 where the relative percentages of the maximum time of july for example change from 42 1 hour duration in fig 5g 65 6 hour in fig 5h to 76 24 hour in fig 5i 4 2 storm centered arf estimations 4 2 1 influence of area and duration on arf arf has been extensively studied in terms of duration and area with results suggesting that arf generally becomes smaller as area increases and larger as duration increases rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 pavlovic et al 2016 our results also suggest that arf depends on both duration and area arf generally increases with duration and this phenomenon becomes pronounced as the area becomes larger fig 6 a this is because as the size of the time window of rainfall accumulation increases moving storms leave traces with greater spatial homogeneity increasing the arf value but in the same time the degree of homogeneity decreases as the area of rainfall accumulation exceeds the spatial scale of storm traces which subsequently reduces the arf value the relationship between the arf and the area is also shown in fig 6b when the area is small the relative deviation of the precipitation amount in the storm is not anticipated to be as high so arf approaches a value of one conversely the arf values became smaller as the area of the storms increases for all six different rainfall durations considered the color shades in both plots of fig 6 show the inter quartile range of the arf values corresponding to each duration and area which suggests that the arf values are distributed over a fairly wide range the area arf relationship corresponding to the duration of 24 hour and 72 hour and the area of 4000 km2 and 8000 km2 shows irregular behavior the pink and light blue line of fig 6b this is mainly because there are not many storm ellipses captured in this duration area range see fig 7 h 4 2 2 influence of the various storm characteristics on the arf here we try to identify the storm characteristics that can reduce the large uncertainties residing in the arf value as indicated by the wide shaded areas shown in both plots of fig 6 the storm characteristics considered here are the maximum mean variance and coefficient of variation of the pixel radar rainfall values within a storm the shape of the storms i e storm inclination angle and storm aspect ratio the elevation of the center of the storms and the timing of storm occurrence whether storm occurred during day or night the influence of area and duration on the arf is significant as described in the previous section therefore if any of these two variables are considered as the independent variable of the analysis along with the remaining variables the true influence of the latter may be hidden therefore we first classified the storms based on different areas and durations then for each of the classified dataset we examined the correlation coefficient of the linear relationship between the variable of our interest and the arf value fig 7 summarizes the result of this analysis the title of each plot refers to the independent variable of the regression analysis and the pixel color represents the correlation coefficient between the title variable and the arf value with the area and duration specified by the pixel location the red and blue color represent the positive and negative correlation coefficient between the two variables respectively fig 7a shows that the increase of the storm mean rainfall for most areas and durations is associated with the increase of the arf value this could be understood from eq 3 that the arf value is a direct function of storm mean rainfall fig 7b suggests that the increase of the storm maximum rainfall is associated with the increase of the arf value for large areas and small durations the opposite trend was observed for the storms with small areas and large durations this means that for storms with large areas and small durations the increment of the mean storm rainfall overwhelms the increment of the maximum storm rainfall it is noteworthy that the storm mean and the maximum rainfall which complete the equation of the arf calculation are not highly correlated to the arf value as indicated by the thin pixel colors shown in fig 7a and b the relationship is especially weak for the storms with small areas and durations this is because a small ellipse or an ellipse with short temporal accumulation window tend to capture only a small portion or a short snapshot of rainstorms that has greater stochastic nature this subsequently adds more uncertainties to the both terms of eq 3 resulting in the weak relationship this result suggests that the arf values of small watersheds may display greater uncertainties fig 7c shows that the increase of rainfall variance leads to the decrease of the arf value large variance values may be caused when rain is accumulated on only a small part of ellipse e g fig 2b as opposed to a large part of ellipse e g fig 2a and c this means that the spatially more varying storms such as convective storms is more likely to have smaller arf values compared to the ones with less spatial variability such as frontal storms this tendency becomes clearer as the duration increases and the area decreases as the duration increases rainstorms moving inside the ellipse leaves more traces reducing the contrast between the maximum rainfall and the areal rainfall which eventually reduces the arf value as the ellipse area increases this influence becomes less apparent because the ellipse is occupied by multiple rainstorms which increases the heterogeneity of the rainfall pixels inside the ellipse one way to see the pure influence of rainfall spatial variability regardless of storm mean rainfall is to investigate the rainfall coefficient of variation cv fig 7d shows that the increase of the cv is highly correlated with the decrease of the arf value see the thick red pixel colors of the plot it signifies that cv is the by far the strongest and most consistent factor affecting the arf value among all the variables considered here we will discuss this in detail in section 5 1 fig 7e shows that the shape of storm has a mild influence on the arf value arf tends to increase for the long ellipses with small durations and small areas this is because our storm identification algorithm shows a good performance in capturing the traces of rainfall left along the direction of the rainstorm movement this trend however becomes less apparent and is even inversed as the size and the duration of an ellipse increases because of multiple rainstorms with different internal and motional characteristics being more likely to be captured by the ellipse or the advection of individual storms e g a rain band with a large aspect ratio for a short duration becomes more spherical when considering larger durations fig 7f further verifies this it shows that the ellipses inclined along the ne sw direction tend to have greater arf than the ones inclined along nw se direction a significant portion of monsoon rainfall during summer season and typhoon moves along this ne sw direction in our study area lee and kim 2007 although the light pixel colors of fig 7e and f represent that the degree of influence on arf value is rather mild correlation coefficient varies between 0 2 and 0 2 these findings could be a basis on the estimation of design areal rainfall that one should further consider storm movement characteristics and the size and orientation of watershed fig 7g shows that elevation at the storm center is negatively related to arf this trend is generally observed for most of the storms regardless of choosing different area and duration datasets one can presume that a significant orographic change within the storm area may increase rainfall spatial variability subsequently reducing the arf value lastly fig 7h shows the number of the elliptically shaped storms identified at different areas and durations note that the number of the identified storms decreases as the area and the duration increase which can adversely reduce the reliability of the analyses that were used to obtain the correlation coefficients displayed in fig 7a through g 5 discussion 5 1 rainfall coefficient of variation as a primary variable to determine the arf our investigation on fig 7a though fig 7d reveals that the coefficient of variation cv of a storm can be the most dominant factor in estimating the arf value its influence on arf was even stronger than that of the mean and maximum pixel rainfall of a storm which are the only two terms that complete the arf value calculation eq 3 here we try to confirm this notion fig 8 shows the relationship between the coefficient of variation and the arf value fig 8a isolates the influence of the area but not the duration while fig 8b isolates the influence of the duration but not the area note that the median arf values for different areas and different durations are not as much different as the cases when we did not isolate the influence of cv but area fig 6a or duration fig 6b this result means that the rainfall cv can significantly reduce the uncertainties residing in the arf value that was estimated using the combination of area and duration fig s7a shows the probability distribution of the arf values belonging to the subset corresponding to 530 km2 area and 3 hour duration the black line is drawn by using the arf values of all 638 fig 7h storms and the blue and red lines are shown by using the two greater and smaller subgroups respectively each of which is separated by the median of the storm cv there is a distinct contrast for the arf distributions with different cv ranges such a result is also observed for other subsets with different areas and durations not shown fig s7b shows the typical arf curves area versus arf for the 3 hours of duration the red and blue lines are the median of the arf values of the first and second subset classified by the magnitude of the cv respectively the shadings represent their inter quartile range these results suggest that the current design framework of estimating areal rainfall may be improved if it incorporates information on rainfall spatial variability along with the information of area and duration the reason why the combination of area and duration has been typically used over the cv in the areal rainfall estimation could be primarily because information of the latter was hardly attainable from the traditional approach using ground gauge network this issue will be tackled with the help of pixelated rainfall data such as radar or satellite product huffman et al 2007 hou et al 2014 for example a methodology of regionalization that estimates the typical rainfall variability for different area may be adopted 5 2 elliptical versus circular areal reduction factor here we further quantify the influence of storm movement on the areal rainfall factor storms leaves long traces as they move which is well captured by our storm identification algorithm in the shape of ellipses conversely the shape of circle relatively cannot capture this long traces of storm movement nor rain bands for short durations therefore we compared the ratio of arf values with circular shapes to those with elliptical shapes to see the influence of storm movement the circular arf values were estimated by drawing the circle on the rainfall field so that its center coincided with that of the ellipse but its position representing maximum rainfall was able to differ since the ellipses were determined to contain the maximum amount of rainfall for a given area and the circle is a subset of the ellipse the ratio will be generally less than one for 94 storms the average value of the ratios for all storms in this study was 0 86 for the non parametric kernel distribution or 0 76 for the histogram fig 9 those average values suggest that if the shape of the storm is circular it is likely that the estimated arf value is underestimated by 20 on average and up to 70 however it should be noted that the distribution has a long tail to the left and quite a few storms 30 still have smaller values than the average the influence of storm shape was generally greater for the storms with smaller durations and larger area fig s8 5 3 radar data issue one might contend the short length 5 5 years of the radar data used for our analysis indeed the number of the identified storm samples becomes smaller for some subsets with the larger area and duration fig 7h however the radar data in overall enabled us to capture sufficiently larger rainfall events 54 758 storms with spatially varying storm characteristics otherwise we would have not realized their existence and variability one also concerns that the true areal reduction factor may be different from our results due to chances including radar data with poor quality and inconsistencies between radar and gauge rainfalls for example the maximum pixel rainfall of a storm used in the denominator of arf calculation eq 3 may differ from the rainfall amount measured from rain gauge located in any pixel location furthermore a radar rainfall over a gridded pixel tends to be smaller than the gauge rainfall and the discrepancy between them tends to increase with the increase of storm intensity peleg et al 2018 nonetheless we believe that these shortcomings will not significantly alter our conclusion emphasizing the influence of rainfall spatial variability on the arf it is because arfs are computed from eq 3 where rainfall estimates by radar are employed in both denominator and numerator resulting that some biases can be canceled out from each other given that both terms are not subject to any conditional bias 5 4 bridging the gap in current design frameworks current design frameworks in computing the areal reduction factor and then estimating areal rainfall reflect a view that arf varies depending on area or duration i e the arf of storm decreases with increasing area while increases with duration in practice once information on the area and duration is given the arf is determined as a single value without accounting for any storm characteristics e g see u s weather bureau methodology leclerc and schaake 1972 or traditional figures showing arf versus area or duration however we demonstrated that the arfs given the same area and duration are extremely variable see the shades of fig 6 which implies that the areal rainfall estimated by the conventional techniques is subject to high degree of uncertainty we also showed that this high degree of uncertainty can be significantly reduced by accounting for the within storm rainfall spatial variability see fig s7 taken these we assert that the future design framework of estimating areal rainfall must embrace within storm rainfall spatial variability as a main driver of determining areal rainfall expressing the arf value not only in terms of area and duration but also in terms of the within storm rainfall coefficient of variation cv could be one way furthermore we must acknowledge that remote sensing technique of rainfall measurement such as radar and satellite have a great potential to precisely capture this within storm rainfall spatial variability an overlooked but vital element of accurate areal rainfall estimation 6 conclusions using radar composite data we employed an optimization algorithm to identify a total of 54 758 elliptically shaped storms whose central pixel rainfall value is greater than the rainfall depth corresponding to the 10 year frequency over six year study period 2007 2012 we calculated the arf value of all identified storms and recorded various characteristics of these identified ellipses along with the arf value then we attempted to identify the influence of each of storm characteristics on the arf value our findings are as follow first we confirmed a widely accepted notion that arf increases with the duration more traces of moving storm accumulate as the size of temporal window increases which subsequently reduces rainfall spatial variability and increases arf e g fig 2a conversely the relationship between the arf and the area is inversely proportional as storm area increases the relative deviation of precipitation amount within the storm increases reducing the arf value second one of the reasons we used radar data in this study was to directly investigate the interior variability of storms instead of inferring it from the ground gauge network our analysis reveals that the spatial coefficient of variation of pixel rainfall is a very strong predictor variable in estimating arf and that the larger the coefficient of variation the smaller the arf value when then were the storms with small spatial variability and thus with higher arf values found such storms are likely be identified when the watershed is aligned along the direction of storm movement these findings strongly suggest that the current framework based on the area or the duration in estimating mean areal rainfall needs to incorporate the rainfall spatial variability and storm movement the last point to consider is how much the arf values would vary between the cases when storm shape is considered and when not our computations for the ratio of the arf values from storms with circular shapes to those with elliptical shapes revealed that the average value of the ratio varies between 0 76 and 0 86 fig 9 those average values imply that the estimated arf value of a circular storm can be underestimated by 20 on average however we should emphasize that the distribution has a long tail to the left and quite a few storms 30 still have smaller values than the average which controls uncertainty kim et al 2016a b the influence of storm shape was more pronounced for the storms with smaller duration and larger area despite the lack of long term radar composite data this study is one of the first to assume that the shape of the storm is designed to be very flexible investigate the role of the spatial variability of rainfall on arf values and quantify the relative difference of the values between different storm shapes not surprisingly there are some deviations for hyetographs the number of rainy days and the extreme event value differences between the radar and gauge data there may be various reasons for these differences but we believe that the radar data still provide valuable information for analysis especially in terms of the information of rainfall spatial variability we hope that future studies will be improved with the newly installed dual polarization radar which will help us create updated object detection systems better estimate rainfall with reflectivity relationship and new bias correction techniques the methodologies presented and the storm centered arf values obtained in this study will complement the existing fixed area approaches to estimating mean areal rainfall and accounting for the variability

6823,for the last several decades great efforts have been put into converting point precipitation into mean areal precipitation in the design of hydraulic and hydrologic infrastructures the ratio between point and areal precipitation called the areal reduction factor arf has been identified to vary significantly depending on a variety of factors with some factors remaining to be undiscovered in this paper we highlight the influence of internal spatial variability of storms on the arf value for this we employ a storm identification algorithm on the radar composite data to identify a total of 54 758 elliptically shaped extreme storms over the six year study period then we investigate the relationship between the various storm characteristics to their arf value our findings are as follow first we confirm a widely accepted notion that arf generally increases with the duration and it is inversely related to the storm area second we discover that spatial variability within storm e g the coefficient of variation of radar image pixel rainfall values is a very strong predictor of the arf value along with area and duration last the difference of arf values between storms that have elliptical shapes and those that are circular over the same area is about 20 on average these findings inform that the current design framework of areal rainfall estimation will be improved by incorporating the information on the rainfall spatial variability and storm shape keywords radar rainfall areal reduction factor spatial variability 1 introduction converting point precipitation observed at a ground gauge into areal precipitation averaged over a spatial domain and estimating the ratio between them the areal reduction factor arf has been extensively studied with respect to the design of hydraulic and hydrologic infrastructures for the last several decades rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 omolayo 1993 bacchi and ranzi 1996 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 asquith and famiglietti 2000 yoo et al 2007 svensson and jones 2010 barbero et al 2014 pavlovic et al 2016 the concept of arf is essential not only because point precipitation can only be valid within a limited area but also because areal precipitation tends to be smaller than point precipitation as the domain area becomes larger many empirical and analytical methods for estimating arf have been developed rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 omolayo 1993 bacchi and ranzi 1996 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 asquith and famiglietti 2000 svensson and jones 2010 barbero et al 2014 pavlovic et al 2016 analytical methods focus on developing theoretical relationship between the point rainfall and areal rainfall based on a mathematical framework with set of hypothesis made on spatial correlation structure rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 omolayo 1993 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 crossing properties bacchi and ranzi 1996 concepts of scaling relationships and self affinity de michele et al 2001 veneziano and langousis 2005 veneziano et al 2006 and storm movement bengtsson and niemczynowicz 1986 in contrast empirical methods are often used to provide practical design guidelines on areal rainfall estimation while making no assumptions on spatial or temporal rainfall structures depending on how one chooses rainfall areas the approaches of deriving arf can be also categorized into a fixed area approach which normally focuses on rain gauge networks within a fixed area like a watershed and a storm centered approach in which the area used for computing the arfs is not fixed but varies depending on individual rainfall events omolayo 1993 asquith and famiglietti 2000 pietersen et al 2015 both approaches have advantages and disadvantages omolayo 1993 sivapalan and blöschl 1998 olivera et al 2008 one of the drawbacks of the fixed area approach is that it does not reflect the spatial rainfall structure of storms that concurrently influence multiple gauges located in a watershed in other words it assumes the spatial structure is secured by design rainfall values occurring at different times which are independently estimated at each of the gauges in the watershed omolayo 1993 olivera et al 2008 on the other hand the storm centered approach overcomes this drawback because such a spatial structure of storms can be directly extracted from two dimensional precipitation fields the latter approach however requires high resolution precipitation images that can be obtained through weather radar or highly dense ground gage network wright et al 2014 capable of reflecting storm spatial structures sufficiently which becomes possible through either a precipitation gauge network with an extremely high density or a remotely sensed measurement of which accuracy is still under debate arfs estimated by these approaches have been found to vary significantly depending on a variety of factors related to rainfall characteristics and patterns e g convective showers frontal rainfall or storms generated at the center of low pressure cyclones physical characteristics of a watershed e g altitude topography or urbanization and data resolutions interpolation methods and algorithms used to derive the arfs svensson and

veneziano and langousis 2005 and the data or methodology adopted asquith and famiglietti 2000 allen and degaetano 2005b numerous studies have been conducted with the information described above however there have been no studies that explore the direct effect of the spatial variability within a storm on arfs despite its importance in the computation of areal rainfall identifying the precise spatiotemporal variability of precipitation and its extremes has not yet been achievable with on site networks of rain gauge stations because the gauge networks are still too sparse inaccurately estimated areal rainfall and the corresponding arf values may eventually result in biased consequences on the expected watershed response e g streamflow flood peak borga 2002 jasper et al 2002 ivanov

hydrogeomorphic responses to rainfall these adverse impacts can be exacerbated when the spatio temporal rainfall characteristics are as complex as in our study area where multiple rainfall mechanisms exist simultaneously such as convectional frontal orographic and convergent lifting lee et al 2016 the development of remote sensing techniques and instruments have accelerated the possibility and thus many efforts have been made to employ the data in estimating arfs bacchi and ranzi 1996 durrans et al 2002 allen and degaetano 2005a lombardo et al 2006 olivera et al 2008 overeem et al 2010 ercan and goodall 2012 in this study we attempt to employ radar composite field data with 1 km 1 km resolution quantitatively characterize the degree of spatial variability of the storm compute the storm centered arfs in either circular or elliptical forms and investigate the factors affecting their variabilities this study targets a 99 720 km2 domain of south korea in which the causes of precipitation are very complex a storm identification and tracking algorithm cho et al 2011 cho et al 2013 is employed to detect the best elliptical shapes in the center of the storms tens of thousands of elliptical samples of various size are distinguished and analyzed this large number of storm ellipses will be beneficial in comprehensively determining the role of the spatial variability of rainfall on arf estimation and pinpointing new factors affecting this calculation 2 storm identification procedure and methodology first we must identify the individual storms to be used for arf analysis since storms vary greatly in time and space and their variability is highly unpredictable we attempt to first determine storm centers that contain specific time and location information we then identify the elliptical shapes i e aspect orientation and size encompassing the storm centers determined at that time and location last we perform a filtering process to identify statistically independent storm ellipses to be considered for further analysis in this study we focus on large rainfall events e g rainfall at storm center is greater than the point rainfall of 10 year frequency to make this process easier we assumed that the extreme events can be captured by looking at the pixels of radar image if their accumulated rainfall volume with a given temporal duration exceeds a specific threshold over the entire period 09 17 2007 12 31 2012 a detailed description of this process is provided in the following paragraph and an associated flow chart is illustrated in fig 1 the first step in identifying each storm and computing its arf is to build a time series at every radar pixel 1 km 1 km spatial resolution within south korea given the radar quantitative precipitation estimation mohr and vaughan 1979 cho et al 2006 kma 2013 ye et al 2015 since this estimation is limited by the radar s 10 minute temporal resolution a time series is reconstructed for a duration interval by utilizing the accumulated rainfall depths during the interval and moving the interval window by 10 min over time e g fig s1 for a duration of 1 h for the entire period used in this study the total number of temporal grids in the reconstructed time series for the duration of 1 3 6 12 24 and 72 h is 278203 278191 278173 278137 278065 and 277777 respectively if these temporal grids were combined with the spatial grids i e the 106 735 rainfall cells of the domain the total number of possible storms would extend up to the order of eleven so we have attempted to reduce the number of storms for simplicity by selecting extreme storms only the second step is to find storm centers that correspond spatially and temporally with the extreme storms this step is especially important because arfs are primarily used to reflect the characteristics of extreme storms in designing flood defense systems for this we first assume that extreme storms should contain at least one of the extreme pixels that have rainfall depths greater than 10 year frequency rainfall and lower than 200 year frequency rainfall see fig s2 some pixels with extremely large rainfall values are considered to be subject to large uncertainty caused by non meteorological targets e g flying objects ground clutter chaff etc other than rainfall note that the rainfall value recorded for one pixel of radar image is assumed to be equivalent as that measured at an in situ point location inside the pixel even though some studies suggest that a large variability may reside over this small pixel area of 1 km2 peleg et al 2018 the information about rainfall depth duration and frequency at every pixel used in the above step is obtained from the official korea precipitation frequency data server website http www k idf re kr and can be seen in fig s2 identified storm centers need to be reviewed to eliminate instances of overlap in time if consecutive storm centers are then evaluated as superimposed in time only the center with the greatest accumulated rainfall will be selected for further analysis fig s3 demonstrates this process which represents the time series of the accumulated rainfall at a given pixel even though all storms in fig s3 exceed the frequency threshold our algorithm may exclude some storms e g the blue one in fig s3 if the time intervals between any consecutive storms are smaller than the given duration this exclusion algorithm ensures maximum storms that do not overlap over time for a given pixel from the storm database the next step is to identify elliptical shape of the storm center that fits the selected rainfall radar image and maximizes a rainfall volume within the storm identifying the proper storm shape could be considered a six dimensional time location vector aspect orientation and size optimization problem however if the time and location were independently selected as described in the previous step and the storm area were determined a priori the thirteen areas of 10 30 80 150 250 380 530 700 900 1250 2000 4000 8000 km2 are used in this study which encompasses from small convective storms causing local urban floods to large frontal storms exceeding the size of big watersheds finding the storm becomes a two dimensional optimization problem involving the aspect ratio r which is the ratio of the diameter of the major axis to that of the minor axis and the inclination angle θ which is the angle between the diameter of the major axis and the east axis these parameters can be optimized given the objective function 1 i r x y r θ r i where ri is a rainfall volume mm of the i th cell belonging to r x y r θ which is a series of rainfall depths corresponding to the cells within a storm defined at x y the coordinate x y of the i th cell center within the elliptical storm satisfies the following equation in the orthogonal coordinates system as 2 x cos θ y sin θ 2 r 2 x sin θ y cos θ 2 a π r 2 1 where a is the area of ellipse m2 attaining an optimum solution with multi dimension and multi modality is generally complex and demanding thus we applied an optimization algorithm named isolated speciation based particle swarm optimization cho et al 2011 one of the heuristic methods this algorithm enhances its efficiency by avoiding concentrations of particles through both deterministic and stochastic sampling and by preventing unnecessary function evaluations for the concentrated particles it assists in identifying multiple local optima in complex multi modal problems cho et al 2011 if one zooms out from a pixel to the 2 dimensional space with given areas the aforementioned process however cannot completely guarantee any spatial or spatiotemporal independency of the identified storms for example one notes the case in which frontal storms move fast in space without significant change of spatiotemporal characteristics it is challenging to conclude whether the frontal storms identified in multiple pixels are independent this complexity cannot be addressed by the temporal storm separation algorithm in step 2 for this reason we analyzed the geometric and geographic characteristics of the storms overlapping in time and space by adopting an additional process of k means clustering of which input variables include not only the spatiotemporal proximity i e the centers locating within the given areas and occurring within the given durations but also shape characteristics e g inclination angle and aspect ratio of the storms a number of storms belonging to the same cluster have similar geometric and geographic characteristics see fig s4 for the ranges of values for each cluster and thus a single representative storm with the median arf values is selected for each cluster in conclusion this analysis identified 54 758 clusters corresponding to 1 519 storm centers as a result the number of storms used in the analysis was reduced from 2 218 905 to 54 758 which is 2 47 of all storm ellipses initially identified by our algorithm for the optimized elliptical storms e g fig 2 the arf is computed as 3 arf δ a a 0 r i r 0 where a0 is the area of an elliptical storm m2 δa is the area of radar cells i e 1 km 1 km and r0 is the maximum rainfall depth of an ellipse mm 3 study domain and radar precipitation data the korean peninsula belonging to the east asian monsoon region was chosen as a study domain due to its complex spatiotemporal variation in precipitation patterns such a heterogeneity is mainly driven by its geographical features i e by the difference in specific heat capacity between the asian continent and the pacific ocean resulting in the substantial seasonality of wind direction front formation and corresponding moisture variations wet summers and dry winters in addition there is a clear regional tendency of rainfall characteristics in the study area this regionality is caused by the following reasons quasi stationary fronts causing the monsoon season in july to august tend to approach from the southern coast of korean peninsula move toward the north and then comes back to the southern coast orographic rainfall is highly concentrated on the western side of the long eastern mountainous area stretching through north south direction typhoon paths are more likely pass through the southern part of korean peninsula thus examining the spatiotemporal characteristics of rainfall patterns with a weather radar is indeed important presently eleven weather radars fig 3 operated by the korea meteorological administration kma provide coverage to the entire south korean peninsula the peninsula s first weather radar began taking measurements in september 1969 in seoul in 1985 the first nationwide radar network system was established consisting of five c band doppler radars in gwanaksan gudeoksan gosan donghae and osungsan in late 1990 five more radars were added in baengnyeongdo jindo gwangdeoksan myeonbongsan and sungsan to help resolve the terrain blockage occurring in the mountainous regions and provide better monitoring of storms yoo et al 2016 a total of eight s band and three c band radars were employed for this study to construct the composite field of rainfall with some areas of terrain blockage and cones of silence being filled by means of an interpolation technique nimr 1994 wrc 2010 the ground echoes and anomalous propagation in radars were removed using a fuzzy logic approach cho et al 2006 ye et al 2015 and the composite radar field was performed by mosaics of reflectivity data over the overlapped coverage of radars mohr and vaughan 1979 lee et al 2010 in this study radar composite data from the september 17th 2007 to the december 31st 2012 was used published and freely available from the kma website https data kma go kr data rmt rmtlist do code 11 pgmno 62 which includes spatial distributions of the precipitation intensities quantitatively estimated from radar composites 4 results and analysis 4 1 radar rainfall results and comparison with gauge networks fig s1 shows the time series of hourly rainfall extracted from radar composite fields using the methodology described in step one and the rainfall duration curves computed with the hourly data that exceeded the threshold of 1 mm h due to the nature of spatially distributed radar rainfall fields the time series can be extracted spatially for the entire korean region i e 106 735 grid cells but in this figure the time series in the ten representative areas see fig 3 are illustrated and compared with those observed at the gauge networks for simplicity there is a consistency in the overall patterns of the hyetographs see the left side plots of fig s1 and the rainfall duration curves see the right side plots of fig s1 at all locations although there exist some deviations in the intensity of rainfall at some locations e g seosan or jecheon and the number of rainy days not shown since this study is being conducted on relatively larger events among the continuous rainfall events it is meaningful to further compare the extreme values because the radar covers a larger area than a point at a gauge location and represents an average value over the area we would expect that rainy days would be detected more frequently and that extreme rainfall could be dispersed over more than one point of rainfall measurement our results correspond well with this prediction indicating that rainy hours with greater than 1 mm rainfall are better detected by radar than by gauges 5 5 vs 2 7 on average over the ten locations additionally for extreme rainfall events radar estimated precipitation is lower than the observations at gauge locations and this tendency is more prominent on an hourly scale than a daily scale see fig 4 and fig s5 and s6 fig 5 shows the value its frequency and timing of the maximum rainfall depth over the entire time period in the korean domain as expected as rainfall duration increases so does maximum rainfall volume relatively heavy rainfall occurred in the northern region the west coast and the south coast while a small amount of rain fell in the inland region of the southeast the corresponding frequency of the maximum rainfall is also illustrated in fig 5d f confirming that areas greater than the 10 year frequency are limited few regions are larger than the 200 year frequency and the northwest region near seoul has a large frequency most heavy rainfall events were concentrated in july and august when convective rains frontal jangma and typhoons arise the maximum rainfall events that occur over a short duration i e hourly often happen in august june and september but they are not sustained for a long period of time these phenomena are most pronounced in august for most areas in this study note maximum rainfall events specified at daily and hourly scale occur on different dates as is evident in fig 5 where the relative percentages of the maximum time of july for example change from 42 1 hour duration in fig 5g 65 6 hour in fig 5h to 76 24 hour in fig 5i 4 2 storm centered arf estimations 4 2 1 influence of area and duration on arf arf has been extensively studied in terms of duration and area with results suggesting that arf generally becomes smaller as area increases and larger as duration increases rodriguez iturbe and mejía 1974 pavlovic et al 2016 our results also suggest that arf depends on both duration and area arf generally increases with duration and this phenomenon becomes pronounced as the area becomes larger fig 6 a this is because as the size of the time window of rainfall accumulation increases moving storms leave traces with greater spatial homogeneity increasing the arf value but in the same time the degree of homogeneity decreases as the area of rainfall accumulation exceeds the spatial scale of storm traces which subsequently reduces the arf value the relationship between the arf and the area is also shown in fig 6b when the area is small the relative deviation of the precipitation amount in the storm is not anticipated to be as high so arf approaches a value of one conversely the arf values became smaller as the area of the storms increases for all six different rainfall durations considered the color shades in both plots of fig 6 show the inter quartile range of the arf values corresponding to each duration and area which suggests that the arf values are distributed over a fairly wide range the area arf relationship corresponding to the duration of 24 hour and 72 hour and the area of 4000 km2 and 8000 km2 shows irregular behavior the pink and light blue line of fig 6b this is mainly because there are not many storm ellipses captured in this duration area range see fig 7 h 4 2 2 influence of the various storm characteristics on the arf here we try to identify the storm characteristics that can reduce the large uncertainties residing in the arf value as indicated by the wide shaded areas shown in both plots of fig 6 the storm characteristics considered here are the maximum mean variance and coefficient of variation of the pixel radar rainfall values within a storm the shape of the storms i e storm inclination angle and storm aspect ratio the elevation of the center of the storms and the timing of storm occurrence whether storm occurred during day or night the influence of area and duration on the arf is significant as described in the previous section therefore if any of these two variables are considered as the independent variable of the analysis along with the remaining variables the true influence of the latter may be hidden therefore we first classified the storms based on different areas and durations then for each of the classified dataset we examined the correlation coefficient of the linear relationship between the variable of our interest and the arf value fig 7 summarizes the result of this analysis the title of each plot refers to the independent variable of the regression analysis and the pixel color represents the correlation coefficient between the title variable and the arf value with the area and duration specified by the pixel location the red and blue color represent the positive and negative correlation coefficient between the two variables respectively fig 7a shows that the increase of the storm mean rainfall for most areas and durations is associated with the increase of the arf value this could be understood from eq 3 that the arf value is a direct function of storm mean rainfall fig 7b suggests that the increase of the storm maximum rainfall is associated with the increase of the arf value for large areas and small durations the opposite trend was observed for the storms with small areas and large durations this means that for storms with large areas and small durations the increment of the mean storm rainfall overwhelms the increment of the maximum storm rainfall it is noteworthy that the storm mean and the maximum rainfall which complete the equation of the arf calculation are not highly correlated to the arf value as indicated by the thin pixel colors shown in fig 7a and b the relationship is especially weak for the storms with small areas and durations this is because a small ellipse or an ellipse with short temporal accumulation window tend to capture only a small portion or a short snapshot of rainstorms that has greater stochastic nature this subsequently adds more uncertainties to the both terms of eq 3 resulting in the weak relationship this result suggests that the arf values of small watersheds may display greater uncertainties fig 7c shows that the increase of rainfall variance leads to the decrease of the arf value large variance values may be caused when rain is accumulated on only a small part of ellipse e g fig 2b as opposed to a large part of ellipse e g fig 2a and c this means that the spatially more varying storms such as convective storms is more likely to have smaller arf values compared to the ones with less spatial variability such as frontal storms this tendency becomes clearer as the duration increases and the area decreases as the duration increases rainstorms moving inside the ellipse leaves more traces reducing the contrast between the maximum rainfall and the areal rainfall which eventually reduces the arf value as the ellipse area increases this influence becomes less apparent because the ellipse is occupied by multiple rainstorms which increases the heterogeneity of the rainfall pixels inside the ellipse one way to see the pure influence of rainfall spatial variability regardless of storm mean rainfall is to investigate the rainfall coefficient of variation cv fig 7d shows that the increase of the cv is highly correlated with the decrease of the arf value see the thick red pixel colors of the plot it signifies that cv is the by far the strongest and most consistent factor affecting the arf value among all the variables considered here we will discuss this in detail in section 5 1 fig 7e shows that the shape of storm has a mild influence on the arf value arf tends to increase for the long ellipses with small durations and small areas this is because our storm identification algorithm shows a good performance in capturing the traces of rainfall left along the direction of the rainstorm movement this trend however becomes less apparent and is even inversed as the size and the duration of an ellipse increases because of multiple rainstorms with different internal and motional characteristics being more likely to be captured by the ellipse or the advection of individual storms e g a rain band with a large aspect ratio for a short duration becomes more spherical when considering larger durations fig 7f further verifies this it shows that the ellipses inclined along the ne sw direction tend to have greater arf than the ones inclined along nw se direction a significant portion of monsoon rainfall during summer season and typhoon moves along this ne sw direction in our study area lee and kim 2007 although the light pixel colors of fig 7e and f represent that the degree of influence on arf value is rather mild correlation coefficient varies between 0 2 and 0 2 these findings could be a basis on the estimation of design areal rainfall that one should further consider storm movement characteristics and the size and orientation of watershed fig 7g shows that elevation at the storm center is negatively related to arf this trend is generally observed for most of the storms regardless of choosing different area and duration datasets one can presume that a significant orographic change within the storm area may increase rainfall spatial variability subsequently reducing the arf value lastly fig 7h shows the number of the elliptically shaped storms identified at different areas and durations note that the number of the identified storms decreases as the area and the duration increase which can adversely reduce the reliability of the analyses that were used to obtain the correlation coefficients displayed in fig 7a through g 5 discussion 5 1 rainfall coefficient of variation as a primary variable to determine the arf our investigation on fig 7a though fig 7d reveals that the coefficient of variation cv of a storm can be the most dominant factor in estimating the arf value its influence on arf was even stronger than that of the mean and maximum pixel rainfall of a storm which are the only two terms that complete the arf value calculation eq 3 here we try to confirm this notion fig 8 shows the relationship between the coefficient of variation and the arf value fig 8a isolates the influence of the area but not the duration while fig 8b isolates the influence of the duration but not the area note that the median arf values for different areas and different durations are not as much different as the cases when we did not isolate the influence of cv but area fig 6a or duration fig 6b this result means that the rainfall cv can significantly reduce the uncertainties residing in the arf value that was estimated using the combination of area and duration fig s7a shows the probability distribution of the arf values belonging to the subset corresponding to 530 km2 area and 3 hour duration the black line is drawn by using the arf values of all 638 fig 7h storms and the blue and red lines are shown by using the two greater and smaller subgroups respectively each of which is separated by the median of the storm cv there is a distinct contrast for the arf distributions with different cv ranges such a result is also observed for other subsets with different areas and durations not shown fig s7b shows the typical arf curves area versus arf for the 3 hours of duration the red and blue lines are the median of the arf values of the first and second subset classified by the magnitude of the cv respectively the shadings represent their inter quartile range these results suggest that the current design framework of estimating areal rainfall may be improved if it incorporates information on rainfall spatial variability along with the information of area and duration the reason why the combination of area and duration has been typically used over the cv in the areal rainfall estimation could be primarily because information of the latter was hardly attainable from the traditional approach using ground gauge network this issue will be tackled with the help of pixelated rainfall data such as radar or satellite product huffman et al 2007 hou et al 2014 for example a methodology of regionalization that estimates the typical rainfall variability for different area may be adopted 5 2 elliptical versus circular areal reduction factor here we further quantify the influence of storm movement on the areal rainfall factor storms leaves long traces as they move which is well captured by our storm identification algorithm in the shape of ellipses conversely the shape of circle relatively cannot capture this long traces of storm movement nor rain bands for short durations therefore we compared the ratio of arf values with circular shapes to those with elliptical shapes to see the influence of storm movement the circular arf values were estimated by drawing the circle on the rainfall field so that its center coincided with that of the ellipse but its position representing maximum rainfall was able to differ since the ellipses were determined to contain the maximum amount of rainfall for a given area and the circle is a subset of the ellipse the ratio will be generally less than one for 94 storms the average value of the ratios for all storms in this study was 0 86 for the non parametric kernel distribution or 0 76 for the histogram fig 9 those average values suggest that if the shape of the storm is circular it is likely that the estimated arf value is underestimated by 20 on average and up to 70 however it should be noted that the distribution has a long tail to the left and quite a few storms 30 still have smaller values than the average the influence of storm shape was generally greater for the storms with smaller durations and larger area fig s8 5 3 radar data issue one might contend the short length 5 5 years of the radar data used for our analysis indeed the number of the identified storm samples becomes smaller for some subsets with the larger area and duration fig 7h however the radar data in overall enabled us to capture sufficiently larger rainfall events 54 758 storms with spatially varying storm characteristics otherwise we would have not realized their existence and variability one also concerns that the true areal reduction factor may be different from our results due to chances including radar data with poor quality and inconsistencies between radar and gauge rainfalls for example the maximum pixel rainfall of a storm used in the denominator of arf calculation eq 3 may differ from the rainfall amount measured from rain gauge located in any pixel location furthermore a radar rainfall over a gridded pixel tends to be smaller than the gauge rainfall and the discrepancy between them tends to increase with the increase of storm intensity peleg et al 2018 nonetheless we believe that these shortcomings will not significantly alter our conclusion emphasizing the influence of rainfall spatial variability on the arf it is because arfs are computed from eq 3 where rainfall estimates by radar are employed in both denominator and numerator resulting that some biases can be canceled out from each other given that both terms are not subject to any conditional bias 5 4 bridging the gap in current design frameworks current design frameworks in computing the areal reduction factor and then estimating areal rainfall reflect a view that arf varies depending on area or duration i e the arf of storm decreases with increasing area while increases with duration in practice once information on the area and duration is given the arf is determined as a single value without accounting for any storm characteristics e g see u s weather bureau methodology leclerc and schaake 1972 or traditional figures showing arf versus area or duration however we demonstrated that the arfs given the same area and duration are extremely variable see the shades of fig 6 which implies that the areal rainfall estimated by the conventional techniques is subject to high degree of uncertainty we also showed that this high degree of uncertainty can be significantly reduced by accounting for the within storm rainfall spatial variability see fig s7 taken these we assert that the future design framework of estimating areal rainfall must embrace within storm rainfall spatial variability as a main driver of determining areal rainfall expressing the arf value not only in terms of area and duration but also in terms of the within storm rainfall coefficient of variation cv could be one way furthermore we must acknowledge that remote sensing technique of rainfall measurement such as radar and satellite have a great potential to precisely capture this within storm rainfall spatial variability an overlooked but vital element of accurate areal rainfall estimation 6 conclusions using radar composite data we employed an optimization algorithm to identify a total of 54 758 elliptically shaped storms whose central pixel rainfall value is greater than the rainfall depth corresponding to the 10 year frequency over six year study period 2007 2012 we calculated the arf value of all identified storms and recorded various characteristics of these identified ellipses along with the arf value then we attempted to identify the influence of each of storm characteristics on the arf value our findings are as follow first we confirmed a widely accepted notion that arf increases with the duration more traces of moving storm accumulate as the size of temporal window increases which subsequently reduces rainfall spatial variability and increases arf e g fig 2a conversely the relationship between the arf and the area is inversely proportional as storm area increases the relative deviation of precipitation amount within the storm increases reducing the arf value second one of the reasons we used radar data in this study was to directly investigate the interior variability of storms instead of inferring it from the ground gauge network our analysis reveals that the spatial coefficient of variation of pixel rainfall is a very strong predictor variable in estimating arf and that the larger the coefficient of variation the smaller the arf value when then were the storms with small spatial variability and thus with higher arf values found such storms are likely be identified when the watershed is aligned along the direction of storm movement these findings strongly suggest that the current framework based on the area or the duration in estimating mean areal rainfall needs to incorporate the rainfall spatial variability and storm movement the last point to consider is how much the arf values would vary between the cases when storm shape is considered and when not our computations for the ratio of the arf values from storms with circular shapes to those with elliptical shapes revealed that the average value of the ratio varies between 0 76 and 0 86 fig 9 those average values imply that the estimated arf value of a circular storm can be underestimated by 20 on average however we should emphasize that the distribution has a long tail to the left and quite a few storms 30 still have smaller values than the average which controls uncertainty kim et al 2016a b the influence of storm shape was more pronounced for the storms with smaller duration and larger area despite the lack of long term radar composite data this study is one of the first to assume that the shape of the storm is designed to be very flexible investigate the role of the spatial variability of rainfall on arf values and quantify the relative difference of the values between different storm shapes not surprisingly there are some deviations for hyetographs the number of rainy days and the extreme event value differences between the radar and gauge data there may be various reasons for these differences but we believe that the radar data still provide valuable information for analysis especially in terms of the information of rainfall spatial variability we hope that future studies will be improved with the newly installed dual polarization radar which will help us create updated object detection systems better estimate rainfall with reflectivity relationship and new bias correction techniques the methodologies presented and the storm centered arf values obtained in this study will complement the existing fixed area approaches to estimating mean areal rainfall and accounting for the variability

6824,information for the interspecific variation in plant stemflow production may provide important implications for their survival in drought conditions our objectives were to determine if stemflow generation varied with plant species and to ascertain their possible responses to rainfall characteristics and plant morphology stemflow volume sfv stemflow depth sfd stemflow percentages of gross rainfall sfd gr and funnelling ratio fr a quantitative index to evaluate water enrichment by stemflow were quantified in 2014 and 2015 for coexisting two tree species pinus tabuliformis and armeniaca vulgaris and two shrub species salix psammophila and caragana korshinskii on the loess plateau of china the results indicated that the generation of stemflow varied significantly among the studied four species the shrub species had larger values of sfv sfd and sfd gr than tree species fr values revealed that the soil at the plant bases for p tabuliformis a vulgaris s psammophila and c korshinskii could receive averages of 13 1 23 9 78 2 and 124 9 fold more rainwater respectively than an equivalent open area characteristics of rainfall had a notable influence on stemflow production specifically sfv and sfd were all positively and linearly correlated with rainfall in 2014 and 2015 sfd gr and fr increased linearly with rainfall in 2014 whereas increased exponentially or even decreased after reaching a rainfall threshold in 2015 significant influence of plant morphology on stemflow production was only observed for p tabuliformis but not for the other species in conclusion the studied two shrub species s psammophila and c korshinskii were morphologically more effective than the tree species p tabuliformis and a vulgaris in funnelling rainwater to the soil of the basal area this could be eco hydrologically significant for their survival in drought environments keywords funnelling ratio inter specific variation rainfall characteristics plant morphology 1 introduction rainfall is the sole source of water in most semiarid regions and thus plays a vital role in the survival of vegetation and in ecosystem development wang et al 2013a plant canopies can change the vertical and horizontal spatial distribution of rainwater by partitioning it into interception throughfall and stemflow llorens and domingo 2007 stemflow refers to the part of precipitation that flows down the stems or trunks of plants after the precipitation is intercepted staelens et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 it can alter the vertical distribution of water by funnelling water to the base of plants where it can preferentially infiltrate johnson and lehmann 2006 despite volumetrically minor compared to throughfall at the stand scale stemflow is important for the concentration and storage of water in deeper soil layers which may create favourable soil water conditions for plant growth in arid environments martinez meza and whitford 1996 li et al 2009 in fact stemflow may be an adaptive mechanism that plants have developed to survive periods of drought martinez meza and whitford 1996 garcia estringana et al 2010 stemflow is thus eco hydrologically important for plant growth in water restricted ecosystems and has received increasing attention lloyd and marques 1988 owens et al 2006 schwärzel et al 2012 the generation of stemflow has been studied in recent decades for diverse forest types in various climatic regions and the influencing factors have been well addressed herwitz 1987 cape et al 1991 tobón marin et al 2000 cao et al 2008 siles et al 2010 for example levia and frost 2003 highlighted the significance of stemflow in the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of forested and agricultural ecosystems johnson and lehmann 2006 demonstrated the variation of stemflow generation under a wide range of precipitation 600 7100 mm yr 1 most recently levia and germer 2015 presented an exhaustive review of the dynamics of stemflow generation and stemflow environment interactions in forests and shrub lands these reviews have greatly advanced our knowledge of the significance of stemflow to the hydrology of the vadose zone and its biotic and abiotic influencing factors in arid and semiarid regions there has been increasing attention paid to stemflow generation in shrub and tree species aiming to address the ecohydrological significance of stemflow to plant survival from drought environment martinez meza and whitford 1996 studied stemflow production for three multi stemmed desert shrubs larrea tridentata prosopis glandulosa and flourensia cernua in new mexico and found that root channels are preferential pathways for movement of stemflow water into soil li et al 2008 investigated stemflow generation of three shrubs tamarix ramosissima caragana korshinskii and reaumuria soongorica in a semiarid loess region of china they observed that canopy architecture of the three shrubs was an effective funnel to channel stemflow to the root area which contributes to a higher soil water content in the root area than that outside the shrub canopy xiao and mcpherson 2011 reported that plant morphology had a notable influence on stemflow generation for three tree species ginkgo biloba liquidambar styraciflua and citrus limon in california swaffer et al 2014 compared stemflow yield of two co occurring morphologically distinct tree species in a semi arid environment in australia and found that allocasuarina verticillata had a larger stemflow funnelling ratio than eucalyptus diversifolia zhang et al 2015 reported significant difference in stemflow production between two xerophytic shrubs caragana korshinskii and artemisia ordosica in a rain fed re vegetated desert ecosystem in china most recently yuan et al 2017 found that caragana korshinskii had a greater stemflow yield at all precipitation levels than that of salix psammophila and precipitation amount was the most influential meteorological factor on stemflow generation these studies greatly enhanced our understanding of the key hydrological processes in dry areas however comparisons of stemflow production for tree and shrub species within a specific semiarid region remain underrepresented in the literature this information may provide important implications for the mechanism of the active adaptation of plants to drought conditions and therefore also for the selection of suitable species for revegetation in these regions moreover most previous studies have focused on pure or mixed forest stands in temperate or tropical regions staelens et al 2008 germer et al 2010 siles et al 2010 schwärzel et al 2012 tanaka et al 2016 in arid and semiarid regions though there have been studies on shrubs or trees li et al 2008 2009 germer 2013 carlyle moses and schooling 2015 levia et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the inter specific variation in stemflow generation and the influencing factors have not been well addressed this is especially true for the co existing tree and shrub species in same semi arid regions the chinese loess plateau 35 41 n 102 114 e is covered by loessial deposits ranging from 30 to 80 m in thickness and is characterised by serious soil erosion that is a consequence of both natural and anthropogenic factors qiu et al 2001 wang et al 2010 intensive soil erosion has decreased land productivity increased environmental degradation and raised the level of the riverbed in the lower reaches of the yellow river due to sedimentation wang et al 2010 the grain for green programme was initiated in 1999 by the chinese government to increase permanent vegetative coverage by converting farmland on steep slopes to grassland or forest chen et al 2007 wang et al 2013b and was used on the loess plateau to control soil erosion and restore the ecological environment the plants used for restoration have included perennial herbs e g medicago sativa xerophytic shrubs e g caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila and some trees e g armeniaca vulgaris and pinus tabuliformis after decades of effort vegetation coverage has increased from 6 5 in the 1970s to 51 in 2010 and approximately 24 of the erosion area on the loess plateau has been controlled wang et al 2012 however improperly planted tree species has excessively depleted soil moisture and resulted in the formation and development of dry soil layers which potentially limits the development and sustainability of the ecological environment in this area wang et al 2010 2013b information for plant s inherent trait in collecting and using rainwater is thus urgently needed the study of the interspecific variation of stemflow production could provide important implications for the adaptation of plants to drought stress and could help with the understanding of key hydrological processes in semiarid regions the specific objectives of this study were therefore 1 to quantify and compare stemflow volume sfv stemflow depth sfd stemflow percentage of gross rainfall sfd gr and the funnelling ratio fr for four revegetated species and 2 to clarify the possible relationships of these parameters with rainfall characteristics and plant

evergreen tree with a flat topped crown needle shaped leaves and rough bark armeniaca vulgaris is a small tree with a spreading canopy ovate shaped leaves and smooth bark both shrubs c korshinskii and s psammophila are multiple stemmed v shaped deciduous perennial species with smooth stems twigs and leaves zhang et al 2015 salix psammophila however has more vertically oriented stems and twigs than c korshinskii six or seven plants of each species were selected from pure forests in four study sites for the measurement of stemflow these sites are geographically close to each other and have good representatives of topography and plant traits for each species in this area stemflow production in isolated trees may differ from that in closed natural forest stands xiao et al 2000 guevara escobar et al 2007 the selection of these experimental plants for clarifying the interspecific variation in stemflow production between species was thus based on two criteria 1 isolated with no influence from

correlated with rainfall for the four species during the monitoring period table 3 p 0 01 the regression analysis further indicated that the relationships between sfv sfd and rainfall could be described by significant linear models fig 3 fig 4 p 0 001 these linear regression relations did not differ notably between the successive two study years despite more heavy rainfall events occurred in 2015 in comparison to 2014 fig 2 in addition the slopes of the linear regression models between sfv sfd and rainfall for shrub species i e s psammophila and c korshinskii were notably larger than those for tree species i e p tabuliformis and a vulgaris fig 3 fig 4 however rain intensity did not have a significant influence on sfv and sfd table 3 p 0 05 sfd gr increased from 1 1 1 1 2 3 0 5 4 6

and positively correlated with rainfall for p tabuliformis a vulgaris and s psammophila table 3 p 0 05 however this is not the case for c korshinskii as no significant effect was observed table 3 p 0

fig 10 respectively for p tabuliformis a vulgaris s psammophila and c korshinskii during the studied two years the anova further indicated that both sfv sfd sfd gr and fr were significantly higher in shrub species s psammophila and c korshinskii than those in tree species p tabuliformis a vulgaris figs 7 10 p 0 05 this is in good agreement with the reported results of previous studies tables 5 6 fig 11 generally no significant difference p 0 05 was observed in sfv sfd sfd gr and fr between p tabuliformis and a vulgaris during the two years figs 7 10 however there was an exception of larger sfd gr observed in a vulgaris than in p tabuliformis in 2014 additionally the values of sfd gr and fr were significantly larger in c korshinskii than those in s psammophila in 2015 figs 9 10 p 0 05 3

was negatively correlated with dbh and ba p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effect of rainfall characteristics on stemflow production the generation of stemflow is mainly affected by rainfall not the intensity which can be a general rule and has been widely reported for diverse plant species in different climatic regions crockford and richardson 2000 owens et al 2006 llorens and domingo 2007 our study included four species typically used for revegetation on the loess plateau a semiarid region of china and the results supported this rule well table 3 the linear relationships between sfd and rainfall for the studied species fig 4 agreed well with those reported for diverse plant species staelens et al 2008 fan et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the influences of rain characteristics on sfd gr and fr differed between the year 2014 and 2015 the fact that the rains occurred in 2015 had a larger intensity than the rains in 2014 fig 2 resulted in the exponential regression relations between sfd gr and rainfall for four studied species in 2015 fig 5b the lower sfd gr and fr under rainfalls of high intensities fig 5b 6b may be due to the faster flows along branches produced by heavier rains which may exceed the flow capacities of stems to generate drip herwitz 1987 crockford and richardson 2000 li et al 2008 4 2 inter specific variations in stemflow percentage sfd gr and funnelling ratio fr sfd gr and fr varied inter specifically for both tree table 5 and shrub species table 6 the observed values of sfd gr for s psammophila in our study i e 5 4 in 2014 and 7 2 in 2015 was comparable to the values of 7 6 reported by yang et al 2008 and 6 3 reported by li et al 2009 for the same species in similar semiarid regions of china the values of sfd gr for p tabuliformis i e 1 3 in 2014 and 2 6 in 2015 and for a vulgaris i e 2 5 in 2014 and 2 9 in 2015 was within the ranges of previous studies hu et al 2010 navar 2011 chen et al 2012 levia et al 2015 in addition the observed positive correlations between sfv and tree morphological traits h dbh cpa and ba for p tabuliformis table 4 in our study is similar with the finding reported by fan et al 2015 that total stemflow volume received by the largest pine tree was 2 5 times larger than that sampled by the smallest pine tree levia and germer 2015 also reviewed positive correlations between sfv production and plant morphological parameters the higher sfd gr and fr for smaller p tabuliformis in our study as evidenced by their negative correlations with dbh or ba table 4 is consistent with the findings by murakami 2009 for japanese cypress trees and by germer et al 2010 for babassu palm trees and may highlight the significance of the redistribution of rainfall for the survival of small trees this inverse relationship between fr and plant morphological variables however was not notably observed for a vulgaris s psammophila and c korshinskii perhaps due to their different morphological traits pinus tabuliformis has an upright trunk and uniform canopy whereas a vulgaris has distinct branches near the ground and both s psammophila and c korshinskii are multiple stemmed species but the specific reasons deserve further study also contradictory conclusions about the effects of shrub morphology on stemflow generation can be found in previous publications the weak influences of plant morphology on stemflow for c korshinskii and s psammophila in our study table 4 agreed well with the findings that canopy variables height area volume and stem length did not have a significant effect on stemflow production for c korshinskii r soongorica and t ramosissima li et al 2008 however wang et al 2013a reported that stemflow for c korshinskii was negatively correlated with canopy height branch diameter and canopy volume but positively corelated with branch length and angle area of canopy projection and lai this disagreement can be due to large variation in plant morphology and architecture just as germer et al 2010 addressed that the influence of shrub morphology on stemflow yield is difficult to study in vegetation with high biodiversity fr is a quantitative index for evaluating stemflow funnelling effect of rainwater to plant bases and may have important implications for plant survival in drought conditions and thus merit more attention garcia estringana et al 2010 siegert and levia 2014 inter specific variation in fr has also been widely reported li et al 2008 found that average frs were respectively 153 5 66 2 53 2 25 7 and 24 8 15 3 for c korshinskii r soongorica and t ramosissima three semiarid shrubs in semiarid loess region of china in our study fr was higher during the study period for s psammophila and c korshinskii than a vulgaris and p tabuliformis as described previously s psammophila has numerous and nearly vertical branches and smooth bark which would easily direct rainwater down to the basal area under both light and heavy rains yang et al 2008 the smaller basal area and larger sfv of s psammophila and c korshinskii table 1 fig 3 jointly contributed to their higher frs in comparison with a vulgaris and p tabuliformis the canopy would thus act as a funnel to collect rainwater from a larger rain receiving area canopy and would then funnel the water via stemflow to a concentrated basal area this spatially concentrated point input of rainwater could infiltrate through soil macrospores into deeper soil layers as the preferential flow and the water would remain spatially available for extraction by roots martinez meza and whitford 1996 zhang et al 2015 4 3 potential implications of funnelling ratio fr on the survival of vegetation plant canopies can collect a substantial amount of rainwater and then channel it down along branches or stems as stemflow to the roots where the rainwater serves as a spatially localised input of precipitation and can be further funnelled by the root systems through preferential belowground flow pathways schwärzel et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 buttle et al 2014 spencer and meerveld 2016 stemflow root channelling is thus an important adaptive mechanism for xerophytic plants to survive seasonal drought garcia estringana et al 2010 this ability to funnel rainwater however varies considerably with species due to morphological and structural differences llorens and domingo 2007 the summaries of previous publications tables 5 6 indicated that tree species had lower sfd gr and fr than shrub species fig 11 in our study fr during the rainy seasons of 2014 and 2015 averaged 13 1 23 9 78 2 and 124 9 for p tabuliformis a vulgaris s psammophila and c korshinskii respectively fig 10 this suggests that the soil at the plant bases could receive averages of 13 1 23 9 78 2 and 124 9 fold more rainwater respectively than an equivalent open area the higher frs for the shrub species i e s psammophila and c korshinskii than the tree species i e p tabuliformis and a vulgaris demonstrated that shrubs are morphologically more effective in funnelling rainwater to the soil at the basal area which can be eco hydrologically important for survival and growth in drought conditions carlyle moses 2004 shrubs can deliver more rainwater in unit of depth mm than trees to their basal area via stemflow under the same rainfall levels indicated by the observed larger fr values in shrubs than trees fig 10 this may partly interpret the observed fact that soil water content in 0 500 cm depths was higher in shrub land than in woodland suo et al 2017 the delivered rainwater would preferentially infiltrate into deep soil layers through root channels and soil macropores creating islands of soil moisture and thus can be an important potential source of soil moisture allowing plants to remain physiologically active during dry periods mauchamp and janeau 1993 navar 2011 the funnelled rainwater despite its low volume could consequently be used more efficiently and may thus play an important role in plant survival in drought environments 5 conclusions in the present study stemflow generation was compared for coexisting two tree species pinus tabuliformis and armeniaca vulgaris and two shrub species salix psammophila and caragana korshinskii during the rainy seasons in 2014 and 2015 on the chinese loess plateau the effects of rainfall characteristics and plant morphology on stemflow were also investigated in general the shrub species had significantly larger values of sfv sfd sfd gr and fr than tree species this indicates that the studied shrub species are morphologically more effective than tree species in generating stemflow and further in funnelling rainwater to the soil at the basal area rainfall amount greatly influenced stemflow showing positive linear or exponential correlations with sfv sfd sfd gr and fr for the four revegetated plant species notable influence of plant morphology on stemflow was only observed for p tabuliformis but not for the other species mainly due to their different morphological traits our study assists in understanding the inter specific variation in stemflow generation for revegetated tree and shrub species in the chinese loess plateau and in revealing possible strategies that plants have developed to survive environment in arid areas acknowledgements we are grateful to yalin ji sheng wang and yanchun wei

6824,information for the interspecific variation in plant stemflow production may provide important implications for their survival in drought conditions our objectives were to determine if stemflow generation varied with plant species and to ascertain their possible responses to rainfall characteristics and plant morphology stemflow volume sfv stemflow depth sfd stemflow percentages of gross rainfall sfd gr and funnelling ratio fr a quantitative index to evaluate water enrichment by stemflow were quantified in 2014 and 2015 for coexisting two tree species pinus tabuliformis and armeniaca vulgaris and two shrub species salix psammophila and caragana korshinskii on the loess plateau of china the results indicated that the generation of stemflow varied significantly among the studied four species the shrub species had larger values of sfv sfd and sfd gr than tree species fr values revealed that the soil at the plant bases for p tabuliformis a vulgaris s psammophila and c korshinskii could receive averages of 13 1 23 9 78 2 and 124 9 fold more rainwater respectively than an equivalent open area characteristics of rainfall had a notable influence on stemflow production specifically sfv and sfd were all positively and linearly correlated with rainfall in 2014 and 2015 sfd gr and fr increased linearly with rainfall in 2014 whereas increased exponentially or even decreased after reaching a rainfall threshold in 2015 significant influence of plant morphology on stemflow production was only observed for p tabuliformis but not for the other species in conclusion the studied two shrub species s psammophila and c korshinskii were morphologically more effective than the tree species p tabuliformis and a vulgaris in funnelling rainwater to the soil of the basal area this could be eco hydrologically significant for their survival in drought environments keywords funnelling ratio inter specific variation rainfall characteristics plant morphology 1 introduction rainfall is the sole source of water in most semiarid regions and thus plays a vital role in the survival of vegetation and in ecosystem development wang et al 2013a plant canopies can change the vertical and horizontal spatial distribution of rainwater by partitioning it into interception throughfall and stemflow llorens and domingo 2007 stemflow refers to the part of precipitation that flows down the stems or trunks of plants after the precipitation is intercepted staelens et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 it can alter the vertical distribution of water by funnelling water to the base of plants where it can preferentially infiltrate johnson and lehmann 2006 despite volumetrically minor compared to throughfall at the stand scale stemflow is important for the concentration and storage of water in deeper soil layers which may create favourable soil water conditions for plant growth in arid environments martinez meza and whitford 1996 li et al 2009 in fact stemflow may be an adaptive mechanism that plants have developed to survive periods of drought martinez meza and whitford 1996 garcia estringana et al 2010 stemflow is thus eco hydrologically important for plant growth in water restricted ecosystems and has received increasing attention lloyd and marques 1988 owens et al 2006 schwärzel et al 2012 the generation of stemflow has been studied in recent decades for diverse forest types in various climatic regions and the influencing factors have been well addressed herwitz 1987 cape et al 1991 tobón marin et al 2000 cao et al 2008 siles et al 2010 for example levia and frost 2003 highlighted the significance of stemflow in the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of forested and agricultural ecosystems johnson and lehmann 2006 demonstrated the variation of stemflow generation under a wide range of precipitation 600 7100 mm yr 1 most recently levia and germer 2015 presented an exhaustive review of the dynamics of stemflow generation and stemflow environment interactions in forests and shrub lands these reviews have greatly advanced our knowledge of the significance of stemflow to the hydrology of the vadose zone and its biotic and abiotic influencing factors in arid and semiarid regions there has been increasing attention paid to stemflow generation in shrub and tree species aiming to address the ecohydrological significance of stemflow to plant survival from drought environment martinez meza and whitford 1996 studied stemflow production for three multi stemmed desert shrubs larrea tridentata prosopis glandulosa and flourensia cernua in new mexico and found that root channels are preferential pathways for movement of stemflow water into soil li et al 2008 investigated stemflow generation of three shrubs tamarix ramosissima caragana korshinskii and reaumuria soongorica in a semiarid loess region of china they observed that canopy architecture of the three shrubs was an effective funnel to channel stemflow to the root area which contributes to a higher soil water content in the root area than that outside the shrub canopy xiao and mcpherson 2011 reported that plant morphology had a notable influence on stemflow generation for three tree species ginkgo biloba liquidambar styraciflua and citrus limon in california swaffer et al 2014 compared stemflow yield of two co occurring morphologically distinct tree species in a semi arid environment in australia and found that allocasuarina verticillata had a larger stemflow funnelling ratio than eucalyptus diversifolia zhang et al 2015 reported significant difference in stemflow production between two xerophytic shrubs caragana korshinskii and artemisia ordosica in a rain fed re vegetated desert ecosystem in china most recently yuan et al 2017 found that caragana korshinskii had a greater stemflow yield at all precipitation levels than that of salix psammophila and precipitation amount was the most influential meteorological factor on stemflow generation these studies greatly enhanced our understanding of the key hydrological processes in dry areas however comparisons of stemflow production for tree and shrub species within a specific semiarid region remain underrepresented in the literature this information may provide important implications for the mechanism of the active adaptation of plants to drought conditions and therefore also for the selection of suitable species for revegetation in these regions moreover most previous studies have focused on pure or mixed forest stands in temperate or tropical regions staelens et al 2008 germer et al 2010 siles et al 2010 schwärzel et al 2012 tanaka et al 2016 in arid and semiarid regions though there have been studies on shrubs or trees li et al 2008 2009 germer 2013 carlyle moses and schooling 2015 levia et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the inter specific variation in stemflow generation and the influencing factors have not been well addressed this is especially true for the co existing tree and shrub species in same semi arid regions the chinese loess plateau 35 41 n 102 114 e is covered by loessial deposits ranging from 30 to 80 m in thickness and is characterised by serious soil erosion that is a consequence of both natural and anthropogenic factors qiu et al 2001 wang et al 2010 intensive soil erosion has decreased land productivity increased environmental degradation and raised the level of the riverbed in the lower reaches of the yellow river due to sedimentation wang et al 2010 the grain for green programme was initiated in 1999 by the chinese government to increase permanent vegetative coverage by converting farmland on steep slopes to grassland or forest chen et al 2007 wang et al 2013b and was used on the loess plateau to control soil erosion and restore the ecological environment the plants used for restoration have included perennial herbs e g medicago sativa xerophytic shrubs e g caragana korshinskii and salix psammophila and some trees e g armeniaca vulgaris and pinus tabuliformis after decades of effort vegetation coverage has increased from 6 5 in the 1970s to 51 in 2010 and approximately 24 of the erosion area on the loess plateau has been controlled wang et al 2012 however improperly planted tree species has excessively depleted soil moisture and resulted in the formation and development of dry soil layers which potentially limits the development and sustainability of the ecological environment in this area wang et al 2010 2013b information for plant s inherent trait in collecting and using rainwater is thus urgently needed the study of the interspecific variation of stemflow production could provide important implications for the adaptation of plants to drought stress and could help with the understanding of key hydrological processes in semiarid regions the specific objectives of this study were therefore 1 to quantify and compare stemflow volume sfv stemflow depth sfd stemflow percentage of gross rainfall sfd gr and the funnelling ratio fr for four revegetated species and 2 to clarify the possible relationships of these parameters with rainfall characteristics and plant morphology we expect to provide some insight on the mechanism of the active adaptation of plants to drought conditions in semiarid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description our study was conducted in the liudaogou catchment 38 46 38 51 n 110 21 110 23 e of shenmu county on the northern loess plateau of china fig 1 this area has an area of 6 89 km2 and is characterised by intensive soil erosion and low land productivity which is caused by both natural e g the unique geology and landforms climatic conditions and low vegetative coverage due to water resource constraints and anthropogenic e g poor land use management including cultivation of marginal land and destruction of natural vegetation factors qiu et al 2001 wang et al 2010 this area is characterized by moderate temperate continental climate based on the meteorological data monitored in the period of 1971 2013 at 38 47 43 n 110 21 44 e the mean annual precipitation is 437 mm range of 109 891 mm approximately

according to the usda classification system zhu and shao 2008 2 2 field measurements stemflow production was simultaneously monitored during the rainy season july to september of 2014 and 2015 for p tabuliformis a vulgaris and s psammophila but monitored for c korshinskii only in 2015 these are good representatives of the revegetated plant species in this area pinus tabuliformis is a medium sized evergreen tree with a flat topped crown needle shaped leaves and rough bark armeniaca vulgaris is a small tree with a spreading canopy ovate shaped leaves and smooth bark both shrubs c korshinskii and s psammophila are multiple stemmed v shaped deciduous perennial species with smooth stems twigs and leaves zhang et al 2015 salix psammophila however has more vertically oriented stems and twigs than c korshinskii six or seven plants of each species were selected from pure forests in four study sites for the measurement of stemflow these sites are geographically close to each other and have good representatives of topography and plant traits for each species in this area stemflow production in isolated trees may differ from that in closed natural forest stands xiao et al 2000 guevara escobar et al 2007 the selection of these experimental plants for clarifying the interspecific variation in stemflow production between species was thus based on two criteria 1 isolated with no influence from other plants and 2 representative in plant morphology and architecture table 1 we measured plant height h diameter at breast height dbh canopy projection area cpa basal area ba leaf area index lai and total number of stems tns h was measured using an extendible ruler dbh was only measured for p tabuliformis using a vernier calliper at a height of 130 cm cpa was calculated from the formula for a circle using the average diameter based on four measurements from directions of north south east west northeast southwest and northwest southeast of the canopy ba was calculated from the trunk basal diameter measured at a height of 5 cm for the four species and lai was measured at four orthogonal locations beneath the canopy at about 9 00 a m in the clear skies june 20th august 4th and september 21th for individual plants using a plant canopy analyser lai 2200 licor bioscience lincoln usa a standard automated tipping bucket rain gauge rg3 m onset computer corp bourne usa was installed in an open area at each study site to measure the rainfall characteristics rainfall events were identified with the amount greater than 0 2 mm and separated from each other if no rain occurs in 4 h giacomin and trucchi 1992 sfv was determined for each rain for the four species sfv for p tabuliformis and a vulgaris was measured for each tree using collars constructed with 3 cm polyethylene tubes that were slit open and then sealed around the trunks fig 1b 1c the rainwater collected by the collars was diverted into 25 l plastic buckets placed on the ground sfv for c korshinskii and s psammophila was measured for six stems per plant and then averaged fig 1d 1e the stems were carefully selected to represent the range of morphological characteristics i e length diameter at basal area and stem inclination angle the total sfv for an individual c korshinskii or s psammophila was then estimated by multiplying tns by the average sfv per stem sfv was collected using collars constructed from flexible aluminium foil plates fitted around the entire circumference of the stems each collar was sealed to the stems using all weather silicon caulking jian et al 2014 the rainwater collected by the collars was diverted into 2 5 l plastic buckets placed on the ground the sfv were measured immediately after the cessation of each rain using a graduated cylinder the sfd was calculated by 1 s f d s f v c p a 10 3 where sfv is the total volume of stemflow ml and cpa is the canopy projection area m2 fr introduced by herwitz 1986 as a quantitative index to evaluate water enrichment by stemflow in the basal area of a tree or shrub was determined by 2 f r s f v b a p 10 where sfv is the total volume of stemflow ml ba is the basal area of the trunk or stems cm2 and p is the depth equivalent to the gross incident precipitation mm the product ba p provides the volume of water that would have been caught by a rain gauge with an opening equal to that of the trunk basal area fr thus represents the ratio of the amount of the precipitation delivered to the base of the plant to the amount of rainwater that would have reached the ground if the plants were not present wang et al 2011 an fr 1

correlated with rainfall for the four species during the monitoring period table 3 p 0 01 the regression analysis further indicated that the relationships between sfv sfd and rainfall could be described by significant linear models fig 3 fig 4 p 0 001 these linear regression relations did not differ notably between the successive two study years despite more heavy rainfall events occurred in 2015 in comparison to 2014 fig 2 in addition the slopes of the linear regression models between sfv sfd and rainfall for shrub species i e s psammophila and c korshinskii were notably larger than those for tree species i e p tabuliformis and a vulgaris fig 3 fig 4 however rain intensity did not have a significant influence on sfv and sfd table 3 p 0 05 sfd gr increased from 1 1 1 1 2 3 0 5 4 6

and positively correlated with rainfall for p tabuliformis a vulgaris and s psammophila table 3 p 0 05 however this is not the case for c korshinskii as no significant effect was observed table 3 p 0

studied plant species in 2014 fig 6 a p 0 05 however fr increased exponentially with rainfall for the shrub species i e s psammophila and c korshinskii fig 6b p 0 05 but tented to decrease for the tree species i e p tabuliformis and a vulgaris in 2015 after a rainfall threshold of approximate 20 mm was reached 3 4 inter specific variation of stemflow production sfv averaged 3 5 3 3 5 0 4 1 13 8

fig 10 respectively for p tabuliformis a vulgaris s psammophila and c korshinskii during the studied two years the anova further indicated that both sfv sfd sfd gr and fr were significantly higher in shrub species s psammophila and c korshinskii than those in tree species p tabuliformis a vulgaris figs 7 10 p 0 05 this is in good agreement with the reported results of previous studies tables 5 6 fig 11 generally no significant difference p 0 05 was observed in sfv sfd sfd gr and fr between p tabuliformis and a vulgaris during the two years figs 7 10 however there was an exception of larger sfd gr observed in a vulgaris than in p tabuliformis in 2014 additionally the values of sfd gr and fr were significantly larger in c korshinskii than those in s psammophila in 2015 figs 9 10 p 0 05 3 5 the influences of plant morphology on stemflow production the influence of plant morphology on stemflow differed with plant species table 4 generally notable influences were observed only for p tabuliformis but not for the other species for p tabuliformis sfv was positively correlated with h dbh cpa and ba p 0 05 sfd and sfd gr was both negatively correlated with h dbh and ba p 0 05 and fr was negatively correlated with dbh and ba p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effect of rainfall characteristics on stemflow production the generation of stemflow is mainly affected by rainfall not the intensity which can be a general rule and has been widely reported for diverse plant species in different climatic regions crockford and richardson 2000 owens et al 2006 llorens and domingo 2007 our study included four species typically used for revegetation on the loess plateau a semiarid region of china and the results supported this rule well table 3 the linear relationships between sfd and rainfall for the studied species fig 4 agreed well with those reported for diverse plant species staelens et al 2008 fan et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the influences of rain characteristics on sfd gr and fr differed between the year 2014 and 2015 the fact that the rains occurred in 2015 had a larger intensity than the rains in 2014 fig 2 resulted in the exponential regression relations between sfd gr and rainfall for four studied species in 2015 fig 5b the lower sfd gr and fr under rainfalls of high intensities fig 5b 6b may be due to the faster flows along branches produced by heavier rains which may exceed the flow capacities of stems to generate drip herwitz 1987 crockford and richardson 2000 li et al 2008 4 2 inter specific variations in stemflow percentage sfd gr and funnelling ratio fr sfd gr and fr varied inter specifically for both tree table 5 and shrub species table 6 the observed values of sfd gr for s psammophila in our study i e 5 4 in 2014 and 7 2 in 2015 was comparable to the values of 7 6 reported by yang et al 2008 and 6 3 reported by li et al 2009 for the same species in similar semiarid regions of china the values of sfd gr for p tabuliformis i e 1 3 in 2014 and 2 6 in 2015 and for a vulgaris i e 2 5 in 2014 and 2 9 in 2015 was within the ranges of previous studies hu et al 2010 navar 2011 chen et al 2012 levia et al 2015 in addition the observed positive correlations between sfv and tree morphological traits h dbh cpa and ba for p tabuliformis table 4 in our study is similar with the finding reported by fan et al 2015 that total stemflow volume received by the largest pine tree was 2 5 times larger than that sampled by the smallest pine tree levia and germer 2015 also reviewed positive correlations between sfv production and plant morphological parameters the higher sfd gr and fr for smaller p tabuliformis in our study as evidenced by their negative correlations with dbh or ba table 4 is consistent with the findings by murakami 2009 for japanese cypress trees and by germer et al 2010 for babassu palm trees and may highlight the significance of the redistribution of rainfall for the survival of small trees this inverse relationship between fr and plant morphological variables however was not notably observed for a vulgaris s psammophila and c korshinskii perhaps due to their different morphological traits pinus tabuliformis has an upright trunk and uniform canopy whereas a vulgaris has distinct branches near the ground and both s psammophila and c korshinskii are multiple stemmed species but the specific reasons deserve further study also contradictory conclusions about the effects of shrub morphology on stemflow generation can be found in previous publications the weak influences of plant morphology on stemflow for c korshinskii and s psammophila in our study table 4 agreed well with the findings that canopy variables height area volume and stem length did not have a significant effect on stemflow production for c korshinskii r soongorica and t ramosissima li et al 2008 however wang et al 2013a reported that stemflow for c korshinskii was negatively correlated with canopy height branch diameter and canopy volume but positively corelated with branch length and angle area of canopy projection and lai this disagreement can be due to large variation in plant morphology and architecture just as germer et al 2010 addressed that the influence of shrub morphology on stemflow yield is difficult to study in vegetation with high biodiversity fr is a quantitative index for evaluating stemflow funnelling effect of rainwater to plant bases and may have important implications for plant survival in drought conditions and thus merit more attention garcia estringana et al 2010 siegert and levia 2014 inter specific variation in fr has also been widely reported li et al 2008 found that average frs were respectively 153 5 66 2 53 2 25 7 and 24 8 15 3 for c korshinskii r soongorica and t ramosissima three semiarid shrubs in semiarid loess region of china in our study fr was higher during the study period for s psammophila and c korshinskii than a vulgaris and p tabuliformis as described previously s psammophila has numerous and nearly vertical branches and smooth bark which would easily direct rainwater down to the basal area under both light and heavy rains yang et al 2008 the smaller basal area and larger sfv of s psammophila and c korshinskii table 1 fig 3 jointly contributed to their higher frs in comparison with a vulgaris and p tabuliformis the canopy would thus act as a funnel to collect rainwater from a larger rain receiving area canopy and would then funnel the water via stemflow to a concentrated basal area this spatially concentrated point input of rainwater could infiltrate through soil macrospores into deeper soil layers as the preferential flow and the water would remain spatially available for extraction by roots martinez meza and whitford 1996 zhang et al 2015 4 3 potential implications of funnelling ratio fr on the survival of vegetation plant canopies can collect a substantial amount of rainwater and then channel it down along branches or stems as stemflow to the roots where the rainwater serves as a spatially localised input of precipitation and can be further funnelled by the root systems through preferential belowground flow pathways schwärzel et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 buttle et al 2014 spencer and meerveld 2016 stemflow root channelling is thus an important adaptive mechanism for xerophytic plants to survive seasonal drought garcia estringana et al 2010 this ability to funnel rainwater however varies considerably with species due to morphological and structural differences llorens and domingo 2007 the summaries of previous publications tables 5 6 indicated that tree species had lower sfd gr and fr than shrub species fig 11 in our study fr during the rainy seasons of 2014 and 2015 averaged 13 1 23 9 78 2 and 124 9 for p tabuliformis a vulgaris s psammophila and c korshinskii respectively fig 10 this suggests that the soil at the plant bases could receive averages of 13 1 23 9 78 2 and 124 9 fold more rainwater respectively than an equivalent open area the higher frs for the shrub species i e s psammophila and c korshinskii than the tree species i e p tabuliformis and a vulgaris demonstrated that shrubs are morphologically more effective in funnelling rainwater to the soil at the basal area which can be eco hydrologically important for survival and growth in drought conditions carlyle moses 2004 shrubs can deliver more rainwater in unit of depth mm than trees to their basal area via stemflow under the same rainfall levels indicated by the observed larger fr values in shrubs than trees fig 10 this may partly interpret the observed fact that soil water content in 0 500 cm depths was higher in shrub land than in woodland suo et al 2017 the delivered rainwater would preferentially infiltrate into deep soil layers through root channels and soil macropores creating islands of soil moisture and thus can be an important potential source of soil moisture allowing plants to remain physiologically active during dry periods mauchamp and janeau 1993 navar 2011 the funnelled rainwater despite its low volume could consequently be used more efficiently and may thus play an important role in plant survival in drought environments 5 conclusions in the present study stemflow generation was compared for coexisting two tree species pinus tabuliformis and armeniaca vulgaris and two shrub species salix psammophila and caragana korshinskii during the rainy seasons in 2014 and 2015 on the chinese loess plateau the effects of rainfall characteristics and plant morphology on stemflow were also investigated in general the shrub species had significantly larger values of sfv sfd sfd gr and fr than tree species this indicates that the studied shrub species are morphologically more effective than tree species in generating stemflow and further in funnelling rainwater to the soil at the basal area rainfall amount greatly influenced stemflow showing positive linear or exponential correlations with sfv sfd sfd gr and fr for the four revegetated plant species notable influence of plant morphology on stemflow was only observed for p tabuliformis but not for the other species mainly due to their different morphological traits our study assists in understanding the inter specific variation in stemflow generation for revegetated tree and shrub species in the chinese loess plateau and in revealing possible strategies that plants have developed to survive environment in arid areas acknowledgements we are grateful to yalin ji sheng wang and yanchun wei
