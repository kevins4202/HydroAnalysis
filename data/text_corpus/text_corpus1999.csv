9995,jute mallow corchorus olitorius l is an annual crop grown for human consumption of its nutritious leaves in many regions of the world despite its importance for household food security and farmers income reliable information on the crop s water requirements is still quite scarce to overcome this knowledge gap the irrigation needs of jute mallow grown in the akkar region in syria were investigated the analysis focused on a three year period 2017 2019 where the simdualkc model was calibrated and validated for simulating soil water contents and computing the soil water balance in jute mallow plots irrigated with basin and drip methods the model was further used to determine the probabilities of the demand for irrigation water in scenarios considering different crop season lengths irrigation methods and application depths over a longer period of 23 years 1998 2020 the simdualkc model was able to simulate soil water contents measured in the field plots returning root mean square error values lower than 0 001 m3 m 3 and modeling efficiencies ranging from 0 358 to 0 812 the calibrated basal non stressed crop coefficients kcb were 0 15 0 95 and 0 95 for the initial kcb ini mid season kcb mid and end season kcb end stages respectively the crop was harvested twice per season with the drip treatments presenting the highest water productivity and economic indicators in contrast the basin treatment resulted in substantial percolation losses which affected yields and indicators although net irrigation requirements showed a large variation for the extremes of the long term weather time series differences between the years representing average water demand and those representing very high water demand were only found for the drip irrigation scenarios this study contributes to improving irrigation water management of jute mallow in the syrian akkar region and for the sustainability of local production systems keywords crop transpiration simdualkc soil evaporation soil water balance water productivity 1 introduction corchorus is a commercially important genus of the malvaceae family which comprises more than fifty species with different ethnobotanical applications kumari et al 2019 jute mallow corchorus olitorius l is one of the most relevant species of the corchorus genus widely grown for fiber production or as a leafy vegetable in africa asia and parts of latin america and the middle east choudhary et al 2013 kumari et al 2019 the plant is an erect annual herb 2 4 m tall with lanceolate to palmate leaves which are a rich source of carbohydrates polysaccharides vitamins b2 b9 c and e minerals such as iron and calcium β carotene and several phenolic compounds lin et al 2009 fondio and grubben 2011 the leaves are further used for medicinal purposes due to their diuretic analgesic antimicrobial and antipyretic characteristics as well as their antitumor and phenolic antioxidative constituents zakaria et al 2006 yakoub et al 2018 kumari et al 2019 lastly the crop is cheap to produce representing a quality food source for large segments of the population in urban and rural areas choudhary et al 2013 ngomuo et al 2017 in syria jute mallow is mainly produced as a leafy vegetable crop in the governorates of hama in the al ghab depression tartus and latakia where climate conditions the land organization in smallholdings and the proximity of highly dense urban areas that provide for market opportunities favor the production of profitable vegetable crops chard 1981 wattenbach 2006 in these regions the cultivated area sums close to 1 4 m ha representing 10 2 of the syrian cultivated land of which 82 are irrigated wattenbach 2006 cbs 2019 the most prominent and profitable vegetables grown there are tomato solanum lycopersicum l cucumber cucumis sativus l squash cucurbita pepo l and eggplant solanum melongena l but the area cultivated with these crops including jute mallow is uncertain due to the characteristics of local production systems which often include double cropping systems or crops cultivated in the interrow of less dense and young tree orchards several policy measures were implemented in those regions as well as in other agricultural areas in syria to rationalize agricultural water use oweis et al 2003 varela ortega and sagardoy 2003 sadiddin 2013 mourad and alshihabi 2016 abou zakhem et al 2019 improve water and economic irrigation systems productivity performance and farmers income fader et al 2016 darouich et al 2012 2014 2017 modernize irrigation methods and management yigezu et al 2013 darouich et al 2020 and improve fertigation techniques janat 2007 as a result and despite most endeavors have been destroyed by the on going war modern irrigation systems have been slowly replacing traditional surface irrigation systems due to water saving policies aimed at improving land and water productivity as well as protecting local groundwater and downstream water bodies from diffuse pollution therefore drip irrigation presently supplies 43 of the irrigated area in tartus and latakia but only 4 in hama cbs 2019 where nonetheless trends for adopting drip irrigation already exist improving irrigation water use while minimizing the associated environmental risks can only be achieved through the accurate estimate of crop water requirements and appropriate irrigation schedules irrigation timing duration and quantity for maximizing yields farmers income and agricultural water productivity pereira et al 2002 although jute mallow shows a remarkable value for household food security medicinal applications and farmers income in many regions of the world there is still insufficient information on the crop water needs crop coefficients kc and crop sensitiveness to water stress as shown by the knowledge gap in the recent update of tabulated fao56 crop coefficients provided by pereira et al 2021 for vegetable crops allen et al 2011a 2011b revised a variety of field measurement approaches and related requirements for obtaining accurate estimates of evapotranspiration et and crop water requirements at the field plot scale with appropriate focus on the combined monitoring of changes in soil water contents with the use of soil water balance models pereira et al 2020a also provided a review of soil water balance modeling approaches to determine crop et crop irrigation requirements and irrigation schedules following the fao56 method allen et al 1998 this widely used method refers either to the single kc or to the dual kc approach to determine crop evapotranspiration as the product of a crop coefficient and the grass reference evapotranspiration eto the latter is computed with the fao penman monteith fao pm equation and crop evapotranspiration may be measured by several methods as described and discussed by allen et al 2011a and pereira et al 2020a unfortunately existing papers on crop coefficients for jute mallow use reference et different from the standard eto which may make their use highly biased therefore there is the need to derive accurate kc from field etc data and the fao pm eto the dual kc approach which partitions crop evapotranspiration etc into its components crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es also partitions kc into the basal crop coefficient kcb referring to tc and the soil evaporation coefficient ke this approach results more precise namely because it improves the estimation accuracy of the evaporation component pereira et al 2015a 2020a the dual kc approach is widely applied for estimating evapotranspiration fluxes of crops grown under different climatic regions and management practices lópez urrea et al 2009 paço et al 2012 kool et al 2014 gonzález et al 2015 paredes et al 2018a 2018b similarly the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a which adopts the fao56 dual kc approach has been applied to various crops including a winter wheat summer maize crop sequence zhao et al 2013 soybean wei et al 2015 and tomato zhang et al 2018 in the north of china potato in southern italy paredes et al 2018a maize in brazil and uruguay martins et al 2013 giménez et al 2016 and bermudagrass in brazil paredes et al 2018b the simdualkc model was further used in syria to estimate crop coefficients and water use of wheat rosa et al 2012b and of zucchini squash under diverse irrigation regimes darouich et al 2020 the reported variety of applications in terms of crops environmental and weather conditions as well as management practices assures the suitability of the model for the present study considering the brief review above the objectives of this study are i to simulate soil water contents in jute mallow plots irrigated with basin and drip methods using the simdualkc model during three growing seasons 2017 2019 ii to derive the crop coefficients for jute mallow grown in the syrian akkar plain using the dual kc approach iii to evaluate the components of the soil water balance from a water saving and economic perspective and iv to define seasonal irrigation thresholds based on the crop s net irrigation requirements computed using a long term weather time series that may serve as guidelines for defining future water saving policies results of this study will contribute to improving irrigation water use performance in the syrian coastal region where the akkar plain is located and for the sustainability of jute mallow production in the region 2 material and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 description of the study site the field experiment was performed at the zahid research center 34 41 37 n 35 59 16 e 12 m a s l in the western part of the akkar plain tartus governorate syria from may 2017 to august 2019 the akkar plain is located on a narrow coastal area of fertile land between the cities of tartus in syria and trípoli in lebanon the region is especially suited to produce field and greenhouse grown vegetables due to favorable environmental and climate conditions the proximity of highly dense urban areas and water resources availability wattenbach 2006 the climate in the region is classified as hot summer mediterranean climate csa köppen 1884 the mean annual air temperature is 19 3 ºc while the mean daily temperatures range from a minimum of 11 5 ºc in january to a maximum of 27 0 ºc in august the mean annual precipitation is 930 mm which occur mostly between october and may the mean annual reference evapotranspiration eto computed with the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 is 1363 mm

falat and ostouene rivers which supply 29 100 ha of irrigated agricultural land in tartus and 38 000 ha in latakia complemented with groundwater resources cbs 2019 the depth of these groundwater resources varies between 10 and 20 m abou zakhem and hafez 2007 2 1 2 experimental design and treatments the experimental design used to study the soil water balance of zucchini squash in the same region darouich et al 2020 was also adopted for jute mallow known locally as molokhia the experiment involved irrigation with basin and drip methods and various schedules during the 2017 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the experimental area with 23 m long and 19 m wide 437 m2 was flat with 0 005 and 0 002 slope in the west and south directions respectively the soil was classified as a vertisol iuss working group wrb 2014 with the main soil physical and chemical properties given in table 1 disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected for the layers 0 0 15 0 15 0 30 0 30 0 45 and 0 45 0 60 m by opening a small trench in the area adjacent to the experiment the particle size distribution was measured with a hydrometer following the usda texture classification limits soil survey staff 2011 the dry bulk density ρb was obtained by drying volumetric soil samples 100 cm3 at 105ºc for 48 h the organic matter om content which quantifies the organic fraction of the soil on a mass basis was estimated from the oc organic carbon content determined by the walkley black method using the relation om 1 724 oc nelson and sommers 1982 the soil water content at saturation θs m3 m 3 was determined from the maximum volumetric water content of 100 cm3 undisturbed soil cores the soil water contents at field capacity θfc m3 m 3 and the wilting point θwp m3 m 3 were measured on undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3 using the pressure plate apparatus dane and hopmans 2002 the experimental plots were organized in a randomized complete block design with three treatments t0 t1 t2 and four replicates per treatment fig 1 each replicate was 9 m long and 2 m wide 18 m2 with 7 sowed rows spaced 0 30 m apart seeds were sowed at a depth of 0 5 1 5 cm and irrigated with 10 20 mm of applied water to aid germination replicates distanced 1 m from each other table 2 presents the sowing and harvest dates as well as the respective dates of the crop growth stages during the three growing seasons two harvests were obtained per season irrigation was performed from sowing to harvest the water was conveyed from a well to the field by a pvc mainline and distributed to three polyethylene manifold pipes the drainage network was buried at a depth of 1 25 1 75 m with drainpipes distancing 15 25 m treatment t0 represented the traditional irrigation scheme followed by farmers in the region in this treatment plants were irrigated by basin irrigation with water supplied by one of the manifold pipes which discharged approximately 15 m3 h 1 irrigation was applied with an elapsed time of 0 60 0 70 h until the basin was completely flooded table 3 presents the basin irrigation amounts with irrigation events succeeding on average every 10 days depending on weather conditions treatments t1 and t2 refer to drip irrigation schemes laterals were disposed along each plant row in line drippers were spaced 0 2 m with a discharge rate of 4 l h 1 at 100 kpa both treatments aimed to fulfill crop water requirements and maximize water productivity however irrigation was triggered considering different thresholds irrigation in t1 and t2 was initiated when soil water contents in the rootzone dropped respectively below 90 and 80 of the soil water content at field capacity θfc irrigation events succeeded on average every 5 6 days in t1 and 6 10 days in t2 depending on the season irrigation depths table 3 were estimated in the field based on atmospheric demand and soil moisture measurements following a simple water balance procedure soil water contents were measured at depths of 0 2 and 0 4 m every week by gravimetry three soil samples were randomly collected per depth and treatment additional management practices included fertilization with manure 30 mg ha 1 phosphorus 125 kg ha 1 and potassium 65 kg ha 1 before sowing nitrogen was applied as urea 57 5 kg n ha 1 in two batches one 3 4 weeks after sowing and the other after the first harvest weed control was performed manually 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 model description the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a uses a daily time step to compute the soil water balance at the plot scale as follows 1 d r i d r i 1 p ro i i i cr i et c act i dp i where dr is the root zone depletion mm p is the rainfall mm ro is the surface runoff mm i is the net irrigation depth mm cr is the capillary rise from the groundwater table mm etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and dp is the deep percolation from the root zone mm all referring to day i or day i 1 the model adopts the fao56 dual kc approach for computing crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 2005 rosa et al 2012a in this approach the components relative to crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm are estimated separately as 2 t c k cb et o 3 e s k e et o where kcb is the standard basal crop coefficient ke is the evaporation coefficient and eto is the grass reference evapotranspiration mm computed using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 etc act is obtained as a function of the available soil water in the root zone by introducing a dimensionless stress coefficient ks which affects the tc component 4 e t c act t c act e s 5 t c act k cb act et o k s k cb et o where tc act is the actual crop transpiration mm and kcb act is the actual basal crop coefficient ks which values vary from 0 to 1 is defined as 6 k s taw d r i taw raw in which taw and raw are respectively the total and readily available soil water relative to the rooting depth mm these are computed as 7 taw 1000 z r θ fc θ wp 8 raw p taw where θfc and θwp are the soil water contents at field capacity and the wilting point m3 m 3 respectively zr is the root depth m and p is the depletion fraction for no stress when soil depletion exceeds the depletion fraction for no stress i e the soil water content drops below raw tc values are reduced due to water stress ks 1 0 otherwise no reduction in tc values occurs ks 1 0 for a crop with two cuts like jute mallow the kcb curves are described for each cutting cycle considering four growth stages i the initial stage or start of the crop season ii the rapid growth or development stage iii the mid season stage which corresponds to the period when plant s canopy is maximum and iv the late season stage curves are described by three kcb values corresponding to the initial mid and end season stages respectively kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end these values were calibrated based on field observations of soil water contents taking into consideration the recommendations for accuracy by allen et al 2011a kcb mid and kcb end are further internally corrected to local climatic conditions when the average rhmin differs from 45 and the average u2 differs from 2 m s 1 allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021 as follows 9 k cb k cb calib 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where kcb corresponds to the kcb standard values and kcb calib are the kcb values obtained from calibration the kcb values may be further adjusted to actual crop characteristics density and height using a density coefficient kd which accounts for the increase in kcb with the increase in the amount of vegetation allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020b soil evaporation is limited by the amount of energy available at the soil surface in conjunction with the energy consumed by transpiration and by water availability in the surface soil layer allen et al 1998 2005 es is maximum during the early crop stages when crop shadowing is small and the topsoil is wetted by rain or irrigation and energy is largely available at the soil surface on the other hand es is minimum when the crop fully shadows the soil limiting the energy available for evaporation and or when the surface soil layer is dry thus the evaporation coefficient ke is computed as follows allen et al 2005 10 k e k r k c max k cb min f ew k c max where kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient values range from 0 to 1 kc max is the maximum value of kc i e kcb ke following a rain or irrigation event and few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to radiation and wetted by rain or irrigation which depends upon the fraction of ground covered by the crop fc kr is obtained following the two stage drying cycle approach where the first stage is the energy limited stage and the second is the water limited stage ritchie 1972 allen et al 1998 2005 11 k r 1 for d e i 1 rew 12 k r tew d e i 1 tew rew for d e i 1 rew where tew and rew are respectively the total and readily evaporable water in the evaporation soil layer mm and de is the evaporation layer depletion at the end of day i 1 mm de is computed through a daily water balance of the evaporation soil layer with the evaporation decreasing as the evaporable soil water decreases in the evaporation soil layer beyond rew finally deep percolation dp is computed using the parametric time decay function proposed by liu et al 2006 which relates the soil water storage above field capacity with the draining time until θfc is reached 13 w a a d t b d where wa is the actual soil water storage in the root zone mm ad is the soil water storage comprised between saturation θs and θfc mm bd is an empirical dimensionless parameter and t is the time after an irrigation or rain that produces storage above field capacity days runoff ro is estimated using the curve number approach usda scs 1972 capillary rise cr was not considered in this study due to the existence of a drainage network in the study area 2 2 2 model setup the simdualkc model requires detailed information on weather conditions soil properties crop phenology irrigation events and irrigation systems to compute the soil water balance meteorological conditions were observed at the local weather station placed over a well watered clipped grass during the three experimental seasons and are displayed in fig 2 the available information included daily values of maximum and minimum surface air temperatures tmin and tmax ºc minimum and maximum relative humidity rhmin rhmax sunshine hours isun h wind speed measured at 2 m height u2 m s 1 and rainfall p mm the soil profile was characterized using the particle size distribution and soil hydraulic properties of the different soil layers listed in table 1 the taw mm values were then obtained automatically from θfc θwp and layer thickness the depth of the evaporation layer ze was specified according to allen et al 1998 2005 and the values of tew and rew were calculated according to the soil texture and water holding characteristics of the soil evaporation layer the curve number cn was also specified based on the particle size distribution of the surface soil layer as well as land use usda scs 1972 the deep percolation parameters relative to the parametric equation of liu et al 2006 were defined according to the soil texture data and θs and θfc values in the soil profile lastly the initial soil water depletion values in both the root zone and the evaporation soil layer were defined based on measurements taken in the different treatments at the beginning of each growing season resulting 25 35 of taw and 25 35 of tew which correspond to expected low soil wetness conditions by early may crop phenology data included the observed dates of the initial rapid growth mid season and late season stages as well as the harvest dates of each growing season table 2 which refer to end season the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end were then specified based on pereira et al 2021 values for leaves vegetable crops the soil water depletion fraction values for no stress pini pmid pend were also set for the same crop stages following pereira et al 2021 crop height h the estimated fraction of ground cover fc and root depth zr were defined for each crop stage based on observations and are presented in table 4 crop height h and the mean canopy width were monitored using a tape at each stage and mainly before and after each harvest the fraction of ground cover fc was then estimated based on the surface area between rows covered by the canopy assuming a rectangular shape of the canopy root depth zr was observed in soil profiles at the end of each crop season leaves were collected in all replicates after each harvest and the fresh weight was recorded finally referring to irrigation data the dates of irrigation events and irrigation depths were specified according to observations the fraction of the soil surface wetted by irrigation fw was further measured and defined as 0 3 in the drip treatments and 1 0 in the basin irrigation treatment 2 2 3 model calibration and validation the simdualkc model was calibrated following an iterative trial and error procedure which consisted of adjusting model parameters one at a time within reasonable ranges of values until deviations between measured and simulated soil water contents were minimized the 2018 dataset from the three treatments was selected for calibration calibration following pereira et al 2015b started by first adjusting the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end and the corresponding pini pmid and pend parameters then the deep percolation parameters ad and bd and in a third step the ze rew and tew model calibration was considered terminated when the best fit was achieved and the errors of prediction did not change from an iteration to the next if that goal was not achieved at the end of the first trial and error cycle the calibration process restarted again validation was then performed by comparing measured soil water contents with the respective model predictions using the previously calibrated model parameters the 2017 and 2019 datasets were used for validation the model performance was evaluated using various goodness of fit indicators including the regression coefficient b0 the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the modeling efficiency nse respectively given as nash and sutcliffe 1970 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 12 b 0 i

i o 2 where oi and pi are respectively the observed and model predicted values at time i o and p are the respective mean values and n is the number of observations b0 values close to 1 indicate that the predicted values are statistically close to the observed ones r2 values close to 1 indicate that the model explains well the variance of observations rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate small estimation errors and good model predictions legates and mccabe 1999 pbias values close to zero indicate that model simulations are accurate while positive or negative values indicate under or over estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 indicate that the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance hence the model predictions are good on the contrary if nse is less than zero the model predicted values are worse than simply using the observed mean nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 3 water productivity indicators the experimental results were further assessed using the crop water productivity indicators relative to the total water used wpwu kg m 3 the irrigation water applied wpirrig kg m 3 the consumptive use wpet kg m 3 and transpiration wpt kg m 3 which were described in pereira et al 2009a 2012 2020a and fernández et al 2020 and are respectively given by 18 wp wu y a twu 19 wp irrig y a iwu 20 wp et y a et c act 21 wp t y a t c act where ya is the actual measured yield kg ha 1 twu is the total water used given by the sum of effective p i and the variation of the soil water storage sw m3 ha 1 iwu is the irrigation water used m3 ha 1 etc act is the estimated actual evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 and tc act is again the estimated actual crop transpiration m3 ha 1 the economic crop water productivity ewp m 3 and the economic crop water productivity ratio ewpr were also computed as follows pereira et al 2009a 2012 fernández et al 2020 22 ewp value y a twu 23 ewpr value y a cost twu where value ya is the value of the achieved yield ha 1 and cost twu is the cost of the irrigation water ha 1 ewp expresses the ratio between the profit produced by a crop along the growing season and the total amount of water involved in crop production the ewpr shows the impacts of water prices on the economic return of irrigation the yield value was here set to 0 22 kg 1 according to prices from capmas 2020 in egypt which can also be considered representative for the syrian market the price of the irrigation water was set to 0 055 m 3 as in darouich et al 2020 yields and water productivity indicators in the different treatments and growing seasons were also subjected to a two way anova analysis using spss statistical software version 25 0 spss inc chicago il usa the significant level was tested for different levels of probability using yates s weighted squares of means yates 1934 2 4 net irrigation requirements net irrigation requirements nir consist of the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its water needs when the water available through precipitation capillary rise and soil water storage variation is insufficient pereira et al 2020a nir of jute mallow were computed using a weather time series for the period 1998 2020 23 years which included all daily records of tmax and tmin rhmax and rhmin isun u2 at 2 m height and p available in the same local meteorological station used in the experiment since its installation missing u2 values in 2011 2013 and 2015 were filled with wind data from the closest weather station trípoli lebanon for each year simulations were performed using the calibrated crop parameters while initial soil water depletion was set as 25 of taw and 25 of tew following the earlier observations from irrigation treatments the sowing and crop stages dates were defined as follows a the sowing date in each simulated year was set to may 1st which corresponds to the common beginning of the jute mallow season in the region the dates of the crop growth stages were then defined based on the mean cumulative growing degree days gdd observed during the three growing seasons table 5 the base temperature was 15 ºc following fondio and grubben 2011 b the sowing and crop stages dates were set as in the 2017 season which corresponded to the latest sowing date and longest growing season observed in the experiment on the other hand irrigation scheduling considered the following strategies i basin irrigation with a management allowed depletion mad equal to the depletion fraction for no stress p mad p in which net irrigation depths were computed to refill soil water contents to field capacity ii drip irrigation with mad p in which net irrigation depths were fixed to 20 mm per event for each scenario ai aii bi bii the probability of the demand for irrigation water for the period 1998 2020 was computed by identifying the years representing the average high and very high demand which correspond respectively to the probabilities of 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance as in pereira et al 2009b 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization table 6 presents the model parameters calibrated during the 2018 growing season which were then validated during the 2017 and 2019 seasons the calibrated kcb ini i and kcb ini ii values were 0 15 and 0 35 respectively subscripts i and ii denote for the first and second cut cycles the higher kcb ini value relative to the second cycle resulted from the larger fc value 0 50 of plants remaining in the field after the first cut with the crop already well established when compared with the period after sowing table 4 for these reasons the length of the initial stage during the second cut cycle was short table 2 the calibrated kcb mid value was 0 95 for both cut cycles lastly the calibrated kcb end value was also set to 0 95 in both cut cycles thus indicating that harvesting for fresh human consumption was done when jute mallow leaves were still green and tender i e before senescence occurs these options agree with those proposed by pereira et al 2021 for kcb mid and kcb end of leaves and flowers vegetable crops as such and because experimental plots were relatively small and fast to harvest only one day was considered as the length of the late season stage table 2 for larger crop areas where harvesting of leaves takes several days it could be assumed a longer late season and a shorter mid season with kcb end decreasing to 0 35 as described in fig 3 as a result of leaves harvesting crop transpiration would progressively decrease thus kcb would reduce gradually from 0 95 to 0 35 this hypothesis needs however to be confirmed as referred earlier the literature on jute mallow water requirements is quite scarce with existing studies lacking detailed information on crop phenological characteristics and with non precise derivation of kc moreover no studies were found where jute mallow was harvested with two cuts considering this information gap the calibrated kcb mid and kcb end values matched the corresponding tabulated kcb values for the mid and end season stages of most leaves vegetable crops listed in pereira et al 2021 the pini pmid and pend values were set to 0 55 during both cut cycles representing an increase from those proposed by allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 2021 for leaves vegetable crops table 6 jute mallow was thus considered to be more tolerant to water stress than those crops during the different crop stages 3 2 model simulation of the soil water contents fig 4 presents the soil water contents measured in the root zone of treatments t0 t1 and t2 during the 2017 2019 growing seasons and compares these values with the simdualkc simulations fig 4 further provides the dates of rainfall and irrigation events as well as depths applied per event the seasonal irrigation depths in t0 ranged from 550 to 990 mm with water applied through basin flooding in 5 9 events table 3 irrigation scheduling in this treatment followed the common practice in the region which finds some comparison with the management of jute mallow in other parts of the world palada and chang 2003 odofin et al 2011 while the seasonal amount of water depended much on the length of the crop s growing season the depths applied per irrigation event were very similar and characteristically high ranging from 110 to 115 mm as a result the simulated soil water contents exhibited large variation throughout the crop seasons increasing soil water to values close to saturation during irrigation events and then gradually decreasing due to percolation and root water uptake darouich et al 2020 had already reported a similar soil moisture behavior in zucchini squash furrow irrigation treatments implemented in an adjacent experimental field in t1 the seasonal irrigation depths ranged from 219 to 421 mm table 3 in this drip treatment triggering irrigation when soil water contents dropped below 90 of θfc produced the highest irrigation frequency 11 18 events and the lowest depths per event 11 30 mm contrastingly irrigation in t2 triggered when soil water contents dropped below 80 of θfc resulted in larger depths per event 10 43 mm but fewer events 10 13 events than in t1 the seasonal irrigation depths were the lowest ranging from 200 to 393 mm table 3 nevertheless both t1 and t2 used 57 64 less water than t0 due to the characteristics of the drip irrigation method used in these treatments the simulated soil water contents exhibited also less variation than in t0 with values remaining always close to or slightly below θfc but never approaching saturation the simdualkc model was able to reproduce field measurements reasonably well during the 2018 calibration season with goodness of fit indicating a quite good performance of the model table 7 these indicators showed a higher accuracy of soil water content simulations in the case of drip irrigation t1 and t2 than with surface irrigation in t0 the r2 values were 0 79 and 0 89 in t1 and t2 respectively while in t0 the r2 value was 0 687 nevertheless all r2 values were high enough to express the model s capability in explaining most of the variability of the observed data in the different treatments also the nse value was found to be superior in t1 and t2 nse of 0 69 and 0 79 than in t0 nse 0 47 which still indicated that the residual variance was much smaller than the measured data variance in all treatments furthermore the error of the estimate was generally quite small resulting in rmse and nrmse values lower than 0 001 m3 m 3 and 0 002 respectively lastly both b0 always close to 1 0 and pbias quite small did not allow finding a tendency for observations to be under or over predicted thus confirming the goodness of the model simulations the parameters calibrated in 2018 were validated with the field data of the 2017 and 2019 growing seasons the resulting goodness of fit indicators demonstrate a behavior of the simdualkc model similar to that of calibration in predicting soil water contents during those seasons the goodness of fit indicators are also within the range of values reported in other successful simdualkc applications to vegetables zhang et al 2018 patil and tiwari 2019 darouich et al 2020 and well confirm the reliability of model simulations 3 3 standard and actual crop coefficients fig 5 presents the seasonal values of the potential non stressed basal crop coefficients kcb the actual basal crop coefficients kcb act the soil evaporation coefficients ke and the actual crop coefficients kc act kcb act ke computed by simdualkc for jute mallow during the 2017 2019 growing seasons also included are the rainfall and irrigation events as referred earlier the kcb values for the different crop stages were first calibrated from field data and then further adjusted to local weather conditions following allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 2021 hence during the 2018 growing season the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end values were calibrated to 0 15 0 95 and 0 95 respectively for the first cut cycle and to 0 35 0 95 and 0 95 respectively for the second cut cycle table 6 after adjustment to local weather conditions the kcb values varied slightly with kcb mid and kcb end adjusting to near 0 90 during both cycles the calibrated kcb values were then validated during the 2017 and 2019 growing seasons in 2017 the kcb adjustment to local weather conditions resulted in kcb mid and kcb end values of 0 92 for the first cut cycle and 0 91 for the second cut cycle in 2019 the adjusted values for kcb mid and kcb end were 0 90 and 0 89 for the first and second cut cycles respectively in t0 the kcb act values always matched the potential standard kcb ones no water stress was ever observed during the three growing seasons fig 5 however the same was not true for t1 and t2 with the kcb act values occasionally departing from the kcb curves during the mid season when the frequency of irrigation was sub optimal nevertheless the water stress periods were always short with the kcb values equaling again the potential values after a successive irrigation or rain event the ke values showed a contrasting behavior between basin and drip treatments which was consistent throughout the three growing seasons the ke values started always high in all treatments after irrigation was applied to aid germination then those values rapidly decreased due to the depletion of the evaporation soil layer in t0 the ke values were raised again to maximum values after the first irrigation event due to the increase of soil moisture in the surface soil layer as jute mallow rapidly developed and the canopy fully covered soil surface reducing the amount of energy available for evaporation the ke values dropped to practically nil values during the rest of the growing season only increasing with irrigation but always producing small peaks the exception was the period after the first cut when the ke values were raised again with the increase of the energy available for evaporation at the soil surface in t1 and t2 contrarily to t0 the ke values never increased to maximum values after irrigation started this occurred because irrigation depths and the fw value in these treatments were much smaller than in t0 which prevented the ke values to increase above 0 4 since irrigation depths in both t1 and t2 were always enough to moist the soil evaporation layer no differences were found in the ke values except for those related to the dates of irrigation events and irrigation frequency with the development of the plant s canopy low ke values were maintained for longer periods in t1 due to the higher irrigation frequency recorded in that treatment compared to t2 in both treatments the ke values eventually dropped to null values a few days after irrigation events but more regularly in t2 larger ke values were also observed in both t1 and t2 after the first cut however ke values remained always smaller than in t0 since irrigation depths and fw were also smaller the kc act curve described the same trends observed for kcb act and ke clearly distinguishing the stages where crop transpiration and soil evaporation contributed most to crop evapotranspiration 3 4 soil water balance table 8 presents the soil water balance computed by simdualkc for jute mallow during the 2017 2019 growing seasons the length of the crop cycle decisively influenced the seasonal tc which values ranged from 284 to 404 mm the lowest value was obtained in 2018 during a season that lasted 68 days the highest was reached in 2017 when the crop season length was 96 days the tc act etc act ratio which ranged from 0 86 to 0 91 showed the dominance of the transpiration component in seasonal et values as mentioned earlier the kcb act values in t0 always matched the potential ones as such the tc act values also equaled the respective tc values meaning that no root water uptake reductions due to water stress were ever registered in this treatment fig 6 the same was also observed for the drip treatments since the previously noticed departure between kcb act and kcb values resulted only in meaningless reductions of the tc values 2 this was important to know since water stress can have a detrimental effect on jute mallow yields by reducing photosynthesis respiration and ultimately leaves growth soil evaporation exhibited the same trends already described for the ke values fig 6 with higher rates during the initial crop stages and following the first cut the seasonal soil evaporation was relatively low due to the fast crop growth determining that full coverage of the soil surface by crop leaves fc 0 95 was attained quite rapidly thus limiting the energy available for evaporation the seasonal es values ranged from 31 to 51 mm and were generally higher in t1 due to the higher irrigation frequency adopted in this treatment the seasonal etc act values ranged from 310 to 452 mm which values are comparable with those reported by odofin et al 2011 326 374 mm deep percolation was only found in t0 with extremely large cumulated values 300 565 mm which represented 55 62 of the irrigation water applied and 49 59 of the total water inputs including rain and soil water storage contrastingly crop water used in t1 ranged from 87 to 90 and in t2 from 89 to 92 in relation to the total water inputs these results further reveal the inefficiency of the traditional irrigation methods considered in this treatment traditional basin irrigation often results in high dp values due to the commonly low performance of these methods walker and skogerboe 1987 darouich et al 2012 however many studies demonstrate that the performance of surface irrigation may be highly improved when design considers the appropriate relationships among the field size slope infiltration characteristics inflow rates and irrigation timing duration and frequency as already demonstrated for syria darouich et al 2012 2014 while for the case study area the percolated water ended up being collected by the drainage network system and delivered to the local stream to be eventually reused further downstream in most syrian irrigated areas those losses constitute an important contribution to groundwater recharge darouich et al 2014 thus despite less efficient than the drip methods the traditional surface irrigation method may well be a valuable mechanism for increasing the soil water storage to be used in irrigation 3 5 yield and water productivity indicators table 9 presents jute mallow yields measured in each treatment during the three growing seasons as well as the respective water productivity indicators wpwu wpirrig wpet wpt ewp and ewpr indicators table 10 then presents the anova table with the analysis of variance for the effects of treatments and seasons on jute mallow yields and wp indicators jute mallow yields were always higher in t1 and t2 than in t0 in t1 yields averaged 16 31 mg ha 1 with annual maximum and minimum values of 18 34 and 13 20 mg ha 1 respectively in t2 the yield average was only slightly below the previous one 15 20 mg ha 1 with yearly values ranging from 14 73 to 15 59 mg ha 1 the first cut was always more productive than the second contrastingly yields in t0 averaged only 11 07 mg ha 1 with yearly values also ranging from 10 42 to 11 94 mg ha 1 statistics showed that the difference in the average between treatments was significant at the 99 9 level of confidence but no relation was found either for the growing seasons or the interaction of both factors i e years treatments literature is quite scarce on the effect of irrigation method and scheduling on jute mallow yields yousef et al 2020 reported a maximum yield of 8 0 mg ha 1 in well fertilized treatments irrigated every ten days by flooding in the assiut governorate central egypt during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons asmaa et al 2014 also presented yields ranging from 10 48 to 12 87 mg ha 1 for jute mallow irrigated by drip in the beheira governorate northern egypt during the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons the previous values were smaller than those obtained in this study yet as in this study crop irrigation by traditional methods always returned the lowest marketable yields the same had already been observed in darouich et al 2020 for zucchini squash like then for traditional furrows basin irrigation resulted in high percolation losses which most certainly promoted nutrient leaching and reduced nutrient availability for jute mallow growth drip irrigation treatments also returned higher water productivity indicators than the basin irrigation treatment table 9 this trend was noticed not only when analyzing the absolute values of each indicator but also their yearly variation assuming always the respective wpwu values as the baseline as a result the wpirrig values showed a greater increase in the drip treatments 6 50 than in t0 2 11 when considering wpwu as the calculation basis thus revealing the higher efficiency of the drip irrigation system on the other hand no substantial differences were found between wpwu and wpet in the drip treatments contrarily to t0 where this indicator increased by 91 140 thus meaning that most of the water inputs in t1 and t2 were used in the et process i e no percolation or runoff occurred a similar analysis was drawn for wpt but here values in the drip treatments suffered a slight increase 8 15 when compared to wpet because evaporation was then not considered the wpwu and wpirrig showed significant differences in the average between treatments and between years at the 99 9 level of confidence but no differences were found for interaction between both factors table 10 likewise the wpet and wpt showed contrasting differences between treatments and between years but the level of confidence was smaller than in the previous indicators 99 also the economical indicators were more advantageous in the drip treatments than in the basin treatment with the average values of both indicators being again found to be significantly different for treatments and years at the 99 9 level of confidence the ewp values ranged from 0 8 to 1 3 m 3 in t1 and t2 while they varied only from 0 24 to 0 43 m 3 in t0 on the other hand the ewpr values ranged from 15 87 to 33 51 in t1 and t2 while in t0 they reached 4 39 8 68 the ewpr values for jute mallow were thus smaller than those in darouich et al 2020 for zucchini squash which ranged from 14 3 to 23 9 in the furrow treatment and from 24 5 to 90 0 in the drip treatments therefore jute mallow may be considered a less interesting crop to be grown in the akkar plain syria but valuable enough to be included in a crop rotation scheme 3 6 defining irrigation thresholds fig 7 presents nir of jute mallow for scenarios ai aii bi and bii for the period 1998 2020 for scenario ai which considered may 1st as the sowing date the dates of the crop stages based on the gdd and basin irrigation the nir values ranged from 314 to 397 mm yet no substantial differences were found for 21 of the 23 years in which nir values varied only from 386 to 397 mm therefore nir values corresponding to this scenario in fig 7 were practically constant this was explained by the small interannual variation of the atmospheric demand during the crop cycle the commonly adopted irrigation trigger threshold mad p and the high irrigation depths applied in each event to refill the soil water contents to field capacity which were not sensitive to small variations on atmospheric demand during the 23 year period the same results were observed for scenario bi which considered the same irrigation method but in this case the sowing date and the crop growth stages were defined as in 2017 nir ranged from 386 to 395 mm for 22 of the 23 years with only one season requiring an extra irrigation event that increased nir to 468 mm for scenario aii which considered the same assumptions as ai but drip irrigation nir ranged from 280 to 400 mm for scenario bii also with drip irrigation nir values varied from 340 to 420 mm despite the noticed small interannual variation of the atmospheric demand during the crop cycle the introduction of drip irrigation allowed to better distinguish nir of jute mallow along the seasons nonetheless nir variation in these scenarios was relatively narrow but with values being always similar or lower than those computed in the basin irrigation scenarios table 11 presents the soil water balance for the years representing the average high and very high demand which corresponded to the probabilities of 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance when assuming a normal distribution for the 1998 2020 nir time series that were always different for each scenario for scenarios ai and bi as referred above no substantial differences were found in the nir of jute mallow nonetheless tc and tc act values increased as expected from the years representing average water demand to the years representing very high water demand for scenarios aii and bii the increase of nir was followed by an increase of tc and tc act values confirming the capability of drip irrigation schemes to save water not just due to the greater efficiency of these systems but also because with drip irrigation it is easier to adjust irrigation depths to atmospheric demand 4 conclusions the modernization of irrigation methods and practices in the syrian akkar plain has provided the context for this research in which irrigation requirements of jute mallow corchorus olitorius l were investigated the simdualkc model which follows the fao56 dual kc approach was used to compute the soil water balance in jute mallow plots irrigated with basin and drip irrigation methods during three growing seasons 2017 2019 the model successfully simulated soil water contents in diverse experimental plots with the level of agreement between measured and simulated data returning rmse values lower than 0 001 m3 m 3 and nse values ranging from 0 36 to 0 81 the calibrated basal crop coefficients kcb were 0 15 0 95 and 0 95 for the initial kcb ini mid season kcb mid and end season kcb end stages respectively which should be considered when computing future crop irrigation needs in the syrian akkar plain the corresponding standard kcb values to be used worldwide and adjusted to local climates are for the first cut cycle kcb ini 0 15 kcb mid 0 92 and kcb end 0 90 and for the second cycle kcb ini 0 35 kcb mid 0 91 and kcb end 0 90 jute mallow yields were significantly higher in the drip irrigation treatments than in the basin treatment with the water productivity and economic indicators responding also positively to water savings generated by the higher application efficiency of the drip systems through the highly frequent application of small irrigation depths that better adjust to the crop water demand the net irrigation requirements were also investigated using the simdualkc model over a long time period of 23 years 1998 2020 where the probabilities of the demand for irrigation water were assessed in scenarios considering different crop season lengths irrigation methods and application depths and schedules except for the extremes of the long term weather time series the probability of the demand for irrigation water for the years representing the average high and very high demand which correspond respectively to the probabilities of 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance were relatively similar for the basin irrigation scenarios from 391 to 395 mm but more distinct for drip irrigation scenarios from 360 to 400 mm further showing the advantages of this irrigation method to save water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9995,jute mallow corchorus olitorius l is an annual crop grown for human consumption of its nutritious leaves in many regions of the world despite its importance for household food security and farmers income reliable information on the crop s water requirements is still quite scarce to overcome this knowledge gap the irrigation needs of jute mallow grown in the akkar region in syria were investigated the analysis focused on a three year period 2017 2019 where the simdualkc model was calibrated and validated for simulating soil water contents and computing the soil water balance in jute mallow plots irrigated with basin and drip methods the model was further used to determine the probabilities of the demand for irrigation water in scenarios considering different crop season lengths irrigation methods and application depths over a longer period of 23 years 1998 2020 the simdualkc model was able to simulate soil water contents measured in the field plots returning root mean square error values lower than 0 001 m3 m 3 and modeling efficiencies ranging from 0 358 to 0 812 the calibrated basal non stressed crop coefficients kcb were 0 15 0 95 and 0 95 for the initial kcb ini mid season kcb mid and end season kcb end stages respectively the crop was harvested twice per season with the drip treatments presenting the highest water productivity and economic indicators in contrast the basin treatment resulted in substantial percolation losses which affected yields and indicators although net irrigation requirements showed a large variation for the extremes of the long term weather time series differences between the years representing average water demand and those representing very high water demand were only found for the drip irrigation scenarios this study

evaporation soil water balance water productivity 1 introduction corchorus is a commercially important genus of the malvaceae family which comprises more than fifty species with different ethnobotanical applications kumari et al 2019 jute mallow corchorus olitorius l is one of the most relevant species of the corchorus genus widely grown for fiber production or as a leafy vegetable in africa asia and parts of latin america and the middle east choudhary et al 2013 kumari et al 2019 the plant is an erect annual herb 2 4 m tall with lanceolate to palmate leaves which are a rich source of carbohydrates polysaccharides vitamins b2 b9 c and e minerals such as iron and calcium β carotene and several phenolic compounds lin et al 2009 fondio and grubben 2011 the leaves are further used for medicinal purposes due to their diuretic analgesic antimicrobial and antipyretic characteristics as well as their antitumor and phenolic antioxidative constituents zakaria et al 2006 yakoub et al 2018 kumari et al 2019 lastly the crop is cheap to produce representing a quality food source for large segments of the population in urban and rural areas choudhary et al 2013 ngomuo et al 2017 in syria jute mallow is mainly produced as a leafy vegetable crop in the governorates of hama in the al ghab depression tartus and latakia where climate conditions the land organization in smallholdings and the proximity of highly dense urban areas that provide for market opportunities favor the production of profitable vegetable crops chard 1981 wattenbach 2006 in these regions the cultivated area sums close to 1 4 m ha representing 10 2 of the syrian cultivated land of which 82 are irrigated wattenbach 2006 cbs 2019 the most prominent and profitable vegetables grown there are tomato solanum lycopersicum l cucumber cucumis sativus l squash cucurbita pepo l and eggplant solanum melongena l but the area cultivated with these crops including jute mallow is uncertain due to the characteristics of local production systems which often include double cropping systems or crops cultivated in the interrow of less dense and young tree orchards several policy measures were implemented in those regions as well as in other agricultural areas in syria to rationalize agricultural water use oweis et al 2003 varela ortega and sagardoy 2003 sadiddin 2013 mourad and alshihabi 2016 abou zakhem et al 2019 improve water and economic irrigation systems productivity performance and farmers income fader et al 2016 darouich et al 2012 2014 2017 modernize irrigation methods and management yigezu et al 2013 darouich et al 2020 and improve fertigation techniques janat 2007 as a result and despite most endeavors have been destroyed by the on going war modern irrigation systems have been slowly replacing traditional surface irrigation systems due to water saving policies aimed at improving land and water productivity as well as protecting local groundwater and downstream water bodies from diffuse pollution therefore drip irrigation presently supplies 43 of the irrigated area in tartus and latakia but only 4 in hama cbs 2019 where nonetheless trends for adopting drip irrigation already exist improving irrigation water use while minimizing the associated environmental risks can only be achieved through the accurate estimate of crop water requirements and appropriate irrigation schedules irrigation timing duration and quantity for maximizing yields farmers income and agricultural water productivity pereira et al 2002 although jute mallow shows a remarkable value for household food security medicinal applications and farmers income in many regions of the world there is still insufficient information on the crop water needs crop coefficients kc and crop sensitiveness to water stress as shown by the knowledge gap in the recent update of tabulated fao56 crop coefficients provided by pereira et al 2021 for vegetable crops allen et al 2011a 2011b revised a variety of field measurement approaches and related requirements for obtaining accurate estimates of evapotranspiration et and crop water requirements at the field plot scale with appropriate focus on the combined monitoring of changes in soil water contents with the use of soil water balance models pereira et al 2020a also provided a review of soil water balance modeling approaches to determine crop et crop irrigation requirements and irrigation schedules following the fao56 method allen et al 1998 this widely used method refers either to the single kc or to the dual kc approach to determine crop evapotranspiration as the product of a crop coefficient and the grass reference evapotranspiration eto the latter is computed with the fao penman monteith fao pm equation and crop evapotranspiration may be measured by several methods as described and discussed by allen et al 2011a and pereira et al 2020a unfortunately existing papers on crop coefficients for jute mallow use reference et different from the standard eto which may make their use highly biased therefore there is the need to derive accurate kc from field etc data and the fao pm eto the dual kc approach which partitions crop evapotranspiration etc into its components crop transpiration tc and soil evaporation es also partitions kc into the basal crop coefficient kcb referring to tc and the soil evaporation coefficient ke this approach results more precise namely because it improves the estimation accuracy of the evaporation component pereira et al 2015a 2020a the dual kc approach is widely applied for estimating evapotranspiration fluxes of crops grown under different climatic regions and management practices lópez urrea et al 2009 paço et al 2012 kool et al 2014 gonzález et al

al 2016 and bermudagrass in brazil paredes et al 2018b the simdualkc model was further used in syria to estimate crop coefficients and water use of wheat rosa et al 2012b and of zucchini squash under diverse irrigation regimes darouich et al 2020 the reported variety of applications in terms of crops environmental and weather conditions as well as management practices assures the suitability of the model for the present study considering the brief review above the objectives of this study are i to simulate soil water contents in jute mallow plots irrigated with basin and drip methods using the simdualkc model during three growing seasons 2017 2019 ii to derive the crop coefficients for jute mallow grown in the syrian akkar plain using the dual kc approach iii to evaluate the components of the soil water balance from a water saving and economic perspective and iv to define seasonal irrigation thresholds based on the crop s net irrigation requirements computed using a long term weather time series that may serve as guidelines for defining future water saving policies results of this study will contribute to improving irrigation water use performance in the syrian coastal region where the akkar plain is located and for the sustainability of jute mallow production in the region 2 material and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 description of the study site the field

located on a narrow coastal area of fertile land between the cities of tartus in syria and trípoli in lebanon the region is especially suited to produce field and greenhouse grown vegetables due to

resources varies between 10 and 20 m abou zakhem and hafez 2007 2 1 2 experimental design and treatments the experimental design used to study the soil water balance of zucchini squash in the same region darouich et al 2020 was also adopted for jute mallow known locally as molokhia the experiment involved irrigation with basin and drip methods and various schedules during the 2017 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the experimental area with 23 m long and 19 m wide 437 m2 was flat with 0 005 and 0 002 slope in the west and south directions respectively the soil was classified as a vertisol iuss working group wrb 2014 with the main soil physical and chemical properties given in table 1 disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected for the layers 0 0 15 0 15 0 30 0 30 0 45 and 0 45 0 60 m by opening a small trench in the area adjacent to the experiment the particle size distribution was measured with a hydrometer following the usda texture classification limits soil survey staff 2011 the dry bulk density ρb was obtained by drying volumetric soil samples 100 cm3 at 105ºc for 48 h the organic matter om content which quantifies the organic fraction of the soil on a mass basis was estimated from the oc organic carbon content determined by the walkley black method using the relation om 1 724 oc nelson and sommers 1982 the soil water content at saturation θs m3 m 3 was determined from the maximum volumetric water content of 100 cm3 undisturbed soil cores the soil water contents at field capacity θfc m3 m 3 and the wilting point θwp m3 m 3 were measured on undisturbed soil samples of 100 cm3 using the pressure plate apparatus dane and hopmans 2002 the experimental plots were organized in a randomized complete block design with three treatments t0 t1 t2 and four replicates per treatment fig 1 each replicate was 9 m long and 2 m wide 18 m2 with 7 sowed rows spaced 0 30 m apart seeds were sowed at a depth of 0 5 1 5 cm and irrigated with 10 20 mm of applied water to aid germination replicates distanced 1 m from each other table 2 presents the sowing and harvest dates as well as the respective dates of the crop growth stages during the three growing seasons two harvests were obtained per season irrigation was performed from sowing to harvest the water was conveyed from a well to the field by a pvc mainline and distributed to three polyethylene manifold pipes the drainage network was buried at a depth of 1 25 1 75 m with drainpipes distancing 15 25 m treatment t0 represented the traditional irrigation scheme followed by farmers in the region in this treatment plants were irrigated by basin irrigation with water supplied by one of the manifold pipes which discharged approximately 15 m3 h 1 irrigation was applied with an elapsed time of 0 60 0 70 h until the basin was completely flooded table 3 presents the basin irrigation amounts with irrigation events succeeding on average every 10 days depending on weather conditions treatments t1 and t2 refer to drip irrigation schemes laterals were disposed along each plant row in line drippers were spaced 0 2 m with a discharge rate of 4 l h 1 at 100 kpa both treatments aimed to fulfill crop water requirements and maximize water productivity however irrigation was triggered considering different thresholds irrigation in t1 and t2 was initiated when soil water contents in the rootzone dropped respectively below 90 and 80 of the soil water content at field capacity θfc irrigation events succeeded on average every 5 6 days in t1 and 6 10 days in t2 depending on the season irrigation depths table 3 were estimated in the field based on atmospheric demand and soil moisture measurements following a simple water balance procedure soil water contents were measured at depths of 0 2 and 0 4 m every week by gravimetry three soil samples were randomly collected per depth and treatment additional management practices included fertilization with manure 30 mg ha 1 phosphorus 125 kg ha 1 and potassium 65 kg ha 1 before sowing nitrogen was applied as urea 57 5 kg n ha 1 in two batches one 3 4 weeks after sowing and the other after the first harvest weed control was performed manually 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 model description the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a uses a daily time step to compute the soil water balance at the plot scale as follows 1 d r i d r i 1 p ro i i i cr i et c act i dp i where dr is the root zone depletion mm p is the rainfall mm ro is the surface runoff mm i is the net irrigation depth mm cr is the capillary rise from the groundwater table mm etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and dp is the deep percolation from the root zone mm all referring to day i or day i 1 the model adopts the fao56 dual kc approach for computing crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 2005 rosa et al 2012a in this approach the components relative to crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm are estimated separately as 2 t c k cb et o 3 e s k e et o where kcb is the standard basal crop coefficient ke is the evaporation coefficient and eto is the grass reference evapotranspiration mm computed using the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 etc act is obtained as a function of the available soil water in the root zone by introducing a dimensionless stress coefficient ks which affects the tc component 4 e t c act t c act e s 5 t c act k cb act et o k s k cb et o where tc act is the actual crop transpiration mm and kcb act is the actual basal crop coefficient ks which values vary from 0 to 1 is defined as 6 k s taw d r i taw raw in which taw and raw are respectively the total and readily available soil water relative to the rooting depth mm these are computed as 7 taw 1000 z r θ fc θ wp 8 raw p taw where θfc and θwp are the soil water contents at field capacity and the wilting point m3 m 3 respectively zr is the root depth m and p is the depletion fraction for no stress when soil depletion exceeds the depletion fraction for no stress i e the soil water content drops below raw tc values are reduced due to water stress ks 1 0 otherwise no reduction in tc values occurs ks 1 0 for a crop with two cuts like jute mallow the kcb curves are described for each cutting cycle considering four growth stages i the initial stage or start of the crop season ii the rapid growth or development stage iii the mid season stage which corresponds to the period when plant s canopy is maximum and iv the late season stage curves are described by three kcb values corresponding to the initial mid and end season stages respectively kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end these values were calibrated based on field observations of soil water contents taking into consideration the recommendations for accuracy by allen et al 2011a kcb mid and kcb end are further internally corrected to local climatic conditions when the average rhmin differs from 45 and the average u2 differs from 2 m s 1 allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021 as follows 9 k cb k cb calib 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where kcb corresponds to the kcb standard values and kcb calib are the kcb values obtained from calibration the kcb values may be further adjusted to actual crop characteristics density and height using a density coefficient kd which accounts for the increase in kcb with the increase in the amount of vegetation allen and pereira 2009 pereira et al 2020b soil evaporation is limited by the amount of energy available at the soil surface in conjunction with the energy consumed by transpiration and by water availability in the surface soil layer allen et al 1998 2005 es is maximum during the early crop stages when crop shadowing is small and the topsoil is wetted by rain or irrigation and energy is largely available at the soil surface on the other hand es is minimum when the crop fully shadows the soil limiting the energy available for evaporation and or when the surface soil layer is dry thus the evaporation coefficient ke is computed as follows allen et al 2005 10 k e k r k c max k cb min f ew k c max where kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient values range from 0 to 1 kc max is the maximum value of kc i e kcb ke following a rain or irrigation event and few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to radiation and wetted by rain or irrigation which depends upon the fraction of ground covered by the crop fc kr is obtained following the two stage drying cycle approach where the first stage is the energy limited stage and the second is the water limited stage ritchie 1972 allen et al 1998 2005 11 k r 1 for d e i 1 rew 12 k r tew d e i 1 tew rew for d e i 1 rew where tew and rew are respectively the total and readily evaporable water in the evaporation soil layer mm and de is the evaporation layer depletion at the end of day i 1 mm de is computed through a daily water balance of the evaporation soil layer with the evaporation decreasing as the evaporable soil water decreases in the evaporation soil layer beyond rew finally deep percolation dp is computed using the parametric time decay function proposed by liu et al 2006 which relates the soil water storage above field capacity with the draining time until θfc is reached 13 w a a d t b d where wa is the actual soil water storage in the root zone mm ad is the soil water storage comprised between saturation θs and θfc mm bd is an empirical dimensionless parameter and t is the time after an irrigation or rain that produces storage above field capacity days runoff ro is estimated using the curve number approach usda scs 1972 capillary rise cr was not considered in this study due to the existence of a drainage network in the study area 2 2 2 model setup the simdualkc model requires detailed information on weather conditions soil properties crop phenology irrigation events and irrigation systems to compute the soil water balance meteorological conditions were observed at the local weather station placed over a well watered clipped grass during the three experimental seasons and are displayed in fig 2 the available information included daily values of maximum and minimum surface air temperatures tmin and tmax ºc minimum and maximum relative humidity rhmin rhmax sunshine hours isun h wind speed measured at 2 m height u2 m s 1 and rainfall p mm the soil profile was characterized using the particle size distribution and soil hydraulic properties of the different soil layers listed in table 1 the taw mm values were then obtained automatically from θfc θwp and layer thickness the depth of the evaporation layer ze was specified according to allen et al 1998 2005 and the values of tew and rew were calculated according to the soil texture and water holding characteristics of the soil evaporation layer the curve number cn was also specified based on the particle size distribution of the surface soil layer as well as land use usda scs 1972 the deep percolation parameters relative to the parametric equation of liu et al 2006 were defined according to the soil texture data and θs and θfc values in the soil profile lastly the initial soil water depletion values in both the root zone and the evaporation soil layer were defined based on measurements taken in the different treatments at the beginning of each growing season resulting 25 35 of taw and 25 35 of tew which correspond to expected low soil wetness conditions by early may crop phenology data included the observed dates of the initial rapid growth mid season and late season stages as well as the harvest dates of each growing season table 2 which refer to end season the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end were then specified based on pereira et al 2021 values for leaves vegetable crops the soil water depletion fraction values for no stress pini pmid pend were also set for the same crop stages following pereira et al 2021 crop height h the estimated fraction of ground cover fc and root depth zr were defined for each crop stage based on observations and are presented in table 4 crop height h and the mean canopy width were monitored using a tape at each stage and mainly before and after each harvest the fraction of ground cover fc was then estimated based on the surface area between rows covered by the canopy assuming a rectangular shape of the canopy root depth zr was observed in soil profiles at the end of each crop season leaves were collected in all replicates after each harvest and the fresh weight was recorded finally referring to irrigation data the dates of irrigation events and irrigation depths were specified according to observations the fraction of the soil surface wetted by irrigation fw was further measured and defined as 0 3 in the drip treatments and 1 0 in the basin irrigation treatment 2 2 3 model calibration and validation the simdualkc model was calibrated following an iterative trial and error procedure which consisted of adjusting model parameters one at a time within reasonable ranges of values until deviations between measured and simulated soil water contents were minimized the 2018 dataset from the three treatments was selected for calibration calibration following pereira et al 2015b started by first adjusting the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end and the corresponding pini pmid and pend parameters then the deep percolation parameters ad and bd and in a third step the ze rew and tew model calibration was considered terminated when the best fit was achieved and the errors of prediction did not change from an iteration to the next if that goal was not achieved at the end of the first trial and error cycle the calibration process restarted again validation was then performed by comparing measured soil water contents with the respective model predictions using the previously calibrated model parameters the 2017 and 2019 datasets were used for validation the model performance was evaluated using various goodness of fit indicators including the regression coefficient b0 the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the modeling efficiency nse respectively given as nash and sutcliffe 1970 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 12 b 0 i

the predicted values are statistically close to the observed ones r2 values close to 1 indicate that the model explains well the variance of observations rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate small estimation errors and good model predictions legates and mccabe 1999 pbias values close to zero indicate that model simulations are accurate while positive or negative values indicate under or over estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 indicate that the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance hence the model predictions are good on the contrary if nse is less than zero the model predicted values are worse than simply using the observed mean nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 3 water productivity indicators the experimental results were further assessed using the crop water productivity indicators relative to the total water used wpwu kg m 3 the irrigation water applied wpirrig kg m 3 the consumptive use wpet kg m 3 and transpiration wpt kg m 3 which were described in pereira et al 2009a 2012 2020a and fernández et al 2020 and are respectively given by 18 wp wu y a twu 19 wp irrig y a iwu 20 wp et y a et c act 21 wp t y a t c act where ya is the actual measured yield kg ha 1 twu is the total water used given by the sum of effective p i and the variation of the soil water storage sw m3 ha 1 iwu is the irrigation water used m3 ha 1 etc act is the estimated actual evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 and tc act is again the estimated actual crop transpiration m3 ha 1 the economic crop water productivity ewp m 3 and the economic crop water productivity ratio ewpr were also computed as follows pereira et al 2009a 2012 fernández et al 2020 22 ewp value y a twu 23 ewpr value y a cost twu where value ya is the value of the achieved yield ha 1 and cost twu is the cost of the irrigation water ha 1 ewp expresses the ratio between the profit produced by a crop along the growing season and the total amount of water involved in crop production the ewpr shows the impacts of water prices on the economic return of irrigation the yield value was here set to 0 22 kg 1 according to prices from capmas 2020 in egypt which can also be considered representative for the syrian market the price of the irrigation water was set to 0 055 m 3 as in darouich et al 2020 yields and water productivity indicators in the different treatments and growing seasons were also subjected to a two way anova analysis using spss statistical software version 25 0 spss inc chicago il usa the significant level was tested for different levels of probability using yates s weighted squares of means yates 1934 2 4 net irrigation requirements net irrigation requirements nir consist of the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its water needs when the water available through precipitation capillary rise and soil water storage variation is insufficient pereira et al 2020a nir of jute mallow were computed using a weather time series for the period 1998 2020 23 years which included all daily records of tmax and tmin rhmax and rhmin isun u2 at 2 m height and p available in the same local meteorological station used in the experiment since its installation missing u2 values in 2011 2013 and 2015 were filled with wind data from the closest weather station trípoli lebanon for each year simulations were performed using the calibrated crop parameters while initial soil water depletion was set as 25 of taw and 25 of tew following the earlier observations from irrigation treatments the sowing and crop stages dates were defined as follows a the sowing date in each simulated year was set to may 1st which corresponds to the common beginning of the jute mallow season in the region the dates of the crop growth stages were then defined based on the mean cumulative growing degree days gdd observed during the three growing seasons table 5 the base temperature was 15 ºc following fondio and grubben 2011 b the sowing and crop stages dates were set as in the 2017 season which corresponded to the latest sowing date and longest growing season observed in the experiment on the other hand irrigation scheduling considered the following strategies i basin irrigation with a management allowed depletion mad equal to the depletion fraction for no stress p mad p in which net irrigation depths were computed to refill soil water contents to field capacity ii drip irrigation with mad p in which net irrigation depths were fixed to 20 mm per event for each scenario ai aii bi bii the probability of the demand for irrigation water for the period 1998 2020 was computed by identifying the years representing the average high and very high demand which correspond respectively to the probabilities of 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance as in pereira et al 2009b 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization table 6 presents the model parameters calibrated during the 2018 growing season which were then validated during the 2017 and 2019 seasons the calibrated kcb ini i and kcb ini ii values were 0 15 and 0 35 respectively subscripts i and ii denote for the first and second cut cycles the higher kcb ini value relative to the second cycle resulted from the larger fc value 0 50 of plants remaining in the field after the first cut with the crop already well established when compared with the period after sowing table 4 for these reasons the length of the initial stage during the second cut cycle was short table 2 the calibrated kcb mid value was 0 95 for both cut cycles lastly the calibrated kcb end value was also set to 0 95 in both cut cycles thus indicating that harvesting for fresh human consumption was done when jute mallow leaves were still green and tender i e before senescence occurs these options agree with those proposed by pereira et al 2021 for kcb mid and kcb end of leaves and flowers vegetable crops as such and because experimental plots were relatively small and fast to harvest only one day was considered as the length of the late season stage table 2 for larger crop areas where harvesting of leaves takes several days it could be assumed a longer late season and a shorter mid season with kcb end decreasing to 0 35 as described in fig 3 as a result of leaves harvesting crop transpiration would progressively decrease thus kcb would reduce gradually from 0 95 to 0 35 this hypothesis needs however to be confirmed as referred earlier the literature on jute mallow water requirements is quite scarce with existing studies lacking detailed information on crop phenological characteristics and with non precise derivation of kc moreover no studies were found where jute mallow was harvested with two cuts considering this information gap the calibrated kcb mid and kcb end values matched the corresponding tabulated kcb values for the mid and end season stages of most leaves vegetable crops listed in pereira et al 2021 the pini pmid and pend values were set to 0 55 during both cut cycles representing an increase from those proposed by allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 2021 for leaves vegetable crops table 6 jute mallow was thus considered to be more tolerant to water stress than those crops during the different crop stages 3 2 model simulation of the soil water contents fig 4 presents the soil water contents measured in the root zone of treatments t0 t1 and t2 during the 2017 2019 growing seasons and compares these values with the simdualkc simulations fig 4 further provides the dates of rainfall and irrigation events as well as depths applied per event the seasonal irrigation depths in t0 ranged from 550 to 990 mm with water applied through basin flooding in 5 9 events table 3 irrigation scheduling in this treatment followed the common practice in the region which finds some comparison with the management of jute mallow in other parts of the world palada and chang 2003 odofin et al 2011 while the seasonal amount of water depended much on the length of the crop s growing season the depths applied per irrigation event were very similar and characteristically high ranging from 110 to 115 mm as a result the simulated soil water contents exhibited large variation throughout the crop seasons increasing soil water to values close to saturation during irrigation events and then gradually decreasing due to percolation and root water uptake darouich et al 2020 had already reported a similar soil moisture behavior in zucchini squash furrow irrigation treatments implemented in an adjacent experimental field in t1 the seasonal irrigation depths ranged from 219 to 421 mm table 3 in this drip treatment triggering irrigation when soil water contents dropped below 90 of θfc produced the highest irrigation frequency 11 18 events and the lowest depths per event 11 30 mm contrastingly irrigation in t2 triggered when soil water contents dropped below 80 of θfc resulted in larger depths per event 10 43 mm but fewer events 10 13 events than in t1 the seasonal irrigation depths were the lowest ranging from 200 to 393 mm table 3 nevertheless both t1 and t2 used 57 64 less water than t0 due to the characteristics of the drip irrigation method used in these treatments the simulated soil water contents exhibited also less variation than in t0 with values remaining always close to or slightly below θfc but never approaching saturation the simdualkc model was able to reproduce field measurements reasonably well during the 2018 calibration season with goodness of fit indicating a quite good performance of the model table 7 these indicators showed a higher accuracy of soil water content simulations in the case of drip irrigation t1 and t2 than with surface irrigation in t0 the r2 values were 0 79 and 0 89 in t1 and t2 respectively while in t0 the r2 value was 0 687 nevertheless all r2 values were high enough to express the model s capability in explaining most of the variability of the observed data in the different treatments also the nse value was found to be superior in t1 and t2 nse of 0 69 and 0 79 than in t0 nse 0 47 which still indicated that the residual variance was much smaller than the measured data variance in all treatments furthermore the error of the estimate was generally quite small resulting in rmse and nrmse values lower than 0 001 m3 m 3 and 0 002 respectively lastly both b0 always close to 1 0 and pbias quite small did not allow finding a tendency for observations to be under or over predicted thus confirming the goodness of the model simulations the parameters calibrated in 2018 were validated with the field data of the 2017 and 2019 growing seasons the resulting goodness of fit indicators demonstrate a behavior of the simdualkc model similar to that of calibration in predicting soil water contents during those seasons the goodness of fit indicators are also within the range of values reported in other successful simdualkc applications to vegetables zhang et al 2018 patil and tiwari 2019 darouich et al 2020 and well confirm the reliability of model simulations 3 3 standard and actual crop coefficients fig 5 presents the seasonal values of the potential non stressed basal crop coefficients kcb the actual basal crop coefficients kcb act the soil evaporation coefficients ke and the actual crop coefficients kc act kcb act ke computed by simdualkc for jute mallow during the 2017 2019 growing seasons also included are the rainfall and irrigation events as referred earlier the kcb values for the different crop stages were first calibrated from field data and then further adjusted to local weather conditions following allen et al 1998 and pereira et al 2021 hence during the 2018 growing season the kcb ini kcb mid and kcb end values were calibrated to 0 15 0 95 and 0 95 respectively for the first cut cycle and to 0 35 0 95 and 0 95 respectively for the second cut cycle table 6 after adjustment to local weather conditions the kcb values varied slightly with kcb mid and kcb end adjusting to near 0 90 during both cycles the calibrated kcb values were then validated during the 2017 and 2019 growing seasons in 2017 the kcb adjustment to local weather conditions resulted in kcb mid and kcb end values of 0 92 for the first cut cycle and 0 91 for the second cut cycle in 2019 the adjusted values for kcb mid and kcb end were 0 90 and 0 89 for the first and second cut cycles respectively in t0 the kcb act values always matched the potential standard kcb ones no water stress was ever observed during the three growing seasons fig 5 however the same was not true for t1 and t2 with the kcb act values occasionally departing from the kcb curves during the mid season when the frequency of irrigation was sub optimal nevertheless the water stress periods were always short with the kcb values equaling again the potential values after a successive irrigation or rain event the ke values showed a contrasting behavior between basin and drip treatments which was consistent throughout the three growing seasons the ke values started always high in all treatments after irrigation was applied to aid germination then those values rapidly decreased due to the depletion of the evaporation soil layer in t0 the ke values were raised again to maximum values after the first irrigation event due to the increase of soil moisture in the surface soil layer as jute mallow rapidly developed and the canopy fully covered soil surface reducing the amount of energy available for evaporation the ke values dropped to practically nil values during the rest of the growing season only increasing with irrigation but always producing small peaks the exception was the period after the first cut when the ke values were raised again with the increase of the energy available for evaporation at the soil surface in t1 and t2 contrarily to t0 the ke values never increased to maximum values after irrigation started this occurred because irrigation depths and the fw value in these treatments were much smaller than in t0 which prevented the ke values to increase above 0 4 since irrigation depths in both t1 and t2 were always enough to moist the soil evaporation layer no differences were found in the ke values except for those related to the dates of irrigation events and irrigation frequency with the development of the plant s canopy low ke values were maintained for longer periods in t1 due to the higher irrigation frequency recorded in that treatment compared to t2 in both treatments the ke values eventually dropped to null values a few days after irrigation events but more regularly in t2 larger ke values were also observed in both t1 and t2 after the first cut however ke values remained always smaller than in t0 since irrigation depths and fw were also smaller the kc act curve described the same trends observed for kcb act and ke clearly distinguishing the stages where crop transpiration and soil evaporation contributed most to crop evapotranspiration 3 4 soil water balance table 8 presents the soil water balance computed by simdualkc for jute mallow during the 2017 2019 growing seasons the length of the crop cycle decisively influenced the seasonal tc which values ranged from 284 to 404 mm the lowest value was obtained in 2018 during a season that lasted 68 days the highest was reached in 2017 when the crop season length was 96 days the tc act etc act ratio which ranged from 0 86 to 0 91 showed the dominance of the transpiration component in seasonal et values as mentioned earlier the kcb act values in t0 always matched the potential ones as such the tc act values also equaled the respective tc values meaning that no root water uptake reductions due to water stress were ever registered in this treatment fig 6 the same was also observed for the drip treatments since the previously noticed departure between kcb act and kcb values resulted only in meaningless reductions of the tc values 2 this was important to know since water stress can have a detrimental effect on jute mallow yields by reducing photosynthesis respiration and ultimately leaves growth soil evaporation exhibited the same trends already described for the ke values fig 6 with higher rates during the initial crop stages and following the first cut the seasonal soil evaporation was relatively low due to the fast crop growth determining that full coverage of the soil surface by crop leaves fc 0 95 was attained quite rapidly thus limiting the energy available for evaporation the seasonal es values ranged from 31 to 51 mm and were generally higher in t1 due to the higher irrigation frequency adopted in this treatment the seasonal etc act values ranged from 310 to 452 mm which values are comparable with those reported by odofin et al 2011 326 374 mm deep percolation was only found in t0 with extremely large cumulated values 300 565 mm which represented 55 62 of the irrigation water applied and 49 59 of the total water inputs including rain and soil water storage contrastingly crop water used in t1 ranged from 87 to 90 and in t2 from 89 to 92 in relation to the total water inputs these results further reveal the inefficiency of the traditional irrigation methods considered in this treatment traditional basin irrigation often results in high dp values due to the commonly low performance of these methods walker and skogerboe 1987 darouich et al 2012 however many studies demonstrate that the performance of surface irrigation may be highly improved when design considers the appropriate relationships among the field size slope infiltration characteristics inflow rates and irrigation timing duration and frequency as already demonstrated for syria darouich et al 2012 2014 while for the case study area the percolated water ended up being collected by the drainage network system and delivered to the local stream to be eventually reused further downstream in most syrian irrigated areas those losses constitute an important contribution to groundwater recharge darouich et al 2014 thus despite less efficient than the drip methods the traditional surface irrigation method may well be a valuable mechanism for increasing the soil water storage to be used in irrigation 3 5 yield and water productivity indicators table 9 presents jute mallow yields measured in each treatment during the three growing seasons as well as the respective water productivity indicators wpwu wpirrig wpet wpt ewp and ewpr indicators table 10 then presents the anova table with the analysis of variance for the effects of treatments and seasons on jute mallow yields and wp indicators jute mallow yields were always higher in t1 and t2 than in t0 in t1 yields averaged 16 31 mg ha 1 with annual maximum and minimum values of 18 34 and 13 20 mg ha 1 respectively in t2 the yield average was only slightly below the previous one 15 20 mg ha 1 with yearly values ranging from 14 73 to 15 59 mg ha 1 the first cut was always more productive than the second contrastingly yields in t0 averaged only 11 07 mg ha 1 with yearly values also ranging from 10 42 to 11 94 mg ha 1 statistics showed that the difference in the average between treatments was significant at the 99 9 level of confidence but no relation was found either for the growing seasons or the interaction of both factors i e years treatments literature is quite scarce on the effect of irrigation method and scheduling on jute mallow yields yousef et al 2020 reported a maximum yield of 8 0 mg ha 1 in well fertilized treatments irrigated every ten days by flooding in the assiut governorate central egypt during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons asmaa et al 2014 also presented yields ranging from 10 48 to 12 87 mg ha 1 for jute mallow irrigated by drip in the beheira governorate northern egypt during the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons the previous values were smaller than those obtained in this study yet as in this study crop irrigation by traditional methods always returned the lowest marketable yields the same had already been observed in darouich et al 2020 for zucchini squash like then for traditional furrows basin irrigation resulted in high percolation losses which most certainly promoted nutrient leaching and reduced nutrient availability for jute mallow growth drip irrigation treatments also returned higher water productivity indicators than the basin irrigation treatment table 9 this trend was noticed not only when analyzing the absolute values of each indicator but also their yearly variation assuming always the respective wpwu values as the baseline as a result the wpirrig values showed a greater increase in the drip treatments 6 50 than in t0 2 11 when considering wpwu as the calculation basis thus revealing the higher efficiency of the drip irrigation system on the other hand no substantial differences were found between wpwu and wpet in the drip treatments contrarily to t0 where this indicator increased by 91 140 thus meaning that most of the water inputs in t1 and t2 were used in the et process i e no percolation or runoff occurred a similar analysis was drawn for wpt but here values in the drip treatments suffered a slight increase 8 15 when compared to wpet because evaporation was then not considered the wpwu and wpirrig showed significant differences in the average between treatments and between years at the 99 9 level of confidence but no differences were found for interaction between both factors table 10 likewise the wpet and wpt showed contrasting differences between treatments and between years but the level of confidence was smaller than in the previous indicators 99 also the economical indicators were more advantageous in the drip treatments than in the basin treatment with the average values of both indicators being again found to be significantly different for treatments and years at the 99 9 level of confidence the ewp values ranged from 0 8 to 1 3 m 3 in t1 and t2 while they varied only from 0 24 to 0 43 m 3 in t0 on the other hand the ewpr values ranged from 15 87 to 33 51 in t1 and t2 while in t0 they reached 4 39 8 68 the ewpr values for jute mallow were thus smaller than those in darouich et al 2020 for zucchini squash which ranged from 14 3 to 23 9 in the furrow treatment and from 24 5 to 90 0 in the drip treatments therefore jute mallow may be considered a less interesting crop to be grown in the akkar plain syria but valuable enough to be included in a crop rotation scheme 3 6 defining irrigation thresholds fig 7 presents nir of jute mallow for scenarios ai aii bi and bii for the period 1998 2020 for scenario ai which considered may 1st as the sowing date the dates of the crop stages based on the gdd and basin irrigation the nir values ranged from 314 to 397 mm yet no substantial differences were found for 21 of the 23 years in which nir values varied only from 386 to 397 mm therefore nir values corresponding to this scenario in fig 7 were practically constant this was explained by the small interannual variation of the atmospheric demand during the crop cycle the commonly adopted irrigation trigger threshold mad p and the high irrigation depths applied in each event to refill the soil water contents to field capacity which were not sensitive to small variations on atmospheric demand during the 23 year period the same results were observed for scenario bi which considered the same irrigation method but in this case the sowing date and the crop growth stages were defined as in 2017 nir ranged from 386 to 395 mm for 22 of the 23 years with only one season requiring an extra irrigation event that increased nir to 468 mm for scenario aii which considered the same assumptions as ai but drip irrigation nir ranged from 280 to 400 mm for scenario bii also with drip irrigation nir values varied from 340 to 420 mm despite the noticed small interannual variation of the atmospheric demand during the crop cycle the introduction of drip irrigation allowed to better distinguish nir of jute mallow along the seasons nonetheless nir variation in these scenarios was relatively narrow but with values being always similar or lower than those computed in the basin irrigation scenarios table 11 presents the soil water balance for the years representing the average high and very high demand which corresponded to the probabilities of 50 80 and 95 for non exceedance when assuming a normal distribution for the 1998 2020 nir time series that were always different for each scenario for scenarios ai and bi as referred above no substantial differences were found in the nir of jute mallow nonetheless tc and tc act values increased as expected from the years representing average water demand to the years representing very high water demand for scenarios aii and bii the increase of nir was followed by an increase of tc and tc act values confirming the capability of drip irrigation schemes to save water not just due to the greater efficiency of these systems but also because with drip irrigation it is easier to adjust irrigation depths to atmospheric demand 4 conclusions the modernization of irrigation methods and practices in the syrian akkar plain has provided the context for this research in which irrigation requirements of jute mallow corchorus olitorius l were investigated the simdualkc model which follows the fao56 dual kc approach was used to compute the soil water balance in jute mallow plots irrigated with basin and drip irrigation methods during three growing seasons 2017 2019 the model successfully simulated soil water contents in diverse experimental plots with the level of agreement between measured and simulated data returning rmse values lower than 0 001 m3 m 3 and nse values ranging from 0 36 to 0 81 the calibrated basal crop coefficients kcb were 0 15 0 95 and 0 95 for the initial kcb ini mid season kcb mid and end season kcb end stages respectively which should be considered when computing future crop irrigation needs in the syrian akkar plain the corresponding standard kcb values to be used worldwide and adjusted to local climates are for the first cut cycle kcb ini 0 15 kcb mid 0 92 and kcb end 0 90 and for the second cycle kcb ini 0 35 kcb mid 0 91 and kcb end 0 90 jute mallow yields were significantly higher in the drip irrigation treatments than in the basin treatment with the water productivity and economic indicators responding also positively to water savings generated by the higher application efficiency of the drip systems through the highly frequent application of small irrigation depths that better adjust to the crop water demand the net irrigation requirements were also investigated using the simdualkc

partitioning physiology 1 introduction sugarcane saccharum spp is one of the important commercial crops cultivated in more than 100 countries in the world for mainly sugar and energy globally it is cultivated in an area of 26 52 mha with a production of 1877 10 million tonnes of cane and 172 36 million tonnes of sugar during 2017 18 http sugarcane dac gov in statisticsapy pdf in india it is the second major commercial crop cultivated in 5 042 mha with the production of 411 0 mtonnes and productivity of 81 51 tonnes ha in 2017 18 isma sugarcane productivity is limited by several environmental factors of which drought poses considerable threat and causing severe yield losses in the world venkataramana et al 1986a 1986b in india 93 of sugarcane area is irrigated and severe water stress can pose up to 50 60 yield reduction especially in tropical states gomathi et al 2011 predictions on climate change have also indicated an increased unpredictability in rainfall pattern and increased risk of high temperature in the next 40 years which will cause appreciable limitations of yield total annual water requirement of sugarcane crop ranges from 1850 mm to 2500 mm and sugarcane passes through four distinct physiological growth phases i e germination 0 60 days formative 60 150 days grand growth 150 240 days and maturity 240 360 days among the different growth phases of sugarcane formative stage tillering and early cane formation was identified as the critical water demanding period and has a direct influence on the cane yield and juice quality naidu 1976 ramesh 2000 extensive research work on drought in sugarcane showed that water limited conditions severely affects the growth and cane yield in tropical regions of india the formative phase normally coincides with hot summer months march to may and inadequate water supply drastically results in reduced yield singh and singh 1985 the limited cane yield under formative phase drought has attributed to decreased number of millable canes coupled with reduced cane length number of internodes and single cane weight ramesh and mahadevasamy 2000 in addition to cane yield severe water deficit stress can also influence juice quality traits with appreciable reduction in pol and commercial cane sugar hemaprabha et al 2004 drought stress impairs many physiological functions such as radiation capture leaf temperature lt stomatal conductance transpiration electron transport photosynthesis and respiration which ultimately determine yield qing et al 2001 dry matter production and partitioning to stalks finally decide the cane yield under drought development of drought tolerant varieties to sustain sugarcane productivity in the tropical part of the world has been a major focus area for several decades drought is a complex trait and studying plant s response to drought is complicated and challenged different varieties species and genera show variation in their morphological and physiological responses to drought under same condition stressing the need for importance of diversity in drought tolerance wolfe et al 1988 aguilera et al 1999 souza et al 2004 unfortunately the sugarcane genetic base is narrow and involves only few basic clones of saccharum species and drought tolerance is governed by saccharum spontaneum genome deng et al 2019 the commercial cultivars with s spontaneum genome shows a moderate levels of yield reduction of up to 60 in most of the tropical regions of the world the related genera erianthus has been identified as a valuable source for many traits such as ratoonability tolerance to environmental stresses vigour and disease resistance including remarkable levels of drought tolerance hale et al 2010 deng et al 2019 identifying enhanced drought tolerant clones with erianthus spp could be potential way to improve the sugarcane productivity in drought prone areas and sustaining sugarcane production hence the study was initiated with following objectives i to study the influence of drought on biomass yield and physiology of commercial clones and erianthus introgressed clones ii to compare the dry matter partitioning and to identify drought tolerant clones with desirable

in the dry matter under irrigated than stress situation in other ways the leaf and sheath proportion was higher under drought treatment which was 28 61 for commercial clones and 31 48 for erianthus introgressed clones the proportion of leaf dry matter was 14 5 higher in drought than irrigated condition fig 2 3 5 physiological responses to drought stress the clones were evaluated for physiological traits at the end of drought stress 150dap and the mean values are given in the fig 3 the results showed significant differences for leaf area index relative water content lipid peroxidation and epicuticular wax content among the genotypes and between treatments the clone co 07004 recorded the highest lai of 5 10 followed by the backcross hybrid of erianthus procerus gu 12 21 4 19 which also recorded the highest leaf dry biomass at harvest there were no significant differences for lai between commercial clones and erianthus derivatives under irrigated condition but erianthus introgressed clones showed higher lai under drought the susceptible check co 775 recorded the lowest lai of 0 68 the mean relative content was 82 80 under irrigated and 63 63 under water

one of the most important c4 crops in the world grown mainly for sugar and energy the productivity of sugarcane has been hampered by many environmental stresses of which drought causes severe yield losses especially in tropical regions of the world water limited condition directly affects the yield and juice quality in india drought is the major abiotic stress affecting sugarcane productivity in all sugarcane growing zones in the tropical states 30 36 irrigations are given to raise a good crop the dwindling water resources and erratic rainfall pattern makes sugarcane cultivation difficult and also lead to low availability of cane and affecting sugar recovery hence it is imperative to breed sugarcane varieties tolerant to water limited conditions to sustain the productivity all cane breeding stations are trying hard to include drought tolerant ability as one of the important objectives in breeding sugarcane varieties traditionally saccharum spontaneum has been the source for many biotic and abiotic stresses including drought wang et al 2020 developing and identifying novel sources of drought tolerance from wild resources have the potential to enhance the drought tolerance decades of prebreeding work has resulted in handful of intergeneric hybrids with various genera this study involving 15 diverse clones especially five clones with erianthus spp genome were evaluated for their drought tolerant efficiency comparing with commercial clones only few reports are available on the agronomic performance of intergeneric hybrids and their derivatives nair et al 2017 pachakkil et al 2019 cym clones have erianthus arundinaceus cytoplasm as well as nuclear genome and confirmed with erianthus chloroplast specific markers premachandran et al 2006 lekshmi et al 2017 the other two clones gu 12 21 and gu 12 31 are backcross hybrids involving erianthus procerus mohanraj et al 2019 comparing the hybrids along with a set of diverse commercial clones including a predominant sugarcane variety co 86032 provided an opportunity to identify clones with desirable traits for drought tolerance in sugarcane 4 1 dry biomass partitioning and cane yield sugarcane has the capability of producing 65 tonnes ha 1 of above ground dry mass per year ramanujam and venkataramana 1999 study of dry biomass partitioning is crucial as it decides final cane yield in sugarcane in this study the drought effect on biomass yield juice quality and assimilate partitioning was investigated the drybiomass at peak stress 150dap showed that the reduction was higher in commercial cultivars 70 66 compared to igh clones 59 14 under drought in commercial cultivars the contribution of leaves was more for dry matter production at 150dap 43 70 compared to stalks 33 66 whereas in erianthus derived clones had 43 11 through stalks and 38 62 through leaves however the contribution of stalks increased at harvest 33 66 56 07 in commercials and 43 11 52 2 in erianthus clones under drought condition dry matter partitioning clearly showed that the percent leaf and leaf sheath dry matter was higher under drought than irrigated situation which furthermore indicated the effect of drought on translocation of dry matter from leaf to stalk erianthus derived clones with higher dry biomass under drought showed their relatively higher drought tolerant potential the highest sti was recorded in cym 08 922 1 256 which is bc3 progeny between e arundinaceus and saccharum spontaneum signifying the importance of wild species in drought tolerance quang et al 2019 in their study involving 30 bce3f1 lines of erianthus arundinaceus reported 50 of them highly drought tolerant harvest index is an important efficiency indicator showing dry matter portioned into economic parts we have observed much lower hi under drought compared to irrigated condition indicating the drought affected the translocation of dry matter to stalks our study in a diverse clones clearly showed partitioning of assimilates in to stalk is more important for higher cane yield than dry biomass productivity in sugarcane after the stress termination the drought affected plants try to produce more shoots by accelerated growth which would increase the leaf dry matter the highest leaf biomass was recorded in gu 12 21 a bc1 progeny of e procerus 34 70 and 26 30 in gu 12 31 shows more leaf production after the stress was relieved the clones com 0265 co 06022 cym 08 922 cym 09 1369 and gu 12 31 showed greater ability to partition more dry matter in to stalks under drought than the other clones we able to identify clones viz cym 08 922 gu 12 31 com 0265 co 06022 and cym 09 1369 which performed better interms of cane yield and total dry biomass under drought and also recorded higher sti high association hi with cane yield under both drought and irrigated could serve easy trait to be used in drought breeding programmes sugarcane has moderate drought tolerant ability and can make up the yield once drought is relieved the conversion more biomass produced during this period need to be converted into stalk biomass and delayed harvesting can improve the yield in those entries which has higher dry matter partitioning ability physiological response of sugarcane clones to drought and its effect on cane yield and juice quality parameters given an insight in the selection of traits for screening drought tolerant varieties plants have several physiological and biochemical mechanisms to copeup the drought situation several studies on drought have shown that relatively higher rwc in drought tolerant plants jamaux et al 1997 altinkut et al 2001 it is a key physiological trait shows the degree of cell and tissue degradation in our study rwc was significantly higher under irrigated and some clones able to maintain better tissue hydration drought tolerant sugarcane maintained higher rwc 16 compared to susceptible types marcelo et al 2007 in this study also the clones co 06022 and cym 08 922 maintained higher rwc under drought the trait association with cane yield under drought and irrigated indicated the use of this trait in screening drought tolerant varieties in the present study there was mean reduction of 52 86 due to drought among the clones for leaf area index this was in confirmation with earlier reports that growth and expansion of leaves were severely affected by drought venkataramana et al 1984 gururajarao 1994 gomathi et al 2011 the clone co 07004 able to susain the effect of drought and showed only 8 13 reductioni lai and this may be due to that the clone was developed by involving novel saccharum spontaneum genome other such clone gu 12 21 which is a derivative of erianthus procerus also exhibited lower reduction of lai 28 34 and such genotypic differences in the ability to maintain leaf area might be associated with drought tolerance through the maintenance of high leaf water potential lipid peroxidation is often used as an indicator of increased oxidative damage and the mda content increased under drought compared to control condition in both commercial and igh clones lower levels of lipid peroxidation in the leaves of igh clones indicating their better protected from oxidative damage under drought stress than commercial cultivars under drought stress the epiculticular wax content was found to be increase in several crops such as wheat and pea merah et al 2001 sanchez et al 2001 in our study also the epiculticular wax content increased in all the genotypes under drought and the percent increase was more in igh clones 35 20 compared to commercial cultivars 23 88 present findings clearly showed that the igh clone involving erianthus spp had improved drought tolerant ability than the commercial cultivars and they are important sources for enhancing the drought tolerance and sustaining sugarcane productivity in sub optimal water availability drought stress is a major environmental factor affecting the sugarcane productivity in all agro climatic zones of india drought in combination with high temperature during summer months is known to suppress the cane yields in both tropical and sub tropical climates in this study we have observed there was 33 30 cane yield reduction under drought and other cane traits cane height nmc and single cane weight also suffered more than 15 reduction the correlation has also shown the significant correlation of these traits under drought previous studies in commercial clones had shown 38 5 under severe drought and 24 7 reduction due to formative phase drought under moderate drought situation ramesh and mahadevaswamy 2000 da silva and da costa 2004 also found significant positive correlation among productivity and stalk height and stalk weight but a moderate positive correlation was found between productivity and stalk number and no significant correlation to productivity versus stalk diameter in addition to rwc cane height nmc and showed positive association with cane yield under both drought and irrigated condition and could be important parameters in screening clones under sugarcane improvement programmes it should be noted that nmc was negatively correlated with cane diameter and hence selection for high nmc may lead to thinner canes 5 conclusion drought stress affects total biomass production cane yield dry matter partitioning in sugarcane the translocation of dry matter from leaves to cane was severely affected under water limited situation and there was variation in dry matter partitioning among clones com 0265 co 06022 cym 08 922 cym 09 1369 and gu 12 31 showed greater ability to partition dry matter in to stalks under drought than the other clones and had higher stress tolerant index cane height number of millable stalks and rwc showed positive and significant association with cane yield under both drought and irrigated condition and could be important parameters in screening clones under sugarcane improvement programmes igh clone involving erianthus spp had improved drought tolerant ability than the commercial cultivars and they are important sources for enhancing the drought tolerance and sustaining sugarcane productivity under sub optimal water availability high dry biomass coupled with more than 13 sucrose and drought tolerant ability in erianthus introgressed clones could be a good candidate

four distinct physiological growth phases i e germination 0 60 days formative 60 150 days grand growth 150 240 days and maturity 240 360 days among the different growth phases of sugarcane formative stage tillering and early cane formation was identified as the critical water demanding period and has a direct influence on the cane yield and juice quality naidu 1976 ramesh 2000 extensive research work on drought in sugarcane showed that water limited conditions severely affects the growth and cane yield in tropical regions of india the formative phase normally coincides with hot summer months march to may and inadequate water supply drastically results in reduced yield singh and singh 1985 the limited cane yield under formative phase drought has attributed to decreased number of millable canes coupled with reduced cane length number of internodes and single cane weight ramesh and mahadevasamy 2000 in addition to cane yield severe water deficit stress can also influence juice quality traits with appreciable reduction in pol and commercial cane sugar hemaprabha et al 2004 drought stress impairs many physiological functions such as radiation capture leaf temperature lt stomatal conductance transpiration electron transport photosynthesis and respiration which ultimately determine yield qing et al 2001 dry matter production and partitioning to stalks finally decide the cane yield under drought development of drought tolerant varieties to sustain sugarcane productivity in the tropical part of the world has been a major focus area for several decades drought is a complex trait and studying plant s response to drought is complicated and challenged different varieties species and genera show variation in their morphological and physiological responses to drought under same condition stressing the need for importance of diversity in drought tolerance wolfe et al 1988 aguilera et al 1999 souza et al 2004 unfortunately the sugarcane genetic base is narrow and involves only few basic clones of saccharum species and drought tolerance is governed by saccharum spontaneum genome deng et al 2019 the commercial cultivars with s spontaneum genome shows a moderate levels of yield reduction of up to 60 in most of the tropical regions of the world the related genera erianthus has been identified as a valuable source for many traits such as ratoonability tolerance to environmental stresses vigour and disease resistance including remarkable levels of drought tolerance hale et al 2010 deng et al 2019 identifying enhanced drought tolerant clones with erianthus spp could be potential way to improve the sugarcane productivity in drought prone areas and sustaining sugarcane production hence the study was initiated with following objectives i to study the influence of drought on biomass yield and physiology of commercial clones and erianthus introgressed clones ii to compare the dry matter partitioning and to identify drought tolerant clones with desirable traits that could be used as donors in sugarcane improvement programmes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and climatic conditions the trial was conducted at east chithirai chavadi farm of

backcrosses involving erianthus the mean harvest index under irrigated was 70 86 and 54 13 under water stress there was no significant difference for hi between commercial and igh clones under drought though it was significant under irrigated condition 3 4 dry matter production and partitioning at peak stress and harvest water stress at formative phase significantly reduced the dry biomass in all the genotypes drybiomass production at peak water stress 150dap showed that erianthus derived clones recorded a mean of 10 74 t ha dry biomass compared to commercial cultivars 8 0 t ha the portioning of drymatter into stalks leaf and sheath showed that the leaves contributed 43 70 in commercials while stalks contributed only 33 66 whereas in erianthus derived clones leaves had 38 62 and stalks had

highest in cym 08 922 47 66 t ha table 2 the partitioning of dry matter into stalk leaf and leaf sheath under both regimes at harvest indicated the stalks contributed significantly higher proportion in the dry matter under irrigated than stress situation in other ways the leaf and sheath proportion was higher under drought treatment which was 28 61 for commercial clones and 31 48 for erianthus introgressed clones the proportion of leaf dry matter was 14 5 higher in drought than irrigated condition fig 2 3 5 physiological responses to drought stress the clones were evaluated for

one of the most important c4 crops in the world grown mainly for sugar and energy the productivity of sugarcane has been hampered by many environmental stresses of which drought causes severe yield losses especially in tropical regions of the world water limited condition directly affects the yield and juice quality in india drought is the major abiotic stress affecting sugarcane productivity in all sugarcane growing zones in the tropical states 30 36 irrigations are given to raise a good crop the dwindling water resources and erratic rainfall pattern makes sugarcane cultivation difficult and also lead to low availability of cane and affecting sugar recovery hence it is imperative to breed sugarcane varieties tolerant to water limited conditions to sustain the productivity all cane breeding stations are trying hard to include drought tolerant ability as one of the important objectives in breeding sugarcane varieties traditionally saccharum spontaneum has been the source for many biotic and abiotic stresses including drought wang et al 2020 developing and identifying novel sources of drought tolerance from wild resources have the potential to enhance the drought tolerance decades of prebreeding work has resulted in handful of intergeneric hybrids with various genera this study involving 15 diverse clones especially five clones with erianthus spp genome were evaluated for their drought tolerant efficiency comparing with commercial clones only few reports are available on the agronomic performance of intergeneric hybrids and their derivatives nair et al 2017 pachakkil et al 2019 cym clones have erianthus arundinaceus cytoplasm as well as nuclear genome and confirmed with erianthus chloroplast specific markers premachandran et al 2006 lekshmi et al 2017 the other two clones gu 12 21 and gu 12 31 are backcross hybrids involving erianthus procerus mohanraj et al 2019 comparing the hybrids along with a set of diverse commercial clones including a predominant sugarcane variety co 86032 provided an opportunity to identify clones with desirable traits for drought tolerance in sugarcane 4 1 dry biomass partitioning and cane yield sugarcane has the capability of producing 65 tonnes ha 1 of above ground dry mass per year ramanujam and venkataramana 1999 study of dry biomass partitioning is crucial as it decides final cane yield in sugarcane in this study the drought effect on biomass yield juice quality and assimilate partitioning was investigated the drybiomass at peak stress 150dap showed that the reduction was higher in commercial cultivars 70 66 compared to igh clones 59 14 under drought in commercial cultivars the contribution of leaves was more for dry matter production at 150dap 43 70 compared to stalks 33 66 whereas in erianthus derived clones had 43 11 through stalks and 38 62 through leaves however the contribution of stalks increased at harvest 33 66 56 07 in commercials and 43 11 52 2 in erianthus clones under drought condition dry matter partitioning clearly showed that the percent leaf and leaf sheath dry matter was higher under drought than irrigated situation which furthermore indicated the effect of drought on translocation of dry matter from leaf to stalk erianthus derived clones with higher dry biomass under drought showed their relatively higher drought tolerant potential the highest sti was recorded in cym 08 922 1 256 which is bc3 progeny between e arundinaceus and saccharum spontaneum signifying the importance of wild species in drought tolerance quang et al 2019 in their study involving 30 bce3f1 lines of erianthus arundinaceus reported 50 of them highly drought tolerant harvest index is an important efficiency indicator showing dry matter portioned into economic parts we have observed much lower hi under drought compared to irrigated condition indicating the drought affected the translocation of dry matter to stalks our study in a diverse clones clearly showed partitioning of assimilates in to stalk is more important for higher cane yield than dry biomass productivity in sugarcane after the stress termination the drought affected plants try to produce more shoots by accelerated growth which would increase the leaf dry matter the highest leaf biomass was recorded in gu 12 21 a bc1 progeny of e procerus 34 70 and 26 30 in gu 12 31 shows more leaf production after the stress was relieved the clones com 0265 co 06022 cym 08 922 cym 09 1369 and gu 12 31 showed greater ability to partition more dry matter in to stalks under drought than the other clones we able to identify clones viz cym 08 922 gu 12 31 com 0265 co 06022 and cym 09 1369 which performed better interms of cane yield and total dry biomass under drought and also recorded higher sti high association hi with cane yield under both drought and irrigated could serve easy trait to be used in drought breeding programmes sugarcane has moderate drought tolerant ability and can make up the yield once drought is relieved the conversion more biomass produced during this period need to be converted into stalk biomass and delayed harvesting can improve the yield in those entries which has higher dry matter partitioning ability physiological response of sugarcane clones to drought and its effect on cane yield and juice quality parameters given an insight in the selection of traits for screening drought tolerant varieties plants have several physiological and biochemical mechanisms to copeup the drought situation several studies on drought have shown that relatively higher rwc in drought tolerant plants jamaux et al 1997 altinkut et al 2001 it is a key physiological trait shows the degree of cell and tissue degradation in our study rwc was significantly higher under irrigated and some clones able to maintain better tissue hydration drought tolerant sugarcane maintained higher rwc 16 compared to susceptible types marcelo et al 2007 in this study also the clones co 06022 and cym 08 922 maintained higher rwc under drought the trait association with cane yield under drought and irrigated indicated the use of this trait in screening drought tolerant varieties in the present study there was mean reduction of 52 86 due to drought among the clones for leaf area index this was in confirmation with earlier reports that growth and expansion of leaves were severely affected by drought venkataramana et al 1984 gururajarao 1994 gomathi et al 2011 the clone co 07004 able to susain the effect of drought and showed only 8 13 reductioni lai and this may be due to that the clone was developed by involving novel saccharum spontaneum genome other such clone gu 12 21 which is a derivative of erianthus procerus also exhibited lower reduction of lai 28 34 and such genotypic differences in the ability to maintain leaf area might be associated with drought tolerance through the maintenance of high leaf water potential lipid peroxidation is often used as an indicator of increased oxidative damage and the mda content increased under drought compared to control condition in both commercial and igh clones lower levels of lipid peroxidation in the leaves of igh clones indicating their better protected from oxidative damage under drought stress than commercial cultivars under drought stress the epiculticular wax content was found to be increase in several crops such as wheat and pea merah et al 2001 sanchez et al 2001 in our study also the epiculticular wax content increased in all the genotypes under drought and the percent increase was more in igh clones 35 20 compared to commercial cultivars 23 88 present findings clearly showed that the igh clone involving erianthus spp had improved drought tolerant ability than the commercial cultivars and they are important sources for enhancing the drought tolerance and sustaining sugarcane productivity in sub optimal water availability drought stress is a major environmental factor affecting the sugarcane productivity in all agro climatic zones of india drought in combination with high temperature during summer months is known to suppress the cane yields in both tropical and sub tropical climates in this study we have observed there was 33 30 cane yield reduction under drought and other cane traits cane height nmc and single cane weight also suffered more than 15 reduction the correlation has also shown the significant correlation of these traits under drought previous studies in commercial clones had shown 38 5 under severe drought and 24 7 reduction due to formative phase drought under moderate drought situation ramesh and mahadevaswamy 2000 da silva and da costa 2004 also found significant positive correlation among productivity and stalk height and stalk weight but a moderate positive correlation was found between productivity and stalk number and no significant correlation to productivity versus stalk diameter in addition to rwc cane height nmc and showed positive association with cane yield under both drought and irrigated condition and could be important parameters in screening clones under sugarcane improvement programmes it should be noted that nmc was negatively correlated with cane diameter and hence selection for high nmc may lead to thinner canes 5 conclusion drought stress affects total biomass production cane yield dry matter partitioning in sugarcane the translocation of dry matter from leaves to cane was severely affected under water limited situation and there was variation in dry matter partitioning among clones com 0265 co 06022 cym 08 922 cym 09 1369 and gu 12 31 showed greater ability to partition dry matter in to stalks under drought than the other clones and had higher stress tolerant index cane height number of millable stalks and rwc showed positive and significant association with cane yield under both drought and irrigated condition and could be important parameters in screening clones under sugarcane improvement programmes igh clone involving erianthus spp had improved drought tolerant ability than the commercial cultivars and they are important sources for enhancing the drought tolerance and sustaining sugarcane productivity under sub optimal water availability high dry biomass coupled with more than 13 sucrose and drought tolerant ability in erianthus introgressed clones could be a good candidate

9997,regulated deficit irrigation rdi is an important means by which the water use efficiency wue of peanut can be improved and facilitates the sustainable development of the peanut industry however most studies of rdi have only focused on single growth periods which limits the water saving potential in this study continuous regulated deficit irrigation crdi was used to significantly improve the wue of peanut through an experiment employing a split plot design three levels of water deficit treatment severe h1 j1 45 field capacity moderate h2 j2 55 field capacity and mild h3 j3 65 field capacity were applied in the flower pegging stage h and the pod setting stage j moderate crdi h2j2 stably improved the instantaneous water use efficiency of peanut leaves yield was not significantly decreased under the h2j2 treatment and was only 4 47 lower than that of the h3j2 treatment in which the yield was the highest the highest wue was observed in the h2j2 treatment 1 87 kg m 3 the first time that the soil water content reached the lower limit in the pod setting stage the proline content in the h1j1 treatment was 13 57 times higher than that in the h3j3 indicating that peanuts in the h1j1 treatment experienced substantial drought stress the second time that the lower limit of soil water content was reached the proline content in the h1j1 treatment was 7 14 times higher than that in the h3j3 treatment indicating that the peanut drought resistance was improved by the drought rehydration exercise at the flower pegging stage and drought stress was alleviated in the pod setting stage we conclude that moderate crdi is beneficial to peanut drought resistance for arid and semi arid areas and significantly promoted higher wue keywords continuous regulated deficit irrigation peanut drought resistance yield proline content gas exchange parameters 1 introduction china is one of the world s largest peanut producers and consumers xia et al 2021 since the reform and opening up of china economic development and improved living standards have continuously increased the demand for peanut oil and peanut kernels and the domestic and international trade prospects for chinese peanuts are very promising dai et al 2009 therefore improving peanut yield and quality is very important for the development of oil crops in china chi et al 2019 peanut producing areas are concentrated primarily in arid and semi arid hilly regions of china zhang et al 2020 however water resources are increasingly scarce and droughts are frequent in this region these adverse factors seriously impair the development of the peanut flower peg and the degree of pod fullness thereby limiting the improvement of peanut yield and quality aninbon et al 2019 the adoption of effective irrigation protocols is an important measure for ensuring sustainable peanut production but the traditional full irrigation method often wastes water resources and causes low wue thus falling short of sustainable agricultural standards ding et al 2021 geries et al 2021 breaking free of conventional irrigation modes and adopting a new irrigation system is critical to ensuring green and efficient peanut production in the 1970s the australian researcher tatura introduced a new water saving irrigation method regulated deficit irrigation rdi dingre and gorantiwar 2020 he believed that when crops were under drought stress they were affected by genetic factors and growth hormones that regulated organ development altered the root to shoot ratio increased the harvestable plant parts and changed internal biochemical reactions ultimately achieving the goal of saving water while maintaining high yield and quality nikanorova et al 2016 in recent years this technology has shown positive effects on tomato wheat corn and other crops chand et al 2021 ali et al 2018 çakir and çebi 2010 roccuzzo et al 2014 for example when water deficit was 65 of field capacity the highest root dry matter could still be obtained at a later growth stage in cotton and this was beneficial for nutrient absorption and yield formation meng et al 2008 the main reason for implementing rdi is that it both stabilizes or even increases yield and also greatly improves crop water use efficiency which is important for cultivation in arid and semi arid areas at present research on the mechanisms by which rdi saves water increases yield and improves wue focuses primarily on four aspects 1 physiological activities related to crop yield have different responses to water in growing crops cell expansion responds most rapidly to water deficit and is the physiological process most susceptible to drought when the soil is dry the vegetative growth of crops stagnates first under suitable water deficit conditions fruit organic matter accumulation and effective yield are less affected hossain et al 2015 rdi can compensate or even overcompensate for previous water deficit by artificially controlling soil moisture to limit crop growth in the plant growth stage then fully supplying water in the water stress relief stage yang et al 2020 2 a decrease in soil moisture leads to a decrease in the water potential of crop leaves thereby regulating stomatal opening to better cope with drought crops tend to reduce transpiration while maintaining normal photosynthesis thereby improving instantaneous water use efficiency yin et al 2011 3 osmotic adjustment is an effective means by which crops compensate for adversity the ability to perform osmotic adjustment directly determines the compensation effect which depends mainly on proline soluble sugars and soluble protein accumulation bandurska et al 2017 furlan et al 2020 under drought many crops accumulate large amounts of proline that not only increase the solute concentration of the cytoplasm but can also substitute for water in related physiological processes during drought resistance at the same time proline and similar substances can be used as raw materials for the compensation effect on dry matter accumulation after rehydration dong et al 2019 an et al 2017 4 crops can often remember the initial stress and respond to secondary or multiple stresses and this kind of stress memory can improve the resistance ability from the physiological and biochemical level and help to improve the drought resistance of crop rdi is a kind of irrigation method involving multiple drought rehydration processes and its induced stress memory was helpful to improve the drought resistance of peanut thus ensuring peanut yield baldwin and schmelz 1996 liu et al 2016 qin and ci 2017 continuous regulated deficit irrigation crdi is an improved irrigation method based on rdi which can make use of the stress memory mechanism of crops and adopt the water deficit rewatering irrigation mode in multiple growth period to facilitate continuous regulation of crops and greatly improve the water use efficiency of crops few studies have examined rdi in peanut and most rdi studies have focused on a single growth period in this experiment the method of continuous regulated deficit irrigation crdi in the flower pegging stage and the pod setting stage was used specifically we aimed to clarify the eﬀect of crdi on peanut growth yield wue osmotic regulation substances leaf gas exchange parameters dry matter accumulation as well as the differences in drought resistance between the flower pegging stage and the pod setting stage driven by crdi the aims of our study were to explore crdi s water saving and yield increasing effects and characterize the difference in drought resistance under crdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 site conditions field experiments were conducted from may 2017 to october 2018 in taoli village fuxin 121 47 e 42 01 n which is

ratio and wue value of peanut 3 results 3 1 gas exchange parameters of the leaves at the pod setting stage the dynamic changes of net photosynthetic rate pn and transpiration rate tr of peanut before and after the first drought rehydration process were shown in fig 4 the pn and tr were significantly reduced by water stress in 2017 the pn of h2j2 treatment was 1 82 p 0 05 higher than that of h3j3 treatment on the first day before rehydration the pn of h2j2 treatment on the first day before rehydration was 6 15 lower than that on the second day before rehydration while h3j3 treatment on the first day before rehydration was 44 89 lower than that on the second day before rehydration this indicated that moderate crdi slowed down the decline rate of pn on the first day after rehydration the pn and tr of h1j3 was increased however the pn and tr of h1j1 h1j2 and h2j1 treatment exhibited a downward trend indicating that severe crdi showed obvious inhibition effects on the peanut gas exchange function on the third day after rehydration the pn of h3j3 treatment showed a downward trend which was completely contrary to that of h2j2 the pn of h2j2 treatment remained an upward trend on the third day after rehydration in both years the average total iwue of h2j2 3 66 co2 h2o was the maximum fig 5 gs and iwue showed a quadratic curve relationship with r2 of 0 692 and 0 626 respectively in 2017 and 2018 fig 6 3 2 osmotic adjustment substances crdi significantly increased the pro content in peanut leaves fig 7 in 2017 and 2018 h1j1 treatment was 8 87 times and 13 57 times higher than that of h3j3 treatment respectively after rehydration the pro content of most treatment decreased rapidly but the pro content of h1j1 treatment was still at a high level and h1j1 treatment was 2 19 times and 3 53 times higher than that of h3j3 treatment respectively in 2017 and 2018 in 2018 the pro content of h1j1 treatment in the second drought was 29 69 lower than that of h1j1 treatment in the first drought this indicated that the drought resistance of peanut was improved by the first drought rehydration exercise in 2017 and 2018 the sp content of h1j1 treatment was 23 36 and 23 60 higher than that of h3j3 treatment respectively p 0 05 during rehydration the sp content did not decrease during the second drought the sp content continued to increase and h1j1 treatment was 87 32 higher than that of h3j3 treatment in 2017 p 0 05 in general sp showed a trend of continuous increase indicating that sp accumulated for a long time for drought resistance the interaction effect of crdi on ss content was not significant table 3 in both years the ss content of h1 treatment increased by 100 60 and 64 30 compared with that of h3 treatment respectively p 0 05 after rehydration the ss content of all treatments were no difference for the second drought the ss content of h1 treatment was 114 61 and 115 45 higher than that of h3 treatment respectively p 0 05 3 3 dry weight and root to shoot ratio crdi significantly increased the root dry weight and reduced the shoot dry weight table 4 in 2017 the root dry weight of h1j1 treatment at the pod setting stage and the pod filling stage was 52 19 and 51 51 higher than that of h3j3 treatment and the shoot dry weight was 23 15 and 24 12 lower than that of h3j3 treatment respectively p 0 05 in 2017 and 2018 the root to shoot ratio of h1j1 treatment was 109 26 and 70 77 higher than that of h3j3 treatment respectively p 0 05 fig 8 in conclusion severe crdi treatment increased peanut root to shoot ratio but inhibited dry matter accumulation of peanut shoot 3 4 yield and wue crdi had significant influence on yield and wue table 5 in both years the average total yield of h3j2 5794 66 kg ha 1 was the highest among all treatments and it was 82 53 higher compared with the h1j1 treatment there was no difference in yield among the h3j1 h3j2 and h2j2 treatments in both years with averages yield of 5687 65 5794 66 and 5535 54 kg ha 1 respectively the yield of h3j3 treatment was lower than that of the above three treatments the yield of h2j2 treatment was 72 25 and 74 01 higher than that of h1j1 treatment in 2017 and 2018 respectively p 0 05 in both years the wue of h2j2 treatment was the highest which was 44 16 and 45 03 higher than that of h3j3 p 0 05 respectively the h2j2 treatment had the higher yield and the highest wue which met the requirement of water saving and stable yield under the crdi system 3 5 correlation of each index the leaf iwue on the second and third day after rehydration was positively correlated with wue with the correlation coefficient of 0 57 and 0 75 respectively fig 9 there was a negative correlation between wue and root to shoot ratio in the pod setting stage and the pod filling stage with correlation coefficients of 0 52 and 0 66 respectively the three osmotic regulating substances were positively correlated with each other 4 discussion 4 1 influence of crdi on the root to shoot ratio the root system and the canopy are the basic structures of crop growth and their growth ratio is mainly affected by genetic factors nonetheless the expression of genetic characteristics is also affected by the growth environment in which water is a predominant factor wu et al 2020 here we found that crdi significantly increased the root dry matter of peanuts decreased the canopy dry matter and increased the root to shoot ratio consistent with the results of most crop water stress studies ma et al 2017 li et al 2018a 2018b there is a competition between root and shoot and water deficit affects the distribution ratio of dry matter among the root and shoot so that more nutrients are transferred to the roots the main function of the root system is the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil when the soil water environment is poor the development of the root system is prioritized and the roots continue exploring the soil to absorb more water and nutrients in order to cope with drought rejeth et al 2020 sushil et al 2019 this preferential development of the root system is also conducive to the absorption of nutrients and water during the rehydration stage thereby ensuring that the compensation effect occurs in the later period to achieve stable or even increased yields the main function of the canopy is to synthesize carbohydrates and reduced canopy development during drought at the same time a smaller canopy area can significantly reduce excessive transpiration in conclusion crdi enhances the water and nutrient absorption capacity of peanut by increasing the root to shoot ratio and limiting the excess growth of vegetative organs thereby optimizing the root to shoot structure saving water and increasing yield tarek et al 2017 wu et al 2019 in this study it was found that under crdi there was a negative correlation between root shoot ratio and wue which was consistent with xia s research on rdi in peanuts xia et al 2018 however contrary results showed that there was a positive correlation between the root to shoot ratio and wue ma et al 2010 this may be because in this study under the conditions of continuous water deficit longer stress cycle and severe water deficit the yield compensation was small and finally there was a negative correlation at the same time peanut pod yield is in the underground part its growth and development of nutrition source is not limited to canopy transfer related and the complex relationship with the root system still needs to be further studied 4 2 effects of crdi on leaf gas exchange parameters photosynthesis is a process by which green plants absorb light energy assimilate co2 and h2o produce organic substances and simultaneously release o2 it is an important aspect of plant physiological activity li et al 2019 transpiration is not only the main means by which plants respond to adversity and optimize their physiological state but also the driving force for the upward transportation of water and nutrients zahia et al 2017 here we concluded that water deficit significantly reduced the pn and tr of peanut leaves the greater the degree of stress the more significant the decline was which was consistent with a previous report li et al 2018a 2018b xia et al 2020 after rehydration the gas exchange capacity of leaves under mild and moderate water deficit treatment gradually recovered the photosynthesis and transpiration of peanut exposed to the h2j2 treatment over the continuous growth period showed some overcompensation effect on the third day after rehydration the pn was still clearly increasing this result indicated that moderate crdi regulation provided beneficial drought resistance acclimation for peanut after rehydration the gas exchange parameters of leaves from the severe water deficit treatment continued to decline indicating that excessive water deficit irreversibly damaged peanut leaves and was not conducive to peanut growth ma et al 2016 there was a quadratic relationship between gs and iwue and gs was negatively correlated with iwue to the left of the symmetry axis during the water deficit stages of crdi peanut leaf gs decreased significantly however crops often improve their iwue in response to drought because photosynthesis and transpiration have different sensitivities to water deficit transpiration is more sensitive than photosynthesis and under the same drought conditions transpiration is inhibited to a greater extent here the pn of peanut leaves under mild or moderate water deficit treatment was affected very little after the drought rehydration exercise tr decreased under water deficit but pn decreased to only a small extent leading to improvement in iwue li et al 2018a 2018b in the rehydration stage of crdi stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration recovered transpiration is more sensitive to soil moisture than photosynthesis and decreased on the second day after rehydration however photosynthetic compensation was clear in the continuous mild and moderate water deficit treatments after the drought rehydration exercise and both showed an increasing trend in this case the iwue was improved in general because of the different sensitivities of photosynthesis and transpiration to soil water status the iwue of leaves first decreased and then increased with increasing gs showing a quadratic relationship the iwue of leaves on the second and third day after rehydration were positively correlated with the wue of the final yield indicating that the higher the iwue the higher the wue of the final yield this indicates that appropriate water deficit treatment improves the wue of the final yield by increasing the iwue consistent with qin s report that improving the cumulative effect of iwue can improve crop water efficiency qin and ci 2017 4 3 effects of crdi on osmotic adjustment substances in peanut leaves the osmotic adjustment process is the most effective means of crop compensation for stress injury the strength of osmotic adjustment directly determines the degree of the compensation effect after the stress is removed noguera artiaga et al 2019 osmotic regulation is mainly determined by the contents of proline soluble protein and soluble sugar here we found that water deficit significantly increased proline content in peanut leaves and severe water deficit increased the proline content several fold after rehydration proline content returned to normal levels proline acts as a solute to increase the concentration of the intracellular fluid during drought thus regulating cell osmotic potential ghaffari et al 2021 karami et al 2017 during rehydration compensation proline is used as a nitrogenous compound to provide raw material for plant nitrogen compensation and participates in physiological and biochemical reactions during the second drought proline still accumulated rapidly but its content was lower than during the first drought indicating that peanut acclimated during the drought rehydration exercise in ways that increased its adaptability about facing drought fiasconaro et al 2019 the soluble protein content in peanut leaves increased during the drought rehydration drought process during the first drought water deficit significantly increased soluble protein content after rehydration the soluble protein content did not decrease significantly perhaps due to the slow hydrolysis of protein and leaf soluble protein content continued to increase during the second drought this is consistent with the results of guo s research in which soluble protein played a long term role in the osmotic regulation mechanisms of crops guo et al 2018 soluble sugars are small solute molecules induced by drought stress that not only maintain the osmotic regulation of cells but also participate in physiological repair processes after rehydration studies have shown that soluble sugars are combined with aba during signal conduction aba s main function is the regulation of stomatal aperture during drought in order to reduce excessive water consumption and maintain a high wue devireddy et al 2020 soluble sugars act quickly and their synthesis and degradation processes are relatively fast in this study we found that the relationship between water deficit in the continuous growth period and soluble sugar content was not significant although it was significant in the single growth period this indicates that soluble sugar responds rapidly to drought signaling it is produced quickly during drought to participate in osmotic regulation hydrolyzed rapidly during rehydration and produced rapidly again to participate in stress resistance during the second drought gao et al 2020 in general the response of soluble sugar to drought was not affected by the drought rehydration exercise there was a positive correlation among proline soluble sugar and soluble protein indicating that the three substances had a synergistic effect in coping with drought this is consistent with mousavi s conclusion that the response of osmotic substances during drought resistance is a comprehensive effect mousavi et al 2017 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to improve the water use efficiency wue and the water saving potential of peanut in arid areas through continuous regulated deficit irrigation the main conclusions were threefold 1 after severe water deficit and rehydration leaves were not able to resume normal photosynthesis but the compensation effect after moderate water stress and rehydration could greatly improve the instantaneous wue of peanut leaves 2 water deficit significantly increased the osmotic regulatory substances in peanut leaves and the proline content showed the greatest increase after the drought rehydration exercise the osmotic regulation mechanism permitted adaptation to drought 3 in both years the average total wue was highest in the h2j2 treatment 1 87 kg m 3 the h2j2 treatment improved the drought resistance of peanut in the drought rehydration exercise during the flower pegging stage at the pod setting stage after the drought resistance exercise the iwue continuously increased at the pod setting stage in the h2j2 treatment overall the h2j2 treatment can improve the wue of peanut without compromising peanut yield this treatment also facilitates water saving promotes stable yields and promotes the sustainable development of peanut declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9997,regulated deficit irrigation rdi is an important means by which the water use efficiency wue of peanut can be improved and facilitates the sustainable development of the peanut industry however most studies of rdi have only focused on single growth periods which limits the water saving potential in this study continuous regulated deficit irrigation crdi was used to significantly improve the wue of peanut through an experiment employing a split plot design three levels of water deficit treatment severe h1 j1 45 field capacity moderate h2 j2 55 field capacity and mild h3 j3 65 field capacity were applied in the flower pegging stage h and the pod setting stage j moderate crdi h2j2 stably improved the instantaneous water use efficiency of peanut leaves yield was not significantly decreased under the h2j2 treatment and was only 4 47 lower than that of the h3j2 treatment in which the yield was the highest the highest wue was observed in the h2j2 treatment 1 87 kg m 3 the first time that the soil water content reached the lower limit in the pod setting stage the proline content in the h1j1 treatment was 13 57 times higher than that in the h3j3 indicating that peanuts in the h1j1 treatment experienced substantial drought stress the second time that the lower limit of soil water content was reached the proline content in the h1j1 treatment was 7 14 times higher than that in the h3j3 treatment indicating that the peanut drought resistance was improved by the drought rehydration exercise at the flower pegging stage and drought stress was alleviated in the pod setting stage we conclude that moderate crdi is beneficial to peanut drought resistance for arid and semi arid areas and significantly promoted higher wue keywords continuous regulated deficit irrigation peanut drought resistance yield proline content gas exchange parameters 1 introduction china is one of the world s largest peanut producers and consumers xia et al 2021 since the reform and opening up of china economic development and improved living standards have continuously increased the demand for peanut oil and peanut kernels and the domestic and international trade prospects for chinese peanuts are very promising dai et al 2009 therefore improving peanut yield and quality is very important for the development of oil crops in china chi et al 2019 peanut producing areas are concentrated primarily in arid and semi arid hilly regions of china zhang et al 2020 however water resources are increasingly scarce and droughts are frequent in this region these adverse factors seriously impair the development of the peanut flower peg and the degree of pod fullness thereby limiting the improvement of peanut yield and quality aninbon et al 2019 the adoption of effective irrigation protocols is an important measure for ensuring sustainable peanut production but the traditional full irrigation method often wastes water resources and causes low wue thus falling short of sustainable agricultural standards ding et al 2021 geries et al 2021 breaking free of conventional irrigation modes and adopting a new irrigation system is critical to ensuring green and efficient peanut production in the 1970s the australian researcher tatura introduced a new water saving irrigation method regulated deficit irrigation rdi dingre and gorantiwar 2020 he believed that when crops were under drought stress they were affected by genetic factors and growth hormones that regulated organ development altered the root to shoot ratio increased the harvestable plant parts and changed internal biochemical reactions ultimately achieving the goal of saving water while maintaining high yield and quality nikanorova et al 2016 in recent years this technology has shown positive effects on tomato wheat corn and other crops chand et al 2021 ali et al 2018 çakir and çebi 2010 roccuzzo et al 2014 for example when water deficit was 65 of field capacity the highest root dry matter could still be obtained at a later growth stage in cotton and this was beneficial for nutrient absorption and yield formation meng et al 2008 the main reason for implementing rdi is that it both stabilizes or even increases yield and also greatly improves crop water use efficiency which is important for cultivation in arid and semi arid areas at present research on the mechanisms by which rdi saves water increases yield and improves wue focuses primarily on four aspects 1 physiological activities related to crop yield have different responses to water in growing crops cell expansion responds most rapidly to water deficit and is the physiological process most susceptible to drought when the soil is dry the vegetative growth of crops stagnates first under suitable water deficit conditions fruit organic matter accumulation and effective yield are less affected hossain et al 2015 rdi can compensate or even overcompensate for previous water deficit by artificially controlling soil moisture to limit crop growth in the plant growth stage then fully supplying water in the water stress relief stage yang et al 2020 2 a decrease in soil moisture leads to a decrease in the water potential of crop leaves thereby regulating stomatal opening to better cope with drought crops tend to reduce transpiration while maintaining normal photosynthesis thereby improving instantaneous water use efficiency yin et al 2011 3 osmotic adjustment is an effective means by which crops compensate for adversity the ability to perform osmotic adjustment directly determines the compensation effect which depends mainly on proline soluble sugars and soluble protein accumulation bandurska et al 2017 furlan et al 2020 under drought many crops accumulate large amounts of proline that not only increase the solute concentration of the cytoplasm but can also substitute for water in related physiological processes during drought resistance at the same time proline and similar substances can be used as raw materials for the compensation effect on dry matter accumulation after rehydration dong et al 2019 an et al 2017 4 crops can often remember the initial stress and respond to secondary or multiple stresses and this kind of stress memory can improve the resistance ability from the physiological and biochemical level and help to improve the drought resistance of crop rdi is a kind of irrigation method involving multiple drought rehydration processes and its induced stress memory was helpful to improve the drought resistance of peanut thus ensuring peanut yield baldwin and schmelz 1996 liu et al 2016 qin and ci 2017 continuous regulated deficit irrigation crdi is an improved irrigation method based on rdi which can make use of the stress memory mechanism of crops and adopt the water deficit rewatering irrigation mode in multiple growth period to facilitate continuous regulation of crops and greatly improve the water use efficiency of crops few studies have examined rdi in peanut and most rdi studies have focused on a single growth period in this experiment the method of continuous regulated deficit irrigation crdi in the flower pegging stage and the pod setting stage was used specifically we aimed to clarify the eﬀect of crdi on peanut growth yield wue osmotic regulation substances leaf gas exchange parameters dry matter accumulation as well as the differences in drought resistance between the flower pegging stage and the pod setting stage driven by crdi the aims of our study were to explore crdi s water saving and yield increasing effects and characterize the

higher than that of h3j3 treatment respectively after rehydration the pro content of most treatment decreased rapidly but the pro content of h1j1 treatment was still at a high level and h1j1 treatment was 2 19 times and 3 53 times higher than that of h3j3 treatment respectively in 2017 and 2018 in 2018 the pro content of h1j1 treatment in the second drought was 29 69 lower than that of h1j1 treatment in the first drought this indicated that the drought resistance of peanut was improved by the first drought rehydration exercise in 2017 and 2018 the sp content of h1j1 treatment was 23 36 and 23 60 higher than that of h3j3 treatment respectively p 0 05 during rehydration the sp content did not decrease during the second drought the sp content continued to increase and h1j1 treatment was 87 32 higher than that of h3j3 treatment in 2017 p 0 05 in general sp showed a trend of continuous increase indicating that sp accumulated for a long time for drought resistance the interaction effect of crdi on ss content was not significant table 3 in both years the ss content of h1 treatment increased by 100 60 and 64 30 compared with that of h3 treatment respectively p 0 05 after rehydration the ss content of all treatments were no difference for the second drought the ss content of h1 treatment was 114 61 and 115 45 higher than that of h3 treatment respectively p 0 05 3 3 dry weight and root to shoot ratio crdi significantly increased the root dry weight and reduced the shoot dry weight table 4 in 2017 the root dry weight of h1j1 treatment at the pod setting stage and the pod filling stage was 52 19 and 51 51 higher than that of h3j3 treatment and the shoot dry weight was 23 15 and 24 12 lower than that of h3j3 treatment respectively p 0 05 in 2017 and 2018 the root to shoot ratio of h1j1 treatment was 109 26 and 70 77 higher than that of h3j3 treatment respectively p 0 05 fig 8 in conclusion severe crdi treatment increased peanut root to shoot ratio but inhibited dry matter accumulation of peanut shoot 3 4 yield and wue crdi had significant influence on yield and wue table 5 in both years the average total yield of h3j2 5794 66 kg ha 1 was the highest among all treatments and it was 82 53 higher compared with the h1j1 treatment there was no difference in yield among the h3j1 h3j2 and h2j2 treatments in both years with averages yield of 5687 65 5794 66 and 5535 54 kg ha 1 respectively the yield of h3j3 treatment was lower than that of the above three treatments the yield of h2j2 treatment was 72 25 and 74 01 higher than that of h1j1 treatment in 2017 and 2018 respectively p 0 05 in both years the wue of h2j2 treatment was the highest which was 44 16 and 45 03 higher than that of h3j3 p 0 05 respectively the h2j2 treatment had the higher yield and the highest wue which met the requirement of water saving and stable yield under the crdi system 3 5 correlation of each index the leaf iwue on the second and third day after rehydration was positively correlated with wue with the correlation coefficient of 0 57 and 0 75 respectively fig 9 there was a negative correlation between wue and root to shoot ratio in the pod setting stage and the pod filling stage with correlation coefficients of 0 52 and 0 66 respectively the three osmotic regulating substances were positively correlated with each other 4 discussion 4 1 influence of crdi on the root to shoot ratio the root system and the canopy are the basic structures of crop growth and their growth ratio is mainly affected by genetic factors nonetheless the expression of genetic characteristics is also affected by the growth environment in which water is a predominant factor wu et al 2020 here we found that crdi significantly increased the root dry matter of peanuts decreased the canopy dry matter and increased the root to shoot ratio consistent with the results of most crop water stress studies ma et al 2017 li et al 2018a 2018b there is a competition between root and shoot and water deficit affects the distribution ratio of dry matter among the root and shoot so that more nutrients are transferred to the roots the main function of the root system is the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil when the soil water environment is poor the development of the root system is prioritized and the roots continue exploring the soil to absorb more water and nutrients in order to cope with drought rejeth et al 2020 sushil et al 2019 this preferential development of the root system is also conducive to the absorption of nutrients and water during the rehydration stage thereby ensuring that the compensation effect occurs in the later period to achieve stable or even increased yields the main function of the canopy is to synthesize carbohydrates and reduced canopy development during drought at the same time a smaller canopy area can significantly reduce excessive transpiration in conclusion crdi enhances the water and nutrient absorption capacity of peanut by increasing the root to shoot ratio and limiting the excess growth of vegetative organs thereby optimizing the root to shoot structure saving water and increasing yield tarek et al 2017 wu et al 2019 in this study it was found that under crdi there was a negative correlation between root shoot ratio and wue which was consistent with xia s research on rdi in peanuts xia et al 2018 however contrary results showed that there was a positive correlation between the root to shoot ratio and wue ma et al 2010 this may be because in this study under the conditions of continuous water deficit longer stress cycle and severe water deficit the yield compensation was small and finally there was a negative correlation at the same time peanut pod yield is in the underground part its growth and development of nutrition source is not limited to canopy transfer related and the complex relationship with the root system still needs to be further studied 4 2 effects of crdi on leaf gas exchange parameters photosynthesis is a process by which green plants absorb light energy assimilate co2 and h2o produce organic substances and simultaneously release o2 it is an important aspect of plant physiological activity li et al 2019 transpiration is not only the main means by which plants respond to adversity and optimize their physiological state but also the driving force for the upward transportation of water and nutrients zahia et al 2017 here we concluded that water deficit significantly reduced the pn and tr of peanut leaves the greater the degree of stress the more significant the decline was which was consistent with a previous report li et al 2018a 2018b xia et al 2020 after rehydration the gas exchange capacity of leaves under mild and moderate water deficit treatment gradually recovered the photosynthesis and transpiration of peanut exposed to the h2j2 treatment over the continuous growth period showed some overcompensation effect on the third day after rehydration the pn was still clearly increasing this result indicated that moderate crdi regulation provided beneficial drought resistance acclimation for peanut after rehydration the gas exchange parameters of leaves from the severe water deficit treatment continued to decline indicating that excessive water deficit irreversibly damaged peanut leaves and was not conducive to peanut growth ma et al 2016 there was a quadratic relationship between gs and iwue and gs was negatively correlated with iwue to the left of the symmetry axis during the water deficit stages of crdi peanut leaf gs decreased significantly however crops often improve their iwue in response to drought because photosynthesis and transpiration have different sensitivities to water deficit transpiration is more sensitive than photosynthesis and under the same drought conditions transpiration is inhibited to a greater extent here the pn of peanut leaves under mild or moderate water deficit treatment was affected very little after the drought rehydration exercise tr decreased under water deficit but pn decreased to only a small extent leading to improvement in iwue li et al 2018a 2018b in the rehydration stage of crdi stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration recovered transpiration is more sensitive to soil moisture than photosynthesis and decreased on the second day after rehydration however photosynthetic compensation was clear in the continuous mild and moderate water deficit treatments after the drought rehydration exercise and both showed an increasing trend in this case the iwue was improved in general because of the different sensitivities of photosynthesis and transpiration to soil water status the iwue of leaves first decreased and then increased with increasing gs showing a quadratic relationship the iwue of leaves on the second and third day after rehydration were positively correlated with the wue of the final yield indicating that the higher the iwue the higher the wue of the final yield this indicates that appropriate water deficit treatment improves the wue of the final yield by increasing the iwue consistent with qin s report that improving the cumulative effect of iwue can improve crop water efficiency qin and ci 2017 4 3 effects of crdi on osmotic adjustment substances in peanut leaves the osmotic adjustment process is the most effective means of crop compensation for stress injury the strength of osmotic adjustment directly determines the degree of the compensation effect after the stress is removed noguera artiaga et al 2019 osmotic regulation is mainly determined by the contents of proline soluble protein and soluble sugar here we found that water deficit significantly increased proline content in peanut leaves and severe water deficit increased the proline content several fold after rehydration proline content returned to normal levels proline acts as a solute to increase the concentration of the intracellular fluid during drought thus regulating cell osmotic potential ghaffari et al 2021 karami et al 2017 during rehydration compensation proline is used as a nitrogenous compound to provide raw material for plant nitrogen compensation and participates in physiological and biochemical reactions during the second drought proline still accumulated rapidly but its content was lower than during the first drought indicating that peanut acclimated during the drought rehydration exercise in ways that increased its adaptability about facing drought fiasconaro et al 2019 the soluble protein content in peanut leaves increased during the drought rehydration drought process during the first drought water deficit significantly increased soluble protein content after rehydration the soluble protein content did not decrease significantly perhaps due to the slow hydrolysis of protein and leaf soluble protein content continued to increase during the second drought this is consistent with the results of guo s research in which soluble protein played a long term role in the osmotic regulation mechanisms of crops guo et al 2018 soluble sugars are small solute molecules induced by drought stress that not only maintain the osmotic regulation of cells but also participate in physiological repair processes after rehydration studies have shown that soluble sugars are combined with aba during signal conduction aba s main function is the regulation of stomatal aperture during drought in order to reduce excessive water consumption and maintain a high wue devireddy et al 2020 soluble sugars act quickly and their synthesis and degradation processes are relatively fast in this study we found that the relationship between water deficit in the continuous growth period and soluble sugar content was not significant although it was significant in the single growth period this indicates that soluble sugar responds rapidly to drought signaling it is produced quickly during drought to participate in osmotic regulation hydrolyzed rapidly during rehydration and produced rapidly again to participate in stress resistance during the second drought gao et al 2020 in general the response of soluble sugar to drought was not affected by the drought rehydration exercise there was a positive correlation among proline soluble sugar and soluble protein indicating that the three substances had a synergistic effect in coping with drought this is consistent with mousavi s conclusion that the response of osmotic substances during drought resistance is a comprehensive effect mousavi et al 2017 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to improve the water use efficiency wue and the water saving potential of peanut in arid areas through continuous regulated deficit irrigation the main conclusions were threefold 1 after severe water deficit and rehydration leaves were not able to resume normal photosynthesis but the compensation effect after moderate water stress and rehydration could greatly improve the instantaneous wue of peanut leaves 2 water deficit significantly increased the osmotic regulatory substances in peanut leaves and the proline content showed the greatest increase after the drought rehydration exercise the osmotic regulation mechanism permitted adaptation to drought 3 in both years the average total wue was highest in the h2j2 treatment 1 87 kg m 3 the h2j2 treatment improved the drought resistance of peanut in the drought rehydration exercise during the flower pegging stage at the pod setting stage after the drought resistance exercise the iwue continuously increased at the pod setting stage in the h2j2 treatment overall the h2j2 treatment can improve the wue of peanut without compromising peanut yield this treatment also facilitates water saving promotes stable yields and promotes the sustainable development of peanut declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9998,agricultural drought is generally defined as a deficit in soil moisture and can affect plant growth and crop yields accurate prediction of agricultural drought with sufficient lead time can aid agricultural planning and reduce losses in agricultural production in this study the meta gaussian model was employed to predict agricultural drought standardized soil moisture index or ssi during spring and summer in china based on the initial soil moisture conditions antecedent meteorological drought standardized precipitation index or spi and large scale drivers el niño southern oscillation or enso monthly precipitation and soil moisture data from global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas 2 0 were used to compute the meteorological and agricultural drought indicators the conditional distribution of agricultural drought given multiple predictors was used for the statistical prediction the autocorrelation of agricultural drought the correlation between meteorological drought and agricultural drought and the correlation between enso and agricultural drought were first evaluated to understand the predictors from soil moisture persistence drought propagation and large scale drivers we then employed the conditional distribution to predict agricultural drought over the period from 1948 to 2014 in which contributions of antecedent meteorological drought and large scale drivers to the prediction performance were evaluated results showed that the prediction method performed well in semi arid and sub humid regions during spring but did not perform well in humid regions during summer in addition the incorporation of enso provided useful predictability for long lead time prediction in certain regions with significant influence of enso the results obtained from this study can provide useful information for early agricultural drought warning across china keywords drought prediction agricultural drought drought propagation gldas 1 introduction drought is a slow onset phenomenon and is among the most destructive natural disasters causing huge economic losses mishra and singh 2010 cunha et al 2019 generally drought can be classified into four categories including meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomical drought wilhite and glantz 1985 among the different types of drought agricultural drought has immediate impacts on crop production martínez fernández et al 2016 in historical periods severe agricultural drought events have been shown to cause large damages to agriculture and social economy posing threats to food security and human society mishra and singh 2010 hao et al 2018 in addition agricultural drought has been shown to be a significant factor affecting social instability in certain politically unstable regions kelley et al 2015 due to the large impacts of agricultural drought reliable prediction of agricultural drought with sufficient lead time plays an important role in agricultural planning and management agricultural drought is commonly defined as a deficit in soil moisture that affects plant growth or crop yields huang et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2019 potopová et al 2020 hong et al 2021 a variety of soil moisture based indicators have been developed to measure agricultural drought mishra and singh 2011 hao et al 2018 such as crop moisture index cmi soil moisture percentile smp sheffield et al 2008 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao et al 2014 and soil water deficit index swdi martínez fernández et al 2016 due to the lack of observational networks soil moisture data simulated from hydrological models and remote sensing techniques have also been used to characterize agricultural drought li et al 2020a b zhang et al 2017b zhou et al 2021 because of the close association between meteorological drought and agricultural drought several drought indicators based on meteorological variables such as standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei have been used for assessing agricultural drought wu et al 2020 javed et al 2021 in addition vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi vegetation condition index vci and vegetation health index vhi have also been used to characterize agricultural drought wu et al 2015 cunha et al 2019 based on the different agricultural drought indicators mentioned above a multitude of statistical methods and dynamical methods have been developed for agricultural drought prediction hao et al 2018 the commonly used statistical methods for drought prediction include regression models artificial intelligence models conditional distribution models and markov chain models özger et al 2011 santos et al 2014 avilés et al 2015 hao et al 2016 these methods are mainly based on empirical relationships between the predictand i e drought indicators and the potential predictors barros and bowden 2008 sun et al 2012 compared with statistical methods dynamical methods are based on weather and climate forecast products with focus on the physical process of drought development yoon et al 2012 yuan et al 2013 dutra et al 2014b for example mo and lyon 2015 employed the north american multi model ensemble nmme to forecast the global spi at various timescales and suggested that improvements in climate models can lead to advances in drought prediction in recent decades statistical dynamical drought prediction has been developed to incorporate the prediction skill from both types of models wang et al 2017 hao et al 2018 understanding the mechanisms causing drought is a key step in selecting different indicators for agricultural drought prediction one important soil moisture property is its high persistence or memory spanning weeks to months wu and dickinson 2004 koster et al 2010 hao et al 2018 soil moisture persistence can provide useful information for drought prediction and has been commonly used as a reference prediction hao et al 2014 nicolai shaw et al 2016 in addition agricultural drought generally originates from precipitation deficits meteorological drought which lead to soil moisture deficits affecting crop growth li et al 2014 cunha et al 2019 han et al 2021 the propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought provides useful information for predicting agricultural drought based on different statistical or data driven models apurv et al 2017 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2015 li et al 2020b liu et al 2016 van loon 2015 zhang et al 2019 for example maity et al 2016 proposed a wavelet based approach for agricultural and hydrological drought prediction in the mahanadi river region based on meteorological drought status agricultural drought represented by soil moisture is also affected by common forcing factors such as el niño southern oscillation enso nicolai shaw et al 2016 ying et al 2016 tian et al 2018 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 these factors may affect precipitation and soil moisture variabilities in different regions or seasons for example enso is a key driver of precipitation and temperature variability in tropical and extra tropical regions mishra and singh 2011 hao et al 2018 it has been shown to exert various degrees of impacts on climate conditions in different sub regions of china feng et al 2011 ouyang et al 2014 li and zhao 2019 and may affect crop yields in some farming areas zhang et al 2015 guo et al 2021 as such climate indices representing these large scale modes of climate variability can also be used as predictors for drought prediction based on statistical approaches such as conditional distribution linear regression and machine learning approaches hao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 feng et al 2020 for example nicolai shaw et al 2016 employed large scale drivers to obtain long term prediction of soil moisture and showed that the use of large scale drivers increased the predictability of soil moisture the prediction performance of this approach relies on the selection of suitable climate indices that provide large scale forcing for the future development of hydroclimatic anomalies china is a drought prone country and severe drought events have struck china frequently in historical periods with devastating impacts on agriculture ecosystems and human society such as the drought events that occurred during 2008 2009 in northeast china and 2009 2010 in southwestern china zhang and yamaguchi 2014 huang et al 2019 extensive studies have been devoted to drought prediction in china based on different methods for example xu et al 2018 compared meteorological drought prediction in china using large scale climate signals and dynamical forecasts tian et al 2018 conducted agricultural drought prediction in the xiangjiang river basin by incorporating climate indices such as enso and western pacific subtropical high wpsh based on support vector regression models however most previous drought prediction studies in china have mainly focused on meteorological drought while agricultural drought prediction incorporating multiple predictors has been rather limited the objective of this study is to evaluate the agricultural drought prediction performance based on multiple predictors including the initial soil moisture condition representing persistence antecedent meteorological drought representing propagation from meteorological drought and antecedent enso representing large scale drivers to meet the need for high dimensional modeling the meta gaussian model was employed to model the joint distribution of the predictand and multiple predictors the performance of the agricultural drought prediction was then evaluated along with a quantification of the relative contributions of different predictors 2 data monthly precipitation and soil moisture data collected from 1948 to 2014 over china are obtained from global gridded datasets with 0 25 degree resolution provided by global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas 2 0 https disc gsfc nasa gov the spi based on monthly precipitation is used to define meteorological drought the root zone soil moisture plays a crucial role in crop growth and agricultural production and is used to define ssi as the agricultural drought indicator the gldas 2 0 dataset has been validated in different regions of china and the results showed that this dataset provided useful soil moisture simulations for drought analysis in china cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a li et al 2020b the enso phenomenon is represented by the nino3 4 index average sea surface temperature anomaly from 5 s to 5 n and from 170 w to 120 w which is obtained from the global climate observing system gcos https www esrl noaa gov psd enso in this study we only focus on drought that occurred during spring and summer from march to august this period is important for the growth of many crops in china during which drought prediction information is important for agricultural planning and management to further evaluate the effects of climatic conditions on the prediction performance the study area in china is divided into four climate regions huang et al 2021 including humid 800 mm sub humid 400 800 mm semi arid 200 400 mm and arid 0 200 mm regions based on 800 400 and 200 mm precipitation isohyets which are shown in fig s1 3 method 3 1 meta gaussian model the joint distribution e g copula or vine copula model is commonly used to model the dependence structures of multiple variables including drought indicators or properties feng et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2019 dai et al 2020 vergni et al 2020 the meta gaussian model can be used to construct the joint distribution of multiple hydroclimatic variables independently of the marginal distribution kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 this flexibility enables the model to construct joint and conditional distributions incorporating multivariate dependence structures for different applications including probabilistic drought prediction hao et al 2016 to apply the meta gaussian model the individual variable was first transformed to the standardized variables that can be expressed as z n 1 f with f denoting the marginal probability and n 1 denoting the inverse of the standard normal distribution function the empirical method based on the weibull plotting position formula was used to derive the marginal probability and then to transform the precipitation and soil moisture to spi and ssi hao and aghakouchak 2014 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 the time scale of spi and ssi was 1 month to facilitate the application of the meta gaussian model we also transformed nino3 4 to a standardized variable i e snino in a similar way to that applied for spi and ssi in a trivariate case with three standardized variables x 1 x 2 and x 3 the multivariate density function of the meta gaussian model can be expressed as follows wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 1 f x 1 x 2 x 3 1 2 π n 2 σ exp 1 2 x μ t σ 1 x μ where x is the vector x 1 x 2 x 3 t μ is the mean vector of each variable and is the covariance matrix with the dimension n 3 3 2 conditional distribution the conditional distribution is often used for drought prediction hao et al 2016 liu et al 2016 in this study the meta gaussian model was employed to predict agricultural drought by deriving the conditional distribution of ssi conditioned on the antecedent ssi spi and snino an important property of the meta gaussian model used in this study is that the form of the conditional distribution is explicit which is essentially a normal distribution kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 hao et al 2016 for example the 4 dimension conditional distribution model for predicting y i e ssi based on three predictors x 1 x 2 and x 3 x x 1 x 2 x 3 can then be expressed as wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 2 f y x 1 x 2 x 3 φ μ y x σ y x 3 μ y x μ y σ yx σ xx 1 x μ x 4 σ y x σ yy σ yx σ xx 1 σ xy where ф is the normal distribution function μ y x is the conditional mean and σ y x is the conditional covariance matrix μ x and μ y are the mean of x and y σ xx σ xy σ yx σ yy are the covariance matric of x and y the conditional mean of the conditional distribution is used as the predicted value for the l month lead prediction the prediction of ssi t l of lead time l can be derived from the conditional distribution shown in eq 2 given the antecedent values of multiple predictors here we denoted the 4 dimension model with three predictors ssi t spi t snino t as the full model or 4 d model and the model with two predictors ssi t and spi t as the trivariate model or 3 d model in our prediction model ssi t spi t and snino t represented the initial drought condition antecedent meteorological drought and large scale drivers respectively 3 3 leave one out cross validation we used the leave one out cross validation loocv wilks 2011 to assess the model performance for the period from 1948 to 2014 specifically for n groups of observations and predictors the meta gaussian model was repeatedly fitted n times with n 1 samples leaving one observation and its predictors out in each iteration then the omitted observation was predicted using the meta gaussian model with the parameters estimated from the remaining n 1 group samples using this procedure n predicted values for the period 1948 2014 were obtained 3 4 prediction measure to evaluate the prediction performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and root mean square error rmse were used in this study higher nse and lower rmse values indicate better prediction performance the nse and rmse can be calculated as follows legates and mccabe 1999 5 nse 1 i 1 n s i s o i 2 i 1 n s o i s o 2 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i s o i 2 where s i and s o i are the predicted and observed ssi for month or period i respectively s o is the mean observed ssi and n is the total number of predicted periods the nse value ranges from to 1 an nse value of 1 represents a perfect prediction and an nse value less than 0 represents unreliable prediction in addition a lower rmse value represents a better prediction we used a reference prediction to assess the prediction accuracy of the proposed method with multiple predictors commonly used reference prediction includes the climatological average persistence prediction and random prediction wilks 2011 yuan et al 2013 nicolai shaw et al 2016 in this study the reference prediction was defined as the prediction from the proposed method with only one predictor i e antecedent ssi 4 results 4 1 predictor evaluation before conducting the prediction we first evaluated the potential predictors in this study three predictors including the soil moisture meteorological drought and nino3 4 in antecedent periods were used for the drought prediction in this section we computed the autocorrelation of soil moisture the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation and the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent enso to evaluate the rationality of these predictors 4 1 1 autocorrelation of soil moisture the autocorrelation is a commonly used measure of persistence wilks 2011 the autocorrelation of soil moisture in the period from march to august at temporal lags of 1 4 months is shown in fig 1 this correlation is overall higher in spring than in summer and higher in non humid regions than in humid regions with an increased lag time the correlation decreases in most of the study area during spring the autocorrelation is high in the whole study area particularly in the arid semi arid and sub humid regions the high autocorrelation of soil moisture in arid and semi arid regions may be due to the low variability in precipitation in these regions this high persistence of soil moisture in dry climate regions is consistent with previous studies orth and seneviratne 2012 nicolai shaw et al 2016 notably the autocorrelation in the tibetan plateau and northeast china is relatively high in spring possibly due to the impact of snow cover specifically snow cover can effectively prevent the exchange of water between the atmosphere and soil surface contributing to the persistence of soil moisture sospedra alfonso and merryfield 2018 during summer the autocorrelation of soil moisture is relatively inconspicuous in humid regions likely due to the short residence time caused by intensive rainfall during summer in short the autocorrelation of soil moisture is affected by the seasons high in spring and low in summer and shows strong regional differences high in non humid regions 4 1 2 correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation indicates propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought which can be affected by meteorological forcing including precipitation and temperature or radiation evapotranspiration depending on the season e g snowmelt in spring and region e g arid and humid regions gevaert et al 2018 han et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 a deficit in precipitation leading to a meteorological drought may propagate into the soil and cause agricultural drought with different propagation time in different climate regions the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation from march to august at different lags is shown in fig 2 in each month this correlation is overall high for a lag of 1 month but decreases with an increased lag time unlike the autocorrelation of soil moisture the correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation is higher in summer than in spring during spring the correlation is relatively strong in humid regions e g southern regions likely due to the higher variability in precipitation i e soil moisture is sensitive to precipitation variability in these regions in addition this correlation is relatively low in the tibetan plateau and northeast china where soil moisture may be fed by snowmelt and precipitation in winter may have little influence on soil moisture for example in the tibetan plateau region both temperature and solar radiation are important factors that may affect agricultural drought by modulating evapotranspiration while in southern regions agricultural drought is more sensitive to precipitation zhou et al 2021 moreover spring is an important irrigation period in china and human water management may greatly affect the propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought chen et al 2020 during summer the lag 1 correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation is overall high in most parts of china because soil moisture is mostly fed by rainfall in summer and agricultural drought is generally driven by rainfall deficits yurekli and kurunc 2006 when the lag time is beyond 1 month the spatial correlation pattern is relatively low in most parts of china i e propagation time is comparatively short because soil moisture is more affected by recent precipitation these results indicate that antecedent meteorological drought can affect subsequent agricultural drought and thus may provide valuable information for 1 month lead prediction of agricultural drought 4 1 3 correlation between soil moisture and antecedent enso to demonstrate the influence of large scale drivers on agricultural drought we analyzed the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent nino3 4 in each month at different lags as shown in fig 3 this pattern is possibly related to the impact of enso on precipitation which then propagates to soil moisture the spatial distribution of the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent nino3 4 varies among different months for example a significant positive correlation is found in the southeastern coastal areas in spring which becomes weak in summer this is likely related to the strong impact of enso on precipitation during spring in southeastern china ouyang et al 2014 li and zhao 2019 the cross correlations between soil moisture and antecedent nino3 4 for lags of 2 4 months are still high in certain regions indicating the lagged impact of large scale drivers on agricultural drought i e enso affects precipitation and then soil moisture as shown for the cross correlation coefficients between precipitation and antecedent nino3 4 in fig s2 in conclusion the influence of enso on agricultural drought is confined to certain areas but has a long lag time this indicates that enso can provide useful information for long lead time prediction in certain regions 4 2 prediction performance the conditional distribution expressed in eq 2 was used for the 1 4 months lead prediction of ssi 2 4 months ahead prediction was considered to be long lead time prediction in this study in this section we first employed the full model to predict agricultural drought the prediction skill may come from the initial drought conditions propagation from meteorological drought or enso in the second step we employed the 3 d model without enso to reveal the impact of drought propagation by comparing the output with the reference prediction finally we compared the prediction obtained from the 4 d model with those obtained from the 3 d model to highlight the impact of enso on the prediction performance 4 2 1 comparisons with observations comparisons between observations and predictions from the 4 d model based on the nse and rmse are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively to demonstrate the differences in the prediction performance among different regions we also compute the average nse values based on the 4 d model in four climate regions i e humid sub humid semi arid and arid as shown in fig 6 these results indicate that the model performance is better in semi arid and sub humid regions than in arid and humid regions regarding the two seasons the prediction performance is overall better in spring than in summer and generally degrades with an increasing lead time from 1 to 4 months specifically during spring the performance is relatively good in semi arid and sub humid regions even for the long lead time prediction which is likely due to the high persistence of soil moisture however for humid regions over the same period the prediction performance is acceptable merely for the 1 month lead prediction and quickly worsens with increasing lead time i e from 2 month to 4 month lead time during summer the agricultural drought can be predicted relatively well for 1 month lead time except in certain areas in humid regions however when the lead time increases the prediction performance during summer becomes poor in most regions of china except for june in certain semi arid or sub humid regions the main reason for the good prediction performance in semi arid and sub humid regions and short lead time may be the high autocorrelation of soil moisture these results highlight that during spring the statistical method can provide useful prediction in most parts of china especially in semi arid and sub humid regions even for long lead prediction however during summer the prediction performance of this method is limited except for the 1 month lead time and is prone to degradation with an increasing lead time we speculate that the prediction skill over the reference prediction is affected by meteorological drought and large scale drivers in antecedent periods detailed analyses of their contributions are evaluated in the following sections 4 2 2 impact from drought propagation the impact from antecedent meteorological drought or drought propagation can be represented by comparisons between the 3 d model with antecedent ssi and antecedent spi as predictors and the reference prediction with antecedent ssi as the single predictor the differences in rmse between the prediction from the 3 d model and the reference prediction are shown in fig 7 indicating improved prediction performance over the reference prediction where the rmse is negative the 3 d model mainly shows a better performance than the reference prediction for 1 month lead prediction during spring the 3 d model prediction performs better than reference prediction in parts of humid regions for the 1 month lead prediction limited prediction improvements from antecedent meteorological drought are shown in arid semi arid and sub humid regions mainly due to the high persistence of soil moisture during summer the 3 d model prediction outperform the reference prediction over larger areas especially the 1 month lead prediction in august the reason for this result is that the persistence of soil moisture is low during summer and thus the soil moisture fluctuation is highly affected by precipitation variability these results indicate that the performance of 1 month lead prediction of agricultural drought can be improved with the use of antecedent meteorological drought as predictors however although the 3 d model performs better than the reference prediction in certain limited regions the improvement is not quite pronounced for lead time beyond one month fig s3 4 2 3 impact from enso in this section we discuss the long lead time prediction of agricultural drought driven by enso the impact of enso is highlighted based on the rmse differences between the 4 d model prediction with enso and the 3 d model prediction without enso as shown in fig 8 the prediction performance of the 4 d model is better than that of the 3 d model only in certain months with strong regional dependence for example a better performance is obtained in regions such as the southeast coast in march parts of xinjiang province in may and yunnan province in june compared with fig 3 these regions with better performance are generally consistent with those observed with high nino3 4 soil moisture correlations the agricultural drought prediction in regions influenced by enso generally shows better performance under long lead time the reason for this result is that enso provides useful predictive information for precipitation which then affects agricultural drought hao et al 2018 these results highlight that in regions with strong enso impacts on soil moisture the 4 d model provides improved prediction performance especially for long lead time prediction 5 discussions 5 1 importance of enso for long lead time prediction accurate prediction of agricultural drought of long lead time is critical for agricultural water planning and management as shown in fig 3 higher correlation between nino3 4 and soil moisture is obtained in certain regions and certain periods moreover the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture is lower at longer lead time especially in these regions this result indicates that for long lead time prediction of agricultural drought the antecedent meteorological drought does not provide useful predictive information however enso provides predictability for agricultural drought of long lead time in certain seasons and regions here we use a case study of prediction of the agricultural drought in june 2010 in yunnan province from the fall of 2009 to the spring of 2010 an extremely severe drought struck yunnan province leading to large agricultural and economic losses wang and meng 2013 the occurrences of dry wet events in southwest china were found to be closely related to enso cheng et al 2019 in our study a relatively high correlation between enso and soil moisture is obtained in yunnan in june as shown in fig 3 in this section we further demonstrate how the incorporation of enso improves the prediction of agricultural drought in yunnan province the observations and 1 month to 4 month lead predictions of ssi obtained with the 3 d model and 4 d model for june 2010 in yunnan are shown in fig 9 the 3 d model without enso does not predict this event well however the prediction from the 4 d model with enso as a predictor is relatively closer to the observation although the 3 d model and 4 d model give similar predictions of 1 month lead time with rmse of 0 77 and 0 78 respectively the 4 d model performs relatively better for prediction of longer lead time due to the incorporation of large scale drivers as the predictor for example the rmse of the 2 month lead prediction by the 4 d model is 0 71 lower than the rmse of 0 92 resulting from the 3 d model these results suggest that enso can provide useful early warning information for agricultural drought prediction especially at long lead time 5 2 limitation and extension several limitations exist in this study due to the lack of long term observational data of soil moisture the soil moisture data in this study were obtained from model simulations and can be subject to uncertainties in the structure and parameter estimation of the model leading to uncertainties in the predictor analysis and prediction performance other soil moisture products based on remote sensing provide useful alternatives to define agricultural drought for prediction purposes zhou et al 2021 furthermore other factors can be used as predictors to improve the prediction for example the north atlantic oscillation nao is an important large scale driver with profound impacts on climate variability in northern china which may be useful for drought prediction sun and wang 2012 wu et al 2021 in addition high temperature anomalies can increase evaporation and thus exacerbate soil moisture deficits or agricultural drought which may further induce high temperature or the soil moisture temperature feedback seneviratne et al 2010 as a result the incorporation of the temperature or evaporation may also improve the performance of drought prediction hao et al 2018 the conditional distribution model considered in this study relies on the statistical relationships between the predictand and predictors other methods such as multiple linear regressions can also be used to establish these relationships for prediction purposes for example raziei et al 2012 used multiple linear regression to assess the predictability of atmospheric circulation on precipitation and found that particular circulation types were potential predictors of dry wet events in iran advanced statistical techniques such as artificial intelligence or machine learning can also be used to model the complex relationships between agricultural drought indicators and multiple predictors mishra and singh 2011 santos et al 2014 hao et al 2018 as stated before these statistical prediction methods generally fall short in capturing complicated physical processes in climate and hydrological systems therefore further improvements to the drought prediction performance may be achieved by using dynamical forecast products from nmme or european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf hao et al 2018 comparisons of prediction skill between the conditional distribution model and other aforementioned models in different regions and seasons may aid in the improvements of agricultural drought prediction in china these possibilities will be evaluated in our future studies 6 conclusions in this study the meta gaussian model was employed for the prediction of agricultural drought based on the initial drought conditions propagation from meteorological drought and large scale drivers we chose the antecedent ssi spi and nino3 4 as predictors to predict agricultural drought during spring and summer in china the following conclusions were obtained from this study 1 the autocorrelation of soil moisture was relatively high during spring and in non humid regions the correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation for a lag of 1 month was overall high in most parts of china during summer and in parts of china during spring the correlation between soil moisture and the antecedent nino3 4 showed that enso in antecedent periods played an important role in affecting soil moisture in certain regions with long lag time 2 the proposed method with all three predictors provided useful prediction information for the semi arid and sub humid regions of china during spring and performed better in spring than in summer 3 the 3 d model with the antecedent ssi and antecedent spi as predictors provided useful information for 1 month lead drought prediction compared to the reference prediction using the antecedent ssi as the single predictor however for long lead time prediction the improvement in prediction performance resulting from the incorporation of the antecedent meteorological drought was limited 4 compared to the 3 d model the 4 d model incorporating enso as a predictor provided useful information for regions with significant impacts of enso especially for long lead time prediction 5 as a case study the proposed method was applied to predict the ssi of yunnan province in june 2010 the results showed that the full model with enso as a predictor provided predictions that were closer to the observations better than those from the 3 d model especially for long lead time prediction overall the results obtained from this study showed that the incorporation of initial drought conditions propagation from meteorological drought and large scale drivers is important for agricultural drought prediction in china the conditional distribution approach presented in this study can be extended to predict other

9998,agricultural drought is generally defined as a deficit in soil moisture and can affect plant growth and crop yields accurate prediction of agricultural drought with sufficient lead time can aid agricultural planning and reduce losses in agricultural production in this study the meta gaussian model was employed to predict agricultural drought standardized soil moisture index or ssi during spring and summer in china based on the initial soil moisture conditions antecedent meteorological drought standardized precipitation index or spi and large scale drivers el niño southern oscillation or enso monthly precipitation and soil moisture data from global land data assimilation system version 2 gldas 2 0 were used to compute the meteorological and agricultural drought indicators the conditional distribution of agricultural drought given multiple predictors was used for the statistical prediction the autocorrelation of agricultural drought the correlation between meteorological drought and agricultural drought and the correlation between enso and agricultural drought were first evaluated to understand the predictors from soil moisture persistence drought propagation and large scale drivers we then employed the conditional distribution to predict agricultural drought over the period from 1948 to 2014 in which contributions of antecedent meteorological drought and large scale drivers to the prediction performance were evaluated results showed that the prediction method performed well in semi arid and sub humid regions during spring but did not perform well in humid regions during summer in addition the incorporation of enso provided useful predictability for long lead time prediction in certain regions with significant influence of enso the results obtained from this study can provide useful information for early agricultural drought warning across china keywords drought prediction agricultural drought drought propagation gldas 1 introduction drought is a slow onset phenomenon and is among the most destructive natural disasters causing huge economic losses mishra and singh 2010 cunha et al 2019 generally drought can be classified into four categories including meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomical drought wilhite and glantz 1985 among the different types of drought agricultural drought has immediate impacts on crop production martínez fernández et al 2016 in historical periods severe agricultural drought events have been shown to cause large damages to agriculture and social economy posing threats to food security and human society mishra and singh 2010 hao et al 2018 in addition agricultural drought has been shown to be a significant factor affecting social instability in certain politically unstable regions kelley et al 2015 due to the large impacts of agricultural drought reliable prediction of agricultural drought with sufficient lead time plays an important role in agricultural planning and management agricultural drought is commonly defined as a deficit in soil moisture that affects plant growth or crop yields huang et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2019 potopová et al 2020 hong et al 2021 a variety of soil moisture based indicators have been developed to measure agricultural drought mishra and singh 2011 hao et al 2018 such as crop moisture index cmi soil moisture percentile smp sheffield et al 2008 standardized soil moisture index ssi hao et al 2014 and soil water deficit index swdi martínez fernández et al 2016 due to the lack of observational networks soil moisture data simulated from hydrological models and remote sensing techniques have also been used to characterize agricultural drought li et al 2020a b zhang et al 2017b zhou et al 2021 because of the close association between meteorological drought and agricultural drought several drought indicators based on meteorological variables such as standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei have been used for assessing agricultural drought wu et al 2020 javed et al 2021 in addition vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi vegetation condition index vci and vegetation health index vhi have also been used to characterize agricultural drought wu et al 2015 cunha et al 2019 based on the different agricultural drought indicators mentioned above a multitude of statistical methods and dynamical methods have been developed for agricultural drought prediction hao et al 2018 the commonly used statistical methods for drought prediction include regression models artificial intelligence models conditional distribution models and markov chain models özger et al 2011 santos et al 2014 avilés et al 2015 hao et al 2016 these methods are mainly based on empirical relationships between the predictand i e drought indicators and the potential predictors barros and bowden 2008 sun et al 2012 compared with statistical methods dynamical methods are based on weather and climate forecast products with focus on the physical process of drought development yoon et al 2012 yuan et al 2013 dutra et al 2014b for example mo and lyon 2015 employed the north american multi model ensemble nmme to forecast the global spi at various timescales and suggested that improvements in climate models can lead to advances in drought prediction in recent decades statistical dynamical drought prediction has been developed to incorporate the prediction skill from both types of models wang et al 2017 hao et al 2018 understanding the mechanisms causing drought is a key step in selecting different indicators for agricultural drought prediction one important soil moisture property is its high persistence or memory spanning weeks to months wu and dickinson 2004 koster et al 2010 hao et al 2018 soil moisture persistence can provide useful information for drought prediction and has been commonly used as a reference prediction hao et al 2014 nicolai shaw et al 2016 in addition agricultural drought generally originates from precipitation deficits meteorological drought which lead to soil moisture deficits affecting crop growth li et al 2014 cunha et al 2019 han et al 2021 the propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought provides useful information for predicting agricultural drought based on different statistical or data driven models apurv et al 2017 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2015 li et al 2020b liu et al 2016 van loon 2015 zhang et al 2019 for example maity et al 2016 proposed a wavelet based approach for agricultural and hydrological drought prediction in the mahanadi river region based on meteorological drought status agricultural drought represented by soil moisture is also affected by common forcing factors such as el niño southern oscillation enso nicolai shaw et al 2016 ying et al 2016 tian et al 2018 vazifehkhah and kahya 2019 these factors may affect precipitation and soil moisture variabilities in different regions or seasons for example enso is a key driver of precipitation and temperature variability in tropical and extra tropical regions mishra and singh 2011 hao et al 2018 it has been shown to exert various degrees of impacts on climate conditions in different sub regions of china feng et al 2011 ouyang et al 2014 li and zhao 2019 and may affect crop yields in some farming areas zhang et al 2015 guo et al 2021 as such climate indices representing these large scale modes of climate variability can also be used as predictors for drought prediction based on statistical approaches such as conditional distribution linear regression and machine learning approaches hao et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 feng et al 2020 for example nicolai shaw et al 2016 employed large scale drivers to obtain long term prediction of soil moisture and showed that the use of large scale drivers increased the predictability of soil moisture the prediction performance of this approach relies on the selection of suitable climate indices that provide large scale forcing for the future development of hydroclimatic anomalies china is a drought prone country and severe drought events have struck china frequently in historical periods with devastating impacts on agriculture ecosystems and human society such as the drought events that occurred during 2008 2009 in northeast china and 2009 2010 in southwestern china zhang and yamaguchi 2014 huang et al 2019 extensive studies have been devoted to drought prediction in china based on different methods for example xu et al 2018 compared meteorological drought prediction in china using large scale climate signals and dynamical forecasts tian et al 2018 conducted agricultural drought prediction in the xiangjiang river basin by incorporating climate indices such as enso and western pacific subtropical high wpsh based on support vector regression models however most previous drought prediction studies in china have mainly focused on meteorological drought while agricultural drought prediction incorporating multiple predictors has been rather limited the objective of this study is to evaluate the agricultural drought prediction performance based on multiple predictors including the initial soil moisture condition representing persistence antecedent meteorological drought representing propagation from meteorological drought and antecedent enso representing large scale drivers to meet the need for high dimensional modeling the meta gaussian model was employed to model the joint distribution of the predictand and multiple predictors the performance of the agricultural drought prediction was then evaluated along with a quantification of the relative contributions of different predictors 2 data monthly precipitation and soil moisture data collected from 1948 to 2014 over china are obtained from global gridded datasets with 0 25 degree resolution provided by global

role in crop growth and agricultural production and is used to define ssi as the agricultural drought indicator the gldas 2 0 dataset has been validated in different regions of china and the results showed that this dataset provided useful soil moisture simulations for drought analysis in china cui et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a li et al 2020b the enso phenomenon is represented by the nino3 4 index average sea surface temperature anomaly from 5 s to 5 n and from 170 w to 120 w which is obtained from the global climate observing system gcos https www esrl noaa gov psd enso in this study we only focus on drought that occurred during spring and summer from march to august this period is important for the growth of many crops in china during which drought prediction information is important for agricultural planning and management to further evaluate the effects of climatic conditions on the prediction performance the study area in china is divided into four climate regions huang et al 2021 including humid 800 mm sub humid 400 800 mm semi arid 200 400 mm and arid 0 200 mm regions based on 800 400 and 200 mm precipitation isohyets which are shown in fig s1 3 method 3 1 meta gaussian model the joint distribution e g copula or vine copula model is commonly used to model the dependence structures of multiple variables including drought indicators or properties feng et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2019 dai et al 2020 vergni et al 2020 the meta gaussian model can be used to construct the joint distribution of multiple hydroclimatic variables independently of the marginal distribution kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 this flexibility enables the model to construct joint and conditional distributions incorporating multivariate dependence structures for different applications including probabilistic drought prediction hao et al 2016 to apply the meta gaussian model the individual variable was first transformed to the standardized variables that can be expressed as z n 1 f with f denoting the marginal probability and n 1 denoting the inverse of the standard normal distribution function the empirical method based on the weibull plotting position formula was used to derive the marginal probability and then to transform the precipitation and soil moisture to spi and ssi hao and aghakouchak 2014 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 the time scale of spi and ssi was 1 month to facilitate the application of the meta gaussian model we also transformed nino3 4 to a standardized variable i e snino in a similar way to that applied for spi and ssi in a trivariate case with three standardized variables x 1 x 2 and x 3 the multivariate density function of the meta gaussian model can be expressed as follows wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 1 f x 1 x 2 x 3 1 2 π n 2 σ exp 1 2 x μ t σ 1 x μ where x is the vector x 1 x 2 x 3 t μ is the mean vector of each variable and is the covariance matrix with the dimension n 3 3 2 conditional distribution the conditional distribution is often used for drought prediction hao et al 2016 liu et al 2016 in this study the meta gaussian model was employed to predict agricultural drought by deriving the conditional distribution of ssi conditioned on the antecedent ssi spi and snino an important property of the meta gaussian model used in this study is that the form of the conditional distribution is explicit which is essentially a normal distribution kelly and krzysztofowicz 1997 hao et al 2016 for example the 4 dimension conditional distribution model for predicting y i e ssi based on three predictors x 1 x 2 and x 3 x x 1 x 2 x 3 can then be expressed as wilks 2011 hao et al 2016 2 f y x 1 x 2 x 3 φ μ y x σ y x 3 μ y x μ y σ yx σ xx 1 x μ x 4 σ y x σ yy σ yx σ xx 1 σ xy where ф is the normal distribution function μ y x is the conditional mean and σ y x is the conditional covariance matrix μ x and μ y are the mean of x and y σ xx σ xy σ yx σ yy are the covariance matric of x and y the conditional mean of the conditional distribution is used as the predicted value for the l month lead prediction the prediction of ssi t l of lead time l can be derived from the conditional distribution shown in eq 2 given the antecedent values of multiple predictors here we denoted the 4 dimension model with three predictors ssi t spi t snino t as the full model or 4 d model and the model with two predictors ssi t and spi t as the trivariate model or 3 d model in our prediction model ssi t spi t and snino t represented the initial drought condition antecedent meteorological drought and large scale drivers respectively 3 3 leave one out cross validation we used the leave one out cross validation loocv wilks 2011 to assess the model performance for the period from 1948 to 2014 specifically for n groups of observations and predictors the meta gaussian model was repeatedly fitted n times with n 1 samples leaving one observation and its predictors out in each iteration then the omitted observation was predicted using the meta gaussian model with the parameters estimated from the remaining n 1 group samples using this procedure n predicted values for the period 1948 2014 were obtained 3 4 prediction measure to evaluate the prediction performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and root mean square error rmse were used in this study higher nse and lower rmse values indicate better prediction performance the nse and rmse can be calculated as follows legates and mccabe 1999 5 nse 1 i 1 n s i s o i 2 i 1 n s o i s o 2 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i s o i 2 where s i and s o i are the predicted and observed ssi for month or period i respectively s o is the mean observed ssi and n is the total number of predicted periods the nse value ranges from to 1 an nse value of 1 represents a perfect prediction and an nse value less than 0 represents unreliable prediction in addition a lower rmse value represents a better prediction we used a reference prediction to assess the prediction accuracy of the proposed method with multiple predictors commonly used reference prediction includes the climatological average persistence prediction and random prediction wilks 2011 yuan et al 2013 nicolai shaw et al 2016 in this study the reference prediction was defined as the prediction from the proposed method with only one predictor i e antecedent ssi 4 results 4 1 predictor evaluation before conducting the prediction we first evaluated the potential predictors in this study three predictors including the soil moisture meteorological drought and nino3 4 in antecedent periods were used for the drought prediction in this section we computed the autocorrelation of soil moisture the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation and the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent enso to evaluate the rationality of these predictors 4 1 1 autocorrelation of soil moisture the autocorrelation is a commonly used measure of persistence wilks 2011 the autocorrelation of soil moisture in the period from march to august at temporal lags of 1 4 months is shown in fig 1 this correlation is overall higher in spring than in summer and higher in non humid regions than in humid regions with an increased lag time the correlation decreases in most of the study area during spring the autocorrelation is high in the whole study area particularly in the arid semi arid and sub humid regions the high autocorrelation of soil moisture in arid and semi arid regions may be due to the low variability in precipitation in these regions this high persistence of soil moisture in dry climate regions is consistent with previous studies orth and seneviratne 2012 nicolai shaw et al 2016 notably the autocorrelation in the tibetan plateau and northeast china is relatively high in spring possibly due to the impact of snow cover specifically snow cover can effectively prevent the exchange of water between the atmosphere and soil surface contributing to the persistence of soil moisture sospedra alfonso and merryfield 2018 during summer the autocorrelation of soil moisture is relatively inconspicuous in humid regions likely due to the short residence time caused by intensive rainfall during summer in short the autocorrelation of soil moisture is affected by the seasons high in spring and low in summer and shows strong regional differences high in non humid regions 4 1 2 correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation indicates propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought which can be affected by meteorological forcing including precipitation and temperature or radiation evapotranspiration depending on the season e g snowmelt in spring and region e g arid and humid regions gevaert et al 2018 han et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 a deficit in precipitation leading to a meteorological drought may propagate into the soil and cause agricultural drought with different propagation time in different climate regions the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation from march to august at different lags is shown in fig 2 in each month this correlation is overall high for a lag of 1 month but decreases with an increased lag time unlike the autocorrelation of soil moisture the correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation is higher in summer than in spring during spring the correlation is relatively strong in humid regions e g southern regions likely due to the higher variability in precipitation i e soil moisture is sensitive to precipitation variability in these regions in addition this correlation is relatively low in the tibetan plateau and northeast china where soil moisture may be fed by snowmelt and precipitation in winter may have little influence on soil moisture for example in the tibetan plateau region both temperature and solar radiation are important factors that may affect agricultural drought by modulating evapotranspiration while in southern regions agricultural drought is more sensitive to precipitation zhou et al 2021 moreover spring is an important irrigation period in china and human water management may greatly affect the propagation from meteorological drought to agricultural drought chen et al 2020 during summer the lag 1 correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation is overall high in most parts of china because soil moisture is mostly fed by rainfall in summer and agricultural drought is generally driven by rainfall deficits yurekli and kurunc 2006 when the lag time is beyond 1 month the spatial correlation pattern is relatively low in most parts of china i e propagation time is comparatively short because soil moisture is more affected by recent precipitation these results indicate that antecedent meteorological drought can affect subsequent agricultural drought and thus may provide valuable information for 1 month lead prediction of agricultural drought 4 1 3 correlation between soil moisture and antecedent enso to demonstrate the influence of large scale drivers on agricultural drought we analyzed the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent nino3 4 in each month at different lags as shown in fig 3 this pattern is possibly related to the impact of enso on precipitation which then propagates to soil moisture the spatial distribution of the cross correlation between soil moisture and antecedent nino3 4 varies among different months for example a significant positive correlation is found in the southeastern coastal areas in spring which becomes weak in summer this is likely related to the strong impact of enso on precipitation during spring in southeastern china ouyang et al 2014 li and zhao 2019 the cross correlations between soil moisture and antecedent nino3 4 for lags of 2 4 months are still high in certain regions indicating the lagged impact of large scale drivers on agricultural drought i e enso affects precipitation and then soil moisture as shown for the cross correlation coefficients between precipitation and antecedent nino3 4 in fig s2 in conclusion the influence of enso on agricultural drought is confined to certain areas but has a long lag time this indicates that enso can provide useful information for long lead time prediction in certain regions 4 2 prediction performance the conditional distribution expressed in eq 2 was used for the 1 4 months lead prediction of ssi 2 4 months ahead prediction was considered to be long lead time prediction in this study in this section we first employed the full model to predict agricultural drought the prediction skill may come from the initial drought conditions propagation from meteorological drought or enso in the second step we employed the 3 d model without enso to reveal the impact of drought propagation by comparing the output with the reference prediction finally we compared the prediction obtained from the 4 d model with those obtained from the 3 d model to highlight the impact of enso on the prediction performance 4 2 1 comparisons with observations comparisons between observations and predictions from the 4 d model based on the nse and rmse are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively to demonstrate the differences in the prediction performance among different regions we also compute the average nse values based on the 4 d model in four climate regions i e humid sub humid semi arid and arid as shown in fig 6 these results indicate that the model performance is better in semi arid and sub humid regions than in arid and humid regions regarding the two seasons the prediction performance is overall better in spring than in summer and generally degrades with an increasing lead time from 1 to 4 months specifically during spring the performance is relatively good in semi arid and sub humid regions even for the long lead time prediction which is likely due to the high persistence of soil moisture however for humid regions over the same period the prediction performance is acceptable merely for the 1 month lead prediction and quickly worsens with increasing lead time i e from 2 month to 4 month lead time during summer the agricultural drought can be predicted relatively well for 1 month lead time except in certain areas in humid regions however when the lead time increases the prediction performance during summer becomes poor in most regions of china except for june in certain semi arid or sub humid regions the main reason for the good prediction performance in semi arid and sub humid regions and short lead time may be the high autocorrelation of soil moisture these results highlight that during spring the statistical method can provide useful prediction in most parts of china especially in semi arid and sub humid regions even for long lead prediction however during summer the prediction performance of this method is limited except for the 1 month lead time and is prone to degradation with an increasing lead time we speculate that the prediction skill over the reference prediction is affected by meteorological drought and large scale drivers in antecedent periods detailed analyses of their contributions are evaluated in the following sections 4 2 2 impact from drought propagation the impact from antecedent meteorological drought or drought propagation can be represented by comparisons between the 3 d model with antecedent ssi and antecedent spi as predictors and the reference prediction with antecedent ssi as the single predictor the differences in rmse between the prediction from the 3 d model and the reference prediction are shown in fig 7 indicating improved prediction performance over the reference prediction where the rmse is negative the 3 d model mainly shows a better performance than the reference prediction for 1 month lead prediction during spring the 3 d model prediction performs better than reference prediction in parts of humid regions for the 1 month lead prediction limited prediction improvements from antecedent meteorological drought are shown in arid semi arid and sub humid regions mainly due to the high persistence of soil moisture during summer the 3 d model prediction outperform the reference prediction over larger areas especially the 1 month lead prediction in august the reason for this result is that the persistence of soil moisture is low during summer and thus the soil moisture fluctuation is highly affected by precipitation variability these results indicate that the performance of 1 month lead prediction of agricultural drought can be improved with the use of antecedent meteorological drought as predictors however although the 3 d model performs better than the reference prediction in certain limited regions the improvement is not quite pronounced for lead time beyond one month fig s3 4 2 3 impact from enso in this section we discuss the long lead time prediction of agricultural drought driven by enso the impact of enso is highlighted based on the rmse differences between the 4 d model prediction with enso and the 3 d model prediction without enso as shown in fig 8 the prediction performance of the 4 d model is better than that of the 3 d model only in certain months with strong regional dependence for example a better performance is obtained in regions such as the southeast coast in march parts of xinjiang province in may and yunnan province in june compared with fig 3 these regions with better performance are generally consistent with those observed with high nino3 4 soil moisture correlations the agricultural drought prediction in regions influenced by enso generally shows better performance under long lead time the reason for this result is that enso provides useful predictive information for precipitation which then affects agricultural drought hao et al 2018 these results highlight that in regions with strong enso impacts on soil moisture the 4 d model provides improved prediction performance especially for long lead time prediction 5 discussions 5 1 importance of enso for long lead time prediction accurate prediction of agricultural drought of long lead time is critical for agricultural water planning and management as shown in fig 3 higher correlation between nino3 4 and soil moisture is obtained in certain regions and certain periods moreover the correlation between precipitation and soil moisture is lower at longer lead time especially in these regions this result indicates that for long lead time prediction of agricultural drought the antecedent meteorological drought does not provide useful predictive information however enso provides predictability for agricultural drought of long lead time in certain seasons and regions here we use a case study of prediction of the agricultural drought in june 2010 in yunnan province from the fall of 2009 to the spring of 2010 an extremely severe drought struck yunnan province leading to large agricultural and economic losses wang and meng 2013 the occurrences of dry wet events in southwest china were found to be closely related to enso cheng et al 2019 in our study a relatively high correlation between enso and soil moisture is obtained in yunnan in june as shown in fig 3 in this section we further demonstrate how the incorporation of enso improves the prediction of agricultural drought in yunnan province the observations and 1 month to 4 month lead predictions of ssi obtained with the 3 d model and 4 d model for june 2010 in yunnan are shown in fig 9 the 3 d model without enso does not predict this event well however the prediction from the 4 d model with enso as a predictor is relatively closer to the observation although the 3 d model and 4 d model give similar predictions of 1 month lead time with rmse of 0 77 and 0 78 respectively the 4 d model performs relatively better for prediction of longer lead time due to the incorporation of large scale drivers as the predictor for example the rmse of the 2 month lead prediction by the 4 d model is 0 71 lower than the rmse of 0 92 resulting from the 3 d model these results suggest that enso can provide useful early warning information for agricultural drought prediction especially at long lead time 5 2 limitation and extension several limitations exist in this study due to the lack of long term observational data of soil moisture the soil moisture data in this study were obtained from model simulations and can be subject to uncertainties in the structure and parameter estimation of the model leading to uncertainties in the predictor analysis and prediction performance other soil moisture products based on remote sensing provide useful alternatives to define agricultural drought for prediction purposes zhou et al 2021 furthermore other factors can be used as predictors to improve the prediction for example the north atlantic oscillation nao is an important large scale driver with profound impacts on climate variability in northern china which may be useful for drought prediction sun and wang 2012 wu et al 2021 in addition high temperature anomalies can increase evaporation and thus exacerbate soil moisture deficits or agricultural drought which may further induce high temperature or the soil moisture temperature feedback seneviratne et al 2010 as a result the incorporation of the temperature or evaporation may also improve the performance of drought prediction hao et al 2018 the conditional distribution model considered in this study relies on the statistical relationships between the predictand and predictors other methods such as multiple linear regressions can also be used to establish these relationships for prediction purposes for example raziei et al 2012 used multiple linear regression to assess the predictability of atmospheric circulation on precipitation and found that particular circulation types were potential predictors of dry wet events in iran advanced statistical techniques such as artificial intelligence or machine learning can also be used to model the complex relationships between agricultural drought indicators and multiple predictors mishra and singh 2011 santos et al 2014 hao et al 2018 as stated before these statistical prediction methods generally fall short in capturing complicated physical processes in climate and hydrological systems therefore further improvements to the drought prediction performance may be achieved by using dynamical forecast products from nmme or european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf hao et al 2018 comparisons of prediction skill between the conditional distribution model and other aforementioned models in different regions and seasons may aid in the improvements of agricultural drought prediction in china these possibilities will be evaluated in our future studies 6 conclusions in this study the meta gaussian model was employed for the prediction of agricultural drought based on the initial drought conditions propagation from meteorological drought and large scale drivers we chose the antecedent ssi spi and nino3 4 as predictors to predict agricultural drought during spring and summer in china the following conclusions were obtained from this study 1 the autocorrelation of soil moisture was relatively high during spring and in non humid regions the correlation between soil moisture and antecedent precipitation for a lag of 1 month was overall high in most parts of china during summer and in parts of china during spring the correlation between soil moisture and the antecedent nino3 4 showed that enso in antecedent periods played an important role in affecting soil moisture in certain regions with long lag time 2 the proposed method with all three predictors provided useful prediction information for the semi arid and sub humid regions of china during spring and performed better in spring than in summer 3 the 3 d model with the antecedent ssi and antecedent spi as predictors provided useful information for 1 month lead drought prediction compared to the reference prediction using the antecedent ssi as the single predictor however for long lead time prediction the improvement in prediction performance resulting from the incorporation of the antecedent meteorological drought was limited 4 compared to the 3 d model the 4 d model incorporating enso as a predictor provided useful information for regions with significant impacts of enso especially for long lead time prediction 5 as a case study the proposed method was applied to predict the ssi of yunnan province in june 2010 the results showed that the full model with enso as a predictor provided predictions that were closer to the observations better than those from the 3 d model especially for long lead time prediction overall the results obtained from this study showed that the incorporation of initial drought conditions propagation from meteorological drought and large scale drivers is important for agricultural drought prediction in china the conditional distribution approach presented in this study can be extended to predict other types of drought e g hot droughts the results of this study are useful for providing early warning information of agricultural drought across different regions declaration of competing interest the

9999,the control of soil nutrient loss to lighten non point source pollution to water body and improve soil fertility is a global problem biochar application to soil is widely considered as an effective method to improve soil fertility and reduce nutrient loss however the effect of biochar application to barren karst yellow soil in global karst regions on the loss of nitrogen n and phosphorous p and the growth of oil peony an important woody oil crop remains unclear we conducted the indoor leaching experiments in site observation of the n and p loss with surface runoff under three types of rains and the comparative experiment of oil peony growth when the different amount of biochar was applied to karst yellow soil the results indicated that soil ph total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp available n and available p contents in the soil increased with an increase of biochar application under indoor simulation but the loss of leaching solution decreased 2 kg m2 biochar application caused the least loss of tp tn nitrate nitrogen nn and ammonia nitrogen an with the leaching solution compared with 0 4 and 6 kg m2 application the rapid and slow attenuation of p and n concentrations respectively were observed in karst yellow soil with biochar application the n p change in leaching solution showed a parabolic form under natural rainfall 4 kg m2 biochar application had the best effect on a reduction of tp tn and an loss in surface runoff rainstorm caused an and tp large loss but rainstorm heavy and moderate rains all easily caused nn large loss 4 kg m2 biochar application had the best effect on the growth of plant height and base diameter leaf spad and n and p content in organs in the fertilized area but 6 kg m2 in the unfertilized area biochar application effectively improved the fertility of karst yellow soil reduced the loss of n and p with vertical leaching and surface runoff and promoted the growth of oil peony this study provides new knowledge for

development keywords biochar karst yellow soil soil nutrients oil peony nutrient leaching loss 1 introduction as a new type of the carbonization of agricultural and forestry waste biochar has recently received a widespread attention zimmerman 2010 blanco canqui 2017 owing to the high organic carbon content porosity and alkalinity biochar has a strong capacity to absorb pollutants and improves soil structure thus widely applied to the restoration of soil environment dong et al 2017 yao et al 2017 the application of biochar to soil can significantly improve soil physical and chemical properties to prevent from soil degradation jeffery et al 2011 brassard et al 2016 weber and quicker 2018 concretely biochar application reduces soil bulk density increases soil porosity and improves 3 phase soil composition and thus increasing soil water holding capacity burrell et al 2016 cong et al 2020 biochar can also promote soil conservation and reduce nutrient loss faloye et al 2019 guo et al 2021 all these effects of biochar application to soil can improve soil fertility to increase crop productivity igalavithana et al 2015 cong et al 2020 wang et al 2016a 2016b oil peony is a general term for the species of peony whose oil yield in seeds is 20 oil peony has the high yield of seeds and the oil yield rate from the seeds ranges between 24 and 38 higher than the seeds of all other oil crops liu 2015 in recent years many researchers used the different methods to determine the composition of nutrients in the oil produced with the seeds of oil peony wang et al 2012 shi et al 2014 they found that the oil contained rich protein minerals vitamins and unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and linolenic acid of which linolenic acid even accounted for 42 therefore the oil of peony seeds is considered the best edible oil hao et al 2019 as a perennial shrub oil peony is not only used as a woody oil crop but also often used as an effective tree species for greening barren hills and slopes reducing soil erosion and beautifying environment because the oil peony can strongly resists to drought barrenness and coldness zhou et al 2009 liu 2015 oil peony can even be planted in saline alkali and gobi desert for sand fixation in the northwest of china besides planted in parks for a view gao et al 2013 chen et al 2013 yang et al 2018 considering that biochar and oil peony have so many excellent qualities oil peony has been selected as an important oil crop and will be planted in large quantities in the regions where karst yellow soil covers to meet the demand for edible oil in china karst yellow soil is a soil of worldwide distribution dai et al 2018 jiang et al 2006 2018 the soil is highly acidic and viscous in texture and has low nutrient content and low water holding capacity therefore biochar has been considered as soil conditioner to apply to the soil guo et al 2017 however it remains unclear whether there are significant effects of biochar application on n and p loss from karst yellow soil and growths of oil peony the conduction of the study can provide knowledge for application of biochar to karst yellow soil and plantation of oil peony for diverse goals luo et al 2020 therefore we collected karst yellow soil to make soil columns to which different amount of biochar was added and conducted the indoor leaching experiment with distilled water the simulated experiment was conducted to clarify the effects of biochar application to karst yellow soil on the volume of percolation water and nutrient loss with the percolation water and analyze underlying mechanisms meanwhile we applied the different amount of biochar and fertilizers and planted oil peonies to an experimental cropland covered by karst yellow soil the runoff troughs were used to collect surface runoff under different types of natural rainfall to test the loss of n and p with the surface runoff from the experimental cropland the in site experiment was conducted to reveal the effects of biochar application to karst yellow soil covered by oil peony on the volume of surface runoff and nutrient loss with the surface runoff and analyze underlying mechanisms some botanical indices were measured to assess the effects of biochar and fertilizer application on the growth of peony we assume that 1 too much biochar application will increase the loss of n and p in soil and be not necessarily beneficial to plant growth when the amount of biochar application to soil is higher than a threshold value the loss of n and p will begin to increase and some indices of plant growth will begin to decrease with increasing biochar application 2 the loss of n and p from karst yellow soil with different levels of biochar application will undergo an explosive growth with the intense disturbance of rainstorm to the soil biochar fertilizer compound body the purpose of this research is to solve the following scientific problems after different amounts of biochar application 1 the effects of different amount of biochar application to soil columns on the volume of percolation water and the loss of n and p under the conditions of indoor simulation rainfall 2 the effects of different level of biochar application to croplands on surface runoff and nutrient element loss in karst yellow soil under different natural rainfall intensities 3 the effects of the combined application of biochar and fertilizer and the single application of biochar to croplands on the growth of oil peony based on the measurement of botanical indices 2 materials and methods 2 1 indoor

dry quartz sand with a thickness of 3 cm and a particle size of 1 2 mm which was soaked overnight with 2 0 mol l h2so4 and washed with distilled water was spread on the filter paper in the column subsequently two layers of filter paper were used to cover the quartz sand a layer of vaseline was daubed on the inner wall of the cylindrical tube in order to reduce the edge effect of soil column laird et al 2010 the soil that would be filled to columns for simulation leaching experiment was designed as 4 levels of biochar application b0 0 kg m2 b2 2 kg m2 b4 4 kg m2 b6 6 kg m2 the corresponding application amount of the 4 levels to each column was 0 g 13 35 g 26 67 g and 40 01 g and each level included 3 repetitions this biochar application rate was chosen because it is widely used in other studies and is generally considered to be an intermediate level of biochar application batschauer 1998 joseph et al 2007 jeffery et al 2011 jones et al 2012 cui et al 2013 li et al 2020

loss from different levels of biochar application under rainstorm was fb6 fb4 ck fb2 fb0 the loss from fb6 was significantly reduced by 29 60 compared with fb0 nn loss under heavy rain was the same as rainstorm however nn loss under moderate rain was fb6 fb4 fb2 ck fb0 the loss from fb6 was significantly reduced by 45 77 compared with fb0 indicating that the more biochar application the lower nn loss on the whole 6 kg m2 biochar application had the best effect on the control of nn loss in three types of rain events 3 3 soil nutrients and oil peony growth after biochar application 3 3 1 soil nutrients soil ph at the end of the test ranged from 5 17 to 5 48 table 5 which was still weakly acidic but increased with an increasing application of biochar except soil tn there was a significant difference in five indices of soil nutrients among different levels of biochar application in the fertilized and unfertilized areas anova in supplementary file 3f similarly with increase biochar application in the two areas soil tn tp available n and available p also increased except tn there were also significant differences among the different levels of biochar application in the unfertilized area tp content in soil at b2 b4 and b6 increased by 11 17 and 30 respectively compared with b0 available n content at b4 and b6 increased by 10 and 17 respectively compared with b0 available p content at b2 b4 and b6 increased by 18 23 and 39 respectively compared with b0 in the fertilization area the contents of tp available n and available p in soil at fb4 and fb6 were higher than fb0 compared with fb0 tp in soil at fb6 increased by 35 available n increased by 21 and available p increased by 45 the application of biochar obviously improved soil fertility 3 3 2 plant height the plant height of peony in each level in the fertilized area was higher than unfertilized area but there was not a significant difference fig 7 anova in supplementary file 3g in the unfertilized zone the plant height increased with the increase of biochar dosage from april onward with an increase of 10 43 8 31 and 4 07 at b6 b4 and b2 respectively compared with b0 in the fertilized area the plant height was fb4 fb6 fb2 fb0 plant height at fb4 fb6 and fb2 increased by 7 21 5 06 and 2 98 respectively compared to fb0 3 3 3 plant basal diameter in the unfertilized area plant basal diameter increased with an increase of biochar application however plant basal diameter did not show significantly different among these levels of biochar application fig 8 anova in supplementary file 3h in the fertilized area the basal diameter of oil peony was fb4 fb6 fb2 fb0 and the index at fb4 increased by 4 95 compared with fb0 however plant basal diameter did not also show significantly different among these levels of biochar application comparatively there was a significant difference in plant basal diameter between the unfertilized and fertilized areas 3 3 4 chlorophyll content the spad values of leaves in the unfertilized area increased with an increase of biochar application at the stages of plant growth but after june the index decreased fig 9 the spad values of leaves showed significantly different among different levels of biochar application fig 9 anova in supplementary file 3i in the fertilization area the spad value of leaves increased with an increase of biochar application from in april to june but after june the spad of leaves at fb0 and fb2 decreased however the spad of leaves at fb4 and fb6 maintained at a high level after it had decreased a bit the spad values of leaves at fb4 and fb6 in august and september were far larger than other levels of biochar application 3 3 5 organ n and p content biochar application increased the n and p content in the roots stems and leaves of oil peony in both fertilized and unfertilized areas table 6 in the fertilized area with an increase of biochar application the n content in the roots stems and leaves of oil peony was fb4 fb6 fb2 fb0 but the p content in each organ of peony was fb6 fb4 fb2 fb0 the n content in these organs was significantly different among the four levels of biochar application but the p content not anova in supplementary file 3j on the whole the n and p content in three organs at the four levels of biochar application in the fertilized area was higher than that at the same levels of biochar application in the unfertilized area 4 discussion 4 1 effects of biochar on soil nutrients and n p leaching under indoor simulation soil ph has a great impact on soil fertility and is one of the important indicators reflecting soil properties schulz et al 2014 the ph of karst yellow soil increased from 5 08 to 5 70 5 94 after different amounts of biochar application biochar contains rich ca2 k and mg2 after biochar has been applied to soil these basic ions exchange h and al3 in soil and consequently increase soil ph mchenry 2011 van zwieten et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 biochar application also increased tn tp available n and available p concentrations in karst yellow soil biochar contains a large amount of n and p after the application of different amounts of biochar tn in the soil increased from 1 58 to 1 71 g kg and the tp increased from 0 74 to 1 03 g kg due to the special microporous structure and high specific surface area of biochar ammonium nitrate and phosphate ions can be easily adsorb by biochar thereby reducing the loss of n and p and increasing the nutrient concentration in the soil ippolito et al 2012 randolph et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 the special structure of biochar also enables to improve soil porosity and increase soil water holding capacity with biochar application and consequently decreases the leaching losses of water from soil kuo et al 2020 karthik et al 2020 however we found that only when a small amount of biochar was applied the leaching loss of n and p showed a decrease in indoor modeling too much biochar application caused a high leaching loss of p and n from soil 2 kg m2 biochar application was a threshold with the best effect on the reduction of tp tn an and nn leaching loss in indoor modeling therefore the study validates our assumption i e when the amount of biochar application is higher than a threshold value the loss of p and n from soil will begin to increase with increasing biochar application previous study indicated that the saturation of soil p could cause a large amount of p leached into groundwater and the loss amount of p was dependent on the soil p saturation and the amount of p applied vander molen et al 1998 per kg biochar applied to karst yellow soil itself contained 1 09 g p which was equal to 105 kg hm2 p therefore more biochar application easily caused the saturation of p in the soil and increased the leaching loss of p the threshold of biochar application is also 2 kg m2 for the least leaching loss of tn nn and an a small amount of biochar application to soil can help adsorb n to soil biochar complex and reduce the loss of n however too much biochar application to soil can not only cause the saturation of soil n but also increase the porosity of soil and cause organic n to be more easily mineralized into inorganic n and increase the leaching of inorganic n from soil xing et al 2011 concretely an increase of oxygen in soil induced by biochar application creates the favorable living conditions for ammonifying and nitrifying bacteria and increases the number of these bacteria and the ammoniation and nitrification reaction rates consequently generating more an and nn production and loss from organic matter decomposition luo et al 2006 ruser et al 2006 we further found that the ratio of tn an and nn concentration to tp concentration in the leaching solution from all treatments of biochar application showed a parabolic form across different groups of leaching experiments the change of the ratio of n to p concentration in the leaching solution reflects the asynchrony of the n and p release from soil smith et al 1998 in subtropical karst regions there are many lakes accepting leaching solution from karst yellow soil ye et al 2015 cyanobacteria generally account for 50 80 of total phytoplankton biovolume and affect eutrophication in these lakes havens 2003 non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria dominate under the conditions of the high and low n p ratio respectively havens 2003 therefore the parabolic ratio of tn an and nn concentration to tp in the leaching solution from karst yellow soil with biochar application potentially regulates the bloom of non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria in water body during a summer 4 2 effect of biochar application on the loss of n p under natural rainfall biochar application reduced surface runoff in karst yellow soil and surface runoff continually decreased with an increase of biochar application biochar has rich pores large specific surface area and high surface charge density and thus good water adsorption capacity blanco canqui 2019 after being applied to soil biochar can significantly improve soil structure increase soil porosity and soil water storage and consequently reduce runoff loss water is the main carrier of soil nutrient and rainfall intensity is a key factor leading to the loss of soil n and p cohen ofri et al 2006 when the increase of rainfall intensity leads to more surface runoff the loss of n and p in surface runoff certainly continues to increase fraser et al 1999 liang et al 2015 therefore the loss of n and p from all plots with biochar application under rainstorm was far larger than heavy rain and moderate rain the loss of n and p under heavy rain was also about two times higher than moderate rain our results indicate that increasing biochar application can significantly reduce the loss of n and p in surface runoff from karst yellow soil under different rainfall intensity and the decrease of nn is most significant biochar contains abundant oxygen containing functional groups knowles et al 2011 the property makes biochar have good ion exchange adsorption capacity and can effectively adsorb soluble n and p such as an nn and phosphate ion in soil and decrease these ions loss wang et al 2017 high ratio of biochar addition can adsorb nitrate and weaken nitrification in the soil further reducing soil nn concentration and leading to a decrease of the nn loss with runoff liu 2015 li et al 2018 yuan et al 2016 in addition the co application of fertilizer and biochar can improve soil structure and promote the growth of plant root systems and increase the n utilization rate of plants consequently decreasing the loss of n and p liu et al 2017 pratiwi et al 2016 however too much biochar application increased the loss of n and p in the study therefore the optimal biochar application to decrease the loss of tn an and tp in karst yellow soil is 4 kg m2 the value is larger than 2 kg m2 obtained from the modeling experiments of soil columns this is because the amount of fertilizer application was larger in soil columns than the cropland in the study therefore the amount of fertilizer application can be properly decreased under the co application of fertilizer and biochar we found that rainstorm caused the large loss of an from karst yellow soil which was similar with nn but the loss of an was far smaller than nn under heavy rain and moderate rain the previous study indicated that the n leaching loss was mainly nn and an only accounted for a small proportion ma et al 2015 wang and zhou 2013 soil particles mainly adsorb an which causes the leaching loss of nn to be larger than an with rainfall runoff ji et al 2011 sun et al 2018 these studies explain the low contents of an in runoff under heavy and moderate rains in the study however the good adsorption of biochar and soil particles to an was disturbed with the scouring of large raindrops and surface runoff under rainstorm leading to high an loss similarly the loss of tp under rainstorm was also far larger than that under heavy rain and moderate rain dissolved p and particulate p are the main forms of p loss with runoff wang et al 2016a 2016b huang et al 2018 biochar can adsorb dissolved p and precipitate particulate p to reduce mobility of p in runoff and soil solution ye et al 2015 li and wei 2016 therefore the loss of p with runoff decreased with increasing biochar application under different rainfall in the study rainstorm often causes a large amount of surface runoff to increase the mobility of different forms of p cui et al 2013 han et al 2016 biochar applied to croplands is also scoured by rainstorm runoff to increase the loss of p gundale and deluca 2006 hong and li 2011 thus the flux of tp loss in kart yellow soil under rainstorm was several times more than other rainfall 4 3 effect of biochar application on the growth of oil peony the combined application of fertilizer and biochar had a better effect on plant growth oil peony is suitable to grow in loose air permeable well drained soil with a ph value of 6 5 8 0 however karst yellow soil is acid soil with high cohesiveness luo et al 2020 biochar application to karst yellow soil just made up for the defects of the soil in physical and chemical properties and provided suitable growth conditions for the oil peony liang et al 2006 therefore the growth of oil peony was improved significantly however when no fertilizer was applied the optimal amount of application biochar was 6 kg m2 for plant growth when fertilizer was applied the optimal amount was 4 kg m2 the combination of biochar and fertilizer in application can reduce the amount of fertilizer application too much application of biochar such as 6 kg m2 under the co application of fertilizer and biochar conversely inhibits the plant growth of oil peony as other plants steiner et al 2008 too much application of biochar may lead to n fixation to biochar which reduces the available n in soil and limits the absorption of available n by plants resulting in a decline of plant growth lone et al 2015 the spad value of plant leaves is often used to reflect leaf n nutrient status and photosynthetic capacity wang et al 2016a 2016b sun et al 2016 biochar application could increase the spad value of leaves in oil peony during the test period the spad values of the peony leaves at all levels of biochar application showed a trend of increasing firstly and then stabilizing it may be due to the high c n ratio of biochar at the last stage to limit the growth of plants biederman and stanley harpole 2013 cao and harris 2010 however after july the spad value of leaves in oil peony in the fertilized plots with biochar application was far larger than the unfertilized plots with biochar application especially the unfertilized plots without biochar application therefore the co application of fertilizer and biochar is very effective to the growth of oil peony liang et al 2006 biochar can promote the absorption of plants to soil nutrients due to the improvement of soil environment jiang et al 2017 lehmann et al 2006 after biochar is applied to soil it can promote a conversion of p from the fixed to available state in the soil and directly increase the available p concentration steiner et al 2008 meanwhile after high temperature pyrolysis the compound containing p in biochar was activated and transformed into dissolved p that can be easily absorbed and utilized by crops liu et al 2019 therefore in the study whether fertilizers were applied or not to soil p concentration in the roots stems and leaves of oil peony continually increased with an increase of biochar application however n content in the roots stems and leaves of oil peony was not largest at the highest levels of biochar application with fertilization van zwieten et al 2010 found that the mixing application of biochar and chemical fertilizers to acidic soils really increased the uptake of n by crops but too much biochar application increased c n ratio of soil resulting in a decrease in soil available n and in turn reduced the absorption of n by plants biochar application truly promotes the n cycle and increases the soluble n in soil covington and sackett 1992 gundale and deluca 2007 however many studies including ours indicate that the combined application of medium level biochar and fertilizer has the best effect on several indices of plant growth 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 in the indoor simulation experiment soil ph tn available nitrogen tp and available phosphorus contents all increase with the increase of the amount of biochar application but the volume of the leaching solution decreases the cumulative leaching loss of tn tp an and nn was significantly reduced by 13 57 26 09 13 9 and 29 79 when 2 kg m2 biochar was applied to soil a small amount of biochar application can effectively reduce the nutrient leaching loss in karst yellow soil change in n p in leaching solution regularly collected from soil with biochar application shows a parabolic form 2 under natural rainfall increasing biochar application reduces surface runoff and the loss of n and p but excessive application conversely increases the loss rainstorm can cause a large loss of an tp and nn but the loss of an and tp is far smaller than nn under heavy and moderate rain 4 kg m2 biochar application has a better effect on reducing tn tp and an in surface runoff while 6 kg m2 biochar application has a better effect on reducing nn 3 the combined application of fertilizer and biochar has a better effect on the growth and nutrient absorption of oil peony than a single biochar application the optimal amount of biochar application is 4 kg m2 moderate biochar application is conductive to both control the loss of p and n in karst yellow soil under different rains and obtain the largest growths of plant height and base diameter the largest spad value of leaves and the highest n and p accumulation in organs too much biochar application is unfavorable to the control of the loss of n and p and plant growth the study reveals the levels of biochar and fertilizer application to karst yellow soil for the effective control of nutrient loss to concurrently promote the growth of oil peony the knowledge found in the study can be directly applied to agricultural water management in karst yellow soil credit authorship contribution statement cong zhang formal analysis data curation writing

9999,the control of soil nutrient loss to lighten non point source pollution to water body and improve soil fertility is a global problem biochar application to soil is widely considered as an effective method to improve soil fertility and reduce nutrient loss however the effect of biochar application to barren karst yellow soil in global karst regions on the loss of nitrogen n and phosphorous p and the growth of oil peony an important woody oil crop remains unclear we conducted the indoor leaching experiments in site observation of the n and p loss with surface runoff under three types of rains and the comparative experiment of oil peony growth when the different amount of biochar was applied to karst yellow soil the results indicated that soil ph total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp available n and available p contents in the soil increased with an increase of biochar application under indoor simulation but the loss of leaching solution decreased 2 kg m2 biochar application caused the least loss of tp tn nitrate nitrogen nn and ammonia nitrogen an with the leaching solution compared with 0 4 and 6 kg m2 application the rapid and slow attenuation of p and n concentrations respectively were observed in karst yellow soil with biochar application the n p change in leaching solution showed a parabolic form under natural rainfall 4 kg m2 biochar application had the best effect on a reduction of tp tn and an loss in surface runoff rainstorm caused an and tp large loss but rainstorm heavy and moderate rains all easily caused nn large loss 4 kg m2 biochar application had the best effect on the growth of plant height and base diameter leaf spad and n and p content in organs in the fertilized area but 6 kg m2 in the unfertilized area biochar application effectively improved the fertility of karst yellow soil reduced the loss of n and p with vertical leaching and surface runoff and promoted the growth of oil peony this study provides new knowledge for

development keywords biochar karst yellow soil soil nutrients oil peony nutrient leaching loss 1 introduction as a new type of the carbonization of agricultural and forestry waste biochar has recently received a widespread attention zimmerman 2010 blanco canqui 2017 owing to the high organic carbon content porosity and alkalinity biochar has a strong capacity to absorb pollutants and improves soil structure thus widely applied to the restoration of soil environment dong et al 2017 yao et al 2017 the application of biochar to soil can significantly improve soil physical and chemical properties to prevent from soil degradation jeffery et al 2011 brassard et al 2016 weber and quicker 2018 concretely biochar application reduces soil bulk density increases soil porosity and improves 3 phase soil composition and thus increasing soil water holding capacity burrell et al 2016 cong et al 2020 biochar can also promote soil conservation and reduce nutrient loss faloye et al 2019 guo et al 2021 all these effects of biochar application to soil can improve soil fertility to increase crop productivity igalavithana et al 2015 cong et al 2020 wang et al 2016a 2016b oil peony is a general term for the species of peony whose oil yield in seeds is 20 oil peony has the high yield of seeds and the oil yield rate from the seeds ranges between 24 and 38 higher than the seeds of all other oil crops liu 2015 in recent years many researchers used the different methods to determine the composition of nutrients in the oil produced with the seeds of oil peony wang et al 2012 shi et al 2014 they found that the oil contained rich protein minerals vitamins and unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and linolenic acid of which linolenic acid even accounted for 42 therefore the oil of peony seeds is considered the best edible oil hao et al 2019 as a perennial shrub oil peony is not only used as a woody oil crop but also often used as an effective tree species for greening barren hills and slopes reducing soil erosion and beautifying environment because the oil peony can strongly resists to drought barrenness and coldness zhou et al 2009 liu 2015 oil peony can even be planted in saline alkali and gobi desert for sand fixation in the northwest of china besides planted in parks for a view gao et al 2013 chen et al 2013 yang et al 2018 considering that biochar and oil peony have so many excellent qualities oil peony has been selected as an important oil crop and will be planted in large quantities in the regions where karst yellow soil covers to meet the demand for edible oil in china karst yellow soil is a soil of worldwide distribution dai et al 2018 jiang et al 2006 2018 the soil is highly acidic and viscous in texture and has low nutrient content and low water holding capacity therefore biochar has been considered as soil conditioner to apply to the soil guo et al 2017 however it remains unclear whether there are significant effects of biochar application on n and p loss from karst yellow soil and growths of oil peony the conduction of the study can provide knowledge for application of biochar to karst yellow soil and plantation of oil peony for diverse goals luo et al 2020 therefore we collected karst yellow soil to make soil columns to which different amount of biochar was added and conducted the indoor leaching experiment with distilled water the simulated experiment was conducted to clarify the effects of biochar application to karst yellow soil on the volume of percolation water and nutrient loss with the percolation water and analyze underlying mechanisms meanwhile we applied the different amount of biochar and fertilizers and planted oil peonies to an experimental cropland covered by karst yellow soil the runoff troughs were used to collect surface runoff under different types of natural rainfall to test the loss of n and p with the surface runoff from the experimental cropland the in site experiment was conducted to reveal the effects of biochar application to karst yellow soil covered by oil peony on the volume of surface runoff and nutrient loss with the surface runoff and analyze underlying mechanisms some botanical indices were measured to assess the effects of biochar and fertilizer application on the growth of peony we assume that 1 too much biochar application will increase the loss of n and p in soil and be not necessarily beneficial to plant growth when the amount of biochar application to soil is higher than a threshold value the loss of n and p will begin to increase and some indices of plant growth will begin to decrease with increasing biochar application 2 the loss of n and p from karst yellow soil with different levels of biochar application will undergo an explosive growth with the intense disturbance of rainstorm to the soil biochar fertilizer compound body the purpose of this research is to solve the following scientific problems after different amounts of biochar application 1 the effects of different amount of biochar application to soil columns on the volume of percolation water and the loss of n and p under the conditions of indoor simulation rainfall 2 the effects of different level of biochar application to croplands on surface runoff and nutrient element loss in karst yellow soil under different natural rainfall intensities 3 the effects of the combined application of biochar and fertilizer and the single application of biochar to croplands on the growth of oil peony based on the measurement of botanical indices 2 materials and methods 2 1 indoor simulation leaching experiment 2 1 1 experimental materials soil for simulating experiments was collected from the farming layer 0 20 cm of the guizhou university teaching and experimental base 106 69 e 26 58 n in guizhou china the visible plant rhizomes and sand were removed from collected soil after air dry the soil was sieved through a 2 mm mesh sieve and stored for use the basic properties of soil were as follows ph 5 08 tn 1 68 g kg tp 0 97 g kg available p 20 2 mg kg available n 86 8 mg kg biochar used in the research was purchased from shenyang longtai biological engineering co ltd which was made from pure rice husk by pyrolytic at 450 under anoxic conditions and was ground and sieved through a 1 mm sieve for use the ph of the tested biochar was 7 86 biochar water ratio was 1 30 the mass fraction of carbon was 45 59 and tn and tp content were 7 59 g kg and 1 09 g kg respectively the fertilizers used in the experiment were urea superphosphate and potassium chloride and their n p and k contents were 46 12 and 60 respectively 2 1 2 experiment design soil column for leaching experiment was made with a polyethylene cylindrical tube with an inner diameter of 10 cm and a height of 30 cm fig 1 laird et al 2010 troy et al 2014 akhtar et al 2015 the bottom of the tube was firstly sealed with sterile gauze and then the gauze was covered by three layers of filter paper a layer of dry quartz sand with a thickness of 3 cm and a particle size of 1 2 mm which was soaked overnight with 2 0 mol l h2so4 and washed with distilled water was spread on the filter paper in the column subsequently two layers of filter paper were used to cover the quartz sand a layer of vaseline was daubed on the inner wall of the cylindrical tube in order to reduce the edge effect of soil column laird et al 2010 the soil that would be filled to columns for simulation leaching experiment was designed as 4 levels of biochar application b0 0 kg m2 b2 2 kg m2 b4 4 kg m2 b6 6 kg m2 the corresponding application amount of the 4 levels to each column was 0 g 13 35 g 26 67 g and 40 01 g and each level included 3 repetitions this biochar application rate was chosen because it is widely used in other studies and is generally considered to be an intermediate level of biochar application batschauer 1998 joseph et al 2007 jeffery et al 2011 jones et al 2012 cui et al 2013 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 concretely 1 5 kg of dry soil 0 4087 g urea 0 6833 g super phosphate and 0 0783 g potassium chloride corresponding to n 240 kg hm2 p 105 kg hm2 and k 60 kg hm2 for each soil column total 12 columns the amount of fertilizer added was consistent with the level of fertilization used by local farmers then dry soil biochar and fertilizer were completely mixed according to the proportion of design and filled to soil column finally a filter paper was cushioned on the soil at the top of soil column to prevent from disturbance to surface soil during the leaching process of water 2 1 3 leaching operation after the soil column had been filled in order to make the fertilizers and biochar to fully combine with soil 78 5 ml distilled water equivalent to 10 mm rainfall was used to leach the soil in each soil column every day until the leaching solution flow out from the bottom of the soil column then the leaching experiment was conducted once every 6 days a total of 3 times with 157 ml distilled water equivalent to 20 mm rainfall next distilled water was increased to 235 5 ml equal to 30 mm rainfall for one leaching experiment every 10 days a total of 3 times finally distilled water was increased to 314 ml equal to 40 mm rainfall to conduct the last leaching experiment after 10 days all leaching experiments lasted 63 days we used different amount of distilled water to regularly leach soil so that the characteristics of main rainfalls during a summer in the karst regions of china was simulated fig 2 the contents of tn tp nn and an in the leaching solutions collected were respectively determined by alkaline potassium per sulfate digestion uv spectrophotometry potassium per sulfate digestion ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry uv spectrophotometry and nessler reagent spectrophotometric determination li et al 2019 after the experiment soil ph tn tp available n and available p in the soil of soil columns were determined with potentiometer method semi micro kjeldahl method molybdenum antimony anti colorimetric method alkaline hydrolysis distillation and sodium bicarbonate molybdenum antimony anti colorimetric method mao 2020 2 2 in site experiment of n and p loss under natural rainfall 2 2 1 experiment design a cropland was selected for in site experiment in the guizhou university teaching and experimental base supplementary file 1 a total of 15 plots including 12 plots with fertilization and biochar application and three control checks ck without fertilization and biochar application were set up in the cropland the slope of the cropland was 5 degrees the size of each plot was 120 cm 140 cm biochar was applied to the soil of the plough layer in october 2016 so that soil and biochar were thoroughly mixed the levels of biochar application were set to fb0 0 kg m2 fb2 2 kg m2 fb4 4 kg m2 and fb6 6 kg m2 each level included 3 replicates fertilizers applied to each plot were counted according to the following amount per unit area n 180 kg hm2 p 65 kg hm2 and k 40 kg hm2 which were lower than the amount of conventional fertilization the plots were randomly ranged on the cropland supplementary file 1 then the seedlings of oil peony were planted with a row spacing of 20 cm 50 cm there were 12 seedlings of oil peony at each plot peony seedlings were purchased from shandong zhongda peony cooperative the seedlings were uniform in size and age the average height of the seedlings was 27 2 cm and the diameter was 0 4 cm during the experiment crop management and pest control were regularly operated 2 2 2 test of n and p loss with surface runoff surface runoff was collected with a portable collector of surface runoff pcsr wang 2020 which consisted of two parts a runoff collecting trough and a draft tube fig 3 the runoff collecting trough is a frame with 50 cm length 15 cm width and 10 cm height and has no upper and lower bottom surfaces there was a circular draft tube with a length of 5 cm and a diameter of 2 cm at the center of one end of the collecting trough one end of the tube was welded to the wall of the collecting trough and the other end could be connected with a soft plastic pipe the runoff collecting trough was pressed to 5 cm deep in soil at the representative sites within plots before surface runoff was collected the draft tube was linked with the soft plastic pipe that was inserted into a runoff bottle the collection of surface runoff was conducted from june to september in 2017 during the time a total of 65 rains occurred including 45 light rains 12 moderate rains 4 heavy rains and 4 rainstorms and the rainfall reached 815 3 mm accounted for 69 93 of the annual rainfall we totally collected 12 times of effective surface runoff for each plot supplementary file 2 after the volume of collected runoff had been measured about 500 ml fully mixed runoff sample by shaking was sampled transferred to a plastic bottle and stored at 4 c the determination of tn tp an and nn in the runoff samples was completed using the method above within 24 h 2 3 growth experiment of oil peony 2 3 1 experimental design the experimental lands were designed as two sections one was the fertilization area and the other the non fertilization area fig 4 each area contained 4 levels of biochar application 0 kg m2 2 kg m2 4 kg m2 and 6 kg m2 and 3 repetitions was set for each level biochar was applied to the soil of the cultivated layer in october 2016 so that soil and biochar were thoroughly mixed a total of plots was 24 for the two sections of experiment the size of each plot was 120 cm 140 cm fertilizers were evenly applied to the fertilization area according to the following amount per unit area n 180 kg hm2 p 65 kg hm2 and k 40 kg hm2

nutrients soil ph at the end of the test ranged from 5 17 to 5 48 table 5 which was still weakly acidic but increased with an increasing application of biochar except soil tn there was a significant difference in five indices of soil nutrients among different levels of biochar application in the fertilized and unfertilized areas anova in supplementary file 3f similarly with increase biochar application in the two areas soil tn tp available n and available p also increased except tn there were also significant differences among the different levels of biochar application in the unfertilized area tp content in soil at b2 b4 and b6 increased by 11 17 and 30 respectively compared with b0 available n content at b4 and b6 increased by 10 and 17 respectively compared with b0 available p content at b2 b4 and b6 increased by 18 23 and 39 respectively compared with b0 in the fertilization area the contents of tp available n and available p in soil at fb4 and fb6 were higher than fb0 compared with fb0 tp in soil at fb6 increased by 35 available n increased by 21 and available p increased by 45 the application of biochar obviously improved soil fertility 3 3 2 plant height the plant height of peony in each level in the fertilized area was higher than unfertilized area but there was not a significant difference fig 7 anova in supplementary file 3g in the unfertilized

among these levels of biochar application comparatively there was a significant difference in plant basal diameter between the unfertilized and fertilized areas 3 3 4 chlorophyll content the spad values of leaves in the unfertilized area increased with an increase of biochar application at the stages of plant growth but after june the index decreased fig 9 the spad values of leaves showed significantly different among different levels of biochar application fig 9 anova in supplementary file 3i in the fertilization area the spad value of leaves increased with an increase of biochar application from in april to june but after june the spad of leaves at fb0 and fb2 decreased however the spad of leaves at fb4 and fb6 maintained at a high level after it had decreased a bit the spad values of leaves at fb4 and fb6 in august and september were far larger than other levels of biochar application 3 3 5 organ n and p content biochar application increased the n and p content in the

biochar application in the unfertilized area 4 discussion 4 1 effects of biochar on soil nutrients and n p leaching under indoor simulation soil ph has a great impact on soil fertility and is one of the important indicators reflecting soil properties schulz et al 2014 the ph of karst yellow soil increased from 5 08 to 5 70 5 94 after different amounts of biochar application biochar contains rich ca2 k and mg2 after biochar has been applied to soil these basic ions exchange h and al3 in soil and consequently increase soil ph mchenry 2011 van zwieten et al 2010 yuan et al 2011 biochar application also increased tn tp available n and available p concentrations in karst yellow soil biochar contains a large amount of n and p after the application of different amounts of biochar tn in the soil increased from 1 58 to 1 71 g kg and the tp increased from 0 74 to 1 03 g kg due to the special microporous structure and high specific surface area of biochar ammonium nitrate and phosphate ions can be easily adsorb by biochar thereby reducing the loss of n and p and increasing the nutrient concentration in the soil ippolito et al 2012 randolph et al 2017 zhu et al 2014 the special structure of biochar also enables to improve soil porosity and increase soil water holding capacity with biochar application and consequently decreases the leaching losses of water from soil kuo et al 2020 karthik et al 2020 however we found that only when a small amount of biochar was applied the leaching loss of n and p showed a decrease in indoor modeling too much biochar application caused a high leaching loss of p and n from soil 2 kg m2 biochar application was a threshold with the best effect on the reduction of tp tn an and nn leaching loss in indoor modeling therefore the study validates our assumption i e when the amount of biochar application is higher than a threshold value the loss of p and n from soil will begin to increase with increasing biochar application previous study indicated that the saturation of soil p could cause a large amount of p leached into groundwater and the loss amount of p was dependent on the soil p saturation and the amount of p applied vander molen et al 1998 per kg biochar applied to karst yellow soil itself contained 1 09 g p which was equal to 105 kg hm2 p therefore more biochar application easily caused the saturation of p in the soil and increased the leaching loss of p the threshold of biochar application is also 2 kg m2 for the least leaching loss of tn nn and an a small amount of biochar application to soil can help adsorb n to soil biochar complex and reduce the loss of n however too much biochar application to soil can not only cause the saturation of soil n but also increase the porosity of soil and cause organic n to be more easily mineralized into inorganic n and increase the leaching of inorganic n from soil xing et al 2011 concretely an increase of oxygen in soil induced by biochar application creates the favorable living conditions for ammonifying and nitrifying bacteria and increases the number of these bacteria and the ammoniation and nitrification reaction rates consequently generating more an and nn production and loss from organic matter decomposition luo et al 2006 ruser et al 2006 we further found that the ratio of tn an and nn concentration to tp concentration in the leaching solution from all treatments of biochar application showed a parabolic form across different groups of leaching experiments the change of the ratio of n to p concentration in the leaching solution reflects the asynchrony of the n and p release from soil smith et al 1998 in subtropical karst regions there are many lakes accepting leaching solution from karst yellow soil ye et al 2015 cyanobacteria generally account for 50 80 of total phytoplankton biovolume and affect eutrophication in these lakes havens 2003 non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria dominate under the conditions of the high and low n p ratio respectively havens 2003 therefore the parabolic ratio of tn an and nn concentration to tp in the leaching solution from karst yellow soil with biochar application potentially regulates the bloom of non n2 fixing and n2 fixing cyanobacteria in water body during a summer 4 2 effect of biochar application on the loss of n p under natural rainfall biochar application reduced surface runoff in karst yellow soil and surface runoff continually decreased with an increase of biochar application biochar has rich pores large specific surface area and high surface charge density and thus good water adsorption capacity blanco canqui 2019 after being applied to soil biochar can significantly improve soil structure increase soil porosity and soil water storage and consequently reduce runoff loss water is the main carrier of soil nutrient and rainfall intensity is a key factor leading to the loss of soil n and p cohen ofri et al 2006 when the increase of rainfall intensity leads to more surface runoff the loss of n and p in surface runoff certainly continues to increase fraser et al 1999 liang et al 2015 therefore the loss of n and p from all plots with biochar application under rainstorm was far larger than heavy rain and moderate rain the loss of n and p under heavy rain was also about two times higher than moderate rain our results indicate that increasing biochar application can significantly reduce the loss of n and p in surface runoff from karst yellow soil under different rainfall intensity and the decrease of nn is most significant biochar contains abundant oxygen containing functional groups knowles et al 2011 the property makes biochar have good ion exchange adsorption capacity and can effectively adsorb soluble n and p such as an nn and phosphate ion in soil and decrease these ions loss wang et al 2017 high ratio of biochar addition can adsorb nitrate and weaken nitrification in the soil further reducing soil nn concentration and leading to a decrease of the nn loss with runoff liu 2015 li et al 2018 yuan et al 2016 in addition the co application of fertilizer and biochar can improve soil structure and promote the growth of plant root systems and increase the n utilization rate of plants consequently decreasing the loss of n and p liu et al 2017 pratiwi et al 2016 however too much biochar application increased the loss of n and p in the study therefore the optimal biochar application to decrease the loss of tn an and tp in karst yellow soil is 4 kg m2 the value is larger than 2 kg m2 obtained from the modeling experiments of soil columns this is because the amount of fertilizer application was larger in soil columns than the cropland in the study therefore the amount of fertilizer application can be properly decreased under the co application of fertilizer and biochar we found that rainstorm caused the large loss of an from karst yellow soil which was similar with nn but the loss of an was far smaller than nn under heavy rain and moderate rain the previous study indicated that the n leaching loss was mainly nn and an only accounted for a small proportion ma et al 2015 wang and zhou 2013 soil particles mainly adsorb an which causes the leaching loss of nn to be larger than an with rainfall runoff ji et al 2011 sun et al 2018 these studies explain the low contents of an in runoff under heavy and moderate rains in the study however the good adsorption of biochar and soil particles to an was disturbed with the scouring of large raindrops and surface runoff under rainstorm leading to high an loss similarly the loss of tp under rainstorm was also far larger than that under heavy rain and moderate rain dissolved p and particulate p are the main forms of p loss with runoff wang et al 2016a 2016b huang et al 2018 biochar can adsorb dissolved p and precipitate particulate p to reduce mobility of p in runoff and soil solution ye et al 2015 li and wei 2016 therefore the loss of p with runoff decreased with increasing biochar application under different rainfall in the study rainstorm often causes a large amount of surface runoff to increase the mobility of different forms of p cui et al 2013 han et al 2016 biochar applied to croplands is also scoured by rainstorm runoff to increase the loss of p gundale and deluca 2006 hong and li 2011 thus the flux of tp loss in kart yellow soil under rainstorm was several times more than other rainfall 4 3 effect of biochar application on the growth of oil peony the combined application of fertilizer and biochar had a better effect on plant growth oil peony is suitable to grow in loose air permeable well drained soil with a ph value of 6 5 8 0 however karst yellow soil is acid soil with high cohesiveness luo et al 2020 biochar application to karst yellow soil just made up for the defects of the soil in physical and chemical properties and provided suitable growth conditions for the oil peony liang et al 2006 therefore the growth of oil peony was improved significantly however when no fertilizer was applied the optimal amount of application biochar was 6 kg m2 for plant growth when fertilizer was applied the optimal amount was 4 kg m2 the combination of biochar and fertilizer in application can reduce the amount of fertilizer application too much application of biochar such as 6 kg m2 under the co application of fertilizer and biochar conversely inhibits the plant growth of oil peony as other plants steiner et al 2008 too much application of biochar may lead to n fixation to biochar which reduces the available n in soil and limits the absorption of available n by plants resulting in a decline of plant growth lone et al 2015 the spad value of plant leaves is often used to reflect leaf n nutrient status and photosynthetic capacity wang et al 2016a 2016b sun et al 2016 biochar application could increase the spad value of leaves in oil peony during the test period the spad values of the peony leaves at all levels of biochar application showed a trend of increasing firstly and then stabilizing it may be due to the high c n ratio of biochar at the last stage to limit the growth of plants biederman and stanley harpole 2013 cao and harris 2010 however after july the spad value of leaves in oil peony in the fertilized plots with biochar application was far larger than the unfertilized plots with biochar application especially the unfertilized plots without biochar application therefore the co application of fertilizer and biochar is very effective to the growth of oil peony liang et al 2006 biochar can promote the absorption of plants to soil nutrients due to the improvement of soil environment jiang et al 2017 lehmann et al 2006 after biochar is applied to soil it can promote a conversion of p from the fixed to available state in the soil and directly increase the available p concentration steiner et al 2008 meanwhile after high temperature pyrolysis the compound containing p in biochar was activated and transformed into dissolved p that can be easily absorbed and utilized by crops liu et al 2019 therefore in the study whether fertilizers were applied or not to soil p concentration in the roots stems and leaves of oil peony continually increased with an increase of biochar application however n content in the roots stems and leaves of oil peony was not largest at the highest levels of biochar application with fertilization van zwieten et al 2010 found that the mixing application of biochar and chemical fertilizers to acidic soils really increased the uptake of n by crops but too much biochar application increased c n ratio of soil resulting in a decrease in soil available n and in turn reduced the absorption of n by plants biochar application truly promotes the n cycle and increases the soluble n in soil covington and sackett 1992 gundale and deluca 2007 however many studies including ours indicate that the combined application of medium level biochar and fertilizer has the best effect on several indices of plant growth 5 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 in the indoor simulation experiment soil ph tn available nitrogen tp and available phosphorus contents all increase with the increase of the amount of biochar application but the volume of the leaching solution decreases the cumulative leaching loss of tn tp an and nn was significantly reduced by 13 57 26 09 13 9 and 29 79 when 2 kg m2 biochar was applied to soil a small amount of biochar application can effectively reduce the nutrient leaching loss in karst yellow soil change in n p in leaching solution regularly collected from soil with biochar application shows a parabolic form 2 under natural rainfall increasing biochar application reduces surface runoff and the loss of n and p but excessive application conversely increases the loss rainstorm can cause a large loss of an tp and nn but the loss of an and tp is far smaller than nn under heavy and moderate rain 4 kg m2 biochar application has a better effect on reducing tn tp and an in surface runoff while 6 kg m2 biochar application has a better effect on reducing nn 3 the combined application of fertilizer and biochar has a better effect on the growth and nutrient absorption of oil peony than a single biochar application the optimal amount of biochar application is 4 kg m2 moderate biochar application is conductive to both control the loss of p and n in karst yellow soil under different rains and obtain the largest growths of plant height and base diameter the largest spad value of leaves and the highest n and p accumulation in organs too much biochar application is unfavorable to the control of the loss of n and p and plant growth the study reveals the levels of biochar and fertilizer application to karst yellow soil for the effective control of nutrient loss to concurrently promote the growth of oil peony the knowledge found in the study can be directly applied to agricultural water management in karst yellow soil credit authorship contribution statement cong zhang formal analysis data curation writing
