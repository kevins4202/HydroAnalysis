2625,the neglect of dissolved organic nitrogen don especially with regard to its transformation in the deep vadose zone can result in high uncertainty surrounding estimated nitrogen n leaching losses

inorganic n for n stocks and 28 04 71 94 of don was sealed in the deep vadose zones i e 1 m depth soil n mineralization rates gradually decreased as incubation proceeded and aerobic condition was more

spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since humans have overused nitrogen n bearing fertilizers and chemicals for a long time nitrate no3 contamination in groundwater has become a major problem globally mwagona et al 2019 feng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 considering the fact that no 3 seeping into the underground aquifer from the surface is subject to leakage through the vadose zone dahan et al 2014 ascott et al 2017 understanding the migration and transformation of n in the vadose zone is crucial for groundwater pollution control previous studies murphy et al 2000 van kessel et al 2009 geng et al 2020 on n pollution primarily focused on forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din such as no 3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n whereas dissolved organic nitrogen don has only recently come under scrutiny current evidence suggests that don is the most abundant form of dissolved n lapworth et al 2008 lorite herrera et al 2009 nai et al 2020 and functions as a hidden reservoir of no 3 n through mineralization in the soil yue et al 2014 ran et al 2017 recent studies liang et al 2021 have indicated that don is as leachable as din and may influence the self purification of no 3 in groundwater as both a nitrate precursor and a denitrification promoter jones et al 2004 rothstein 2010 measuring don concentration and exploring don transformation behavior in the vadose zone are thus critical for soil n budget assessment and adequate groundwater nitrate management don mineralization process is a vital process for n transformation and refers to the microbial breakdown of don into din net n mineralization arising from the balance between gross n mineralization and n immobilization by soil microorganisms is usually evaluated by gauging the rate of inorganic n accumulation in soil chapin et al 1993 according to a literature review xin et al 2019 the range of soil net n mineralization activity is 5 58 2 88 μg n g 1 d 1 for cropland and don mineralization is mediated by the properties of the soil plant litter input plant and microbial nutrient demand and climatic factors clivot et al 2017 risch et al 2019 so far most mineralization related studies mo et al 2016 fujii et al 2018 bagheri novair et al 2020 has been carried out in shallow soils depth 0 100 cm with only few investigations dridi and gueddari 2019 into the mineralization potential of the deep vadose zone considering this limitation the process based n budget models have rarely considered the mineralization process in the deep vadose zone due to a lack of available coefficients which could result in high uncertainty surrounding these models as well as a bias of estimated n leaching losses to groundwater therefore the characteristics and mechanisms of don mineralization in the deep vadose zone require further study don is a mixture of organic molecules that vary greatly in chemical structure and composition therefore also varying in bioavailability and ecological functioning chang et al 2018 there is no consensus on how the molecular properties of don evolve as don passes through the soil profile and ultimately into the groundwater most researchers investigating don have utilized a variety of spectroscopic chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques such as uv visible spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy gas chromatography liquid chromatography gas chromatography mass spectrometry liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms etc toshihiro et al 2005 maie et al 2006 how et al 2014 yang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 although the aforementioned methods can be used to quantify the content of a specific identified compound or to provide general grouping information obtaining a full fingerprint spectrum that covers all components remains a challenging task particularly due to the unidentified components accounting for 70 of don li et al 2018a li et al 2018b currently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analysis can provide a reliable way to detect and analyze individual don molecules to study their composition distribution and transformation li et al 2018a li et al 2018b bahureksa et al 2021 ft icr ms can be used to quantitatively elucidate the composition of leachate don from the vadose zone which has significant implications for evaluating the risks associated with groundwater nitrate pollution and in situ natural attenuation potentials as don plays complex roles in nitrogen cycling processes owing to its diverse physicochemical properties liu et al 2021 in this study we 1 quantified distribution characteristics of soil dissolved nitrogen in the vadose zone 2 compared don

applied to obtain soil samples from a depth of either 300 cm or 400 cm with coring tubes extracted from the ground every 100 cm all intact soil cores were then grouped at 20 cm intervals above a depth of 100 cm as well as at 100 cm intervals below the 100 cm depth each profile sampling site was drilled in three replicates and samples at the same depth of one sampling site were mixed for incubation

to be used for analysis and incubation studies were then expeditiously stored in sterile bags below 4 c in the dark 2 3 incubation considering the redox conditions occurring in the vadose zone profile ranging from aerobic near the surface to anaerobic near the groundwater table the don mineralization potentials were comprehensively evaluated by incubating each soil layer under two redox conditions aerobic and anaerobic we weighed 6 g dry weight equivalent of fresh soil into 50 ml centrifuge tubes to determine potential soil net n mineralization nm and to explore don transformation characteristics these were incubated at 25 c for 84 days in an incubator gxz ningbo jiangnan instrument factory china nm rates were determined using the net changes in din pools over time risch et al

soil properties of three sampling sites are shown in table s1 orp range was 188 278 mv indicating weak reducing conditions ec exhibited moderate variations in the range of 118 730 μs cm 1 the proportions of soil samples with different ph levels were neutral ph 6 5 7 5 65 22 of samples weakly acidic ph 5 5 6 5 30 43 of samples weakly alkaline ph 7 5 8 5 4 35 of samples the total carbon to total nitrogen ratios c n ratio fell in the range of 6 50 11 00 2 25 6 60 and 3 25 6 31 respectively for the three sites with the majority of c n ratios being 8 00 leading to a temporary n surplus especially at sampling sites 2 i e s2 and 3 i e s3 xu et al 2017 surplus n in soils may result in environmental problems dong and lin 2020 such as increased release of nitrous oxide soil acidification and groundwater n pollution foley et al 2011 chen et al 2019 this study found that the tdn content of soils was s3 s2 s1 as shown in fig 1 ranging 7 77 21 51 n mg kg 1 at s1 20 11 47 41 n mg kg 1 at s2 and 31 55 46 97 n mg kg 1 at s3 tdn contents at different sites were significantly correlated with the time interval between fertilization and sampling khalili and nourbakhsh 2012 before sampling s1 had been fertilized for 15 days while s2 and s3 had been fertilized less than a week which accounted for the relatively higher tdn in s2 and s3 no 3 n and don contents accounted for 37 42 70 37 and 9 99 54 12 of tdn contents respectively in the three sampling sites and were the dominant forms of dissolved n in the vadose zone as previously reported christou et al 2005 wu et al 2019 thus implying that don was as important as its inorganic counterpart for n stocks the no3 n and don were the main forms of tdn leaching which may cause serious groundwater contamination once they can reach the aquifer the vertical changes of tdn content with depth in three sites followed the similar rules the tdn contents at the 0 20 cm soil depth s1 21 51 n mg kg 1 s2 47 41 n mg kg 1 s3 41 10 n mg kg 1 was slightly higher than those at the 20 40 cm soil depth s1 8 65 12 68 n mg kg 1 s2 20 11 30 98 n mg kg 1 s3 31 55 46 97 n mg kg 1 and no significant difference was observed in tdn contents along the deeper profile 20 cm higher tdn contents in the surface soil were mainly attributed to accumulation of applied fertilizer n which was not flushed downwards wang et al 2019 moreover 57 51 77 49 no 3 n and 28 04 71 94 don across the whole profile were sealed in the deep vadose zones 1 m at three sampling sites supporting information these results supported the conclusions of previous studies zhou et al 2016 wu et al 2019 nai et al 2020 thus confirming that the deep vadose zone contains a large n reservoir and cannot be overlooked during n budgeting 3 2 temporal variation in soil dissolved nitrogen during incubation changes in dissolved nitrogen species content are attributed to complex nitrogen cycling processes see fig s2 such as 1 particle organic n pon can be broken down to high molecular weight don and low molecular weight lmw don zhang et al 2020 2 labile don is converted into din through don mineralization li et al 2019 3 nh 4 n is released by don degradation ammonification then is oxidized to no 3 n through nitrification nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n and finally converted to gaseous nitrogen through denitrification no 3 n no 2 n no n2o n2 or anammox reactions no 2 n nh 4 n n2 kuypers et al 2018 4 no 3 n can also be reduced to nh 4 n known as the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium process no 3 n no 2 n nh 4 n zhang et al 2020 and 5 din can be assimilated to organic nitrogen to increase don content din don kuypers et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in order to address an insight into the involved n transformation processes the variations of different dissolved n species contents over the incubation time were recorded as shown in fig 2 and figs s3 s10 the changing kinetics of dissolved n accumulation in all the samples from different soil layers under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions can be roughly segmented into three phases soil depth did not have a noticeable influence on the n transformation kinetic pattern whereas the n species evolutional trend was somewhat dependent on redox conditions the three phases in the aerobic group were ⅰ fluctuations with alternating ups and downs in both don and din contents were found ⅱ don markedly decreased p 0 01 whereas din continued increasing and iii the changes of dissolved n contents generally leveled off with the don content remaining stable and the din content slightly declining in most cases changes in dissolved n during each phase embodied different steps of transformation during the initial phase fluctuations in don and din contents were likely attributed to the balancing of complex processes net don variation depended on the balance between the source term i e pon decomposition and sink term i e labile don mineralization whereas net din variation was ascribed to the balancing of the source term i e labile don mineralization and the sink term i e denitrification anammox or assimilation as all these processes occur simultaneously a teeterboard variation pattern of the dissolved n species was displayed staddon et al 2010 during phase ⅱ pon decomposition reduced as the easy to decompose pon was quickly and completely consumed in phase i leaving recalcitrant pon alone there is thus less competition for oxygen which guarantee an aerobic condition and relatively depresses the denitrification anammox processes don mineralization became the prevalent transformation process accounting for decreasing don and the corresponding increase in din content haer and benbi 2003 during the phase iii the recalcitrant organic matter decomposed slowly and the dominant process was din attenuation process denitrification and anammox this was associated with stable don contents and slightly decreased din contents nordmeyer and richter 1985 compared to aerobic conditions there were three similar phases in the anaerobic group but with certain differences which include changes in din contents in the anaerobic group were less significant in the first two phases as compared to the aerobic group probably due to anaerobic conditions inhibiting nitrification and ammonification khalil et al 2004 chen et al 2012 a significant decrease in din p 0 05 was found in phase iii owing to the anaerobic conditions favoring denitrification and anammox khalil et al 2004 nie et al 2019 castellano hinojosa et al 2020 3 3 soil net n mineralization rates soil nm rates over the three incubation phases were 0 00 1 09 n mg kg 1 d 1 0 20 1 76 n mg kg 1 d 1 and 0 55 0 45 n mg kg 1 d 1 under aerobic condition respectively and 0 16 0 56 n mg kg 1 d 1 0 33 1 11 n mg kg 1 d 1 and 0 49 0 10 n mg kg 1 d 1 under anaerobic condition respectively see fig 3 this illustrates the fact that soil n mineralization rates gradually decreased as the incubation proceeded and aerobic conditions were more favorable for soil n mineralization higher don content 31 55 46 97 n mg kg 1 at s3 corresponded with its relatively higher soil nm rate 0 55 1 76 n mg kg 1 d 1 as adequate don in soil increased nitrogen availability and promoted n mineralization shang et al 2015 in addition suitable ph range 5 98 7 77 at s3 was another factor that accounted for its high soil nm rate as high ph value can increase the solubility of soil organic matter and provide enough substances in c and n for microbial activities thus promoting nm curtin et al 1998 different changing trends of nm rates with varying soil depths were observed in different sampling sites considering phase i as an example nm rates decreased with the soil depth in s1 nm rates increased with the soil depth in s2 and nm rates decreased and then increased with the soil depth in s3 soil water content was an important influencing factor of the nm rate when soil water content was lower than a certain threshold the nm rate was significantly positively correlated with the soil water content jacynthe et al 2011 the water content increased with soil depth fig 1 and lead to a higher nm rate in deep soil meanwhile the nm rate was also closely related to the content of don for example the content of don at s1 decreased with the increasing soil depth fig 1 which was consistent with the changing trend of nm rate at s1 in addition the highest nm rate 1 76 n mg kg 1 d 1 among three phases in all the sites was observed in the 80 100 cm soil depth this indicated that both the surface soil and deep vadose zone could be potential hotspots for n mineralization and nitrogen budgeting models need to select the reaction parameters most suited to their site specific conditions 3 4 don molecular composition fig s11 shows substantial changes in the relative abundance of don in dissolved organic matter dom before and after the incubation before incubation the molecular formulas containing n accounted for 10 18 9 07 of dom after incubation for 84 d n containing proportions in the aerobic group and anaerobic group were 8 04 6 81 and 6 78 6 47 respectively these data corresponded with the mineralization process as shown in section 3 2 the number of assigned don molecular formulas increased from 5390 i e the total number of detected don molecules of all samples on day 0 to 8336 after aerobic incubation and 7182 after anaerobic incubation see fig s12 thus highlighting the fact that the diversity of don molecular species increased after incubation van krevelen vk diagrams were used to visualize changes in the molecular composition of don using o c vs h c plots with two different classification methods used for each region as shown in fig 4 a don compounds before incubation were primarily dominant in lipid like structures whereas the relative abundance of lignin like compounds markedly increased after incubation this corresponds to data from another classification method shown in fig 4 b which shows that the prevalent don components before incubation i e unsaturated aliphatic compounds were replaced by highly unsaturated compounds mostly corresponding to lignin like compounds after incubation taking s3 for example approximately 3 34 46 10 and 3 34 29 87 formulas containing n from all samples fell within lignin like and highly unsaturated compounds regions before incubation whereas the proportions were increased to 57 83 75 74 and 30 15 73 21 after aerobic incubation and 59 75 80 56 and 52 01 68 67 after anaerobic incubation respectively correspondingly the relative abundance of lipids like compounds and unsaturated aliphatic compounds before incubation was 29 37 91 36 and 30 50 80 27 respectively and this decreased to 2 07 15 90 and 3 85 25 15 after aerobic incubation and 0 41 19 24 and 2 15 22 98 after anaerobic incubation respectively to provide insight into the governing mechanisms for the observed don molecular evolutionary process the resistant removed and newly formed don fractions were delineated with vk diagrams see fig 5 and figs s13 s18 by comparing the don molecular compositions before and after incubation resistant removed and newly formed don fractions respectively referred to the don fractions present both before and after incubation the don fractions present before incubation but absent after incubation and the don fractions absent before incubation but present after incubation as shown in table s2 the number of the removed compounds in this study accounted for 96 30 100 00 and 97 14 100 00 of initial samples under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively after incubation the number of the newly formed compounds in this study accounted for 97 53 100 00 and 95 68 100 00 of incubation samples under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively the dots for the newly formed and removed formulas distributed in lipids lignins and condensed aromatics regions see fig 5 and figs s13 s18 indicated the don of different class assignments were all experiencing active transformation even for the lignins and condensed aromatics which were traditionally considered as intrinsically recalcitrant in terms of lignin like compounds taking the soil sample at 0 20 cm of s3 for example there were 44 21 and 44 49 molecules removed and 55 88 and 74 53 molecules newly formed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively as shown in table s3 and table s4 this contradicted with the traditional knowledge wong et al 2020 of the unreactive nature of the lignin like compounds and supported that their decreased relative abundance after incubation should be ascribed to the balancing of its synchronous removal and formation by comparing don molecular composition and variation in the anaerobic and aerobic groups as shown in table s5 it was indicated that there was minimal difference in m z w aimod w h c w o c w and n c w by comparing the products under aerobic and anaerobic conditions taking s3 for example the aimod w of dons fell in the range of 0 29 0 58 in the aerobic group and in the range of 0 26 0 48 in the anaerobic group suggesting little changes this demonstrated that don transformation can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and don molecular evolution may not be affected significantly by redox conditions though there were certain differences between the removed and newly formed don molecules as shown in fig 5 and figs s13 s18 after 84 days of incubation the don molecules that were always present are recalcitrant molecules those present only at the beginning of incubation are removed and those present only after incubation are newly formed to address the contribution of in situ transformation for the occurrence of don molecules in the deep vadose zone the common don molecules referring to the don molecules that were shared by all the different layers through the profile were identified and marked in fig 6 and the number of common don molecules before and after incubation was compared results indicated that almost no common don molecules on day 0 were found in all the three sampling sites but an increased number of common don molecules after incubation 84 d was observed this demonstrated that the active decomposition process which would result in more adequate don intermediates was present through the whole vadose zone profile nai et al 2020 and in situ autogenous decomposition was a nonnegligible source for don in the deep soil layers hassouna et al 2010 the large number of removed as well as formed don formulas observed in samples of all soil depths also provided clues for the active transformation process that took place during vertical transfer combining the kinetic evidence in section 3 2 and the molecular evidence here can prove up to the view that the deep vadose zone is not only an n reservoir but also a hotspot area for don transformation furthermore by comparing the molecular evolutionary characteristics along the vertical soil profile see figs s13 s18 the don transformation at different soil depths may be mediated by varying microbial pathways previous studies have shown that different biological metabolic pathways including sulfate carbonate and nitrate respiration in the biodegradation of dissolved organic matter may be involved at different soil depths li et al 2022 4 conclusions and environmental implications don is the main form of dissolved n form in the vadose zone and is not a negligible nitrogen stock in this study mineralization was identified under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions by incubating the soil at different depths the nm rate under aerobic conditions was higher than that under anaerobic conditions but the specific differences varied by sampling site the changes in don molecular components before and after incubation indicate that don molecular analysis confirms that mineralization can occur in deep vadose zones the don mineralization can also occur during leaching even in the case of recalcitrant don such as lignin therefore behavior of don in deep vadose zones needs to be considered when estimating soil n stocks and assessing the risk of groundwater n contamination in the process of don leaching to groundwater a few components can be leached directly to the deeper layers without transformation whereas most dons undergo a general transformation process during leaching liang et al 2021 this occurs under different redox conditions and at different depths consequently producing more labile lmw components and even complete mineralization during the vertical transfer process don may be more easily leached into groundwater without adequate mineralization if the vadose zone is shallow the thicker the vadose zone the higher the possibility for the mineralization occurring during the leaching process which will result in decreased don contents and enhanced no 3 n storage in the vadose zone afterwards if there is timely and significant rainfall or irrigation the amount of no 3 n leached to groundwater may increase long et al 2015 on the contrary if no 3 n is not leached to groundwater in time it may be self purified by denitrification or anammox alleviating the input of no 3 n to groundwater yang et al 2021 previously modeling estimates of no 3 n input fluxes to groundwater have typically not considered the don mineralization behavior in the deep vadose zone or have designed uniform or simplified parameters for the whole vadose zone profile shepherd et al 2018 this results in big uncertainties in the n budgeting and the leaching n flux estimation therefore site specific n reaction parameters along the whole soil profile must be obtained for modeling which would provide for a more accurate assessment of n stocks losses in the vadose zone and the risk of no 3 n leaching to groundwater besides don leached to groundwater can function both as a nitrate precursor and as a facilitator of denitrification affecting no 3 n accumulation by two opposite means liu et al 2021 in other words dons can simultaneously contribute to no 3 n accumulation through mineralization and no 3 n attenuation as a denitrifying carbon source the role that takes superiority depending on the physicochemical properties of different dons determines the environmental effects of don inputs into groundwater it is thus necessary to pay attention to don both for quantity and for composition in this study it was found that soil depth has a significant impact on don composition hence the migration and transformation behavior of dons through the entire vadose zone should be analyzed with respect to the specific environmental conditions of the study area ft icr ms analysis provides a promising way to conduct this analysis laffely et al 2020 don composition in the leachate into groundwater can thus be forecasted which is essential for assessing the risk of nitrate pollution and its self attenuation potentials and sheds light on an efficient nitrate pollution management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

redox conditions potentially having different microbe mediated pathways these findings emphasize the implications of considering don transformation in the deep vadose zone for soil n budgeting and

spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since humans have overused nitrogen n bearing fertilizers and chemicals for a long time nitrate no3 contamination in groundwater has become a major problem globally mwagona et al 2019 feng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 considering the fact that no 3 seeping into the underground aquifer from the surface is subject to leakage through the vadose zone dahan et al 2014 ascott et al 2017 understanding the migration and transformation of n in the vadose zone is crucial for groundwater pollution control previous studies murphy et al 2000 van kessel et al 2009 geng et al 2020 on n pollution primarily focused on forms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din such as no 3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n whereas dissolved organic nitrogen don has only recently come under scrutiny current evidence suggests that don is the most abundant form of dissolved n lapworth et al 2008 lorite herrera et al 2009 nai et al 2020 and functions as a hidden reservoir of no 3 n through mineralization in the soil yue et al 2014 ran et al 2017 recent studies liang et al 2021 have indicated that don is as leachable as din and may influence the self purification of no 3 in groundwater as both a nitrate precursor and a denitrification promoter jones et al 2004 rothstein 2010 measuring don concentration and exploring don transformation behavior in the vadose zone are thus critical for soil n budget assessment and adequate groundwater nitrate management don mineralization process is a vital process for n transformation and refers to the microbial breakdown of don into din net n mineralization arising from the balance between gross n mineralization and n immobilization by soil microorganisms is usually evaluated by gauging the rate of inorganic n accumulation in soil chapin et al 1993 according to a literature review xin et al 2019 the range of soil net n mineralization activity is 5 58 2 88 μg n g 1 d 1 for cropland and don mineralization is mediated by the properties of the soil plant litter input plant and microbial nutrient demand and climatic factors clivot et al 2017 risch et al 2019 so far most mineralization related studies mo et al 2016 fujii et al 2018 bagheri novair et al 2020 has been carried out in shallow soils depth 0 100 cm with only few investigations dridi and gueddari 2019 into the mineralization potential of the deep vadose zone considering this limitation the process based n budget models have rarely considered the mineralization process in the deep vadose zone due to a lack of available coefficients which could result in high uncertainty surrounding these models as well as a bias of estimated n leaching losses to groundwater therefore the characteristics and mechanisms of don mineralization in the deep vadose zone require further study don is a mixture of organic molecules that vary greatly in chemical structure and composition therefore also varying in bioavailability and ecological functioning chang et al 2018 there is no consensus on how the molecular properties of don evolve as don passes through the soil profile and ultimately into the groundwater most researchers investigating don have utilized a variety of spectroscopic chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques such as uv visible spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy gas chromatography liquid chromatography gas chromatography mass spectrometry liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms etc toshihiro et al 2005 maie et al 2006 how et al 2014 yang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 lu et al 2020 although the aforementioned methods can be used to quantify the content of a specific identified compound or to provide general grouping information obtaining a full fingerprint spectrum that covers all components remains a challenging task particularly due to the unidentified components accounting for 70 of don li et al 2018a li et al 2018b currently fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analysis can provide a reliable way to detect and analyze individual don molecules to study their composition distribution and transformation li et al 2018a li et al 2018b bahureksa et al 2021 ft icr ms can be used to quantitatively elucidate the composition of leachate don from the vadose zone which has significant implications for evaluating the risks associated with groundwater nitrate pollution and in situ natural attenuation potentials as don plays complex roles in nitrogen cycling processes owing to its diverse physicochemical properties liu et al 2021 in this study we 1 quantified distribution characteristics of soil dissolved nitrogen in the vadose zone 2 compared don

ranging from aerobic near the surface to anaerobic near the groundwater table the don mineralization potentials were comprehensively evaluated by incubating each soil layer under two redox conditions

lorenz et al 2021 were used to analyze significant difference of the data at a p level of 0 05 i e spss 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil properties and soil dissolved nitrogen distribution the soil properties of three sampling sites are shown in table s1 orp range was 188 278 mv indicating weak reducing conditions ec exhibited moderate variations in the range of 118 730 μs cm 1 the proportions of soil samples with different ph levels were neutral ph 6 5 7 5 65 22 of samples weakly acidic ph 5 5 6 5 30 43 of samples weakly alkaline ph 7 5 8 5 4 35 of samples the total carbon to total nitrogen ratios c n ratio fell in the range of 6 50 11 00 2 25 6 60 and 3 25 6 31 respectively for the three sites with the majority of c n ratios being 8 00 leading to a temporary n surplus especially at sampling sites 2 i e s2 and 3 i e s3 xu et al 2017 surplus n in soils may result in environmental problems dong and lin 2020 such as increased release of nitrous oxide soil acidification and groundwater n pollution foley et al 2011 chen et al 2019 this study found that the tdn content of soils was s3 s2 s1 as shown in fig 1 ranging 7 77 21 51 n mg kg 1 at s1 20 11 47 41 n mg kg 1 at s2 and 31 55 46 97 n mg kg 1 at s3 tdn contents at different sites were significantly correlated with the time interval between fertilization and sampling khalili and nourbakhsh 2012 before sampling s1 had been fertilized for 15 days while s2 and s3 had been fertilized less than a week which accounted for the relatively higher tdn in s2 and s3 no 3 n and don contents accounted for 37 42 70 37 and 9 99 54 12 of tdn contents respectively in the three sampling sites and were the dominant forms of dissolved n in the vadose zone as previously reported christou et al 2005 wu et al 2019 thus implying that don was as important as its inorganic counterpart for n stocks the no3 n and don were the main forms of tdn leaching which may cause serious groundwater contamination once they can reach the aquifer the vertical changes of tdn content with depth in three sites followed the similar rules the tdn contents at the 0 20 cm soil depth s1 21 51 n mg kg 1 s2 47 41 n mg kg 1 s3 41 10 n mg kg 1 was slightly higher than those at the 20 40 cm soil depth s1 8 65 12 68 n mg kg 1 s2 20 11 30 98 n mg kg 1 s3 31 55 46 97 n mg kg 1 and no significant difference was observed in tdn contents along the deeper profile 20 cm higher tdn contents in the surface soil were mainly attributed to accumulation of applied fertilizer n which was not flushed downwards wang et al 2019 moreover 57 51 77 49 no 3 n and 28 04 71 94 don across the whole profile were sealed in the deep vadose zones 1 m at three sampling sites supporting information these results supported the conclusions of previous studies zhou et al 2016 wu et al 2019 nai et al 2020 thus confirming that the deep vadose zone contains a large n reservoir and cannot be overlooked during n budgeting 3 2 temporal variation in soil dissolved nitrogen during incubation changes in dissolved nitrogen species content are attributed to complex nitrogen cycling processes see fig s2 such as 1 particle organic n pon can be broken down to high molecular weight don and low molecular weight lmw don zhang et al 2020 2 labile don is converted into din through don mineralization li et al 2019 3 nh 4 n is released by don degradation ammonification then is oxidized to no 3 n through nitrification nh 4 n no 2 n no 3 n and finally converted to gaseous nitrogen through denitrification no 3 n no 2 n no n2o n2 or anammox reactions no 2 n nh 4 n n2 kuypers et al 2018 4 no 3 n can also be reduced to nh 4 n known as the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium process no 3 n no 2 n nh 4 n zhang et al 2020 and 5 din can be assimilated to organic nitrogen to increase don content din don kuypers et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in order to address an insight into the involved n transformation processes the variations of different dissolved n species contents over the incubation time were recorded as shown in fig 2 and figs s3 s10 the changing kinetics of dissolved n accumulation in all the samples from different soil layers under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions can be roughly segmented into three phases soil depth did not have a noticeable influence on the n transformation kinetic pattern whereas the n species evolutional trend was somewhat dependent on redox conditions the three phases in the aerobic group were ⅰ fluctuations with alternating ups and downs in both don and din contents were found ⅱ don markedly decreased p 0 01 whereas din continued increasing and iii the changes of dissolved n contents generally leveled off with the don content remaining stable and the din content slightly declining in most cases changes in dissolved n during each phase embodied different steps of transformation during the initial phase fluctuations in don and din contents were likely attributed to the balancing of complex processes net don variation depended on the balance between the source term i e pon decomposition and sink term i e labile don mineralization whereas net din variation was ascribed to the balancing of the source term i e labile don mineralization and the sink term i e denitrification anammox or assimilation as all these processes occur simultaneously a teeterboard variation pattern of the dissolved n species was displayed staddon et al 2010 during phase ⅱ pon decomposition reduced as the easy to decompose pon was quickly and completely consumed in phase i leaving recalcitrant pon alone there is thus less competition for oxygen which guarantee an aerobic condition and relatively depresses the denitrification anammox processes don mineralization became the prevalent transformation process accounting for decreasing don and the corresponding increase in din content haer and benbi 2003 during the phase iii the recalcitrant organic matter decomposed slowly and the dominant process was din attenuation process denitrification and anammox this was associated with stable don contents and slightly decreased din contents nordmeyer and richter 1985 compared to aerobic conditions there were three similar phases in the anaerobic group but with certain differences which include changes in din contents in the anaerobic group were less significant in the first two phases as compared to the aerobic group probably due to anaerobic conditions inhibiting nitrification and ammonification khalil et al 2004 chen et al 2012 a significant decrease in din p 0 05 was found in phase iii owing to the anaerobic conditions favoring denitrification and anammox khalil et al 2004 nie et al 2019 castellano hinojosa et al 2020 3 3 soil net n mineralization rates soil nm rates over the three incubation phases were 0 00 1 09 n mg kg 1 d 1 0 20 1 76 n mg kg 1 d 1 and 0 55 0 45 n mg kg 1 d 1 under aerobic condition respectively and 0 16 0 56 n mg kg 1 d 1 0 33 1 11 n mg kg 1 d 1 and 0 49 0 10 n mg kg 1 d 1 under anaerobic condition respectively see fig 3 this illustrates the fact that soil n mineralization rates gradually decreased as the incubation proceeded and aerobic conditions were more favorable for soil n mineralization higher don content 31 55 46 97 n mg kg 1 at s3 corresponded with its relatively higher soil nm rate 0 55 1 76 n mg kg 1 d 1 as adequate don in soil increased nitrogen availability and promoted n mineralization shang et al 2015 in addition suitable ph range 5 98 7 77 at s3 was another factor that accounted for its high soil nm rate as high ph value can increase the solubility of soil organic matter and provide enough substances in c and n for microbial activities thus promoting nm curtin et al 1998 different changing trends of nm rates with varying soil depths were observed in different sampling sites considering phase i as an example nm rates decreased with the soil depth in s1 nm rates increased with the soil depth in s2 and nm rates decreased and then increased with the soil depth in s3 soil water content was an important influencing factor of the nm rate when soil water content was lower than a certain threshold the nm rate was significantly positively correlated with the soil water content jacynthe et al 2011 the water content increased with soil depth fig 1 and lead to a higher nm rate in deep soil meanwhile the nm rate was also closely related to the content of don for example the content of don at s1 decreased with the increasing soil depth fig 1 which was consistent with the changing trend of nm rate at s1 in addition the highest nm rate 1 76 n mg kg 1 d 1 among three phases in all the sites was observed in the 80 100 cm soil depth this indicated that both the surface soil and deep vadose zone could be potential hotspots for n mineralization and nitrogen budgeting models need to select the reaction parameters most suited to their site specific conditions 3 4 don molecular composition fig s11 shows substantial changes in the relative abundance of don in dissolved organic matter dom before and after the incubation before incubation the molecular formulas containing n accounted for 10 18 9 07 of dom after incubation for 84 d n containing proportions in the aerobic group and anaerobic group were 8 04 6 81 and 6 78 6 47 respectively these data corresponded with the mineralization process as shown in section 3 2 the number of assigned don molecular formulas increased from 5390 i e the total number of detected don molecules of all samples on day 0 to 8336 after aerobic incubation and 7182 after anaerobic incubation see fig s12 thus highlighting the fact that the diversity of don molecular species increased after incubation van krevelen vk diagrams were used to visualize changes in the molecular composition of don using o c vs h c plots with two different classification methods used for each region as shown in fig 4 a don compounds before incubation were primarily dominant in lipid like structures whereas the relative abundance of lignin like compounds markedly increased after incubation this corresponds to data from another classification method shown in fig 4 b which shows that the prevalent don components before incubation i e unsaturated aliphatic compounds were replaced by highly unsaturated compounds mostly corresponding to lignin like compounds after incubation taking s3 for example approximately 3 34 46 10 and 3 34 29 87 formulas containing n from all samples fell within lignin like and highly unsaturated compounds regions before incubation whereas the proportions were increased to 57 83 75 74 and 30 15 73 21 after aerobic incubation and 59 75 80 56 and 52 01 68 67 after anaerobic incubation respectively correspondingly the relative abundance of lipids like compounds and unsaturated aliphatic compounds before incubation was 29 37 91 36 and 30 50 80 27 respectively and this decreased to 2 07 15 90 and 3 85 25 15 after aerobic incubation and 0 41 19 24 and 2 15 22 98 after anaerobic incubation respectively to provide insight into the governing mechanisms for the observed don molecular evolutionary process the resistant removed and newly formed don fractions were delineated with vk diagrams see fig 5 and figs s13 s18 by comparing the don molecular compositions before and after incubation resistant removed and newly formed don fractions respectively referred to the don fractions present both before and after incubation the don fractions present before incubation but absent after incubation and the don fractions absent before incubation but present after incubation as shown in table s2 the number of the removed compounds in this study accounted for 96 30 100 00 and 97 14 100 00 of initial samples under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively after incubation the number of the newly formed compounds in this study accounted for 97 53 100 00 and 95 68 100 00 of incubation samples under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively the dots for the newly formed and removed formulas distributed in lipids lignins and condensed aromatics regions see fig 5 and figs s13 s18 indicated the don of different class assignments were all experiencing active transformation even for the lignins and condensed aromatics which were traditionally considered as intrinsically recalcitrant in terms of lignin like compounds taking the soil sample at 0 20 cm of s3 for example there were 44 21 and 44 49 molecules removed and 55 88 and 74 53 molecules newly formed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively as shown in table s3 and table s4 this contradicted with the traditional knowledge wong et al 2020 of the unreactive nature of the lignin like compounds and supported that their decreased relative abundance after incubation should be ascribed to the balancing of its synchronous removal and formation by comparing don molecular composition and variation in the anaerobic and aerobic groups as shown in table s5 it was indicated that there was minimal difference in m z w aimod w h c w o c w and n c w by comparing the products under aerobic and anaerobic conditions taking s3 for example the aimod w of dons fell in the range of 0 29 0 58 in the aerobic group and in the range of 0 26 0 48 in the anaerobic group suggesting little changes this demonstrated that don transformation can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and don molecular evolution may not be affected significantly by redox conditions though there were certain differences between the removed and newly formed don molecules as shown in fig 5 and figs s13 s18 after 84 days of incubation the don molecules that were always present are recalcitrant molecules those present only at the beginning of incubation are removed and those present only after incubation are newly formed to address the contribution of in situ transformation for the occurrence of don molecules in the deep vadose zone the common don molecules referring to the don molecules that were shared by all the different layers through the profile were identified and marked in fig 6 and the number of common don molecules before and after incubation was compared results indicated that almost no common don molecules on day 0 were found in all the three sampling sites but an increased number of common don molecules after incubation 84 d was observed this demonstrated that the active decomposition process which would result in more adequate don intermediates was present through the whole vadose zone profile nai et al 2020 and in situ autogenous decomposition was a nonnegligible source for don in the deep soil layers hassouna et al 2010 the large number of removed as well as formed don formulas observed in samples of all soil depths also provided clues for the active transformation process that took place during vertical transfer combining the kinetic evidence in section 3 2 and the molecular evidence here can prove up to the view that the deep vadose zone is not only an n reservoir but also a hotspot area for don transformation furthermore by comparing the molecular evolutionary characteristics along the vertical soil profile see figs s13 s18 the don transformation at different soil depths may be mediated by varying microbial pathways previous studies have shown that different biological metabolic pathways including sulfate carbonate and nitrate respiration in the biodegradation of dissolved organic matter may be involved at different soil depths li et al 2022 4 conclusions and environmental implications don is the main form of dissolved n form in the vadose zone and is not a negligible nitrogen stock in this study mineralization was identified under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions by incubating the soil at different depths the nm rate under aerobic conditions was higher than that under anaerobic conditions but the specific differences varied by sampling site the changes in don molecular components before and after incubation indicate that don molecular analysis confirms that mineralization can occur in deep vadose zones the don mineralization can also occur during leaching even in the case of recalcitrant don such as lignin therefore behavior of don in deep vadose zones needs to be considered when estimating soil n stocks and assessing the risk of groundwater n contamination in the process of don leaching to groundwater a few components can be leached directly to the deeper layers without transformation whereas most dons undergo a general transformation process during leaching liang et al 2021 this occurs under different redox conditions and at different depths consequently producing more labile lmw components and even complete mineralization during the vertical transfer process don may be more easily leached into groundwater without adequate mineralization if the vadose zone is shallow the thicker the vadose zone the higher the possibility for the mineralization occurring during the leaching process which will result in decreased don contents and enhanced no 3 n storage in the vadose zone afterwards if there is timely and significant rainfall or irrigation the amount of no 3 n leached to groundwater may increase long et al 2015 on the contrary if no 3 n is not leached to groundwater in time it may be self purified by denitrification or anammox alleviating the input of no 3 n to groundwater yang et al 2021 previously modeling estimates of no 3 n input fluxes to groundwater have typically not considered the don mineralization behavior in the deep vadose zone or have designed uniform or simplified parameters for the whole vadose zone profile shepherd et al 2018 this results in big uncertainties in the n budgeting and the leaching n flux estimation therefore site specific n reaction parameters along the whole soil profile must be obtained for modeling which would provide for a more accurate assessment of n stocks losses in the vadose zone and the risk of no 3 n leaching to groundwater besides don leached to groundwater can function both as a nitrate precursor and as a facilitator of denitrification affecting no 3 n accumulation by two opposite means liu et al 2021 in other words dons can simultaneously contribute to no 3 n accumulation through mineralization and no 3 n attenuation as a denitrifying carbon source the role that takes superiority depending on the physicochemical properties of different dons determines the environmental effects of don inputs into groundwater it is thus necessary to pay attention to don both for quantity and for composition in this study it was found that soil depth has a significant impact on don composition hence the migration and transformation behavior of dons through the entire vadose zone should be analyzed with respect to the specific environmental conditions of the study area ft icr ms analysis provides a promising way to conduct this analysis laffely et al 2020 don composition in the leachate into groundwater can thus be forecasted which is essential for assessing the risk of nitrate pollution and its self attenuation potentials and sheds light on an efficient nitrate pollution management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

2626,the penetration depth of post 1950s recharge d 1950 in aquifers is a marker that is frequently used to identify groundwater that is susceptible to anthropogenic contamination here we compute d 1950 values at wells interpolate them in space and project them across time to map the moving front of modern recharge in four dimensions in the central valley aquifer system california usa tracers of groundwater age tritium carbon 14 noble gases sulfur hexafluoride and chlorofluorocarbons were collected at 650 wells spatially distributed throughout the central valley and were fit to a lumped parameter model that assumes a logarithmic age depth profile in the aquifer for samples where tritium was present 0 3 tritium units the model was used to predict d 1950 at wells screened above or across the modern premodern interface n 484 wells with samples where tritium was absent 0 3 tritium units were used to define the depth beyond which groundwater is completely premodern n 166 predicted d 1950 values were below the depth of screen bottoms for wells where groundwater is completely modern and above the depth of screen tops for wells where groundwater is completely premodern the interpolated surface of d 1950 is dynamic less prone to extreme values and produces maps with lower interpolation errors due to a higher spatial density of wells than maps based on the depth of premodern groundwater between 2005 and 2025 d 1950 is expected to deepen by 11 and 12 m in the northern and southern parts of the central valley respectively areas where d 1950 increases rapidly are likely to see increases in nitrate and other anthropogenic contaminants associated with the downward moving front of modern water keywords groundwater age environmental tracers lumped parameter model data availability https doi org 10 5066 p9cl07rx 1 introduction groundwater age is important for understanding the occurrence of contaminants and contaminant trends in aquifers anthropogenic contamination from organic shelton et al 2001 zogorski et al 2006 lindsey et al 2017 and some inorganic constituents green et al 2016 jurgens et al 2010 ransom et al 2017 is commonly associated with groundwater recharged since the 1950s as new recharge enters an aquifer each year previous recharge is pushed deeper and the proportion of groundwater that has been exposed to human activities increases over time in unconfined aquifers that have high pumping rates and recharge from extensive irrigation increased vertical seepage velocities can accelerate the vertical penetration of post 1950s groundwater in the subsurface because of the linkage between groundwater age and groundwater quality identifying and tracking the vertical movement of the depth to post 1950s modern groundwater d 1950 in aquifers is critical for understanding the long term sustainability of groundwater resources as sources of drinking water supply environmental tracers provide a reliable and cost effective way to identify water that was recharged since 1950 several naturally occurring isotopes and anthropogenic compounds commonly referred to as environmental tracers have been released into the atmosphere in large quantities from human activities since the 1950s these substances have dissolved into recharge and their measurement in groundwater can indicate the presence or absence of modern water in california s central valley there are over 90 000 domestic wells johnson and belitz 2015 and about 8 000 public supply wells california state water resources control board 2021 at this scale the measurement of environmental tracers at every domestic and public supply well is impractical however a subset of wells spatially distributed throughout the central valley could be used to map the penetration depth of post 1950s recharge thus the overall proportion of modern water in populations of domestic and public supply wells can be extrapolated from these maps tritium 3h is an ideal hydrologic tracer because it is incorporated into the water molecule its rapid increase in the atmosphere in the early 1950s michel et al 2018 makes it an important tracer of modern water visser et al 2016 used the depth of public supply wells with no detectable 3h to interpolate the depth where modern recharge is absent in aquifers throughout california although this method is useful for identifying the depths at which premodern groundwater is likely to occur it does not directly delineate the interface between modern and premodern groundwater d 1950 as a result the rate at which the moving front of post 1950s recharge occurs cannot be estimated using this method a dynamic model of d 1950 can be computed more broadly by estimating the vertical velocity of groundwater using environmental tracers the age of groundwater and the depth at which it occurs provides an estimate of the vertical flux of solutes in the aquifer while the most simplistic estimate can be made by dividing the screen depth by the age this approach assumes age grows linearly with depth in the aquifer i e a constant vertical flux however many aquifers have age depth patterns that are non linear that vary in shape depending on the aquifer configuration recharge patterns and permeability patterns leray et al 2019 for example the classic exponential model described by vogel 1967 has an age depth pattern that increases logarithmically with depth below the water table e g homogeneous unconfined aquifers vogel 1967 jurgens et al 2016 in this type of aquifer the vertical velocity is not constant and decreases with depth to the base of the active flow system where groundwater flow is entirely lateral consequently the structure of age in the aquifer is an important factor for determining the most appropriate method for estimating d 1950 spatial interpolation of point data is improved when the number of data points is large and the data points are regularly spaced isaaks and srivastava 1989 in places where production wells typically tap some fraction of modern groundwater like the central valley of california interpolated surfaces based entirely on premodern groundwater samples are constrained by relatively sparse data and can lack important regional features consequently the regional variability of d 1950 can be improved when based on data from wells with some fraction of modern water in turn the results may be adequate to extrapolate d 1950 for other wells such as drinking water wells that are not routinely sampled for environmental tracers in this study d 1950 is mapped throughout california s central valley a large agricultural region with growing population centers that rely heavily on groundwater for both public drinking water and agricultural irrigation water supply we computed groundwater ages at 650 wells by calibrating environmental tracers tritium carbon 14 noble gases chlorofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride to a simple lumped parameter model lpm that can project d 1950 in both space and time the combination of age models and geostatistical methods allow for d 1950 surfaces to be projected backward and forward in time to provide a 4 dimensional characterization of vertical groundwater movement in regional aquifers predicted d 1950 values at individual wells were projected temporally on a 5 year timestep and interpolated spatially throughout the central valley to characterize the penetration depth of modern recharge between 2005 and 2025 results of this method provide a first order characterization of the d 1950 surface in groundwater that can be used by water purveyors well drillers and water resource managers to visualize the extent and depth to which modern recharge pervades aquifer depths used for drinking water supply on broad spatial and temporal scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 calculating the depth of post 1950s groundwater the depth to post 1950s water d 1950 in an aquifer can be computed by estimating the vertical velocity of groundwater i e vertical flux of solutes at a well in aquifers with non linear age growth d 1950 can be estimated by assuming the vertical velocity decreases linearly with depth in this case d 1950 will penetrate more slowly as it deepens because the flowlines in the aquifer gradually change from completely vertical at the top to completely horizontal at the base fig 1 a this vertical velocity profile was derived by vogel 1967 for unconfined aquifers that receive uniform recharge across the landscape and have constant thickness aquifers where permeability decreases with depth or have different geometries and recharge characteristics leray et al 2019 can have non linear age growth patterns like the logarithmic pattern described by vogel 1967 the logarithmic age depth pattern therefore provides a reasonable approximation to estimate d 1950 in aquifers with non linear age depth patterns to illustrate the calculation of d 1950 a hypothetical aquifer based on the exponential model vogel 1967 is shown in fig 1 this aquifer has a uniform recharge rate r of 0 4 m per year a constant thickness of 100 m h and a porosity φ of 0 3 from equation 1 the mean residence time of groundwater in the aquifer τ aq is 75 years and from equation 2 d 1950 is 52 m below the water table mbwt in the year 2005 these aquifer properties also define the mean age of groundwater from wells partially screened within the aquifer τ s which is computed from equation 3 using the τ aq and the construction characteristics d 1950 can be computed either from the mean age of groundwater from a well or from the mean residence time of the aquifer since knowing one allows computation of the other in this study we computed τ aq from τ s 1 τ aq h φ r 2 d 1950 h 1 exp t 1950 τ uz τ aq 3 τ s h τ aq z 2 z 1 h z 2 h ln h z 2 h h z 2 h h z 1 h ln h z 1 h h z 1 h where τ aq is the mean residence time of groundwater in the aquifer h is the saturated thickness of the aquifer r is the recharge rate φ is porosity d 1950 is the depth to 1950 year water t is the sample year τ uz is the travel time through the unsaturated zone τ s is the mean age of the sample z 1 is the depth to the top well screen below the water table and z 2 is the depth to the bottom well screen below the water table in the hypothetical case shown in fig 1 the aquifer would have the age and tracer profile shown in fig 1b and samples from the wells would yield the tracer concentrations shown in fig 1c the mean age of groundwater samples τ s from a well can be computed by fitting the tracer concentrations fig 1c to the partial exponential model pem the pem was derived in jurgens et al 2016 and is applicable to wells that partially penetrate an aquifer such that the top of screen is below the water table or the bottom of screen is above the base of the aquifer in this example calibration of the tracers to the pem recovers the theoretical mean age for each well τ s based on equation 3 with corresponding age distributions shown in fig 1d thus d 1950 is correctly predicted at 52 mbwt for each well by calibration of the pem to environmental tracers measured in each well as this example shows wells need not be screened across d 1950 to estimate its depth in an aquifer a temporal model of d 1950 can be found by replacing the sample year with a specific year of interest this allows for comparisons of samples taken years apart projecting d 1950 to a year other than the sample year assumes that the aquifer is at steady state 2 2 model sensitivity calculation of d 1950 relies on measurements of environmental tracers and estimates of depth to water and aquifer thickness for the hypothetical aquifer described above only two tracers are required for the successful recovery of the mean age of each well and hence d 1950 one of the tracers must be tritium tritium has a historical record that is capable of dating groundwater since the early 1950s but it is often insufficient to constrain the mean age alone because the tritium record in precipitation has long term and short term patterns that rise and fall this can cause modeled ages to be non unique for example multiple groundwater ages are possible for well 1 fig 1 when tritium is the only tracer used to constrain the model in this case the modeled ages can deviate as much as 50 from the true age which leads to calculated d 1950 errors of 30 errors associated with estimates of aquifer thickness and water levels have minor effects overall but can be significant when wells are located close to the base of the aquifer or to the water table for the hypothetical example in fig 1 doubling the aquifer thickness can lead to d 1950 errors of as much as 25 but the errors are not one sided table 1 d 1950 is overestimated in shallow wells and underestimated in deep wells whereas wells screened across the d 1950 interface are largely unaffected in general wells that are shallower or deeper than the d 1950 interface are affected by aquifer thickness errors inversely table 1 shallow wells will underestimate d 1950 when the aquifer thickness is too small and overestimate d 1950 when aquifer thickness is too large likewise deeper wells will underestimate d 1950 when aquifer thickness is too large and overestimate d 1950 when aquifer thickness is too small water level errors of 5 m caused d 1950 to deviate less than 20 overall table 1 changes in water levels affect the calculated aquifer thickness because the depth to the base of aquifer was assumed to be constant overall shallow wells were affected by water level errors more than deep wells table 1 d 1950 for the shallow well was underestimated when depth to water was overestimated by 5 m and d 1950 was overestimated when depth to water underestimated by 5 m groundwater levels can be measured or estimated using local monitoring data or models aquifer thickness is harder to define and relies on the practitioner s hydrogeologic knowledge of the study area both geologic aquitard and flow system depth to predominantly lateral flow boundaries can be used to estimate this parameter 2 3 description of study area the central valley is an asymmetrical structural trough filled with marine and continental sediments up to 15 km thick covering an area of more than 50 000 km squared bounded by the cascade range to the north the sierra nevada to the east the klamath mountains and coast ranges to the west and the tehachapi mountains to the south fig 2 the sacramento valley groundwater basin sacv occupies the northern third of the central valley and the san joaquin valley groundwater basin sjv occupies the southern two thirds of the central valley fig 2 the sjv can be further divided into the basins of the san joaquin river hydrologic region sjr and the tulare lake hydrologic region tlr california department of water resources 2020 the sjr occupies the northern half of the sjv and is drained by the san joaquin river the tlr occupies the southern half of the sjv and is an internally drained closed basin faunt et al 2009 fig 2 the climate in the central valley is arid to semiarid average annual precipitation decreases from north to south ranging from 330 to 660 mm in the sacv to 130 to 460 mm in the sjv prior to agricultural development in the central valley the primary sources of recharge to the aquifer were precipitation and seepage from rivers draining the surrounding mountains the primary form of groundwater discharge was to rivers and perennial lakes in the trough of the central valley williamson et al 1989 post development sources of recharge and discharge are excess applied irrigation and groundwater pumping respectively faunt et al 2009 steady state recharge discharge was about 2 million acre ft yr prior to development and is now about 12 million acre ft yr williamson et al 1989 faunt et al 2009 the central valley aquifer system includes unconfined semi confined and confined aquifers which are primarily contained within the upper 300 m of alluvial sediments that were deposited by streams draining the surrounding sierra nevada and coast ranges page 1986 california department of water resources 2020 faunt et al 2009 the aquifer sediments are heterogeneous and typically range from 30 to 70 coarse grained texture throughout the valley the sacv is distinctly more fine grained than the sjv faunt et al 2010 in much of the western side of the sjv the aquifer system is divided into an upper and lower zone by the corcoran clay member of the tulare formation a regionally extensive clay layer that may limit vertical movement of groundwater page 1986 williamson et al 1989 belitz and heimes 1990 burow et al 2004 however the corcoran clay member of the tulare formation no longer acts as a perfect confining layer because of the number of wells that perforate it williamson et al 1989 dubrovsky et al 1991 fram 2017 2 4 well networks groundwater samples were collected from 650 wells in the central valley between 2004 and 2017 sampling was done as part of the california state water resources control board s groundwater ambient monitoring and assessment program priority basin project gama pbp a statewide groundwater quality monitoring program belitz et al 2003 wells were sampled as regional studies within the central valley fig s1 wells were primarily selected using a stratified grid based randomized design belitz et al 2010 resulting in a spatially distributed set of wells throughout the central valley in this dataset 388 wells were sampled from 2004 through 2011 to assess the quality of water used for public supply psa landon et al 2010 bennett et al 2010 2011 burton et al 2012 shelton et al 2013 fram 2017 and 153 wells were sampled from 2013 through 2017 to assess the quality of water used for domestic supply dsa shelton and fram 2017 bennett et al 2017 2019 jurgens et al 2018 an additional 109 wells were sampled to supplement the psa network of wells these secondary sites ssu were used for understanding water quality along regional transects and were not restricted to the depths used for public supply the psa dataset spans the entire spatial extent of the central valley whereas sites for the dsa study are in two subregions of the central valley the southern sacv and the southeastern sjv fig 2a supplemental fig s1 data for some psa and ssu sites were from samples collected after the initial sampling campaign to study temporal water quality trends kent and landon 2016 jurgens et al 2018 psa sites are typically public supply wells 70 or are other well types screened within the depth zone of groundwater used for public supply psa wells are typically constructed to deeper depths and have longer well screens than dsa wells table 2 the ssu wells are typically monitoring wells that have shorter screens and can be screened shallower or deeper than dsa wells depths of the wells from both datasets are summarized in table 2 and listed in faulkner and jurgens 2022 2 5 environmental tracers noble gases helium neon argon krypton and xenon tritium 3h chlorofluorocarbons cfcs sulfur hexafluoride sf6 carbon 14 14c and helium isotopes were collected and analyzed not all tracers were collected at every well fig 2b all tracer data are downloadable from the gama pbp groundwater quality results website and the usgs national water information system nwis database u s geological survey 2016 jurgens et al 2018 recharge temperature excess air and gas fractionation were determined from dissolved gases measured in 556 samples neon argon krypton and xenon using the computer program dgmeta faulkner and jurgens 2022 jurgens et al 2021 dissolved gas models were paired with measured concentrations of cfcs and sf6 to determine atmospheric mixing ratios of cfcs and sf6 dissolved gas models were paired with measurements of helium tritium and helium isotopes to determine the concentrations of tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit from the decay of tritium and radiogenic heluim 4 4herad from decay of uranium and thorium in aquifer sediments average 3hetrit cfcs sf6 and 4herad concentrations were computed when wells had multiple dissolved gas model results and analyses of helium isotopes groundwater can appear older when dead carbon 14c free dissolves from carbonate minerals or organic matter in the aquifer dilution of 14c in groundwater from dissolution of carbonate rock was accounted for by scaling the atmospheric 14c record to match relationships with modern tracers such as 3h 3hetrit sf6 and cfcs see the faulkner and jurgens 2022 for more information about the data collection and processing of data used for modeling groundwater ages tracer errors for 3hetrit cfcs and sf6 were computed by dgmeta jurgens et al 2020 and account for errors in recharge conditions and analytical uncertainty values of 3hetrit had median errors of 7 with an interquartile range of 4 to 18 cfcs and sf6 had median errors of 18 with an interquartile range of 10 to 40 errors for 14c and 4herad were set to 5 of their values 3h which is the most ideal tracer was set to 1 this value forces the calibrated models to adhere most strongly to 3h concentrations but it overestimates the actual precision of 3h measurements analytical uncertainty of tritium measurements is about 0 1 tu assignment of lower tracer errors will often yield similar modeled ages but with lower errors associated with the mean age consequently mean age errors are likely underestimated with these tracer errors 2 6 groundwater age calculations the mean age of each sample was determined by fitting a single pem or a binary pem two pems to measurements of one or more environmental tracers using the computer program tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 jurgens et al 2016 to guide the selection of a single pem or a binary pem for modeling the age distribution samples were categorized as either modern premodern or mixed modern premodern based on the tritium classification scheme described in lindsey et al 2019 a single pem was used to model the age of modern and premodern samples and a binary pem was used to model the age of mixed samples mixed samples can be misclassified as modern when the mean age of modern water is around the 1963 bomb peak because high 3h in modern water can mask the presence of premodern water consequently 3h and the other tracer concentrations were plotted graphically against model output concentrations of a single pem and a binary pem for a range of mean ages and mixtures to verify or adjust each sample s classification and modeling calibration of the models was found by varying the fitting parameter mean age for example until the chi square error which is the difference between measured and output concentrations relative to the measurement error was minimized models with a chi square error less than 10 were considered acceptable these were models that have a chi square probability greater than 0 1 or have an average model tracer concentration that is within 10 of their measured values indicating a reasonable solution has been found the best fit mean age and its error was determined from an inverse method similar to the one described by johnson and faunt 1992 errors associated with the fitted parameters mean age for example were taken from the diagonal terms of the variance covariance matrix all modeling results are published in faulkner and jurgens 2022 the number of tracers had to be equal to or greater than the number of fitting parameters to find a unique solution to the mean age about 70 of samples had two or more tracers to constrain the modeled age distribution in cases where the number of tracers was insufficient to constrain all fitted parameters multiple model solutions were computed by fixing one parameter over a range of possible values and fitting the other parameters at each parameter step the set of model solutions with chi square values less than 10 represent a range of ages that can explain the tracer data the pem has two fitting parameters mean age τ s and unsaturated zone uz travel time binary pems a combination of two pems used to represent modern and premodern groundwater fractions have 3 fitting parameters mean age of the modern fraction τ s fraction of modern water and mean age of the premodern fraction the uz travel time was ignored in binary pems because it was difficult to constrain consistently without measurable 3hetrit at all sites the median uz time for single mixtures was 3 years which suggests it would be negligible relative to the mean age of modern water in most cases the pem has two fixed parameters one parameter each for the relative positions of the top z 1 and bottom z 2 screen depths within the saturated thickness of the aquifer h depth to water for binary pems the well screen is partitioned into two sections an upper section of modern water and a lower section of premodern water fig 3 the fraction of modern water is used to divide the screen length and each section is treated as a separate aquifer with different mean residence times recharge characteristics that can account for the simultaneous presence of modern and premodern water in a groundwater sample fig 3 during the calibration process the well screen partition adjusts vertically z m as the fraction of modern water changes after each iteration step fig 3 the depth of the modern premodern interface z m is 4 z m h h z 1 h f m h z 2 h h z 1 h where z m was the screen depth that separates the modern and premodern groundwater and f m was the fraction of modern water in the binary pem when the fraction of modern water is zero the separation depth is at or above the screen top when the fraction of modern water is 1 the separation depth is at or below the screen bottom for modern samples recharged solely after 1950 the uz travel times were characterized using a set of solutions rather than a single solution tritiogenic helium 3 which is sensitive to travel time delays through the uz and 3h were the primary tracers used to constrain the pem multiple solutions were computed by fixing the uz travel time over a range of up to 30 years which reduced the calibration process to a single parameter τ s thus requiring a single tracer the set of solutions that met the acceptance criteria provided a possible range of uz travel times that explain measure tracer concentrations the best fit uz travel time was used for calculations of d 1950 for premodern samples solely recharged before 1950 the uz travel time was ignored because it would have been small in comparison to the mean age of water which was often thousands of years old carbon 14 was the primary constraint on mean age in cases where the radiogenic helium 4 age was similar to the carbon 14 age helium was included to better characterize the potential error around the age of premodern water mixed samples modern and premodern were modeled using a binary pem multiple model solutions were computed to constrain the possible ranges of modern water fractions and mean ages of premodern water in these samples multiple solutions were computed by fixing the mean age of modern water for a range of ages between 2 and the number of years between the sample date and 1945 typically around 60 years the set of solutions that met the acceptance criteria provided a range of possible fractions of modern water their corresponding modern premodern separation depths and ages of premodern water present in a sample in some cases 14c was not available therefore the same procedure was used with an arbitrary value of 500 years which simulates tritium free concentrations in the mixture for each model solution the modern mean age was used to compute d 1950 the model with a d 1950 that matched the separation depth between modern and premodern water z m was selected from the set of model solutions most of these samples had mean ages of modern water greater than 28 years indicating that these binary mixtures were consistent with infiltration of older modern water that mixes with premodern water in wells the output concentration of a pem is computed by convolution of the tracer history in recharge for a given mean age jurgens et al 2012 jurgens et al 2016 regional records of 3h in precipitation for each site were compiled from michel et al 2018 based on their latitude longitude position and used to compute concentrations of 3h and 3hetrit from the pem atmospheric records of 14c over the last 50 000 years were constructed by combining the international calibration curve nh intcal13 reimer and others 2013 with modern tropospheric 14c data for northern hemisphere zones zones 2 hua et al 2013 the northern atmospheric concentration records for the cfcs and sf6 were compiled by the u s geological survey reston groundwater dating laboratory at half year time increments u s geological survey 2017 radiogenic helium production rates were computed from average abundances of uranium and thorium in surficial sediments of the central valley phillips et al 1993 a porosity of 0 2 and a bulk density of 2 2 2 7 water levels and aquifer thickness estimates of groundwater levels and depth to base of aquifer were used to define the saturated thickness of the aquifer h groundwater levels measured at the well were used when the measurement date was within the last decade of the sample date measured water levels from 230 wells were compiled from the usgs nwis database u s geological survey 2016 for wells where water level was not measured interpolated maps of spring water levels were used from levy 2021 supplemental fig s2a if interpolated groundwater levels were not available the simulated spring 2000 water table depth from the central valley hydrologic model was used faunt et al 2009 the aquifer thickness h was calculated by subtracting the depth to water wl from the depth to the base of the aquifer baq i e h baq wl for this study the base of the aquifer was assumed to be the depth of public supply wells municipal wells and large irrigation wells are typically constructed to greater depths and pump greater volumes than other well types faunt 2009 for the most part the vertical movement of solutes and tracers will be within the saturated thickness where these wells occur which encompasses the aquifer capture zone for both drinking water and most agricultural extractions aquifer thickness for each well was taken from interpolated raster surfaces developed by voss et al 2019 who characterized the 90th percentile of public supply well depths throughout the central valley supplemental fig s2b the depth to the bottom screened interval was used as the depth to the base of the aquifer when sampled wells had well screens below the 90th percentile 2 8 interpolation spatial interpolation of d 1950 calculations was done using empirical bayesian kriging ebk ebk differs from ordinary kriging in that ebk uses overlapping subsets of points each point falling into an average of 5 subsets of 100 points in this study to generate iterative semivariogram models 100 simulations in this study to improve interpolation and it accounts for the error associated with the semivariogram esri 2021a predictions at a point are calculated using the semivariograms from all subsets that contain the neighboring points 10 to 15 neighbors in this study empirical transformations were performed using the k bessel semivariogram model the geographic coordinates of the well locations in decimal degrees were projected into coordinates in meters using albers equal area conic projection well known id 5070 with a central meridian of 120 and rotated clockwise by 30 44 degrees about the point 38 818 m and 1 280 164 m the ebk results were transformed to raster surfaces with a raster cell size of 0 5 km for further analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater age in the central valley the mean age of groundwater from wells ranged from less than one year to nearly 80 000 years supplemental fig s3 faulkner and jurgens 2022 mean groundwater ages were typically older in the sacv than in the sjv table 3 in the sacv groundwater ages were not distinctly different among site types sediments in the sacv are finer grained than in the sjv sacv also has more abundant surface water and is less reliant on groundwater than the sjv these factors likely contribute to the more widespread occurrence of pre 1950 water from wells in the sacv in the sjv groundwater ages were typically older in psa wells than in dsa and ssu wells table 3 groundwater ages were indeterminate at 25 wells because 3h was the only tracer and its concentration was less than 0 3 tu indicating the age was older than the dating range of 3h for these samples about 58 of the wells sampled in this study were binary mixtures of modern and premodern water this percentage is consistent with prior results showing the prevalence of mixed age water in other parts of the central valley alikhani et al 2016 jurgens et al 2016 wells with binary mixtures of groundwater had a median screen length of 30 m whereas wells with strictly modern water had a median screen length of 10 m wells with long screens are more likely to intersect the modern premodern groundwater interface travel time through the unsaturated zone can be an important contributor to the age in some parts of the central valley for samples with modern water the median uz travel time was 3 years uz travel time was not significantly correlated to the depth of the water table spearman s rho 0 08 p value 0 05 which suggests the unsaturated zone thickness is not the only factor affecting recharge to the aquifer uz travel times were greater in the sjv than in the sacv fifty two percent of samples with modern water had uz travel times over 10 years in the sjv whereas only 37 of samples had uz travel times over 10 years in sacv the water table tends to be deeper in the sjv than in the sacv supplemental fig s2a mean age was positively correlated to depth between the water table and the top of the well screen in both the sacv spearman s rho 0 50 p value less than 0 001 and the sjv spearman s rho 0 44 p value less than 0 001 indicating that groundwater age increases with depth below the water table this is consistent with a logarithmic model of age growth depicted in figs 1 and 3 however a linear model of age growth will also yield a positive correlation between depth and age these two types of age models were evaluated by looking at the age depth relationship of domestic wells in two locations in the central valley one set of domestic wells in the southern sacv and another set of domestic wells in southeast sjv fig 4 these wells had the full suite of age tracers 3h 3hetrit sf6 14c and 4herad needed to constrain the age models in both places the logarithmic relationship straight line on fig 4 provided a better fit to the modeling results the logarithmic relationship is consistent the pem assumption however it is not substantially better than the linear model making it difficult to distinguish a clear pattern wells that are spatially distributed over a wide area may have groundwater ages and depth patterns that result from different rates of vertical flow locally so the aggregation of spatially distributed data may confound the relationship between mean age and depth two previous studies in the sjv also found a logarithmic relationship between mean age and depth in nested multi level monitoring wells jurgens et al 2008 burow et al 2012 which suggests the logarithmic model may be more appropriate for modeling the dynamic penetration of d 1950 mean age errors were less than 20 in 85 of all samples n 533 which suggests that mean age is reasonably constrained in most samples however some models were non unique when only a single tracer of modern water namely 3h was used in the calibration tritium was the only tracer used to calibrate the modeled age at about 20 of samples 125 of 625 and 13 of these were modeled as binary pems for these samples multiple model solutions were computed that resulted in a span of potential ages this range was often greater than 30 years and can correspond to an error of about 50 the potential span of ages at these sites increases the uncertainty of d 1950 overall 74 of samples had 2 or more tracers to calibrate age 3 2 depth to post 1950s groundwater predicted values of d 1950 were computed from pem models of modern water at 484 wells in the central valley only samples with 3h values greater than 0 3 tu indicating the presence of modern recharge were used to model d 1950 based on 3h in precipitation records the highest 3h activity in groundwater that could have originated in 1950 and could be measured in 2008 was about 0 3 tu this 3h cutoff marks groundwater depths with a clear modern 3h signal although tritiated groundwater can occur below this depth the cutoff also removed model results with low level 3h activities that may have traveled to the well through the annular seal or was introduced by water lubrication of pumps or by leaky check valves that allow backflow of water from the distribution system in these situations the modeled ages may not be representative of the groundwater movement within the aquifer and hence were poor estimates of d 1950 samples were modeled as either a binary of two pems one for modern water and another for premodern water or as a single pem of modern water in all cases d 1950 values were based on the pem for the modern water there was no systematic difference between d 1950 values computed for samples modeled with a single pem and samples modeled with a binary of two pems supplemental table s1 in the central valley deviations between modeled and actual d 1950 values can occur from the assumption of aquifer homogeneity this assumption presumes that flow to the well is captured over the entire length of screen however sediments in the central valley are a heterogenous mix of clay silt sand and gravel that can lead to non uniform flow over the length of screen faunt et al 2009 jurgens et al 2008 d 1950 may be overestimated or underestimated when modern water enters the well at discrete intervals along the screen for example the pem can project deeper penetration of post 1950s recharge at wells where deeper sections of screen contribute little to no flow to the well the pem assumes the oldest ages are entering near the screen bottom however these no flow zones are caused by presence of clay lenses in the aquifer that can indicate the oldest ages have not penetrated to those depths and that vertical movement of groundwater is more restricted than would be predicted for samples with a binary pem d 1950 can be underestimated when the modern water is younger than the mean age from the selected model these issues are often specific to each well and did not tend to bias results of one model type over the other d 1950 was not computed at 166 sites where 3h was less than 0 3 tu at these sites modern water was largely absent and the median age of premodern groundwater was 7 000 years although the pem can predict d 1950 from wells with premodern water this groundwater was recharged during more natural recharge conditions when pumping from wells and surface water routing through reservoirs was absent consequently d 1950 values from premodern water are much shallower than estimates based on the current recharge and pumping environment fig 3 therefore d 1950 values were based solely on modern groundwater however the top of screen depth of sites with solely premodern groundwater provide a lower vertical boundary to evaluate the efficacy of the d 1950 predictions d 1950 should not be deeper than this boundary d 1950 ranged from about 5 to 317 m below the land surface mbls in the central valley fig 5 a d the median d 1950 is deeper in the sjv 77 mbls than in the sacv 57 mbls in the sacv d 1950 did not vary substantially relative to the water table from west to east fig 5a but did vary with distance from the sacramento san joaquin delta in the northern third of the sacv fig 5b in the sjv d 1950 tended to be deeper in the western portion of the valley fig 5c and was deeper with distance from the delta fig 5d of the 484 wells with modern water computed d 1950 values were below the bottom screen at 35 of wells these wells had groundwater that was completely modern with younger mean ages the median mean age of groundwater at these wells was 29 years which is equivalent to an apparent recharge date of 1981 consequently d 1950 values are consistent with the expectation that post 1950s water is deeper than the depth of these wells about 65 of wells with modern water had computed d 1950 values that were within the screened interval this finding is consistent with the prevalence of mixed age water that is often observed at long screened wells throughout the central valley fig 3 jurgens et al 2016 a line of the moving average of d 1950 values blue line on fig 5 for four transects across the valley shows that 3h is generally greater than 0 3 tu above this depth there were several sites with tritium below the average d 1950 line and sites where tritium was absent were above the d 1950 line fig 5 these discrepancies were most often caused by the 2 d projection that masked local d 1950 trends a line of the moving average of the top of screens for wells with solely premodern groundwater red line on fig 5 was more often deeper than the d 1950 line but there are places where it is shallower than d 1950 in both sacv and sjv discrepancies between the two depths occur in areas where the number of wells with either estimate is low but in general d 1950 is better constrained in most areas because 75 of wells out of 650 were used to compute d 1950 some sites with premodern water were shallower than the d 1950 line fig 5 shallow premodern water can occur where groundwater is not vertically driven downward such as near major groundwater discharge areas along the axial trough of the central valley relative position 0 on fig 5a and 5c premodern groundwater at shallow depths can occur where groundwater movement is more lateral than vertical in places where groundwater movement is lateral d 1950 would be shallower relative to d 1950 under vertical groundwater movement with increasing lateral travel distance shallow premodern groundwater occurs more frequently in sacv than in the sjv which could indicate that the sacv contains more lateral groundwater flow than the sjv 3 3 sensitivity predicted d 1950 values were more sensitive to uncertainties in mean age than to uncertainties in water level depth and aquifer thickness predicted d 1950 values had median errors of 6 5 m 3 m and 3 m for uncertainties associated with modeled ages depth to water and aquifer thickness respectively these errors were derived by applying a 20 uncertainty to modeled groundwater ages depth to water table and aquifer thickness a fixed uncertainty was applied to evaluate the relative importance of each parameter to computed d 1950 values although more than 80 of modeled ages had standard errors less than 10 this error can be small when the models are constrained by 2 or fewer tracers consequently a 20 error on age was used to account for possible errors due to sparsity of tracer data at sites and model non uniqueness a 20 error for water levels and aquifer thickness is reasonable because 75 of wells with a measured water level had deviated no more than 20 from water levels estimated by interpolation levy 2021 levy et al 2021 or from numerical groundwater flow models faunt et al 2009 in the central valley the aquifer is much thicker than the aquifer thicknesses used to compute d 1950 faunt 2009 for the pem the thickness should be constrained by the system of active tracer transport in this case the active system is driven by the capture zones of public supply and irrigation wells in the central valley increasing the thickness beyond these depths would cause the distribution of age to expand to the detriment of the calibration of age tracers for example a thicker aquifer would cause the wells to have more narrow age distributions piston flow like than would be expected based on the screen length a narrower age distribution could lead to poorer model fits to the measured tracers 3 4 interpolation an interpolated surface of predicted d 1950 was computed by projecting all pems to the year 2005 for the 484 samples with modern water and kriging the resultant point estimates of d 1950 in mbls across the valley fig 6 a in the sacv d 1950 had a raster cell average depth of 56 mbls and ranged from 21 to 113 mbls in the sjv d 1950 had a raster cell average depth of 82 mbls and ranged from 33 to 159 mbls cross validation using the leave one out method on the d 1950 datasets was performed as part of the ebk interpolation algorithm this method compares a predicted and measured value at a point to measure the accuracy of the prediction about 96 of the results were within a 95 confidence interval for d 1950 the average standard errors fig 6b were similar to the root mean squared prediction errors which indicated the spatial variability was well predicted esri 2021b the interpolated surfaces represent spatially weighted averages of d 1950 where some fraction of modern water is present in wells kriging tends to smooth outliers in areas where data are denser but is highly influenced by values in areas where data are sparse if sparse data are unreliable it could have a negative effect on the kriging results overall d 1950 kriging errors were less than 25 m across 83 of the area of the central valley standard errors were generally low where well density was high and errors increased as density was reduced this indicated that the error was more closely related to a lack of data than to disagreement of d 1950 at the well locations fig 6b well density in the northern sjv was low and d 1950 errors were higher in this area errors also may not have been well defined where wells were absent for example the low errors in the southwestern sjv where wells were largely absent resulted from extrapolation from the east the area with the lowest standard error is in the northeastern tlr where well density is highest in the future additional groundwater age results in areas of low well density like the northern sjv should strengthen predicted d 1950 values the interpolated d 1950 surfaces followed basin scale trends and highlighted features that can be influenced by municipal pumping surface water sources and deepening of the water table there were localized depressions of d 1950 near the metropolitan areas of chico davis sacramento stockton and tracy these depressions were likely caused by urban pumping which tends to draw modern water deeper into the aquifer these depressions in d 1950 were not seen in the fresno metropolitan area likely because of the lateral groundwater flow created by reestablishment of surface water flows to the san joaquin river north of the city in this area groundwater flow may move more laterally than vertically in response to pumping in the city there is also a shallow broad depression in d 1950 north of fresno in the southern sjr that is consistent with measured water level decline and subsidence in this area i e d 1950 was drawn deeper with the declining water level faunt et al 2016 levy et al 2021 d 1950 exceeded 100 m across much of the southern tlr depth to water in the southern tlr exceeded 180 m supplemental fig s2a however the median d 1950 value in tlr is 44 mbwt which is similar to the 45 mbwt median depth for the entire central valley this indicated that the greater depth of d 1950 in tlr is mostly due to greater depths to water 3 5 model verification the predicted d 1950 surface was compared to the interpolated prediction of the depth of the top of well screens producing completely premodern water spatial surfaces of this depth were made using the same interpolation method as the predicted d 1950 surface in fig 6 the predicted surface the interpolation errors and the deviation of the predicted surface to d 1950 are shown in fig 7 the predicted depth of the top of well screens producing completely premodern water fig 7a is deeper than the predicted d 1950 fig 6 across 87 of the central valley and by more than 15 m across 69 of the area fig 7b the depth to premodern groundwater surface provides a lower vertical boundary for the predicted d 1950 surface because wells producing completely premodern water must be below the depth of the modern and premodern interface consequently the large amount of area where the predicted d 1950 surface is shallower than the top of screens of wells producing completely premodern water provides confidence the exponential model does not frequently overpredict the penetration depth of modern water fig 7b the map of predicted depth of premodern water shares some of the same spatial features as the map of the depth to screen tops of wells producing tritium free groundwater made by visser et al 2016 which is expected because the underlying data are mostly the same the depression around davis was previously shown by visser et al 2016 as an area where depth to tritium free groundwater is more than 150 mbls overall the depth of premodern water has fewer wells to constrain the predicted surface as compared to the predicted d 1950 surface because modern water is present in 75 of wells in this study consequently the kriging error of the depth of completely premodern water is over 25 m in more than 50 of the area in the central valley fig 7c despite the fewer number of wells and larger prediction errors the predicted depth of premodern water provides a lower depth boundary the predicted d 1950 surface rarely exceeds fig 5 and fig 7b a map of d 1950 values computed using a linear age depth relationship was also compared to the predicted d 1950 value in the supplemental material supplemental results supplemental fig s9 d 1950 values were similar but were more often deeper and had larger kriging errors as compared to the predicted d 1950s 3 6 temporal projections temporal projections of d 1950 and the proportion of post 1950s water p 1950 were made to visualize how the moving front of modern recharge migrates vertically through the central valley aquifer system over time p 1950 is computed by removing the aquifer thickness h from equation 2 projecting d 1950 or p 1950 to a year other than the sample year assumes the aquifer is at steady state constant recharge and this assumption may be violated in places with long term groundwater levels declines faunt et al 2009 levy et al 2021 however the projections provide first order estimates of the dynamic penetration depth of modern recharge through regional aquifer systems that are vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination projections were made from 2005 to 2025 in 5 year increments supplemental figs s5 s6 and the changes in d 1950 and p 1950 between 2005 and 2025 are shown in fig 8 and between 2005 and other years in figures s7 and s8 projections of d 1950 were not systematically different between model types supplemental table 1 model projections assuming constant recharge rates of calibrated pems show that d 1950 will increase by more than 10 m in most areas between 2005 and 2025 fig 8a the largest changes occur in the southern sjv that also coincide with some of the largest water level declines over the last decade levy et al 2021 the cities of tracy and chico also had the high rates of d 1950 penetration although deeper penetration of modern water will increase the proportion of modern water in the aquifer areas where the proportion of modern water increases most do not always correspond to the areas with the highest penetration rates in the sacv and northern sjv p 1950 is projected to increase more than the southern sjv because the estimated aquifer extent h that is currently used for drinking water supply is thinner in those areas when projected to the year 2025 the raster cell average d 1950 was 67 and 95 m in the sacv and sjv respectively supplemental fig s6e on average d 1950 is predicted to travel about 11 and 12 m deeper in the sacv and sjv respectively over this twenty year time span in 2005 d 1950 was at least 15 m shallower than the depth to premodern water which suggest that most sites that are entirely premodern will likely still be premodern in 2025 by 2025 the average proportion is predicted to similarly increase in the sacv 0 34 to 0 42 and in the sjv 0 29 to 0 38 penetration rates of d 1950 are over 1 m per year across 2 of the central valley these results indicate that pem projections of the vertical penetration rate of d 1950 is slow but reasonable for most areas in the central valley future work could evaluate its usefulness as a marker of groundwater vulnerability for wells screened above or across the surface 4 conclusions in this study the moving front of post 1950s modern recharge was modeled using a large dataset of multi tracer suites measured at 484 wells throughout california s central valley the combination of simple lumped parameter models with robust geostatistical techniques allowed for aggregation of groundwater age data on variable temporal and broad spatial scales these methods can be used in the central valley and elsewhere to provide first order estimates of time variant groundwater recharge processes that have direct impacts on groundwater quality trends that are critical to assess drinking water supply vulnerability however these methods are less applicable to aquifers where groundwater flow is not vertically dominated such as confined aquifers or in larger alluvial basins where recharge is dominated by mountain front recharge furthermore in systems where the assumptions of hydrologic steady state are violated such as heavily pumped aquifers care should be taken when combining results from wells sampled during very different hydrologic conditions mean age errors are the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of d 1950 uncertainty in mean age calculation is lessened when more environmental tracer measurements are available to constrain lpms at each site the interpolation of d 1950 between well locations assumes that groundwater age is spatially correlated and that heterogeneity can be neglected these assumptions appear to hold in this study based on lower interpolation error near well locations in areas where well density is higher error associated with the interpolation of d 1950 is generally higher with low data density in the central valley wells with some modern water were about 3 times more prevalent as wells with solely premodern water consequently the frequency of modern water in wells the set of tracers available at each well and the spatial density of wells are important factors affecting the spatial resolution of the mapped surface of d 1950 in an aquifer spatial interpolation of d 1950 and p 1950 highlighted areas where vertical seepage rates are high and modern recharge pervades aquifer systems used for drinking water supply projected penetration of d 1950 into the future showed that the sjv will likely have the greatest deepening of modern water this could be due to higher concentrated recharge and pumping rates in areas supporting irrigated agriculture and has important implications for sustainable groundwater management future work will test the capability of the d 1950 maps to predict the vulnerability of groundwater contamination using statistical machine learning models because of the implications of groundwater age for explaining water quality machine learning methods that link mapped drivers of groundwater age like recharge with process based models like the exponential model used in this study could improve the spatial interpolation and extrapolation of results credit authorship contribution statement kirsten e faulkner

2626,the penetration depth of post 1950s recharge d 1950 in aquifers is a marker that is frequently used to identify groundwater that is susceptible to anthropogenic contamination here we compute d 1950 values at wells interpolate them in space and project them across time to map the moving front of modern recharge in four dimensions in the central valley aquifer system california usa tracers of groundwater age tritium carbon 14 noble gases sulfur hexafluoride and chlorofluorocarbons were collected at 650 wells spatially distributed throughout the central valley and were fit to a lumped parameter model that assumes a logarithmic age depth profile in the aquifer for samples where tritium was present 0 3 tritium units the model was used to predict d 1950 at wells screened above or across the modern premodern interface n 484 wells with samples where tritium was absent 0 3 tritium units were used to define the depth beyond which groundwater is completely premodern n 166 predicted d 1950 values were below the depth of screen bottoms for wells where groundwater is completely modern and above the depth of screen tops for wells where groundwater is completely premodern the interpolated surface of d 1950 is dynamic less prone to extreme values and produces maps with lower interpolation errors due to a higher spatial density of wells than maps based on the depth of premodern groundwater between 2005 and 2025 d 1950 is expected to deepen by 11 and 12 m in the northern and southern parts of the central valley respectively areas where d 1950 increases rapidly are likely to see increases in nitrate and other anthropogenic contaminants associated with the downward moving front of modern water keywords groundwater age environmental tracers lumped parameter model data availability https doi org 10 5066 p9cl07rx 1 introduction groundwater age is important for understanding the occurrence of contaminants and contaminant trends in aquifers anthropogenic contamination from organic shelton et al 2001 zogorski et al 2006 lindsey et al 2017 and some inorganic constituents green et al 2016 jurgens et al 2010 ransom et al 2017 is commonly associated with groundwater recharged since the 1950s as new recharge enters an aquifer each year previous recharge is pushed deeper and the proportion of groundwater that has been exposed to human activities increases over time in unconfined aquifers that have high pumping rates and recharge from extensive irrigation increased vertical seepage velocities can accelerate the vertical penetration of post 1950s groundwater in the subsurface because of the linkage between groundwater age and groundwater quality identifying and tracking the vertical movement of the depth to post 1950s modern groundwater d 1950 in aquifers is critical for understanding the long term sustainability of groundwater resources as sources of drinking water supply environmental tracers provide a reliable and cost effective way to identify water that was recharged since 1950 several naturally occurring isotopes and anthropogenic compounds commonly referred to as environmental tracers have been released into the atmosphere in large quantities from human activities since the 1950s these substances have dissolved into recharge and their measurement in groundwater can indicate the presence or absence of modern water in california s central valley there are over 90 000 domestic wells johnson and belitz 2015 and about 8 000 public supply wells california state water resources control board 2021 at this scale the measurement of environmental tracers at every domestic and public supply well is impractical however a subset of wells spatially distributed throughout the central valley could be used to map the penetration depth of post 1950s recharge thus the overall proportion of modern water in populations of domestic and public supply wells can be extrapolated from these maps tritium 3h is an ideal hydrologic tracer because it is incorporated into the water molecule its rapid increase in the atmosphere in the early 1950s michel et al 2018 makes it an important tracer of modern water visser et al 2016 used the depth of public supply wells with no detectable 3h to interpolate the depth where modern recharge is absent in aquifers throughout california although this method is useful for identifying the depths at which premodern groundwater is likely to occur it does not directly delineate the interface between modern and premodern groundwater d 1950 as a result the rate at which the moving front of post 1950s recharge occurs cannot be estimated using this method a dynamic model of d 1950 can be computed more broadly by estimating the vertical velocity of groundwater using environmental tracers the age of groundwater and the depth at which it occurs provides an estimate of the vertical flux of solutes in the aquifer while the most simplistic estimate can be made by dividing the screen depth by the age this approach assumes age grows linearly with depth in the aquifer i e a constant vertical flux however many aquifers have age depth patterns that are non linear that vary in shape depending on the aquifer configuration recharge patterns and permeability patterns leray et al 2019 for example the classic exponential model described by vogel 1967 has an age depth pattern that increases logarithmically with depth below the water table e g homogeneous unconfined aquifers vogel 1967 jurgens et al 2016 in this type of aquifer the vertical velocity is not constant and decreases with depth to the base of the active flow system where groundwater flow is entirely lateral consequently the structure of age in the aquifer is an important factor for determining the most appropriate method for estimating d 1950 spatial interpolation of point data is improved when the number of data points is large and the data points are regularly spaced isaaks and srivastava 1989 in places where production wells typically tap some fraction of modern groundwater like the central valley of california interpolated surfaces based entirely on premodern groundwater samples are constrained by relatively sparse data and can lack important regional features consequently the regional variability of d 1950 can be improved when based on data from wells with some fraction of modern water in turn the results may be adequate to extrapolate d 1950 for other wells such as drinking water wells that are not routinely sampled for environmental tracers in this study d 1950 is mapped throughout california s central valley a large agricultural region with growing population centers that rely heavily on groundwater for both public drinking water and agricultural irrigation water supply we computed groundwater ages at 650 wells by calibrating environmental tracers tritium carbon 14 noble gases chlorofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride to a simple lumped parameter model lpm that can project d 1950 in both space and time the combination of age models and geostatistical methods allow for d 1950 surfaces to be projected backward and forward in time to provide a 4 dimensional characterization of vertical groundwater movement in regional aquifers predicted d 1950 values at individual wells were projected temporally on a 5 year timestep and interpolated spatially throughout the central valley to characterize the penetration depth of modern recharge between 2005 and 2025 results of this method provide a first order characterization of the d 1950 surface in groundwater that can be used by water purveyors well drillers and water resource managers to visualize the extent and depth to which modern recharge pervades aquifer depths used for drinking water supply on broad spatial and temporal scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 calculating the depth of post 1950s groundwater the depth to post 1950s water d 1950 in an aquifer can be computed by estimating the vertical velocity of groundwater i e vertical flux of solutes at a well in aquifers with non linear age growth d 1950 can be estimated by assuming the vertical velocity decreases linearly with depth in this case d 1950 will penetrate more slowly as it deepens because the flowlines in the aquifer gradually change from completely vertical at the top to completely horizontal at the base fig 1 a this vertical velocity profile was derived by vogel 1967 for unconfined aquifers that receive uniform recharge across the landscape and have constant thickness aquifers where permeability decreases with depth or have different geometries and recharge characteristics leray et al 2019 can have non linear age growth patterns like the logarithmic pattern described by vogel 1967 the logarithmic age depth pattern therefore provides a reasonable approximation to estimate d 1950 in aquifers with non linear age depth patterns to illustrate the calculation of d 1950 a hypothetical aquifer based on the exponential model vogel 1967 is shown in fig 1 this aquifer has a uniform recharge rate r of 0 4 m per year a constant thickness of 100 m h and a porosity φ of 0 3 from equation 1 the mean residence time of groundwater in the aquifer τ aq is 75 years and from equation 2 d 1950 is 52 m below the water table mbwt in the year 2005 these aquifer properties also define the mean age of groundwater from wells partially screened within the aquifer τ s which is computed from equation 3 using the τ aq and the construction characteristics d 1950 can be computed either from the mean age of groundwater from a well or from the mean residence time of the aquifer since knowing one allows computation of the other in this study we computed τ aq from τ s 1 τ aq h φ r 2 d 1950 h 1 exp t 1950 τ uz τ aq 3 τ s h τ aq z 2 z 1 h z 2 h ln h z 2 h h z 2 h h z 1 h ln h z 1 h h z 1 h where τ aq is the mean residence time of groundwater in the aquifer h is the saturated thickness of the aquifer r is the recharge rate φ is porosity d 1950 is the depth to 1950 year water t is the sample year τ uz is the travel time through the unsaturated zone τ s is the mean age of the sample z 1 is the depth to the top well screen below the water table and z 2 is the depth to the bottom well screen below the water table in the hypothetical case shown in fig 1 the aquifer would have the age and tracer profile shown in fig 1b and samples from the wells would yield the tracer concentrations shown in fig 1c the mean age of groundwater samples τ s from a well can be computed by fitting the tracer concentrations fig 1c to the partial exponential model pem the pem was derived in jurgens et al 2016 and is applicable to wells that partially penetrate an aquifer such that the top of screen is below the water table or the bottom of screen is above the base of the aquifer in this example calibration of the tracers to the pem recovers the theoretical mean age for each well τ s based on equation 3 with corresponding age distributions shown in fig 1d thus d 1950 is correctly predicted at 52 mbwt for each well by calibration of the pem to environmental tracers measured in each well as this example shows wells need not be screened across d 1950 to estimate its depth in an aquifer a temporal model of d 1950 can be found by replacing the sample year with a specific year of interest this allows for comparisons of samples taken years apart projecting d 1950 to a year other than the sample year assumes that the aquifer is at steady state 2 2 model sensitivity calculation of d 1950 relies on measurements of environmental tracers and estimates of depth to water and aquifer thickness for the hypothetical aquifer described above only two tracers are required for the successful recovery of the mean age of each well and hence d 1950 one of the tracers must be tritium tritium has a historical record that is capable of dating groundwater since the early 1950s but it is often insufficient to constrain the mean age alone because the tritium record in precipitation has long term and short term patterns that rise and fall this can cause modeled ages to be non unique for example multiple groundwater ages are possible for well 1 fig 1 when tritium is the only tracer used to constrain the model in this case the modeled ages can deviate as much as 50 from the true age which leads to calculated d 1950 errors of 30 errors associated with estimates of aquifer thickness and water levels have minor effects overall but can be significant when wells are located close to the base of the aquifer or to the water table for the hypothetical example in fig 1 doubling the aquifer thickness can lead to d 1950 errors of as much as 25 but the errors are not one sided table 1 d 1950 is overestimated in shallow wells and underestimated in deep wells whereas wells screened across the d 1950 interface are largely unaffected in general wells that are shallower or deeper than the d 1950 interface are affected by aquifer thickness errors inversely table 1 shallow wells will underestimate d 1950 when the aquifer thickness is too small and overestimate d 1950 when aquifer thickness is too large likewise deeper wells will underestimate d 1950 when aquifer thickness is too large and overestimate d 1950 when aquifer thickness is too small water level errors of 5 m caused d 1950 to deviate less than 20 overall table 1 changes in water levels affect the calculated aquifer thickness because the depth to the base of aquifer was assumed to be constant overall shallow wells were affected by water level errors more than deep wells table 1 d 1950 for the shallow well was underestimated when depth to water was overestimated by 5 m and d 1950 was overestimated when depth to water underestimated by 5 m groundwater levels can be measured or estimated using local monitoring data or models aquifer thickness is harder to define and relies on the practitioner s hydrogeologic knowledge of the study area both geologic aquitard and flow system depth to predominantly lateral flow boundaries can be used to estimate this parameter 2 3 description of study area the central valley is an asymmetrical structural trough filled with marine and continental sediments up to 15 km thick covering an area of more than 50 000 km squared bounded by the cascade range to the north the sierra nevada to the east the klamath mountains and coast ranges to the west and the tehachapi mountains to the south fig 2 the sacramento valley groundwater basin sacv occupies the northern third of the central valley and the san joaquin valley groundwater basin sjv occupies the southern two thirds of the central valley fig 2 the sjv can be further divided into the basins of the san joaquin river hydrologic region sjr and the tulare lake hydrologic region tlr california department of water resources 2020 the sjr occupies the northern half of the sjv and is drained by the san joaquin river the tlr occupies the southern half of the sjv and is an internally drained closed basin faunt et al 2009 fig 2 the climate in the central valley is arid to semiarid average annual precipitation decreases from north to south ranging from 330 to 660 mm in the sacv to 130 to 460 mm in the sjv prior to agricultural development in the central valley the primary sources of recharge to the aquifer were precipitation and seepage from rivers draining the surrounding mountains the primary form of groundwater discharge was to rivers and perennial lakes in the trough of the central valley williamson et al 1989 post development sources of recharge and discharge are excess applied irrigation and groundwater pumping respectively faunt et al 2009 steady state recharge discharge was about 2 million acre ft yr prior to development and is now about 12 million acre ft yr williamson et al 1989 faunt et al 2009 the central valley aquifer system includes unconfined semi confined and confined aquifers which are primarily contained within the upper 300 m of alluvial sediments that were deposited by streams draining the surrounding sierra nevada and coast ranges page 1986 california department of water resources 2020 faunt et al 2009 the aquifer sediments are heterogeneous and typically range from 30 to 70 coarse grained texture throughout the valley the sacv is distinctly more fine grained than the sjv faunt et al 2010 in much of the western side of the sjv the aquifer system is divided into an upper and lower zone by the corcoran clay member of the tulare formation a regionally extensive clay layer that may limit vertical movement of groundwater page 1986 williamson et al 1989 belitz and heimes 1990 burow et al 2004 however the corcoran clay member of the tulare formation no longer acts as a perfect confining layer because of the number of wells that perforate it williamson et al 1989 dubrovsky et al 1991 fram 2017 2 4 well networks groundwater samples were collected from 650 wells in the central valley between 2004 and 2017 sampling was done as part of the california state water resources control board s groundwater ambient monitoring and assessment program priority basin project gama pbp a statewide groundwater quality monitoring program belitz et al 2003 wells were sampled as regional studies within the central valley fig s1 wells were primarily selected using a stratified grid based randomized design belitz et al 2010 resulting in a spatially distributed set of wells throughout the central valley in this dataset 388 wells were sampled from 2004 through 2011 to assess the quality of water used for public supply psa landon et al 2010 bennett et al 2010 2011 burton et al 2012 shelton et al 2013 fram 2017 and 153 wells were sampled from 2013 through 2017 to assess the quality of water used for domestic supply dsa shelton and fram 2017 bennett et al 2017 2019 jurgens et al 2018 an additional 109 wells were sampled to supplement the psa network of wells these secondary sites ssu were used for understanding water quality along regional transects and were not restricted to the depths used for public supply the psa dataset spans the entire spatial extent of the central valley whereas sites for the dsa study are in two subregions of the central valley the southern sacv and the southeastern sjv fig 2a supplemental fig s1 data for some psa and ssu sites were from samples collected after the initial sampling campaign to study temporal water quality trends kent and landon 2016 jurgens et al 2018 psa sites are typically public supply wells 70 or are other well types screened within the depth zone of groundwater used for public supply psa wells are typically constructed to deeper depths and have longer well screens than dsa wells table 2 the ssu wells are typically monitoring wells that have shorter screens and can be screened shallower or deeper than dsa wells depths of the wells from both datasets are summarized in table 2 and listed in faulkner and jurgens 2022 2 5 environmental tracers noble gases helium neon argon krypton and xenon tritium 3h chlorofluorocarbons cfcs sulfur hexafluoride sf6 carbon 14 14c and helium isotopes were collected and analyzed not all tracers were collected at every well fig 2b all tracer data are downloadable from the gama pbp groundwater quality results website and the usgs national water information system nwis database u s geological survey 2016 jurgens et al 2018 recharge temperature excess air and gas fractionation were determined from dissolved gases measured in 556 samples neon argon krypton and xenon using the computer program dgmeta faulkner and jurgens 2022 jurgens et al 2021 dissolved gas models were paired with measured concentrations of cfcs and sf6 to determine atmospheric mixing ratios of cfcs and sf6 dissolved gas models were paired with measurements of helium tritium and helium isotopes to determine the concentrations of tritiogenic helium 3 3hetrit from the decay of tritium and radiogenic heluim 4 4herad from decay of uranium and thorium in aquifer sediments average 3hetrit cfcs sf6 and 4herad concentrations were computed when wells had multiple dissolved gas model results and analyses of helium isotopes groundwater can appear older when dead carbon 14c free dissolves from carbonate minerals or organic matter in the aquifer dilution of 14c in groundwater from dissolution of carbonate rock was accounted for by scaling the atmospheric 14c record to match relationships with modern tracers such as 3h 3hetrit sf6 and cfcs see the faulkner and jurgens 2022 for more information about the data collection and processing of data used for modeling groundwater ages tracer errors for 3hetrit cfcs and sf6 were computed by dgmeta jurgens et al 2020 and account for errors in recharge conditions and analytical uncertainty values of 3hetrit had median errors of 7 with an interquartile range of 4 to 18 cfcs and sf6 had median errors of 18 with an interquartile range of 10 to 40 errors for 14c and 4herad were set to 5 of their values 3h which is the most ideal tracer was set to 1 this value forces the calibrated models to adhere most strongly to 3h concentrations but it overestimates the actual precision of 3h measurements analytical uncertainty of tritium measurements is about 0 1 tu assignment of lower tracer errors will often yield similar modeled ages but with lower errors associated with the mean age consequently mean age errors are likely underestimated with these tracer errors 2 6 groundwater age calculations the mean age of each sample was determined by fitting a single pem or a binary pem two pems to measurements of one or more environmental tracers using the computer program tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 jurgens et al 2016 to guide the selection of a single pem or a binary pem for modeling the age distribution samples were categorized as either modern premodern or mixed modern premodern based on the tritium classification scheme described in lindsey et al 2019 a single pem was used to model the age of modern and premodern samples and a binary pem was used to model the age of mixed samples mixed samples can be misclassified as modern when the mean age of modern water is around the 1963 bomb peak because high 3h in modern water can mask the presence of premodern water consequently 3h and the other tracer concentrations were plotted graphically against model output concentrations of a single pem and a binary pem for a range of mean ages and mixtures to verify or adjust each sample s classification and modeling calibration of the models was found by varying the fitting parameter mean age for example until the chi square error which is the difference between measured and output concentrations relative to the measurement error was minimized models with a chi square error less than 10 were considered acceptable these were models that have a chi square probability greater than 0 1 or have an average model tracer concentration that is within 10 of their measured values indicating a reasonable solution has been found the best fit mean age and its error was determined from an inverse method similar to the one described by johnson and faunt 1992 errors associated with the fitted parameters mean age for example were taken from the diagonal terms of the variance covariance matrix all modeling results are published in faulkner and jurgens 2022 the number of tracers had to be equal to or greater than the number of fitting parameters to find a unique solution to the mean age about 70 of samples had two or more tracers to constrain the modeled age distribution in cases where the number of tracers was insufficient to constrain all fitted parameters multiple model solutions were computed by fixing one parameter over a range of possible values and fitting the other parameters at each parameter step the set of model solutions with chi square values less than 10 represent a range of ages that can explain the tracer data the pem has two fitting parameters mean age τ s and unsaturated zone uz travel time binary pems a combination of two pems used to represent modern and premodern groundwater fractions have 3 fitting parameters mean age of the modern fraction τ s fraction of modern water and mean age of the premodern fraction the uz travel time was ignored in binary pems because it was difficult to constrain consistently without measurable 3hetrit at all sites the median uz time for single mixtures was 3 years which suggests it would be negligible relative to the mean age of modern water in most cases the pem has two fixed parameters one parameter each for the relative positions of the top z 1 and bottom z 2 screen depths within the saturated thickness of the aquifer h depth to water for binary pems the well screen is partitioned into two sections an upper section of modern water and a lower section of premodern water fig 3 the fraction of modern water is used to divide the screen length and each section is treated as a separate aquifer with different mean residence times recharge characteristics that can account for the simultaneous presence of modern and premodern water in a groundwater sample fig 3 during the calibration process the well screen partition adjusts vertically z m as the fraction of modern water changes after each iteration step fig 3 the depth of the modern premodern interface z m is 4 z m h h z 1 h f m h z 2 h h z 1 h where z m was the screen depth that separates the modern and premodern groundwater and f m was the fraction of modern water in the binary pem when the fraction of modern water is zero the separation depth is at or above the screen top when the fraction of modern water is 1 the separation depth is at or below the screen bottom for modern samples recharged solely after 1950 the uz travel times were characterized using a set of solutions rather than a single solution tritiogenic helium 3 which is sensitive to travel time delays through the uz and 3h were the primary tracers used to constrain the pem multiple solutions were computed by fixing the uz travel time over a range of up to 30 years which reduced the calibration process to a single parameter τ s thus requiring a single tracer the set of solutions that met the acceptance criteria provided a possible range of uz travel times that explain measure tracer concentrations the best fit uz travel time was used for calculations of d 1950 for premodern samples solely recharged before 1950 the uz travel time was ignored because it would have been small in comparison to the mean age of water which was often thousands of years old carbon 14 was the primary constraint on mean age in cases where the radiogenic helium 4 age was similar to the carbon 14 age helium was included to better characterize the potential error around the age of premodern water mixed samples modern and premodern were modeled using a binary pem multiple model solutions were computed to constrain the possible ranges of modern water fractions and mean ages of premodern water in these samples multiple solutions were computed by fixing the mean age of modern water for a range of ages between 2 and the number of years between the sample date and 1945 typically around 60 years the set of solutions that met the acceptance criteria provided a range of possible fractions of modern water their corresponding modern premodern separation depths and ages of premodern water present in a sample in some cases 14c was not available therefore the same procedure was used with an arbitrary value of 500 years which simulates tritium free concentrations in the mixture for each model solution the modern mean age was used to compute d 1950 the model with a d 1950 that matched the separation depth between modern and premodern water z m was selected from the set of model solutions most of these samples had mean ages of modern water greater than 28 years indicating that these binary mixtures were consistent with infiltration of older modern water that mixes with premodern water in wells the output concentration of a pem is computed by convolution of the tracer history in recharge for a given mean age jurgens et al 2012 jurgens et al 2016 regional records of 3h in precipitation for each site were compiled from michel et al 2018 based on their latitude longitude position and used to compute concentrations of 3h and 3hetrit from the pem atmospheric records of 14c over the last 50 000 years were constructed by combining the international calibration curve nh intcal13 reimer and others 2013 with modern tropospheric 14c data for northern hemisphere zones zones 2 hua et al 2013 the northern atmospheric concentration records for the cfcs and sf6 were compiled by the u s geological survey reston groundwater dating laboratory at half year time increments u s geological survey 2017 radiogenic helium production rates were computed from average abundances of uranium and thorium in surficial sediments of the central valley phillips et al 1993 a porosity of 0 2 and a bulk density of 2 2 2 7 water levels and aquifer thickness estimates of groundwater levels and depth to base of aquifer were used to define the saturated thickness of the aquifer h groundwater levels measured at the well were used when the measurement date was within the last decade of the sample date measured water levels from 230 wells were compiled from the usgs nwis database u s geological survey 2016 for wells where water level was not measured interpolated maps of spring water levels were used from levy 2021 supplemental fig s2a if interpolated groundwater levels were not available the simulated spring 2000 water table depth from the central valley hydrologic model was used faunt et al 2009 the aquifer thickness h was calculated by subtracting the depth to water wl from the depth to the base of the aquifer baq i e h baq wl for this study the base of the aquifer was assumed to be the depth of public supply wells municipal wells and large irrigation wells are typically constructed to greater depths and pump greater volumes than other well types faunt 2009 for the most part the vertical movement of solutes and tracers will be within the saturated thickness where these wells occur which encompasses the aquifer capture zone for both drinking water and most agricultural extractions aquifer thickness for each well was taken from interpolated raster surfaces developed by voss et al 2019 who characterized the 90th percentile of public supply well depths throughout the central valley supplemental fig s2b the depth to the bottom screened interval was used as the depth to the base of the aquifer when sampled wells had well screens below the 90th percentile 2 8 interpolation spatial interpolation of d 1950 calculations was done using empirical bayesian kriging ebk ebk differs from ordinary kriging in that ebk uses overlapping subsets of points each point falling into an average of 5 subsets of 100 points in this study to generate iterative semivariogram models 100 simulations in this study to improve interpolation and it accounts for the error associated with the semivariogram esri 2021a predictions at a point are calculated using the semivariograms from all subsets that contain the neighboring points 10 to 15 neighbors in this study empirical transformations were performed using the k bessel semivariogram model the geographic coordinates of the well locations in decimal degrees were projected into coordinates in meters using albers equal area conic projection well known id 5070 with a central meridian of 120 and rotated clockwise by 30 44 degrees about the point 38 818 m and 1 280 164 m the ebk results were transformed to raster surfaces with a raster cell size of 0 5 km for further analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater age in the central valley the mean age of groundwater from wells ranged from less than one year to nearly 80 000 years supplemental fig s3 faulkner and jurgens 2022 mean groundwater ages were typically older in the sacv than in the sjv table 3 in the sacv groundwater ages were not distinctly different among site types sediments in the sacv are finer grained than in the sjv sacv also has more abundant surface water and is less reliant on groundwater than the sjv these factors likely contribute to the more widespread occurrence of pre 1950 water from wells in the sacv in the sjv groundwater ages were typically older in psa wells than in dsa and ssu wells table 3 groundwater ages were indeterminate at 25 wells because 3h was the only tracer and its concentration was less than 0 3 tu indicating the age was older than the dating range of 3h for these samples about 58 of the wells sampled in this study were binary mixtures of modern and premodern water this percentage is consistent with prior results showing the prevalence of mixed age water in other parts of the central valley alikhani et al 2016 jurgens et al 2016 wells with binary mixtures of groundwater had a median screen length of 30 m whereas wells with strictly modern water had a median screen length of 10 m wells with long screens are more likely to intersect the modern premodern groundwater interface travel time through the unsaturated zone can be an important contributor to the age in some parts of the central valley for samples with modern water the median uz travel time was 3 years uz travel time was not significantly correlated to the depth of the water table spearman s rho 0 08 p value 0 05 which suggests the unsaturated zone thickness is not the only factor affecting recharge to the aquifer uz travel times were greater in the sjv than in the sacv fifty two percent of samples with modern water had uz travel times over 10 years in the sjv whereas only 37 of samples had uz travel times over 10 years in sacv the water table tends to be deeper in the sjv than in the sacv supplemental fig s2a mean age was positively correlated to depth between the water table and the top of the well screen in both the sacv spearman s rho 0 50 p value less than 0 001 and the sjv spearman s rho 0 44 p value less than 0 001 indicating that groundwater age increases with depth below the water table this is consistent with a logarithmic model of age growth depicted in figs 1 and 3 however a linear model of age growth will also yield a positive correlation between depth and age these two types of age models were evaluated by looking at the age depth relationship of domestic wells in two locations in the central valley one set of domestic wells in the southern sacv and another set of domestic wells in southeast sjv fig 4 these wells had the full suite of age tracers 3h 3hetrit sf6 14c and 4herad needed to constrain the age models in both places the logarithmic relationship straight line on fig 4 provided a better fit to the modeling results the logarithmic relationship is consistent the pem assumption however it is not substantially better than the linear model making it difficult to distinguish a clear pattern wells that are spatially distributed over a wide area may have groundwater ages and depth patterns that result from different rates of vertical flow locally so the aggregation of spatially distributed data may confound the relationship between mean age and depth two previous studies in the sjv also found a logarithmic relationship between mean age and depth in nested multi level monitoring wells jurgens et al 2008 burow et al 2012 which suggests the logarithmic model may be more appropriate for modeling the dynamic penetration of d 1950 mean age errors were less than 20 in 85 of all samples n 533 which suggests that mean age is reasonably constrained in most samples however some models were non unique when only a single tracer of modern water namely 3h was used in the calibration tritium was the only tracer used to calibrate the modeled age at about 20 of samples 125 of 625 and 13 of these were modeled as binary pems for these samples multiple model solutions were computed that resulted in a span of potential ages this range was often greater than 30 years and can correspond to an error of about 50 the potential span of ages at these sites increases the uncertainty of d 1950 overall 74 of samples had 2 or more tracers to calibrate age 3 2 depth to post 1950s groundwater predicted values of d 1950 were computed from pem models of modern water at 484 wells in the central valley only samples with 3h values greater than 0 3 tu indicating the presence of modern recharge were used to model d 1950 based on 3h in precipitation records the highest 3h activity in groundwater that could have originated in 1950 and could be measured in 2008 was about 0 3 tu this 3h cutoff marks groundwater depths with a clear modern 3h signal although tritiated groundwater can occur below this depth the cutoff also removed model results with low level 3h activities that may have traveled to the well through the annular seal or was introduced by water lubrication of pumps or by leaky check valves that allow backflow of water from the distribution system in these situations the modeled ages may not be representative of the groundwater movement within the aquifer and hence were poor estimates of d 1950 samples were modeled as either a binary of two pems one for modern water and another for premodern water or as a single pem of modern water in all cases d 1950 values were based on the pem for the modern water there was no systematic difference between d 1950 values computed for samples modeled with a single pem and samples modeled with a binary of two pems supplemental table s1 in the central valley deviations between modeled and actual d 1950 values can occur from the assumption of aquifer homogeneity this assumption presumes that flow to the well is captured over the entire length of screen however sediments in the central valley are a heterogenous mix of clay silt sand and gravel that can lead to non uniform flow over the length of screen faunt et al 2009 jurgens et al 2008 d 1950 may be overestimated or underestimated when modern water enters the well at discrete intervals along the screen for example the pem can project deeper penetration of post 1950s recharge at wells where deeper sections of screen contribute little to no flow to the well the pem assumes the oldest ages are entering near the screen bottom however these no flow zones are caused by presence of clay lenses in the aquifer that can indicate the oldest ages have not penetrated to those depths and that vertical movement of groundwater is more restricted than would be predicted for samples with a binary pem d 1950 can be underestimated when the modern water is younger than the mean age from the selected model these issues are often specific to each well and did not tend to bias results of one model type over the other d 1950 was not computed at 166 sites where 3h was less than 0 3 tu at these sites modern water was largely absent and the median age of premodern groundwater was 7 000 years although the pem can predict d 1950 from wells with premodern water this groundwater was recharged during more natural recharge conditions when pumping from wells and surface water routing through reservoirs was absent consequently d 1950 values from premodern water are much shallower than estimates based on the current recharge and pumping environment fig 3 therefore d 1950 values were based solely on modern groundwater however the top of screen depth of sites with solely premodern groundwater provide a lower vertical boundary to evaluate the efficacy of the d 1950 predictions d 1950 should not be deeper than this boundary d 1950 ranged from about 5 to 317 m below the land surface mbls in the central valley fig 5 a d the median d 1950 is deeper in the sjv 77 mbls than in the sacv 57 mbls in the sacv d 1950 did not vary substantially relative to the water table from west to east fig 5a but did vary with distance from the sacramento san joaquin delta in the northern third of the sacv fig 5b in the sjv d 1950 tended to be deeper in the western portion of the valley fig 5c and was deeper with distance from the delta fig 5d of the 484 wells with modern water computed d 1950 values were below the bottom screen at 35 of wells these wells had groundwater that was completely modern with younger mean ages the median mean age of groundwater at these wells was 29 years which is equivalent to an apparent recharge date of 1981 consequently d 1950 values are consistent with the expectation that post 1950s water is deeper than the depth of these wells about 65 of wells with modern water had computed d 1950 values that were within the screened interval this finding is consistent with the prevalence of mixed age water that is often observed at long screened wells throughout the central valley fig 3 jurgens et al 2016 a line of the moving average of d 1950 values blue line on fig 5 for four transects across the valley shows that 3h is generally greater than 0 3 tu above this depth there were several sites with tritium below the average d 1950 line and sites where tritium was absent were above the d 1950 line fig 5 these discrepancies were most often caused by the 2 d projection that masked local d 1950 trends a line of the moving average of the top of screens for wells with solely premodern groundwater red line on fig 5 was more often deeper than the d 1950 line but there are places where it is shallower than d 1950 in both sacv and sjv discrepancies between the two depths occur in areas where the number of wells with either estimate is low but in general d 1950 is better constrained in most areas because 75 of wells out of 650 were used to compute d 1950 some sites with premodern water were shallower than the d 1950 line fig 5 shallow premodern water can occur where groundwater is not vertically driven downward such as near major groundwater discharge areas along the axial trough of the central valley relative position 0 on fig 5a and 5c premodern groundwater at shallow depths can occur where groundwater movement is more lateral than vertical in places where groundwater movement is lateral d 1950 would be shallower relative to d 1950 under vertical groundwater movement with increasing lateral travel distance shallow premodern groundwater occurs more frequently in sacv than in the sjv which could indicate that the sacv contains more lateral groundwater flow than the sjv 3 3 sensitivity predicted d 1950 values were more sensitive to uncertainties in mean age than to uncertainties in water level depth and aquifer thickness predicted d 1950 values had median errors of 6 5 m 3 m and 3 m for uncertainties associated with modeled ages depth to water and aquifer thickness respectively these errors were derived by applying a 20 uncertainty to modeled groundwater ages depth to water table and aquifer thickness a fixed uncertainty was applied to evaluate the relative importance of each parameter to computed d 1950 values although more than 80 of modeled ages had standard errors less than 10 this error can be small when the models are constrained by 2 or fewer tracers consequently a 20 error on age was used to account for possible errors due to sparsity of tracer data at sites and model non uniqueness a 20 error for water levels and aquifer thickness is reasonable because 75 of wells with a measured water level had deviated no more than 20 from water levels estimated by interpolation levy 2021 levy et al 2021 or from numerical groundwater flow models faunt et al 2009 in the central valley the aquifer is much thicker than the aquifer thicknesses used to compute d 1950 faunt 2009 for the pem the thickness should be constrained by the system of active tracer transport in this case the active system is driven by the capture zones of public supply and irrigation wells in the central valley increasing the thickness beyond these depths would cause the distribution of age to expand to the detriment of the calibration of age tracers for example a thicker aquifer would cause the wells to have more narrow age distributions piston flow like than would be expected based on the screen length a narrower age distribution could lead to poorer model fits to the measured tracers 3 4 interpolation an interpolated surface of predicted d 1950 was computed by projecting all pems to the year 2005 for the 484 samples with modern water and kriging the resultant point estimates of d 1950 in mbls across the valley fig 6 a in the sacv d 1950 had a raster cell average depth of 56 mbls and ranged from 21 to 113 mbls in the sjv d 1950 had a raster cell average depth of 82 mbls and ranged from 33 to 159 mbls cross validation using the leave one out method on the d 1950 datasets was performed as part of the ebk interpolation algorithm this method compares a predicted and measured value at a point to measure the accuracy of the prediction about 96 of the results were within a 95 confidence interval for d 1950 the average standard errors fig 6b were similar to the root mean squared prediction errors which indicated the spatial variability was well predicted esri 2021b the interpolated surfaces represent spatially weighted averages of d 1950 where some fraction of modern water is present in wells kriging tends to smooth outliers in areas where data are denser but is highly influenced by values in areas where data are sparse if sparse data are unreliable it could have a negative effect on the kriging results overall d 1950 kriging errors were less than 25 m across 83 of the area of the central valley standard errors were generally low where well density was high and errors increased as density was reduced this indicated that the error was more closely related to a lack of data than to disagreement of d 1950 at the well locations fig 6b well density in the northern sjv was low and d 1950 errors were higher in this area errors also may not have been well defined where wells were absent for example the low errors in the southwestern sjv where wells were largely absent resulted from extrapolation from the east the area with the lowest standard error is in the northeastern tlr where well density is highest in the future additional groundwater age results in areas of low well density like the northern sjv should strengthen predicted d 1950 values the interpolated d 1950 surfaces followed basin scale trends and highlighted features that can be influenced by municipal pumping surface water sources and deepening of the water table there were localized depressions of d 1950 near the metropolitan areas of chico davis sacramento stockton and tracy these depressions were likely caused by urban pumping which tends to draw modern water deeper into the aquifer these depressions in d 1950 were not seen in the fresno metropolitan area likely because of the lateral groundwater flow created by reestablishment of surface water flows to the san joaquin river north of the city in this area groundwater flow may move more laterally than vertically in response to pumping in the city there is also a shallow broad depression in d 1950 north of fresno in the southern sjr that is consistent with measured water level decline and subsidence in this area i e d 1950 was drawn deeper with the declining water level faunt et al 2016 levy et al 2021 d 1950 exceeded 100 m across much of the southern tlr depth to water in the southern tlr exceeded 180 m supplemental fig s2a however the median d 1950 value in tlr is 44 mbwt which is similar to the 45 mbwt median depth for the entire central valley this indicated that the greater depth of d 1950 in tlr is mostly due to greater depths to water 3 5 model verification the predicted d 1950 surface was compared to the interpolated prediction of the depth of the top of well screens producing completely premodern water spatial surfaces of this depth were made using the same interpolation method as the predicted d 1950 surface in fig 6 the predicted surface the interpolation errors and the deviation of the predicted surface to d 1950 are shown in fig 7 the predicted depth of the top of well screens producing completely premodern water fig 7a is deeper than the predicted d 1950 fig 6 across 87 of the central valley and by more than 15 m across 69 of the area fig 7b the depth to premodern groundwater surface provides a lower vertical boundary for the predicted d 1950 surface because wells producing completely premodern water must be below the depth of the modern and premodern interface consequently the large amount of area where the predicted d 1950 surface is shallower than the top of screens of wells producing completely premodern water provides confidence the exponential model does not frequently overpredict the penetration depth of modern water fig 7b the map of predicted depth of premodern water shares some of the same spatial features as the map of the depth to screen tops of wells producing tritium free groundwater made by visser et al 2016 which is expected because the underlying data are mostly the same the depression around davis was previously shown by visser et al 2016 as an area where depth to tritium free groundwater is more than 150 mbls overall the depth of premodern water has fewer wells to constrain the predicted surface as compared to the predicted d 1950 surface because modern water is present in 75 of wells in this study consequently the kriging error of the depth of completely premodern water is over 25 m in more than 50 of the area in the central valley fig 7c despite the fewer number of wells and larger prediction errors the predicted depth of premodern water provides a lower depth boundary the predicted d 1950 surface rarely exceeds fig 5 and fig 7b a map of d 1950 values computed using a linear age depth relationship was also compared to the predicted d 1950 value in the supplemental material supplemental results supplemental fig s9 d 1950 values were similar but were more often deeper and had larger kriging errors as compared to the predicted d 1950s 3 6 temporal projections temporal projections of d 1950 and the proportion of post 1950s water p 1950 were made to visualize how the moving front of modern recharge migrates vertically through the central valley aquifer system over time p 1950 is computed by removing the aquifer thickness h from equation 2 projecting d 1950 or p 1950 to a year other than the sample year assumes the aquifer is at steady state constant recharge and this assumption may be violated in places with long term groundwater levels declines faunt et al 2009 levy et al 2021 however the projections provide first order estimates of the dynamic penetration depth of modern recharge through regional aquifer systems that are vulnerable to anthropogenic contamination projections were made from 2005 to 2025 in 5 year increments supplemental figs s5 s6 and the changes in d 1950 and p 1950 between 2005 and 2025 are shown in fig 8 and between 2005 and other years in figures s7 and s8 projections of d 1950 were not systematically different between model types supplemental table 1 model projections assuming constant recharge rates of calibrated pems show that d 1950 will increase by more than 10 m in most areas between 2005 and 2025 fig 8a the largest changes occur in the southern sjv that also coincide with some of the largest water level declines over the last decade levy et al 2021 the cities of tracy and chico also had the high rates of d 1950 penetration although deeper penetration of modern water will increase the proportion of modern water in the aquifer areas where the proportion of modern water increases most do not always correspond to the areas with the highest penetration rates in the sacv and northern sjv p 1950 is projected to increase more than the southern sjv because the estimated aquifer extent h that is currently used for drinking water supply is thinner in those areas when projected to the year 2025 the raster cell average d 1950 was 67 and 95 m in the sacv and sjv respectively supplemental fig s6e on average d 1950 is predicted to travel about 11 and 12 m deeper in the sacv and sjv respectively over this twenty year time span in 2005 d 1950 was at least 15 m shallower than the depth to premodern water which suggest that most sites that are entirely premodern will likely still be premodern in 2025 by 2025 the average proportion is predicted to similarly increase in the sacv 0 34 to 0 42 and in the sjv 0 29 to 0 38 penetration rates of d 1950 are over 1 m per year across 2 of the central valley these results indicate that pem projections of the vertical penetration rate of d 1950 is slow but reasonable for most areas in the central valley future work could evaluate its usefulness as a marker of groundwater vulnerability for wells screened above or across the surface 4 conclusions in this study the moving front of post 1950s modern recharge was modeled using a large dataset of multi tracer suites measured at 484 wells throughout california s central valley the combination of simple lumped parameter models with robust geostatistical techniques allowed for aggregation of groundwater age data on variable temporal and broad spatial scales these methods can be used in the central valley and elsewhere to provide first order estimates of time variant groundwater recharge processes that have direct impacts on groundwater quality trends that are critical to assess drinking water supply vulnerability however these methods are less applicable to aquifers where groundwater flow is not vertically dominated such as confined aquifers or in larger alluvial basins where recharge is dominated by mountain front recharge furthermore in systems where the assumptions of hydrologic steady state are violated such as heavily pumped aquifers care should be taken when combining results from wells sampled during very different hydrologic conditions mean age errors are the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of d 1950 uncertainty in mean age calculation is lessened when more environmental tracer measurements are available to constrain lpms at each site the interpolation of d 1950 between well locations assumes that groundwater age is spatially correlated and that heterogeneity can be neglected these assumptions appear to hold in this study based on lower interpolation error near well locations in areas where well density is higher error associated with the interpolation of d 1950 is generally higher with low data density in the central valley wells with some modern water were about 3 times more prevalent as wells with solely premodern water consequently the frequency of modern water in wells the set of tracers available at each well and the spatial density of wells are important factors affecting the spatial resolution of the mapped surface of d 1950 in an aquifer spatial interpolation of d 1950 and p 1950 highlighted areas where vertical seepage rates are high and modern recharge pervades aquifer systems used for drinking water supply projected penetration of d 1950 into the future showed that the sjv will likely have the greatest deepening of modern water this could be due to higher concentrated recharge and pumping rates in areas supporting irrigated agriculture and has important implications for sustainable groundwater management future work will test the capability of the d 1950 maps to predict the vulnerability of groundwater contamination using statistical machine learning models because of the implications of groundwater age for explaining water quality machine learning methods that link mapped drivers of groundwater age like recharge with process based models like the exponential model used in this study could improve the spatial interpolation and extrapolation of results credit authorship contribution statement kirsten e faulkner

2627,habitat quality of alpine river is largely affected by human activity the exploitation for hydropower combined with anthropogenic climate change canalter mountain riverine ecosystems leading to less suitable hydro thermal regimes for the fish here we present a new methodology to assess water temperature within a river featuring water exploitation for hydropower purposes usable to assess future potential deterioration of riverine habit suitability in response to increasing water temperature we then propose an application focusing upon the case study of the serio river in northern italy largely exploited by hydropower productions and highly populated by a very sensitive species brown trout salmo trutta the methodology proposed involves a set of tools i e i the hydrological model poli hydro to evaluate natural hydrological regime ii a hydropower plants scheme to assess river water withdrawal iii fish density environment curves to evaluate the hydraulic suitability in terms of trout potential density for adult young and fry as a function of hydraulic features i e depth and velocity and iv a new physically based model poli wat temp to assess changes in river water temperature and possible outbreaks of temperature dependant lethal conditions such as proliferative kidney disease and others to provide an assessment of river suitability possibly complementing improving models based upon solely hydraulic indexes we propose a new synthetic river stress index combining i potential fish density as driven by hydraulic variables and ii thermal suitability given that utmost unsuitable conditions thermally and likely hydrologically are expected under future climate conditions pending global warming we then projected water temperature and stream flows until the end of the century in response to socio economic scenariosof ar6 of the ipcc to explore the potential for future decrease of river quality water temperature would be largely susceptible to climate change with increase up to 6 5c in the worst scenarios while no clear trend is observed for fish density overall potential density would decrease in winter for adults and in summer for juvenile and fry in downstream sections therefore by coupling hydraulic and thermal suitability one finds that i alpine rivers would likely face longer critical periods with respect to those predicted based upon a solely hydraulic habitat based assessment and ii continuous temperature increase as projected until the end of the century would result into worse conditions in summer months seriously endangering fish guilds keywords water temperature modelling physical habitat modelling river stress indicator climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global warming effects upon water ecosystems have now been evident for years the impact of climate change on freshwater availability was assessed both at regional arnell 1999 lehner et al 2006 and global scale doll and zhang 2010 sperna et al 2012 vorosmarty et al 2000 among others several studies were carried out that highlighted significant warming in the european alps decreasing of snow and ice cover and stream flows modification thereby bocchiola and diolaiuti 2010 bocchiola 2014 fuso et al 2020 few studies focused upon changes of water temperature which is crucial for the distribution of biotic organisms in the rivers featuring direct and indirect effects beside the direct influence upon dissolved oxygen webb et al 2008 van vliet et al 2013 increase in water temperature may provide emergence of diseases such as proliferative kidney disease pkd in freshwater fish carraro et al 2017 pkd is a major threat to wild and farmed salmonid populations because of its lethal effect at high water temperatures the disease was recognized as a frequent cause of decline in fish populations over the last decades even driving local extinctions of endemic and or commercially important fish species borsuk et al 2006 when studying thermal regime of rivers attention was cast hitherto upon the link between water and air temperature the latter can indeed be seen as a driver of the former because it affects heat flows to from water edinger et al 1968 zhu et al 2018 thus projected air temperature increase under global warming will likely affect mountain streams temperature and living conditions of river species isaak et al 2010 santiago et al 2016 borgwardt et al 2020 stochastic models exist that link water and air temperature and are easy to implement thanks to the large diffusion of air temperature data caissie et al 2001 caissie et al 1998 further meteorological data are needed to apply more sophisticated deterministic models based upon energy balance caissie et al 2005 bustillo et al 2015 however the latter are more appropriate to analyse anthropogenic activities directly impacting rivers e g diversion channels industrial flows and presence of reservoirs benyahya et al 2007 dams and minor barriers disrupt the hydrological and fluvial ecosystem connectivity affecting the river environment and thermal regime kedra and wiejaczka 2017 particularly diverted water is less susceptible to heating given that often times diversion channels are buried in the ground then return of such colder water in the main river typically at some length downstream and at a lower altitude would cause a sudden drop in water temperature on the other hand water flow left in the river has less thermal inertia due to decreased discharge leading to higher temperature in summer and lower in winter meier et al 2003 thermal models depending upon air temperature only may not be always suitable i e the effect of flow magnitude cannot be neglected toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and more sophisticated heat exchange models are required that make spatial dependence and effects of increasing flow downstream more explicit the eu biodiversity strategy for 2030 eu 2020 states the need to re establish freshwater ecosystems and the natural functions of rivers in this context the assessment of river habitat quality is a key factor lamouroux et al 1998 canobbio et al 2013 and one expects that fish distribution abundance will reflect riverine conditions on a larger spatial scale lamouroux and cattaneo 2006 vancompernolle et al 2019 physical habitat models have been widely used to describe the connection between instream flow and habitat availability for different target species fornaroli et al 2016 however in addition to hydrological flows water temperature is determinant for river species occurrence nukazawa et al 2011 jonsson and jonsson 2009 thus to simulate habitat suitability it seems relevant to consider multiple habitat characteristics and integrated frameworks that couple water temperature and hydraulic parameters may be considered morid et al 2020 the main goals of our study are 1 to propose a new physically based thermal model called poli wat temp to assess water temperature of a river characterized by complex geometry of withdrawal and return to from hydropower plants and 2 to evaluate the combined effect of hydraulic and thermal stress upon mountain river habitat by elaborating a new index which we call river stress we develop here the method and then we propose an application to a stretch of an alpine river the serio catchment in northern italy we chose this catchment for two reasons i e i it nests several hydropower plants displaying a complex geometry of diversion return channels affecting both hydrological and thermal regimes and ii it is populated by salmo trutta the presence of which is nowadays made possible by high dissolved oxygen and somewhat acceptable water temperature armour 1994 the thermal model was calibrated using field data of air and water temperature taken during surveys in several cross sections along the serio river river discharge at several chosen locations along the stream was assessed using the semi distributed physically based hydrological model poli hydro soncini et al 2017 at the basin scale for habitat quality assessment we then used the so modelled discharges as an input to density environmental functions for salmo trutta at different stages young adult and fries calibrated recently for the serio river fornaroli et al 2016 to then evaluate the limiting effects of hydro morphological variables such as water depth current velocity substrate size and composition upon habitat conditions we then propose a new index of river stress by combining habitat suitability and water temperature so obtaining more credible habitat assessment under given climate conditions we projected water temperatures and stream flows to the end of the xxi century in response to climate change as projected under the socio economic scenarios ssp of the most recent assessment report ar6 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to highlight areas of increased stress usable for future planning of adaptation strategies the paper is organized as follows the case study and available data are reported in section 2 where also the methods are discussed the results of model calibration and subsequent of application are discussed in section 3 discussion and conclusions are in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study serio river is 124 km long nested in lombardy region northern italy flowing in the provinces of bergamo bg and cremona cr to the outflow of the adda river fig 1 it has a watershed of 1256 km2 and the source is located at 2500 m asl nearby torena mount in the orobic prealps serio is a mountain river with mono cursal bed step pools geometry and coarse substrate at ca 600 m asl in parre bg the river becomes more and more braiding and gravel sand bottomed at ca 100 m asl it starts meandering with very gentle slope and fine substrate here we consider the river stretch upstream of parre most relevant for water quality assessment and for measurable presence of the target fish species the watershed is located within a temperate region with a total precipitation of ca 1300 mm per year and mean temperature of 23 8 c in july and 1 5 c in january the river receives large precipitation in autumn and large snow melt in spring no ice melt contribution is present here due to the absence of permanent glaciers in the area the hydrological regime displays low discharges in january and february mild flow in spring and main floods in fall the serio river is largely exploited for hydropower production seven run of river power plants are located along the river that we know of in valbondione to parre stretch fig 1 the water collecting and returning points form 7 stretches where the hydrological and thermal regime is altered with respect to natural conditions the considered reach is classified as a high regard area for fishing by the province of bergamo 2009 where the most valued fish species is brown trout salmo trutta protected from overfishing by a limitation in time and amount lombardy region 2003 changes in precipitation and temperature may negatively affect the hydrological regime of the area armour 1994 viganò et al 2016 groppelli et al 2011 leading to critical hydro thermal conditions for the fish it is therefore essential to study the impact of such present and potential future changes upon river quality to plan adaptation strategies for safeguarding of the species and their ecosystem here we assessed the effect of climate change upon river habitat within 8 stations of the upper serio fig 1 where hydro morphological and topographic surveys together with electro fishing samplings were carried out as described e g in viganò et al 2016 2 2 data available daily series of precipitation and air temperature from 3 automatic weather station aws of arpa lombardy authority were used here as inputs to the hydrological model poli hydro e g 9 the model was implemented with a spatial resolution of 100x100 m2 for a 10 year control run period cr 2012 2021 other inputs were the gis map i e digital elevation model dem of the catchment earth data available online https earthdata nasa gov and the land use maps from corine land cover clc 2018 copernicus land monitoring service available online https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc2018 daily discharges at ponte cene hydro station during the cr period were used for model calibration under natural regime conditions while data of minimum instream flow mif and maximum operable discharge qhy for each hydropower station were used to switch from natural to regulated hydrological regime table 1 to setup the thermal model water temperature data were gathered within the sites reported in fig 1 see table 2 for three years june 2018 october 2021 using ibutton devices range 5 to 26 c resolution 0 0625 c measurement interval 10 min water temperature data were downloaded and a linear interpolation between consecutive measurements was performed to obtain a continuous trend of water temperature one value per minute and eventually daily mean maximum and minimum temperature finally density environmental relationships for salmo trutta at different stages fry juvenile adult as derived after sampling in eight stations along the river fornaroli et al 2016 were used for river habitat assessment table 1 2 3 river suitability assessment to assess the river suitability of serio river several methods models were applied here in cascade for clarity we report in fig 2 a flowchart displaying the data and methods adopted here using precipitation and air temperature data p t and watershed gis maps we setup the hydrological model poli hydro to derive daily discharges q we used then the modelled discharges as input to a habitat suitability model that defines fish potential density used to evaluate habitat suitability in the sample locations with the thermal model based upon known the geometry of the hydropower system and of the return tail race system we then used t and the modelled discharge q to assess pointwise daily water temperature tw then we defined habitat suitability classes and water temperature thresholds for pkd next we provided an indicator of stress of the river rs by matching hydraulic habitat suitability with suitability based upon water temperature which we call ts for future projections we downscaled values from gcm scenarios to get future precipitation and temperature pfut and tfut these were fed to poli hydro to assess future discharges qfut still using the thermal model we then exploited tfut qfut to evaluate future scenarios of water temperature tw fut and suitability thereby here we assumed for simplicity that the present hydropower scheme would remain unchanged in the future finally with the same approach above we provided projections of the future river stress rsfut 2 4 hydrological modelling thepoli hydro hydrological model was already used validated and described in several studies hitherto soncini et al 2017 where the reader is referred thereby for a detailed description poli hydrocomputes daily soil water balancefor each cell within thecatchment area here defined with arc gis software the control variable is soil water content inputs are given by liquid precipitation air temperature and snow ice melt and outputs arewater fluxesin the river snow accumulation on the ground in the form of snow water equivalent swe is assessed from precipitation i e snowfall when temperature in one cell is below 0 swe melt is then evaluated with a mixed degree day formula e g pellicciotti et al 2005 temperature is distributed spatially using monthly vertical gradients as from observations by doing so the model can reconstruct for each cell rainfall snow pack on the ground snow ice melt however as reported no ice surface is present in the catchment here surface andsubsurface flows the latter are then routed using a iuh function i e nash model to the final outlet of each sub basin to obtain daily stream flow hydrographs the model was calibrated here for natural discharge estimation and then validated usinggoodness of fitstatistics i e bias and monthly nse nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated against the observed discharges at ponte cene hydrometer relatively undisturbed by flow regulation and simulated discharges

provided for every plant table 1 and we used the proposed values accordingly in the assumption that hydropower managers properly release qmif downstream of intakes 2 5 hydraulic habitat assessment to assess hydraulic based suitability we used a habitat suitability model that defines potential density based upon a limiting factor approach as recently proposed by fornaroli et al 2016 these functions use water velocity depth substrate characteristics availability of refuges and mesohabitat type the latter is divided in four categories namely i shallow pool ii deep pool iii riffle iv run as retrieved within the 8 sampling sites fig 1 table 1 using the functions as developed in our study area fornaroli et al 2016 we assessed the potential density pd ind m2 with respect to discharge for the young and adult trout and for fries obtaining a potential number of individuals per square meters in each site for each discharge level so we calculated pd for the cr period in each sampling site and for each life stage of salmo trutta we then defined two classes of quality i e poor and good corresponding to the intervals for pd 40 60 60 100 of the maximum value of daily potential density pdmax respectively we chose 40 as a lower bound because it was the lowest value resulting from our simulations thus we added up the total number of days in each class for the 4 seasons winter spring summer and fall and we averaged over three different decades i e cr 2012 2021 as a reference in the present conditions a period one p1 half century 2046 2055 and a period two p2 end of century 2091 2100 to evaluate future river suitability 2 6 water temperature modelling here we developed a model for water temperature assessment which we called poli wat temp this is a coupled model interacting with poli hydro to take as an input estimated stream flows and air temperature data the poli wat temp model uses a one dimensional energy balance equation suitable for shallow rivers where vertical gradient of temperature can be neglected caissie et al 2005 as follows 2 t w t v t w x 1 a x a d l t w x b θ ρ a h tot therein t w is water temperature v is mean water velocity x is distance along river axis a is cross section area b is river width d l is a dispersion coefficient in the flow direction θ is specific heat of water ρ is water density h tot is total heat flux from the external environment to the river including solar radiation air temperature evaporative heat fluxes and net long wave radiation here we considered air temperature and incident solar radiation as external sources of heat that we modelled as linear functions of the air water temperature gradient and of incident clear sky solar radiation respectively 3 h tot α t air t w β r a d the dispersion term in eq 2 a d l t w x x may be generally neglected in alpine rivers characterized by medium high flow velocity so that heat transfer along the x axis basically occurs by advection deas and l lowney 2000 v t w t w we solved eq 2 recursively to evaluate heat fluxes from an upstream station to a downstream one with temperature t w 1 and t w 2 respectively using a finite differences scheme where x was approximated with the distance l between the considered stations and t is 1 day using a first order upwind scheme and approximating river channel shape with a rectangular one roughly valid for naturally shaped rivers such as serio river here in several traits we moved from equation 2 to equation 4 and then isolated t w 2 i 2 to explicity assess downstream temperature at day 2 eq 5 4 t w 1 i 2 t w 1 i 1 δ t v l t w 2 i 2 t w 1 i 2 1 θ ρ h α t a i r t w 1 i 2 β r a d i 2 5 t w 2 i 2 t w 1 i 2 l v δ t θ ρ h α t air t w 1 i 2 β rad i 2 l v δ t t w 1 i 2 t w 1 i 1 therein i 1 i 2 indicate day 1 and 2 and h is water depth the water depth and the velocity v could be evaluated as power functions of discharge in this space dependant formulation one needs to fix an upstream initial condition for temperature therefore we set the initial condition of the temperature at the largest lake upstream i e barbellino lake where changes in temperature are more gradual and season dependant the barbellino reservoir is an artificial lake located at 1870 m a s l 9 3 km upstream of the first thermal station where outflow is regulated by a hydropower dam 69 m tall serio river starts at the toe of the serio waterfall with a 315 m jump i e the tallest waterfall of italy watered with the reservoir output generally due to thermocline water temperature at a depth of 20 m can be taken as constant at 4 c dodds and whiles 2010 however withdrawal from the bottom outlet has a mixing effect that has been shown to impact upon hypolimnion lake bottom temperature saber et al 2019 nurnberg 2007 therefore here we modelled barbellino hypolimnion temperature using a sinusoidal function well representing lake bottom temperature in other regulated lakes 48 therein minimum water temperature can be fixed at 4 and phase amplitude and mean values are related to seasonal air temperature as 6 t wbar γ t y ω t sum t y sin 2 π day l a g 365 π therein t y and t sum are annual and july mean temperature estimated at barbellino lake that we linked to average and summer variation of water temperature respectively also γ ω l a g are calibration parameters for model tuning we used data of water temperature at the station of fiumenero as mentioned above along the river stem several hydropower plants divert water modifying stream flows and temperature thereby to account for this the thermal balance as from eq 5 was further modified to consider stream flow changes between different sections as due to i hydrological flow increase contributing catchment ii water diversion for hydropower and iii water return from hydropower tail race channels the water used for hydropower in serio river is often collected in channels buried in the ground i e largely insulated from the atmosphere and restitution at lower altitude occurs quite rapidly with respect to stream flow dynamics i e with a shorter delay than the time span required for the river flow to reach the same altitude accordingly we made the hypothesis that diverted returned water keeps the same temperature i e the water temperature at the restitution point is the same as the stream temperature at the point of withdrawal one can thereby assess water temperature downstream of a flow returning point i e downstream of a tail race channel as the weighted average of the upstream in river temperature and the tail race temperature as 7 t w 3 t w 1 q 1 t w 2 q 2 q 1 q 2 here t w 3 is water the temperature downstream tail race and t w 1 t w 2 are temperature of instream and diverted water and q 1 q 2 are discharge values thereby 2 7 critical temperature for thermal suitability in this case of study where salmo trutta is abundant and oxygen rate during our ten year campaign was always found at saturation level due to the high water turbulence of many riffles rapids we chose as a target disease pkd being particularly temperature dependant waldner et al 2019 and a main threat for alpine trouts e g wahli et al 2007 to define the critical thresholds of water temperature for pkd we relied upon the most recent literature carraro et al 2017 santiago et al 2016 borgwardt et al 2020 and we decided to use the criteria as set out by borgwardt et al 2020 considering water temperature tw and a corresponding consecutive duration dtw when the daily mean temperature is above tw 15 c a situation of i possible outbreak of pkd occurs if the exceedance lasts for dtw 14 consecutive days eq 8 and a situation of ii low mortality occurs when dtw 29 consecutive days eq 9 the most worrisome condition i e iii high mortality takes place when the daily mean temperature exceeds tw 18 c and dtw 26 consecutive days eq 10 8 possibleoutbreak t w 15 c d tw 14 9 lowmortality t w 15 c d tw 29 10 highmortality t w 18 c d tw 29 2 8 river stress indicator to provide a more comprehensive habitat assessment under present and future climate we constrained habitat suitability upon water temperature by calculating a river stress indicator rs representing the number of days per year when the river is in stress conditions rs is defined as the union of i days of poorest river quality e g number of days when pd is 40 60 of pdmax and days when ii water temperature is above the lowest threshold for pkd occurrence e g possible outbreak ideally more responsive to climate change 11 rs 0 4 pd max p d 0 6 pd max t w 15 c d tw 14 we calculated the total number of days when the river would be in a poor quality conditions at each sampling site for the 4 seasons and we averaged this number on the three reference decades cr 2012 2021 p1 2046 2055 and p2 2091 2100 2 9 hydrological projections to evaluate future air temperature to constrain hydrological scenarios we performed a downscaling of the outputs from six global circulation models gcms from the last assessment report 6 ar6 of the ipcc namely european ec earth3 0 ec earth cesm2 danabasoglu et al 2020 echam6 3 mauritsen et al 2019 hadgem3 ridley et al 2018 mircoc6 kataoka et al 2020 and cmcc cm2 cherchi et al 2019 for each model we considered the 4 shared socio economic pathways ssps that are being used as part of the experiment coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip 6 of the ar6 o neill et al 2016 ssp 1 and ssp 5 project a positive development of society but while the latter would be at the expense of an economy based on fossil fuel the former foresees a sustainable economy the ssp 2 scenario follows the historical trend while the ssp 3 and ssp 4 foresee a negative development of the society dynamics worldwide four ssps scenarios were used in this study based on the representative concentration pathways of the ar5 i e rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios namely ssp 126 245 585 and an intermediate ssp370 scenario precipitation was spatially downscaled i e from gcm cell to rain gauges with a stochastic space random cascade model groppelli et al 2011a while for temperature we used a correction with a mean monthly δt approach groppelli et al 2011b 3 results 3 1 hydrological modelling and flow projections poli hydro model was calibrated to fix the necessary parameters of soil permeability and snow melting for a calibration period 2015 2018 by matching q values as measured at the ponte cene hydrometer fig 3 the bias between observed and modelled monthly stream flows was bias 7 and nse 0 71 similar statistics values were obtained for the validation period 2019 2020 bias 6 nse 0 73 a table with the calibration parameter of poli hydro model is given in the supplementary material after model calibration we used poli hydro to assess projected flow discharges we report in fig 4 the projected mean monthly flow for each ssp averaged over the 6 gcms at mid century p1 and end of century p2 and comparison with discharges in cr period 2012 2021 the increase of liquid precipitation at the expense of solid precipitation in winter months would lead to an increase of stream flows therein the decrease of discharge between may and october would be due to decrease of precipitation and to a lack of snowmelt and increase of evapotranspiration overall the average annual discharge e qy of 21 26 m3s 1 in the cr period would decrease in the future to e qy 19 19 m3s 1 and e qy 17 83 m3s 1 for ssp 585 at p1 and p2 respectively 3 2 thermal modelling poli wat temp model calibration namely for parameters α and β was carried out by minimizing bias and random mean square error rmse for calibration starting from the measured water temperature at fiumenero 1 m we applied the thermal model downstream and then we corrected the parameters in order to fit the modelled water temperature to observed data in parre 8 v then we calibrated the parameters γ ω l a g of barbellino temperature model by applying poli wat temp from barbellino to the first station where we had measured data i e fiumenero here we minimized bias and rmse of the modelled temperature against the measured data at fiumenero station fig 5 the calibration parameters for the poli wat temp for barbellino temperature are shown in the supplementary material table 5 table 6 finally we applied the thermal model from barbellino to parre and we performed model validation by matching for each station the computed values of water temperature with the measured ones and evaluating bias and rmse thereby table 3 3 3 thermal suitability in fig 6 we report the mean monthly temperature as simulated for the 8 river stations during the cr period 2012 2021 for the most critical month i e august when temperatures are the highest and the flow the lowest although the average temperature is below the critical one for pkd also in the most downstream stretch sporadic exceeding of the threshold is found for the 3 most downstream stations where pkd may burst possibly with low impact 3 4 habitat suitability with poli hydro model we simulated daily discharges within the 8 sampling locations and we evaluated the corresponding pd in each station in fig 7 we reported the number of days per year averaged along cr period when trout pd falls in each of the two classes that we defined i e good or poor based upon the maximum value of daily potential density pdmax we can see that pd is characterized by higher variability between the upstream and downstream sections mainly for adults and juvenile than for fry but for adults differently from fry and juvenile most of the downstream sections show seemingly little suitable habitat conditions in almost all seasons contrarily for young trout one finds low habitat suitability only in the two upstream sections while overall quite acceptable flow conditions are found this is true also for fry except in downstream sections where habitat is sometimes less suitable 3 5 river stress we reported in fig 8 the river stress indicator for each sampling site and trout life stage averaged over the cr since temperature is nearly always below the pkd critical threshold the stress conditions for the river are mainly due to poor habitat suitability one can see the negative contribution of temperature to rs only in downstream sections and in summer months where sporadic exceedance of the thermal threshold is found 3 6 future thermal suitability our modelled water temperature in future scenarios is reported for the whole stretch in fig 9 using average values of the 6 gcm models only for ssp126 and ssp585 as respectively the more optimistic and pessimistic ones in p1 and p2 one finds that in the worst case scenario the model estimated an increase up to 6 5 c during august which is again the most critic month with likely severe consequences on trout health indeed as water temperature would increase pkd outburst would become more and more frequent and more severe in fig 10 we report the average number of days per year when temperature would be above pkd threshold during cr under all future scenarios all scenarios exhibit possible outbreaks however while for mid century p1 spreading of pkd would be limited to most downstream sections during p2 under the worst scenarios pkd threshold would be exceeded for most of the summer possibly leading to high mortality in downstream sections and low mortality elsewhere in the reach to assess hydro morphological suitability we evaluated pd for the 8 sampling sites during p1 and p2 for the two scenarios ssp126 and ssp585 thus providing the lower and the upper bound of the future suitability assessment then we evaluated number of days per year averaged along the cr p1 and p2 when such weighted pd for the river would fall within each class for each season fig 11 because winter discharge would increase in future scenarios fig 4 water level would also increase and accordingly adult fish would find more suitable conditions this projected condition would be confirmed by the slight decrease in future winters of the number of days when pd for adult trout would be in poor class on the contrary in spring and fall the number of days in poor class would remain almost constant while in summer the critical days would slightly increase no evident trends are observed for juvenile and fry stages that may face less criticalities 3 7 future river stress in fig 12 we report the rs index during p1 and p2 for the two scenarios ssp126 and ssp585 differently from the findings for the cr period fig 8 here the combination of the habitat and thermal suitability seem crucial since it would lead to a worsening of river conditions when considering both the suitability functions with respect to the approach of dealing with them separately fig 10 fig 11 whereas for adult the projected habitat suitability along the river would be undermined under all scenarios both in p1 and p2 for juvenile and fry the findings would be slightly less alarming fig 11 contrarily the rs index by combining habitat suitability with the effect of projected water temperature increase would project a picture with larger stress leading under the worst case scenarios to the highest stress conditions in summer and fall seasons 4 discussion suitability indexes depending upon stream flow magnitude and timing are largely adopted to evaluate the effect of climate change on riverine habitat viganò et al 2016 ayllòn et al 2009 however assessment of water temperature is likely essential due to its effects upon physiology and behaviour of trout elliot j m and elliot j a 2010 the assessment of water temperature requires proper modelling particularly in rivers exploited by human activity where alteration of the thermal regime as due to withdrawal and release is still poorly understood dickson et al 2012 we used here a physically based model poli wat temp depending upon factors directly affecting thermal dynamics we modelled daily water temperature obtaining a bias mod obs smaller than 1 c in each water temperature station that is consistent with similar studies in nearby areas toffolon et piccolroaz 2015 in future worst scenarios we projected a significant temperature increase for water in most downstream areas during august over 6 5 c which is even higher than the increase of air temperature as projected this result is coherent e g with a recent study in columbia basin ficklin et al 2014 where the lack of cold water coming from snow would lead to similar temperature outbreaks and it is also consistent with the historic trend of swiss streams temperature as observed nearby 0 37c per decade vs 0 13c per decade for air temperature auer et al 2007 nevertheless in other studies projected temperature increase would be milder michel et al 2022 agnetti et al 2018 especially when using empirical models possibly less recommended for projections in future scenarios leach et al 2019 in these models generally water temperature is linearly dependant on air temperature with slopes smaller than one erickson et al 1996 however in physical models the link with air temperature can be more complex given the presence of other variables also depending upon air temperature i e upstream water temperature like here and the link between air water temperatures is less predictable here we considered spatial dependence thus water temperature is affected by upstream boundary conditions e g water temperature in barbellino lake with its average linked linearly to annual air temperature we did not consider here boundary initial conditions as possibly given by other smaller reservoirs in the high serio valley e g valmorta avert we nevertheless consider this choice as the best option here since we do not possess data thereby for water temperature assessment furthermore regarding the assessment of barbellino temperature the apparent lack of physical modelling of lake heating dynamics crucial to correctly assess downstream temperature possibly limits our analysis here indeed most studies concerning lake temperature are related to epilimnion i e the lake surface where more data are available and remote sensing can be used pareeth et al 2016 few studies try to model hypolimnion temperature prats et al 2019 and we are not aware of any studies attempting to model lake temperature considering the effect of withdrawal upon lake mixing indeed the morphology of the hydraulic structure impacts lake mixing and so vertical temperature profile is also affected according to our predictions of hydro morphological suitability we do not foresee very large trends therein for the next future like previous studies in the area viganò et al 2016 small flow variations are projected in winter when a slight increase of discharge due to larger shares of liquid precipitation would positively affect adult trout we observed that potential trout density would never decrease below 40 of its maximum in our simulations thus dramatic conditions linked to lack of water would not be encountered in serio river under our hypotheses moreover the critical periods in response to hydrological and thermal conditions i e winter and summer respectively do not coincide thus the combined indicator rs highlights that the critical periods in the year may be longer than when considering the two suitability indexes separately as it would be expected it is important to point out that rs we used here was calculated by merging the number of days when pd falls in poor class and the number of days when water temperature is above the threshold for the possible outbreak of pkd if we had considered the intersection of the two sets or a different criterion to define the critical threshold for temperature probably the results would be less critical however we considered the lowest temperature threshold for pkd because it is the one likely to be most sensitive to climate change three years of water temperature monitoring 2018 2021 in the upper serio catchment revealed an acceptable thermal habitat for salmo trutta since water temperature was always below the chosen critical thresholds the future projections show continuous and evident worsening of the thermal habitat for trout in particular for most downstream stations ra gru pa other studies recently demonstrated the worsening of thermal conditions in temperate rivers due to climate change santiago et al santiago et al 2016 studied the effects of climate change upon the thermal niche of brown trout in the iberian duero river basin they showed that in the worst scenario rcp 8 5 loss of habitat of brown trout may reach 30 in the upstream part of the basin at the end of the century the thermal niche was assessed using a threshold based on the exceeding of 18 c daily mean and projections showed an increase of ca 3 and 9 folds of the number of consecutive days above the threshold with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively similarly borgwardt et al 2020 projected the effects of climate change on austrian brown trout at country scale assessing both physiological stress and potential emergence of diseases overall they found that at the end of the century rcp 8 5 would show an increase of both high mortality 25 and low mortality 20 conditions in our case study high mortality tw 18 c is seldom if ever predicted since we studied a cold alpine river however our results clearly show that the habitat of brown trout would face a more dramatic condition with headwater areas becoming the only optimal niche for the conservation of the species we consider the pkd as the most likely risk factor for trout preliminarily neglecting a possible negative effect as due to lack of food or hypoxia indeed several studies demonstrated that increasing temperatures enhance disease prevalence severity and distribution and pkd related mortality okamura 201 waldner et al 2019 by contrast rising temperatures do not seem to adversely affect food availability because secondary productivity of benthos generally increases albertson et al 2018 bonacina 2022 furthermore as aforementioned oxygen rate in the serio river was always found at saturation level likely due to flow turbulence and the maximum temperatures projected in the worst scenario approximately 21 c did not visibly cause a decrease in oxygen below the concentration needed by trout 7 mg l sub alpine and alpine rivers are profoundly impacted by human infrastructures both for hydroelectric and irrigation purposes affecting the riverine thermal regime cassie 2006 for this reason we included here hydropower diversion in our study to further explore climate change impacts upon fish communities more detailed investigation covering the effects of plants and dams on the thermal regime should be carried out at a regional scale this study helps to understand the magnitude of thermal impacts and explores measures to mitigate the effects of global warming for instance an increase of the minimum flow discharge especially during summer heat waves could increase the thermal inertia of the river and reduce warming decreasing the number of critical days possibly at the cost of reducing hydropower production moreover other strategies to reduce temperature raising could be implemented such as the increase of vegetation cover along the river to enhance the shading and reduce the effect of solar radiation here we considered as a target species the salmo trutta since it is regarded as a most abundant and economically viable fish species in serio river however the marble trout salmo marmoratus indigenous and subendemic of the po valley zerunian 2003 has the same habitat preferences of the allopatric brown trout and it may survive to higher temperature thresholds so in the future it might likely face less criticalities marble trout is included in the habitat directive 92 43 cee and in the iucn red list of threatened species crivelli 2006 another endemic species of the po valley is cottus gobio elliot j et elliot a 1995 also included in the habitat directive 92 43 cee as well in the iucn red list of vertebrate animals rondinini et al 2013 and it has more flexible thermal preference compared to salmo trutta thus the conservation of the endangered species salmo marmoratus and cottus gobio may be fundamental to maintain healthy fish communities on subalpine rivers like serio here also under a climate change adaptation perspective 5 conclusions this study introduces a new physical model to assess river water temperature with the presence of hydropower plants and a synthetic river stress index to consider both the effects of change in discharge and water temperature on riverine habitat the proposed methodology was applied to alpine serio river in present and ipcc future scenarios where future hydraulic habitat suitability is not expected to highlight large criticalities while projections of stream temperature show apparently more alarming findings this methodology can be applied to other alpine rivers also exploited for human activities and requiring quality assessment pending basic information availability of hydrology thermal regime and fish abundance as reported here even in lack of information some findings may be portable to other areas e g fish density functions for similar target species such analysis may help in i evaluating seasonal criticalities for fish species and ii providing more sustainable withdrawal strategies and thus outlining a

2627,habitat quality of alpine river is largely affected by human activity the exploitation for hydropower combined with anthropogenic climate change canalter mountain riverine ecosystems leading to less suitable hydro thermal regimes for the fish here we present a new methodology to assess water temperature within a river featuring water exploitation for hydropower purposes usable to assess future potential deterioration of riverine habit suitability in response to increasing water temperature we then propose an application focusing upon the case study of the serio river in northern italy largely exploited by hydropower productions and highly populated by a very sensitive species brown trout salmo trutta the methodology proposed involves a set of tools i e i the hydrological model poli hydro to evaluate natural hydrological regime ii a hydropower plants scheme to assess river water withdrawal iii fish density environment curves to evaluate the hydraulic suitability in terms of trout potential density for adult young and fry as a function of hydraulic features i e depth and velocity and iv a new physically based model poli wat temp to assess changes in river water temperature and possible outbreaks of temperature dependant lethal conditions such as proliferative kidney disease and others to provide an assessment of river suitability possibly complementing improving models based upon solely hydraulic indexes we propose a new synthetic river stress index combining i potential fish density as driven by hydraulic variables and ii thermal suitability given that utmost unsuitable conditions thermally and likely hydrologically are expected under future climate conditions pending global warming we then projected water temperature and stream flows until the end of the century in response to socio economic scenariosof ar6 of the ipcc to explore the potential for future decrease of river quality water temperature would be largely susceptible to climate change with increase up to 6 5c in the worst scenarios while no clear trend is observed for fish density overall potential density would decrease in winter for adults and in summer for juvenile and fry in downstream sections therefore by coupling hydraulic and thermal suitability one finds that i alpine rivers would likely face longer critical periods with respect to those predicted based upon a solely hydraulic habitat based assessment and ii continuous temperature increase as projected until the end of the century would result into worse conditions in summer months seriously endangering fish guilds keywords water temperature modelling physical habitat modelling river stress indicator climate change data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global warming effects upon water ecosystems have now been evident for years the impact of climate change on freshwater availability was assessed both at regional arnell 1999 lehner et al 2006 and global scale doll and zhang 2010 sperna et al 2012 vorosmarty et al 2000 among others several studies were carried out that highlighted significant warming in the european alps decreasing of snow and ice cover and stream flows modification thereby bocchiola and diolaiuti 2010 bocchiola 2014 fuso et al 2020 few studies focused upon changes of water temperature which is crucial for the distribution of biotic organisms in the rivers featuring direct and indirect effects beside the direct influence upon dissolved oxygen webb et al 2008 van vliet et al 2013 increase in water temperature may provide emergence of diseases such as proliferative kidney disease pkd in freshwater fish carraro et al 2017 pkd is a major threat to wild and farmed salmonid populations because of its lethal effect at high water temperatures the disease was recognized as a frequent cause of decline in fish populations over the last decades even driving local extinctions of endemic and or commercially important fish species borsuk et al 2006 when studying thermal regime of rivers attention was cast hitherto upon the link between water and air temperature the latter can indeed be seen as a driver of the former because it affects heat flows to from water edinger et al 1968 zhu et al 2018 thus projected air temperature increase under global warming will likely affect mountain streams temperature and living conditions of river species isaak et al 2010 santiago et al 2016 borgwardt et al 2020 stochastic models exist that link water and air temperature and are easy to implement thanks to the large diffusion of air temperature data caissie et al 2001 caissie et al 1998 further meteorological data are needed to apply more sophisticated deterministic models based upon energy balance caissie et al 2005 bustillo et al 2015 however the latter are more appropriate to analyse anthropogenic activities directly impacting rivers e g diversion channels industrial flows and presence of reservoirs benyahya et al 2007 dams and minor barriers disrupt the hydrological and fluvial ecosystem connectivity affecting the river environment and thermal regime kedra and wiejaczka 2017 particularly diverted water is less susceptible to heating given that often times diversion channels are buried in the ground then return of such colder water in the main river typically at some length downstream and at a lower altitude would cause a sudden drop in water temperature on the other hand water flow left in the river has less thermal inertia due to decreased discharge leading to higher temperature in summer and lower in winter meier et al 2003 thermal models depending upon air temperature only may not be always suitable i e the effect of flow magnitude cannot be neglected toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and more sophisticated heat exchange models are required that make spatial dependence and effects of increasing flow downstream more explicit the eu biodiversity strategy for 2030 eu 2020 states the need to re establish freshwater ecosystems and the natural functions of rivers in this context the assessment of river habitat quality is a key factor lamouroux et al 1998 canobbio et al 2013 and one expects that fish distribution abundance will reflect riverine conditions on a larger spatial scale lamouroux and cattaneo 2006 vancompernolle et al 2019 physical habitat models have been widely used to describe the connection between instream flow and habitat availability for different target species fornaroli et al 2016 however in addition to hydrological flows water temperature is determinant for river species occurrence nukazawa et al 2011 jonsson and jonsson 2009 thus to simulate habitat suitability it seems relevant to consider multiple habitat characteristics and integrated frameworks that couple water temperature and hydraulic parameters may be considered morid et al 2020 the main goals of our study are 1 to propose a new physically based thermal model called poli wat temp to assess water temperature of a river characterized by complex geometry of withdrawal and return to from hydropower plants and 2 to evaluate the combined effect of hydraulic and thermal stress upon mountain river habitat by elaborating a new index which we call river stress we develop here the method and then we propose an application to a stretch of an alpine river the serio catchment in northern italy we chose this catchment for two reasons i e i it nests several hydropower plants displaying a complex geometry of diversion return channels affecting both hydrological and thermal regimes and ii it is populated by salmo trutta the presence of which is nowadays made possible by high dissolved oxygen and somewhat acceptable water temperature armour 1994 the thermal model was calibrated using field data of air and water temperature taken during surveys in several cross sections along the serio river river discharge at several chosen locations along the stream was assessed using the semi distributed physically based hydrological model poli hydro soncini et al 2017 at the basin scale for habitat quality assessment we then used the so modelled discharges as an input to density environmental functions for salmo trutta at different stages young adult and fries calibrated recently for the serio river fornaroli et al 2016 to then evaluate the limiting effects of hydro morphological variables such as water depth current velocity substrate size and composition upon habitat conditions we then propose a new index of river stress by combining habitat suitability and water temperature so obtaining more credible habitat assessment under given climate conditions we projected water temperatures and stream flows to the end of the xxi century in response to climate change as projected under the socio economic scenarios ssp of the most recent assessment report ar6 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to highlight areas of increased stress usable for future planning of adaptation strategies the paper is organized as follows the case study and available data are reported in section 2 where also the methods are discussed the results of model calibration and subsequent of application are discussed in section 3 discussion and conclusions are in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study serio river is 124 km long nested in lombardy region northern italy flowing in the provinces of bergamo bg and cremona cr to the outflow of the adda river fig 1 it has a watershed of 1256 km2 and the source is located at 2500 m asl nearby torena mount in the orobic prealps serio is a mountain river with mono cursal bed step pools geometry and coarse substrate at ca 600 m asl in parre bg the river becomes more and more braiding and gravel sand bottomed at ca 100 m asl it starts meandering with very gentle slope and fine substrate here we consider the river stretch upstream of parre most relevant for water quality assessment and for measurable presence of the target fish species the watershed is located within a temperate region with a total precipitation of ca 1300 mm per year and mean temperature of 23 8 c in july and 1 5 c in january the river receives large precipitation in autumn and large snow melt in spring no ice melt contribution is present here due to the absence of permanent glaciers in the area the hydrological regime displays low discharges in january and february mild flow in spring and main floods in fall the serio river is largely exploited for hydropower production seven run of river power plants are located along the river that we know of in valbondione to parre stretch fig 1 the water collecting and returning points form 7 stretches where the hydrological and thermal regime is altered with respect to natural conditions the considered reach is classified as a high regard area for fishing by the province of bergamo 2009 where the most valued fish species is brown trout salmo trutta protected from overfishing by a limitation in time and amount lombardy region 2003 changes in precipitation and temperature may negatively affect the hydrological regime of the area armour 1994 viganò et al 2016 groppelli et al 2011 leading to critical hydro thermal conditions for the fish it is therefore essential to study the impact of such present and potential future changes upon river quality to plan adaptation strategies for safeguarding of the species and their ecosystem here we assessed the effect of climate change upon river habitat within 8 stations of the upper serio fig 1 where hydro morphological and topographic surveys together with electro fishing samplings were carried out as described e g in viganò et al 2016 2 2 data available daily series of precipitation and air temperature from 3 automatic weather station aws of arpa lombardy authority were used here as inputs to the hydrological model poli hydro e g 9 the model was implemented with a spatial resolution of 100x100 m2 for a 10 year control run period cr 2012 2021 other inputs were the gis map i e digital elevation model dem of the catchment earth data available online https earthdata nasa gov and the land use maps from corine land cover clc 2018 copernicus land monitoring service available online https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc2018 daily discharges at ponte cene hydro station during the cr period were used for model calibration under natural regime conditions while data of minimum instream flow mif and maximum operable discharge qhy for each hydropower station were used to switch from natural to regulated hydrological regime table 1 to setup the thermal model water temperature data were gathered within the sites reported in fig 1 see table 2 for three years june 2018 october 2021 using ibutton devices range 5 to 26 c resolution 0 0625 c measurement interval 10 min water temperature data were downloaded and a linear interpolation between consecutive measurements was performed to obtain a continuous trend of water temperature one value per minute and eventually daily mean maximum and minimum temperature finally density environmental relationships for salmo trutta at different stages fry juvenile adult as derived after sampling in eight stations along the river fornaroli et al 2016 were used for river habitat assessment table 1 2 3 river suitability assessment to assess the river suitability of serio river several methods models were applied here in cascade for clarity we report in fig 2 a flowchart displaying the data and methods adopted here using precipitation and air temperature data p t and watershed gis maps we setup the hydrological model poli hydro to derive daily discharges q we used then the modelled discharges as input to a habitat suitability model that defines fish potential density used to evaluate habitat suitability in the sample locations with the thermal model based upon known the geometry of the hydropower system and of the return tail race system we then used t and the modelled discharge q to assess pointwise daily water temperature tw then we defined habitat suitability classes and water temperature thresholds for pkd next we provided an indicator of stress of the river rs by matching hydraulic habitat suitability with suitability based upon water temperature which we call ts for future projections we downscaled values from gcm scenarios to get future precipitation and temperature pfut and tfut these were fed to poli hydro to assess future discharges qfut still using the thermal model we then exploited tfut qfut to evaluate future scenarios of water temperature tw fut and suitability thereby here we assumed for simplicity that the present hydropower scheme would remain unchanged in the future finally with the same approach above we provided projections of the future river stress rsfut 2 4 hydrological modelling thepoli hydro hydrological model was already used validated and described in several studies hitherto soncini et al 2017 where the reader is referred thereby for a detailed description poli hydrocomputes daily soil water balancefor each cell within thecatchment area here defined with arc gis software the control variable is soil water content inputs are given by liquid precipitation air temperature and snow ice melt and outputs arewater fluxesin the river snow accumulation on the ground in the form of snow water equivalent swe is assessed from precipitation i e snowfall when temperature in one cell is below 0 swe melt is then evaluated with a mixed degree day formula e g pellicciotti et al 2005 temperature is distributed spatially using monthly vertical gradients as from observations by doing so the model can reconstruct for each cell rainfall snow pack on the ground snow ice melt however as reported no ice surface is present in the catchment here surface andsubsurface flows the latter are then routed using a iuh function i e nash model to the final outlet of each sub basin to obtain daily stream flow hydrographs the model was calibrated here for natural discharge estimation and then validated usinggoodness of fitstatistics i e bias and monthly nse nash sutcliffe efficiency calculated against the observed discharges at ponte cene hydrometer relatively undisturbed by flow regulation and simulated discharges

provided for every plant table 1 and we used the proposed values accordingly in the assumption that hydropower managers properly release qmif downstream of intakes 2 5 hydraulic habitat assessment to assess hydraulic based suitability we used a habitat suitability model that defines potential density based upon a limiting factor approach as recently proposed by fornaroli et al 2016 these functions use water velocity depth substrate characteristics availability of refuges and mesohabitat type the latter is divided in four categories namely i shallow pool ii deep pool iii riffle iv run as retrieved within the 8 sampling sites fig 1 table 1 using the functions as developed in our study area fornaroli et al 2016 we assessed the potential density pd ind m2 with respect to discharge for the young and adult trout and for fries obtaining a potential number of individuals per square meters in each site for each discharge level so we calculated pd for the cr period in each sampling site and for each life stage of salmo trutta we then defined two classes of quality i e poor and good corresponding to the intervals for pd 40 60 60 100 of the maximum value of daily potential density pdmax respectively we chose 40 as a lower bound because it was the lowest value resulting from our simulations thus we added up the total number of days in each class for the 4 seasons winter spring summer and fall and we averaged over three different decades i e cr 2012 2021 as a reference in the present conditions a period one p1 half century 2046 2055 and a period two p2 end of century 2091 2100 to evaluate future river suitability 2 6 water temperature modelling here we developed a model for water temperature assessment which we called poli wat temp this is a coupled model interacting with poli hydro to take as an input estimated stream flows and air temperature data the poli wat temp model uses a one dimensional energy balance equation suitable for shallow rivers where vertical gradient of temperature can be neglected caissie et al 2005 as follows 2 t w t v t w x 1 a x a d l t w x b θ ρ a h tot therein t w is water temperature v is mean water velocity x is distance along river axis a is cross section area b is river width d l is a dispersion coefficient in the flow direction θ is specific heat of water ρ is water density h tot is total heat flux from the external environment to the river including solar radiation air temperature evaporative heat fluxes and net long wave radiation here we considered air temperature and incident solar radiation as external sources of heat that we modelled as linear functions of the air water temperature gradient and of incident clear sky solar radiation respectively 3 h tot α t air t w β r a d the dispersion term in eq 2 a d l t w x x may be generally neglected in alpine rivers characterized by medium high flow velocity so that heat transfer along the x axis basically occurs by advection deas and l lowney 2000 v t w t w we solved eq 2 recursively to evaluate heat fluxes from an upstream station to a downstream one with temperature t w 1 and t w 2 respectively using a finite differences scheme where x was approximated with the distance l between the considered stations and t is 1 day using a first order upwind scheme and approximating river channel shape with a rectangular one roughly valid for naturally shaped rivers such as serio river here in several traits we moved from equation 2 to equation 4 and then isolated t w 2 i 2 to explicity assess downstream temperature at day 2 eq 5 4 t w 1 i 2 t w 1 i 1 δ t v l t w 2 i 2 t w 1 i 2 1 θ ρ h α t a i r t w 1 i 2 β r a d i 2 5 t w 2 i 2 t w 1 i 2 l v δ t θ ρ h α t air t w 1 i 2 β rad i 2 l v δ t t w 1 i 2 t w 1 i 1 therein i 1 i 2 indicate day 1 and 2 and h is water depth the water depth and the velocity v could be evaluated as power functions of discharge in this space dependant formulation one needs to fix an upstream initial condition for temperature therefore we set the initial condition of the temperature at the largest lake upstream i e barbellino lake where changes in temperature are more gradual and season dependant the barbellino reservoir is an artificial lake located at 1870 m a s l 9 3 km upstream of the first thermal station where outflow is regulated by a hydropower dam 69 m tall serio river starts at the toe of the serio waterfall with a 315 m jump i e the tallest waterfall of italy watered with the reservoir output generally due to thermocline water temperature at a depth of 20 m can be taken as constant at 4 c dodds and whiles 2010 however withdrawal from the bottom outlet has a mixing effect that has been shown to impact upon hypolimnion lake bottom temperature saber et al 2019 nurnberg 2007 therefore here we modelled barbellino hypolimnion temperature using a sinusoidal function well representing lake bottom temperature in other regulated lakes 48 therein minimum water temperature can be fixed at 4 and phase amplitude and mean values are related to seasonal air temperature as 6 t wbar γ t y ω t sum t y sin 2 π day l a g 365 π therein t y and t sum are annual and july mean temperature estimated at barbellino lake that we linked to average and summer variation of water temperature respectively also γ ω l a g are calibration parameters for model tuning we used data of water temperature at the station of fiumenero as mentioned above along the river stem several hydropower plants divert water modifying stream flows and temperature thereby to account for this the thermal balance as from eq 5 was further modified to consider stream flow changes between different sections as due to i hydrological flow increase contributing catchment ii water diversion for hydropower and iii water return from hydropower tail race channels the water used for hydropower in serio river is often collected in channels buried in the ground i e largely insulated from the atmosphere and restitution at lower altitude occurs quite rapidly with respect to stream flow dynamics i e with a shorter delay than the time span required for the river flow to reach the same altitude accordingly we made the hypothesis that diverted returned water keeps the same temperature i e the water temperature at the restitution point is the same as the stream temperature at the point of withdrawal one can thereby assess water temperature downstream of a flow returning point i e downstream of a tail race channel as the weighted average of the upstream in river temperature and the tail race temperature as 7 t w 3 t w 1 q 1 t w 2 q 2 q 1 q 2 here t w 3 is water the temperature downstream tail race and t w 1 t w 2 are temperature of instream and diverted water and q 1 q 2 are discharge values thereby 2 7 critical temperature for thermal suitability in this case of study where salmo trutta is abundant and oxygen rate during our ten year campaign was always found at saturation level due to the high water turbulence of many riffles rapids we chose as a target disease pkd being particularly temperature dependant waldner et al 2019 and a main threat for alpine trouts e g wahli et al 2007 to define the critical thresholds of water temperature for pkd we relied upon the most recent literature carraro et al 2017 santiago et al 2016 borgwardt et al 2020 and we decided to use the criteria as set out by borgwardt et al 2020 considering water temperature tw and a corresponding consecutive duration dtw when the daily mean temperature is above tw 15 c a situation of i possible outbreak of pkd occurs if the exceedance lasts for dtw 14 consecutive days eq 8 and a situation of ii low mortality occurs when dtw 29 consecutive days eq 9 the most worrisome condition i e iii high mortality takes place when the daily mean temperature exceeds tw 18 c and dtw 26 consecutive days eq 10 8 possibleoutbreak t w 15 c d tw 14 9 lowmortality t w 15 c d tw 29 10 highmortality t w 18 c d tw 29 2 8 river stress indicator to provide a more comprehensive habitat assessment under present and future climate we constrained habitat suitability upon water temperature by calculating a river stress indicator rs representing the number of days per year when the river is in stress conditions rs is defined as the union of i days of poorest river quality e g number of days when pd is 40 60 of pdmax and days when ii water temperature is above the lowest threshold for pkd occurrence e g possible outbreak ideally more responsive to climate change 11 rs 0 4 pd max p d 0 6 pd max t w 15 c d tw 14 we calculated the total number of days when the river would be in a poor quality conditions at each sampling site for the 4 seasons and we averaged this number on the three reference decades cr 2012 2021 p1 2046 2055 and p2 2091 2100 2 9 hydrological projections to evaluate future air temperature to constrain hydrological scenarios we performed a downscaling of the outputs from six global circulation models gcms from the last assessment report 6 ar6 of the ipcc namely european ec earth3 0 ec earth cesm2 danabasoglu et al 2020 echam6 3 mauritsen et al 2019 hadgem3 ridley et al 2018 mircoc6 kataoka et al 2020 and cmcc cm2 cherchi et al 2019 for each model we considered the 4 shared socio economic pathways ssps that are being used as part of the experiment coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip 6 of the ar6 o neill et al 2016 ssp 1 and ssp 5 project a positive development of society but while the latter would be at the expense of an economy based on fossil fuel the former foresees a sustainable economy the ssp 2 scenario follows the historical trend while the ssp 3 and ssp 4 foresee a negative development of the society dynamics worldwide four ssps scenarios were used in this study based on the representative concentration pathways of the ar5 i e rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios namely ssp 126 245 585 and an intermediate ssp370 scenario precipitation was spatially downscaled i e from gcm cell to rain gauges with a stochastic space random cascade model groppelli et al 2011a while for temperature we used a correction with a mean monthly δt approach groppelli et al 2011b 3 results 3 1 hydrological modelling and flow projections poli hydro model was calibrated to fix the necessary parameters of soil permeability and snow melting for a calibration period 2015 2018 by matching q values as measured at the ponte cene hydrometer fig 3 the bias between observed and modelled monthly stream flows was bias 7 and nse 0 71 similar statistics values were obtained for the validation period 2019 2020 bias 6 nse 0 73 a table with the calibration parameter of poli hydro model is given in the supplementary material after model calibration we used poli hydro to assess projected flow discharges we report in fig 4 the projected mean monthly flow for each ssp averaged over the 6 gcms at mid century p1 and end of century p2 and comparison with discharges in cr period 2012 2021 the increase of liquid precipitation at the expense of solid precipitation in winter months would lead to an increase of stream flows therein the decrease of discharge between may and october would be due to decrease of precipitation and to a lack of snowmelt and increase of evapotranspiration overall the average annual discharge e qy of 21 26 m3s 1 in the cr period would decrease in the future to e qy 19 19 m3s 1 and e qy 17 83 m3s 1 for ssp 585 at p1 and p2 respectively 3 2 thermal modelling poli wat temp model calibration namely for parameters α and β was carried out by minimizing bias and random mean square error rmse for calibration starting from the measured water temperature at fiumenero 1 m we applied the thermal model downstream and then we corrected the parameters in order to fit the modelled water temperature to observed data in parre 8 v then we calibrated the parameters γ ω l a g of barbellino temperature model by applying poli wat temp from barbellino to the first station where we had measured data i e fiumenero here we minimized bias and rmse of the modelled temperature against the measured data at fiumenero station fig 5 the calibration parameters for the poli wat temp for barbellino temperature are shown in the supplementary material table 5 table 6 finally we applied the thermal model from barbellino to parre and we performed model validation by matching for each station the computed values of water temperature with the measured ones and evaluating bias and rmse thereby table 3 3 3 thermal suitability in fig 6 we report the mean monthly temperature as simulated for the 8 river stations during the cr period 2012 2021 for the most critical month i e august when temperatures are the highest and the flow the lowest although the average temperature is below the critical one for pkd also in the most downstream stretch sporadic exceeding of the threshold is found for the 3 most downstream stations where pkd may burst possibly with low impact 3 4 habitat suitability with poli hydro model we simulated daily discharges within the 8 sampling locations and we evaluated the corresponding pd in each station in fig 7 we reported the number of days per year averaged along cr period when trout pd falls in each of the two classes that we defined i e good or poor based upon the maximum value of daily potential density pdmax we can see that pd is characterized by higher variability between the upstream and downstream sections mainly for adults and juvenile than for fry but for adults differently from fry and juvenile most of the downstream sections show seemingly little suitable habitat conditions in almost all seasons contrarily for young trout one finds low habitat suitability only in the two upstream sections while overall quite acceptable flow conditions are found this is true also for fry except in downstream sections where habitat is sometimes less suitable 3 5 river stress we reported in fig 8 the river stress indicator for each sampling site and trout life stage averaged over the cr since temperature is nearly always below the pkd critical threshold the stress conditions for the river are mainly due to poor habitat suitability one can see the negative contribution of temperature to rs only in downstream sections and in summer months where sporadic exceedance of the thermal threshold is found 3 6 future thermal suitability our modelled water temperature in future scenarios is reported for the whole stretch in fig 9 using average values of the 6 gcm models only for ssp126 and ssp585 as respectively the more optimistic and pessimistic ones in p1 and p2 one finds that in the worst case scenario the model estimated an increase up to 6 5 c during august which is again the most critic month with likely severe consequences on trout health indeed as water temperature would increase pkd outburst would become more and more frequent and more severe in fig 10 we report the average number of days per year when temperature would be above pkd threshold during cr under all future scenarios all scenarios exhibit possible outbreaks however while for mid century p1 spreading of pkd would be limited to most downstream sections during p2 under the worst scenarios pkd threshold would be exceeded for most of the summer possibly leading to high mortality in downstream sections and low mortality elsewhere in the reach to assess hydro morphological suitability we evaluated pd for the 8 sampling sites during p1 and p2 for the two scenarios ssp126 and ssp585 thus providing the lower and the upper bound of the future suitability assessment then we evaluated number of days per year averaged along the cr p1 and p2 when such weighted pd for the river would fall within each class for each season fig 11 because winter discharge would increase in future scenarios fig 4 water level would also increase and accordingly adult fish would find more suitable conditions this projected condition would be confirmed by the slight decrease in future winters of the number of days when pd for adult trout would be in poor class on the contrary in spring and fall the number of days in poor class would remain almost constant while in summer the critical days would slightly increase no evident trends are observed for juvenile and fry stages that may face less criticalities 3 7 future river stress in fig 12 we report the rs index during p1 and p2 for the two scenarios ssp126 and ssp585 differently from the findings for the cr period fig 8 here the combination of the habitat and thermal suitability seem crucial since it would lead to a worsening of river conditions when considering both the suitability functions with respect to the approach of dealing with them separately fig 10 fig 11 whereas for adult the projected habitat suitability along the river would be undermined under all scenarios both in p1 and p2 for juvenile and fry the findings would be slightly less alarming fig 11 contrarily the rs index by combining habitat suitability with the effect of projected water temperature increase would project a picture with larger stress leading under the worst case scenarios to the highest stress conditions in summer and fall seasons 4 discussion suitability indexes depending upon stream flow magnitude and timing are largely adopted to evaluate the effect of climate change on riverine habitat viganò et al 2016 ayllòn et al 2009 however assessment of water temperature is likely essential due to its effects upon physiology and behaviour of trout elliot j m and elliot j a 2010 the assessment of water temperature requires proper modelling particularly in rivers exploited by human activity where alteration of the thermal regime as due to withdrawal and release is still poorly understood dickson et al 2012 we used here a physically based model poli wat temp depending upon factors directly affecting thermal dynamics we modelled daily water temperature obtaining a bias mod obs smaller than 1 c in each water temperature station that is consistent with similar studies in nearby areas toffolon et piccolroaz 2015 in future worst scenarios we projected a significant temperature increase for water in most downstream areas during august over 6 5 c which is even higher than the increase of air temperature as projected this result is coherent e g with a recent study in columbia basin ficklin et al 2014 where the lack of cold water coming from snow would lead to similar temperature outbreaks and it is also consistent with the historic trend of swiss streams temperature as observed nearby 0 37c per decade vs 0 13c per decade for air temperature auer et al 2007 nevertheless in other studies projected temperature increase would be milder michel et al 2022 agnetti et al 2018 especially when using empirical models possibly less recommended for projections in future scenarios leach et al 2019 in these models generally water temperature is linearly dependant on air temperature with slopes smaller than one erickson et al 1996 however in physical models the link with air temperature can be more complex given the presence of other variables also depending upon air temperature i e upstream water temperature like here and the link between air water temperatures is less predictable here we considered spatial dependence thus water temperature is affected by upstream boundary conditions e g water temperature in barbellino lake with its average linked linearly to annual air temperature we did not consider here boundary initial conditions as possibly given by other smaller reservoirs in the high serio valley e g valmorta avert we nevertheless consider this choice as the best option here since we do not possess data thereby for water temperature assessment furthermore regarding the assessment of barbellino temperature the apparent lack of physical modelling of lake heating dynamics crucial to correctly assess downstream temperature possibly limits our analysis here indeed most studies concerning lake temperature are related to epilimnion i e the lake surface where more data are available and remote sensing can be used pareeth et al 2016 few studies try to model hypolimnion temperature prats et al 2019 and we are not aware of any studies attempting to model lake temperature considering the effect of withdrawal upon lake mixing indeed the morphology of the hydraulic structure impacts lake mixing and so vertical temperature profile is also affected according to our predictions of hydro morphological suitability we do not foresee very large trends therein for the next future like previous studies in the area viganò et al 2016 small flow variations are projected in winter when a slight increase of discharge due to larger shares of liquid precipitation would positively affect adult trout we observed that potential trout density would never decrease below 40 of its maximum in our simulations thus dramatic conditions linked to lack of water would not be encountered in serio river under our hypotheses moreover the critical periods in response to hydrological and thermal conditions i e winter and summer respectively do not coincide thus the combined indicator rs highlights that the critical periods in the year may be longer than when considering the two suitability indexes separately as it would be expected it is important to point out that rs we used here was calculated by merging the number of days when pd falls in poor class and the number of days when water temperature is above the threshold for the possible outbreak of pkd if we had considered the intersection of the two sets or a different criterion to define the critical threshold for temperature probably the results would be less critical however we considered the lowest temperature threshold for pkd because it is the one likely to be most sensitive to climate change three years of water temperature monitoring 2018 2021 in the upper serio catchment revealed an acceptable thermal habitat for salmo trutta since water temperature was always below the chosen critical thresholds the future projections show continuous and evident worsening of the thermal habitat for trout in particular for most downstream stations ra gru pa other studies recently demonstrated the worsening of thermal conditions in temperate rivers due to climate change santiago et al santiago et al 2016 studied the effects of climate change upon the thermal niche of brown trout in the iberian duero river basin they showed that in the worst scenario rcp 8 5 loss of habitat of brown trout may reach 30 in the upstream part of the basin at the end of the century the thermal niche was assessed using a threshold based on the exceeding of 18 c daily mean and projections showed an increase of ca 3 and 9 folds of the number of consecutive days above the threshold with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively similarly borgwardt et al 2020 projected the effects of climate change on austrian brown trout at country scale assessing both physiological stress and potential emergence of diseases overall they found that at the end of the century rcp 8 5 would show an increase of both high mortality 25 and low mortality 20 conditions in our case study high mortality tw 18 c is seldom if ever predicted since we studied a cold alpine river however our results clearly show that the habitat of brown trout would face a more dramatic condition with headwater areas becoming the only optimal niche for the conservation of the species we consider the pkd as the most likely risk factor for trout preliminarily neglecting a possible negative effect as due to lack of food or hypoxia indeed several studies demonstrated that increasing temperatures enhance disease prevalence severity and distribution and pkd related mortality okamura 201 waldner et al 2019 by contrast rising temperatures do not seem to adversely affect food availability because secondary productivity of benthos generally increases albertson et al 2018 bonacina 2022 furthermore as aforementioned oxygen rate in the serio river was always found at saturation level likely due to flow turbulence and the maximum temperatures projected in the worst scenario approximately 21 c did not visibly cause a decrease in oxygen below the concentration needed by trout 7 mg l sub alpine and alpine rivers are profoundly impacted by human infrastructures both for hydroelectric and irrigation purposes affecting the riverine thermal regime cassie 2006 for this reason we included here hydropower diversion in our study to further explore climate change impacts upon fish communities more detailed investigation covering the effects of plants and dams on the thermal regime should be carried out at a regional scale this study helps to understand the magnitude of thermal impacts and explores measures to mitigate the effects of global warming for instance an increase of the minimum flow discharge especially during summer heat waves could increase the thermal inertia of the river and reduce warming decreasing the number of critical days possibly at the cost of reducing hydropower production moreover other strategies to reduce temperature raising could be implemented such as the increase of vegetation cover along the river to enhance the shading and reduce the effect of solar radiation here we considered as a target species the salmo trutta since it is regarded as a most abundant and economically viable fish species in serio river however the marble trout salmo marmoratus indigenous and subendemic of the po valley zerunian 2003 has the same habitat preferences of the allopatric brown trout and it may survive to higher temperature thresholds so in the future it might likely face less criticalities marble trout is included in the habitat directive 92 43 cee and in the iucn red list of threatened species crivelli 2006 another endemic species of the po valley is cottus gobio elliot j et elliot a 1995 also included in the habitat directive 92 43 cee as well in the iucn red list of vertebrate animals rondinini et al 2013 and it has more flexible thermal preference compared to salmo trutta thus the conservation of the endangered species salmo marmoratus and cottus gobio may be fundamental to maintain healthy fish communities on subalpine rivers like serio here also under a climate change adaptation perspective 5 conclusions this study introduces a new physical model to assess river water temperature with the presence of hydropower plants and a synthetic river stress index to consider both the effects of change in discharge and water temperature on riverine habitat the proposed methodology was applied to alpine serio river in present and ipcc future scenarios where future hydraulic habitat suitability is not expected to highlight large criticalities while projections of stream temperature show apparently more alarming findings this methodology can be applied to other alpine rivers also exploited for human activities and requiring quality assessment pending basic information availability of hydrology thermal regime and fish abundance as reported here even in lack of information some findings may be portable to other areas e g fish density functions for similar target species such analysis may help in i evaluating seasonal criticalities for fish species and ii providing more sustainable withdrawal strategies and thus outlining a

2628,a hydraulic tomography physics informed neural network ht pinn is developed for inverting two dimensional large scale spatially distributed transmissivity ht pinn involves a neural network model of transmissivity and a series of neural network models to describe transient or steady state sequential pumping tests all the neural network models are jointly trained by minimizing the total loss function including data fitting errors and pde constraints batch training of collocation points is used to amplify the advantage of the mesh free property of neural networks thereby limiting the number of collocation points per training iteration and reducing the total training time the developed ht pinn accurately and efficiently inverts two dimensional gaussian transmissivity fields with more than a million unknowns 1024 1024 resolution and the inversion map accuracy exceeds 95 the effects of batch sampling methods batch number and size and data requirements for direct and indirect measurements are systematically investigated in addition the developed ht pinn exhibits great scalability and structure robustness in inverting fields with different resolutions ranging from coarse 64 64 to fine 1024 1024 specifically data requirements do not increase with the problem dimensionality and the computational cost of ht pinn remains almost unchanged due to its mesh free nature while

used by los s t evaluation metrics relative residuals ε pointwise estimation error 1 introduction the cost of directly measuring spatially variable parameters like hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity in the field is prohibitive leading to inverse problems of estimating these parameters through indirect measurements such as hydraulic heads or tracer concentrations hydraulic tomography ht also known as sequential pumping tests has demonstrated great potential for aquifer characterization with relatively low cost and simple data collection techniques yeh and liu 2000 by alternatively switching pumping and monitoring wells in a well network ht can provide larger and more informative data than a traditional single well pumping test the enhanced information density reduces the non uniqueness of potential inverse solutions for the unknown parameter field like hydraulic conductivities a common and effective approach to solving ht inverse problems is the gradient based geostatistical approach ga ga formulates the posterior distribution of target variables according to the likelihood of data matching and the prior for the smoothness regularization under the bayesian framework kitanidis 1995 the posteriori is maximized to obtain the best linear estimate and associated uncertainty the major challenge faced by ga is its applicability when the dimension of the target variable is large for estimating a high resolution parameter field the cost of computing and storing the associated full rank covariance matrix is very high especially when using gradient based methods such as newton s method to evaluate the jacobian matrix at each iteration ambikasaran et al 2013 klein et al 2017 liu and kitanidis 2011 liu et al 2013 obiefuna and eslamian 2019 many efforts have been made to optimize ga for large scale inverse problems from two aspects dimensionality reduction and efficient numerical methods dimensionality reduction encodes the original high dimensional parameter field as low dimensional random parameters and reformulates the computations on the original field to the random parameters so that the computations are more concise and efficient for example gaussian random fields can be encoded through combinations of independent projective vectors and identified with about tens of independent and identically distributed random variables the combinations of independent projective vectors which is usually referred as projection matrix can be obtained by principal component analysis pca kitanidis and lee 2014 lee and kitanidis 2014 lee et al 2016 zhao and luo 2020 zhao and luo 2021a for more complicated non gaussian fields machine learning or deep learning methods can be used for dimensionality reduction chen et al 2022 chen et al 2021 laloy et al 2018 laloy et al 2017 pang et al 2020 efficiency of numerical methods can be improved through accelerating the process of solving the linear system related to forward problems such as using efficient embeddings on the covariance matrix upscaling the parameter fields or implementing quasi newton methods for approximating jacobian matrices broyden 1965 nowak and cirpka 2004 nowak et al 2003 saibaba et al 2012 zhao et al 2022 zhao and luo 2021b in the present research we aim to explore a new method physics informed neural network pinn for solving high dimensional ht inverse problems pinn has demonstrated good potential in inverse modeling due to its pointwise computation and mesh free property pinn is a deep neural network dnn in structure but unlike dnn which only contains the loss function of the residuals of data matching pinn integrates additional constraints from prior physics information in the loss function to overcome the inability of traditional dnns for absorbing prior physics knowledge raissi et al 2017a raissi et al 2017b raissi et al 2017c raissi et al 2017d these constraints are mathematically expressed in partial differential equations pdes and derivative values approximated by automatic differentiation ad griewank 2003 after optimizing such a loss function pinn can make effective predictions in accordance with the governing pdes in addition to the observed data jagtap et al 2020 karniadakis 2019 kharazmi et al 2021 raissi and karniadakis 2018 for groundwater inverse problems tartakovsky et al 2020 used two pinns to jointly solve the forward and inverse groundwater flow problems one was used as the forward model for approximating hydraulic heads and the other as the inverse model for estimating heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities the study was extended to groundwater transport problems by assimilating tracer concentration and hydraulic heads data together for inversing the hydraulic conductivity field he et al 2020 he and tartakovsky 2021 wang et al 2020 developed a theory guided neural network tgnn which was incorporated with weak form pde constraints and used to infer the inverse solution of a gaussian hydraulic conductivity field with known spatial covariance information wang et al 2021a pinn has also been applied to inverse problems in unsaturated groundwater flow depina et al 2022 compared with gradient based ga pinn transformed the inverse problem into a predictive task and solved it directly by a continuous function on mesh coordinates bottou and bousquet 2008 zhu et al 2019 the required gradients whether in the variable space or the model coefficient space were evaluated using ad which was mesh free and much faster than implementing groundwater flow simulation to determine the jacobian matrix yang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 yang and perdikaris 2019 although pinn theoretically has the potential to deal with large scale inverse problems due to its pointwise computation and mesh free property it has not been tested for estimating high resolution parameter fields for example in the above mentioned groundwater application literature the number of hydraulic conductivity to be estimated is on the order of 103 104 for pinn while ga has been successfully applied to estimate high resolution hydraulic conductivity fields with millions of unknowns lee and kitanidis 2014 zhao and luo 2020 tartakovsky et al 2020 investigated the effect of the number of collocation points with pde regularization and demonstrated that approximately 10 of the total grid can provide inverse results comparable to the full grid however their problem dimension is only 1 024 i e a 32 32 field for a high resolution field with millions of unknowns 10 of the total collocation points for pde regularization are computationally unaffordable in this study we develop a hydraulic tomography pinn ht pinn to jointly solve forward and inverse problems for two dimensional large scale hydraulic tomography to the best of our knowledge this is the first pinn for groundwater inverse problems involving pumping tests especially multiple pumping tests we extend the application of pinn by incorporating the batch training technique to solve large scale inverse problems for estimating high resolution parameter fields with over millions of unknowns unlike traditional batch training techniques that divide big data into subsets we divide collocation points with pde regularization into subsets while keeping all measurement data as one batch to train the network sequentially we investigate the collocation point batch training for the developed ht pinn to demonstrate high computational efficiency based on pointwise computation and mesh free property furthermore we compare the performance of ht pinn with ga for estimating parameter fields at different resolutions and discuss the measurement data required for the developed ht pinn 2 models and method 2 1 groundwater flow with pumping the general governing equation for groundwater flow in saturated porous media with source sink terms is given by 1 s s h t q q where s s is specific storage t is time h is hydraulic head q is the water accumulation reduction rate in the selected control volume and q is specific discharge vector for simplicity we consider hydraulic tomography in a confined isotropic heterogeneous aquifer in a 2d spatial domain ω in a time window 0 t thus at a location or grid x e y e in the domain with no source sink q 0 the specific governing pde becomes 2 s s h x e y e t e t t x e y e h x e y e t e 0 x e y e ω t e 0 t where t is isotropic heterogeneous hydraulic transmissivity at the initial condition ic t 0 we have background hydraulic heads 3 h x init y init 0 h

the unit vector normal to neumann bc if water is extracted from a pumping well located in a specific grid x p y p at a constant flow rate q p the governing equation for this grid is 6 s s h x p y p t p t t x p y p h x p y p t p q p x p y p ω t p 0 t eqs 2 6 complete a pde system for groundwater flow in a pumping test if t x y is fully characterized h x y t can be solved with numerical solvers for given initial and boundary conditions and pumping schedules this is known as a forward problem reversely estimating spatially variable t x y with measurements of h x y t at specific monitoring locations and time and limited local measurements of hydraulic transmissivity is an inverse problem which is the focus of the present study in hydraulic tomography multiple sets of h x y t can be collected by conducting pumping tests sequentially at different pumping wells 2 2 pinn forward model to construct a pinn forward model n n x y t for hydraulic responses h x y t in a pumping test the loss function is composed of residuals from data matching ic constraint bc constraints and pde constraints these residuals should be evaluated at separate time steps in the time window 0 t except for the residual of ic constraint which is determined at t 0 the pde constraint residual is the left hand side of eq 2 7 f nn t x y t s s n n x y t t t x y n n x y t where f nn t means that residual is evaluated with nn x y t and t x y the partial derivatives and gradients on the right hand side are approximated by ad the residuals are evaluated for two types of grids pumping and non pumping grids for a non pumping grid x e y e i e no pumping well is located in the grid using mean squared error mse as a metric the pde loss los s e is expressed as 8 los s e 1 n e j 1 n e f nn t x e j y e j t e j 2 for simplicity the total number of non pumping grids n e may be the total grid number if no pumping is applied in the domain however n e can be selected and does not necessarily depend on the domain resolution for a pumping grid x p y p the pumping pde loss los s p in mse is given by 9 los s p 1 n p j 1 n p f nn t x p j y p j t p j q p 2 in a pumping test if water is drawn from a single well located in a grid n p 1 and x p y p are the coordinates of the grid where the pumping well is located the ic constraint from eq 3 is applied to ic grids x init y init which can be anywhere in the spatial domain the resulted mse loss los s init is expressed as 10 los s init 1 n init j 1 n init n n x init y init 0 h x init y init 0 2 bc constraint residuals are evaluated for two types of domain boundary grids neumann and dirichlet boundary grids described by eqs 4 and 5 respectively for neumann bc grids x n y n the mse loss los s n evaluation requires the partial derivatives on n n x y t 11 los s n 1 n n j 1 n n n n n x n y n t n q n 2 the partial derivatives should be determined across the boundary for example for a rectangular domain if neumann bc is on the left or right boundary then n n n x n y n t n n n x n y n x n and n n n x n y n t n n n x n y n t n y n is used for the top or bottom boundary the partial derivatives in eq 11 are approximated by ad for dirichlet bc grids x d y d the mse loss los s d is 12 los s d 1 n d j 1 n d n n x d j y d j t d j h x d j y d j t d j 2 the numbers of grids n n and n d and the spatial coordinates x n y n x d y d of neumann and dirichlet bc grids depend on the domain resolution and boundary setup data matching residuals are evaluated for grids with monitoring wells and hydraulic head measurements for monitoring grids x m y m and measured hydraulic heads h x m y m t m the mse loss los s m has the same form as los s d 13 los s m 1 n m j 1 n m n n x m j y m j t m j h x m j y m j t m j 2 n m is the number of measurements and x m y m are the coordinates of monitoring wells the total loss of the forward problem los s fp is the sum of the weighted loss terms 14 los s fp λ m l o s s m λ e l o s s e λ n l o s s n λ d l o s s d λ p l o s s p λ init l o s s init the weights of the loss terms λ m λ e λ p λ n λ d are hyperparameters it should be noted that in different pumping tests the coordinates of the pumping well x p y p are different and the coordinates of other types of grids other than the domain boundary have also changed consequently different n n x y t need to be trained as forward models corresponding to different pumping wells therefore to simulate a hydraulic tomography consisting of n sequential pumping tests at different locations n pinn forward models n n i x y t i 1 2 n are needed to serve in ensemble as the surrogate model and the total loss function is the sum of eq 18 for all individual pumping tests 2 3 pinn inverse model to estimate the hydraulic transmissivity field t x y we develop an inverse pinn model t n n x y its data matching loss los s t is given by 15 los s t 1 n t j 1 n t t n n x t j y t j t x t j y t j 2 where x t y t are the coordinates of the grids with direct measurements of hydraulic transmissivity and n t is the number these measurements are directly used to constrain the hydraulic transmissivity distribution and no more information or assumptions such as spatial covariance are needed the bc and ic constraints do not apply to t n n x y but the pde constraints are involved substituting t x y in eq 11 with t n n x y the pde residual function of the pumping test i is expressed as f n n i t n n x y t s s n n i x y t t 16 t n n x y n n i x y t i 1 2 n this updated residual function is used in eqs 8 and 9 to evaluate the pde constraint loss for pumping and non pumping grids the total loss of the inverse problem los s ip is given by 17 los s ip i 1 2 n l o s s fp i λ t l o s s t where λ t is the weight of data matching loss on direct measurements los s fp i is the forward problem loss corresponding to the pumping test i where a specific pinn surrogate forward model n n i x y t is trained to approximate its water heads all time steps and pumping tests in hydraulic tomography analysis provide equivalent inferences for the inversion leading to the same weight in the loss function although eq 17 is labeled as the inverse problem loss it is the combined loss of the inverse problem and all forward pumping tests to minimize this loss we train all networks simultaneously even though it looks more complicated however since model coefficients in n n i x y t and tnn x y are randomly initialized their predictions at the beginning are usually far from the reference field training one network with meaningless predictions from other networks probably misguides the optimizing direction which makes it harder to achieve co convergence when the inverse problem loss is minimized ht pinn can provide an inverse network for estimating hydraulic transmissivity as well as an ensemble surrogate forward model for approximating hydraulic heads under different pumping tests fig 1 shows the flowchart and structure of ht pinn including all the loss functions presented above 2 4 batch training of collocation points we design batch or mini batch training for the developed ht pinn inverse model to solve large scale inverse problems for estimating high resolution hydraulic conductivity fields up to millions of unknowns batch training has been commonly used to prevent dnn from overfitting and shorten the training time for big data problems jacob et al 2022 however in groundwater inverse problems measurements including both direct and indirect measurements are not large the primary problem is the high resolution parameter field to be estimated which corresponds to computationally expensive forward model simulations for pinn applications to estimate a high resolution hydraulic conductivity or permeability field with up to millions of unknowns it is impossible to include the pde constraints at all grids even a small fraction such as 10 is computationally expensive thus instead of collocating all grids in one batch we use a series of mini batches containing sampled non pumping grids three hyperparameters need to be determined batch size number of batches and sampling method a large batch size may lead to global optima at the cost of slow convergence ioffe and szegedy 2015 li et al 2021 masters and luschi 2018 wilson and martinez 2003 on the other hand using mini batches may have fast convergence but may not be guaranteed to converge to the global optima here we use three methods for generating batches 1 random and non recurrent generate a new batch at each iteration through random sampling from non pumping grids 2 random and recurrent generate a certain number of batches by randomly sampling before training and use these batches repeatedly in subsequent training iterations 3 uniform recurrent uniformly sample non pumping grids to generate a certain number of batches and use these batches repeatedly in subsequent training mccandlish et al 2018 3 numerical experiments 3 1 high dimensional ht base experiment a two dimensional base experiment of ht is implemented in a large scale high resolution 1024 1024 transmissivity field the experimental lnt field is generated with a gaussian spatial covariance function the generation method implements pca decomposition on the covariance matrix 50 top ranked principal components are retained as the projection matrix and normally distributed random variables are generated as projections which retains over 90 of the total variance fig 2 b the field is scaled to a unit square domain so that the spatial coordinates are dimensionless x 0 1 y 0 1 the top and bottom boundaries are impermeable neumann boundary and left and right boundaries are constant head dirichlet boundary initially hydraulic head on the field is 0 m the geostatistical and hydrogeological parameters are listed in table 1 the geostatistical parameters for the gaussian covariance model are similar to previous pinn applications tartakovsky et al 2020 the well network for the ht survey consists of 25 wells numbered from p1 to p25 evenly distributed in the central area of the domain fig 2a pumping events are performed sequentially in 5 pumping wells located at the center p13 and corners p1 p5 p21 and p25 for each pumping test event water is withdrawn at a constant rate from one of the 5 pumping wells and hydraulic heads are observed from the other 24 monitoring wells as indirect measurements for transient data hydraulic heads are evenly observed 10 times within 1 h the time interval between two consecutive observations is 0 1 h time input can also be seen as dimensionless given that the scaler is 1 h for steady state data hydraulic heads are only observed once at the steady state phase random noises with a variation of 5 from the true value are added to corrupt both these indirect measurements and direct measurements of transmissivities values of direct and indirect measurements are normalized through dividing by l2 norm before being used by ht pinn as reference data 3 2 ht pinn implementation for the steady state ht experiment described above the developed ht pinn contains 5 forward neural networks n n i x y t i 1 5 13 21 25 corresponding to different pumping well and 1 inverse network tnn x y all networks have 6 fully connected layers with tanh activation functions each containing 50 hidden units the sample grids for evaluating los s n i and los s d i are uniformly distributed on neumann top bottom and dirichlet left right boundaries with n d and n n 128 according to the pumping schedule the well grids are separated as samples for los s p i and los s m i with n p 1 and n m 24 direct measurements of transmissivity are uniformly distributed in the domain with n t 61 fig 2 b in the developed ht pinn a relax region is defined as a square area 30 m 30 m centered on the pumping well xu et al 2021a discussed that the solution in a pumping test always has control volumes near the pumping point source sink with significantly larger pde residuals than the outer region thus the loss function may be dominated by the collocation points in this region setting the relax region is a tradeoff between the pde regularization and the solution smoothness outside the relax region is the pde regularization region where the grid is strictly governed by eq 2 i e the non pumping grid we implement the random and recurrent batching method i e the method 2 discussed in the previous section to train the ht pinn we generate 10 batches each containing 900 randomly sampled non pumping collocation points with pde constraints for each pumping test these collocation point batches are recurrently used to evaluate los s e with n e 900 at each iteration in total we include 9 000 pde constrained collocation points for each pumping test and 45 000 collocation points for all the five pumping tests for the transient ht experiment we have 10 determined time steps t 0 1 0 2 1 0 at each time step the data composition mainly refers to the steady state experiment except for the pde batch size which is reduced to 300 n e 300 aggregately the number of collocation points in one transient pumping test with 10 time steps will be 30 000 and in the whole experiment will be 150 000 with consideration of unique ic constraints we add monitoring wells as sample grids for evaluating los s init i causing n init 24 in both types of experiments neural networks are trained with adam optimizer on the google colab platform training is counted by epoch each containing 100 iterations for the transient experiment in each iteration a specific pde batch measurements of hydraulic heads and transmissivities neumann and dirichlet boundary grids ic grids and the pumping grid are fed to backpropagation so one epoch can cover data batches at every time step ht pinn is trained for 3000 epochs and the learning rate decays from 1 10 3 to 1 10 4 after 1000 epochs the weights of each loss term are λ m 10 4 λ f 50 λ p 1 λ n 10 4 λ d 2 10 4 λ t 10 3 λ init 10 4 these weights are determined to keep each loss term at a similar magnitude to balance their contributions to the total loss kingma and ba 2017 in a steady state ht experiment each epoch only contains 10 iterations to cover the data batches and only 2000 epochs are needed to achieve comparative convergence with the learning rate decaying from 1 10 3 to 1 10 4 after 1000 epochs the weight of λ init is not considered due to the removal of loss init and weights of other loss terms are unchanged 3 3 quantitative measures for the forward model surrogate the prediction error is quantified by the forward relative residual metric which is formulated as 18 n n i n n i x y t h i x y t 2 2 h i x y t 2 2 x y ω t 0 t where h i x y t and n n i x y t represent the true and approximated hydraulic heads in vector form respectively similarly the inverse relative residual t is evaluated by 19 t t n n x y t x y 2 2 t x y 2 2 x y ω where t x y and t n n x y are the true and estimated transmissivity vectors moreover the inverse result is accessed by map accuracy map accuracy refers to what percentage of the grid has transmissivity correctly inverted kang et al 2017 the condition for correct inversion is that pointwise estimation error ε x y is less than a predefined threshold set to 10 in this study 20 ε x y t n n x y t x y t max t min x y ω 4 results of numerical experiments 4 1 transient base experiment 4 1 1 forward model of transient problem evaluation fig 3 shows the performance of the forward model in the transient experiment fig 3a shows the true first row and approximated second row hydraulic heads at time steps from 0 1 to 1 h in a pumping test with the pumping well located at the left bottom corner p1 of the well network the approximated heads are from nn 1 x y t prediction and the true hydraulic heads are solved from a numerical solver the color map and contour lines show that the n n 1 model prediction agrees with the numerical simulation result at every time step specifically at 0 and 1 the nn 1 model reproduces the hydraulic heads of 0 defined by dirichlet bc and at y 0 the contour lines are perpendicular to the boundaries defined by the impermeable neumann bc fig 3b plots the indirect measurements collected from monitoring wells and model prediction at monitoring wells on the time axis in the plot each color indicates a specific monitoring well stars note indirect measurements and solid lines note prediction from nn 1 it shows that nn 1 well learns the temporal trends implied by those indirect measurements and initial conditions at t 0 predicted hydraulic heads are 0 as a result of initial condition constraints then they start dropping down until t 0 7 after that hydraulic heads become unchanged and stay at a steady state fig 3c shows a scattered plot of the whole indirect measurements in all five pumping tests and relative predicted hydraulic heads the r 2 coefficient of determination is greater than 0 99 the relative residuals of n n t i for i 1 5 13 21 25 are 6 14 6 26 6 23 6 58 6 53 all five nn models produce a satisfactory prediction of hydraulic heads and are collectively supported as surrogate models for inversion 4 1 2 inverse model under transient problem evaluation fig 4 shows the inverse modeling results of tnn in the transient experiment by comparing fig 4a and b the estimated transmissivity field from tnn well describes the main distribution pattern of the true field fig 4c shows the scatterplot of true and estimated transmissivities for the entire field with over a million values r 2 coefficient is greater than 0 92 the relative residual tnn is 10 32 and the map accuracy is 94 93 in this study the number of known hydraulic transmissivity data is only about 0 006 of the number of parameters to be estimated which is far less than the number in previous studies tartakovsky et al 2020 but the estimation is sufficiently accurate the total running time of this experiment is about 34 260 s 4 2 steady state base experiment 4 2 1 forward model of steady state problem evaluation fig 5 shows the performance of the steady state forward model fig 5a shows the numerically solved true steady state hydraulic heads in the pumping test p21 whose location is at the right bottom corner of the well network fig 5b shows the approximated steady state hydraulic heads from the corresponding forward model nn 21 x y the map can be regarded as a stagnant moment in the later phase of a pumping test and a comparison of them shows that the nn 21 model is in good agreement with the numerical simulation result and follows the defined dirichlet bc and impermeable neumann bc explicitly as the model in the transient experiment one more detail is the perpendicularity of the contour line at y 1 which is not shown in fig 3a fig 5c shows the scattered plot of the true and predicted steady state hydraulic heads in all five pumping tests the r 2 is greater than 0 99 the relative residuals n n i for i 1 5 13 21 25 are 6 00 9 37 6 57 7 13 8 40 the steady state forward model performs equivalently well as the transient model 4 2 2 inverse model under steady state problem evaluation fig 6 shows the inverse modeling results of steady state tnn fig 6a shows the true lnt field fig 6b shows tnn estimation which presents the main pattern of the true field fig 6c shows the scatterplot of true and estimated transmissivities on the whole field r 2 coefficient is nearly 0 95 the relative residual tn n t is 9 09 and the map accuracy is 96 85 this performance is even better than that in the transient experiment more attractively the total running time of this experiment is only 2769 s which is much faster than the transient experiment and computationally efficient for such a large scale inverse problem for simplicity in the following sections ht pinn in steady state experiments is used for further discussion 4 3 uncertainty quantification there are mainly two uncertainty sources for implementing the ht pinn initial guesses of model coefficients and randomly selected batches the implementation is repeated by 50 times with different initial guesses and batch generation to analyze the model uncertainty fig 7 a shows the uncertainty of the evaluation metrics inverse map accuracy inverse residual and forward residual the mean and standard deviation of each metric are presented as dot and error bars for map accuracy the mean and standard deviation are 95 82 and 1 73 respectively for inverse relative residual the mean and standard deviation are 9 84 and 0 78 respectively overall with a relatively small standard deviation ht pinn performs consistently well in all repeats thus it can be concluded that the initial guess of the network coefficients and the random generation of batches have a limited effect on the model performance this implies that the developed ht pinn has a robust structure and contains enough coefficients which make it very likely to converge to a global minimum in addition ht pinn is also robust to error noise added to the direct transmissivity and indirect hydraulic heads measurements the pde constraints enhance the smoothness of model estimation and robustness which can overcome the influences of added data noises fig 7b shows the variance map of the best estimate the variance is quite uniformly distributed with peak zones slightly larger than the rest of the map the uniform variance is mainly due to the constraints from the direct and indirect measurements distributed over the domain 5 effect of batching training strategy a specific batch training method is used for the steady state model presented above that is among all the collocation grids with pde constraints greater than1 million 10 batches are randomly generated with 900 points per batch for each pumping test and recurrently use them for training the ht pinn to investigate the impact of batch size the number of batches and batch generation method the same transmissivity field and ht data of the base experiment are used and the number of epochs and learning rate are kept the same for the model training table 2 summarizes all the experiments and results 5 1 effect of batch sampling method to compare the three batch generation methods listed in table 2 we choose the same batch number n b 10 and batch size m b 100 300 600 the second method of random sampling and non recurrent batches can be regarded as an extreme case in which a new batch is generated for each iteration and the batch number is equal to the number of training iterations thus the total collocation points used in the non recurrent method are much larger than the recurrent methods considering that 15 000 iterations and 5 pumping tests are used in this test the total size of the collocation points used is actually many times the total grid number thus many collocation points are resampled in the iterative process the method of uniform sampling is designed to cover the entire domain except for the relax region the map accuracy of the inversion results of different batch generation methods is very close all around 95 which implies that the impact of different batch generation methods on the inverse estimation accuracy is insignificant for all batch sizes the training time of the non recurrent method is consistently slightly longer than the other two recurrent methods this is because of the resampling at each iteration and the convergence time for new samples in addition all methods exhibit an approximately linear increase in training time with increasing batch size as shown in fig 8 a 5 2 effect of batch size we then choose to use the method with recurrent random samples to study the effect of batch number and size with constant batch number n b 10 the batch size m b is set from 0 to 1200 used in ht pinn to evaluate non pumping pde loss los s e i we repeat such tests ten times each time generating new batches and reinitializing the network for uncertainty quantification fig 8b shows the mean and standard deviation for accuracy and training time results are also summarized in table 2 along with the inverse relative residuals we should notice that when m b 0 the training data does not contain any non pumping grids and los s e i is not evaluated that is the pde constraint has no role in the total loss therefore the ht pinn is relegated to a dnn that only learns inversion from data fitting the mean accuracy and relative residual of the dnn are hardly as satisfactory as the developed ht pinn additionally the associated inversion uncertainty is much larger for the dnn suggesting that the dnn is significantly affected by the initialization of network coefficients the training time of ht pinn is longer than dnn because it uses ad to evaluate the partial derivatives in pde loss terms and takes longer to converge the results show that the dnn is not as good as the ht pinn in providing robust predictions given the small number of direct measurements in our experiment or that the dnn may require much larger data to achieve the accuracy of ht pinn with physical constraints lecun et al 2015 staring from m b 100 the ht pinn gains high accuracy and small uncertainty it illustrates that ht pinn behaves more robustly to sparse data at the batch size m b 100 a total of 5000 pde grids are collocated which is about 0 48 of the total grids in the domain since random sampling and pde regions do not prohibit repetition there may be duplicate grids sampled and the actual grids with pde coverage may be lower however such a low coverage makes it possible to achieve a high level of mean accuracy and low uncertainty already and scaling up the batch size does not improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty fig 8b similar discussions can be found in other groundwater applications where only a single batch with different sizes is considered for example tartakovsky et al 2020 used one batch of 300 pde grids to invert a groundwater flow field with a resolution of 32 32 without pumping its coverage is about 30 in another groundwater flow and transport application he et al 2020 used a batch of only 200 pde grids to invert a field with a resolution of 256 128 the coverage is about 0 61 xu et al 2021a used 5000 pde grids to train a pumping test forward model surrogate in a field with a resolution of 51 51 we should note that neither absolute numbers nor coverage can provide us with a constant collocation size threshold as the results depend on the specific forward pde problem field resolutions and underlying parameter field smoothness the uncertainty in all cases standard deviation around 1 5 is small indicating that the network initialization and random sampling have little effect on the inverse estimation in contrast training time increases with the number of total pde collocation grids fig 8b thus we can choose fewer pde grids since no manifest improvement is seen after m b 100 hoffer et al 2018 nitish et al 2017 5 3 effect of batch number to examine the effect of batch number we control for the total number of collocated pde grids and investigate whether training with a small number of large batches or a large number of small batches is superior the total number of collocated grids for a forward problem is set to 2000 6000 and 12 000 for n b 20 batches with m b 100 300 and 600 respectively considering the ht pinn performance is quite stable with a small uncertainty we do not repeat the test and only compare with the average performance of n b 10 and m b 200 600 900 fig 8c shows the comparison and table 2 lists the specific numbers there is no significant difference in inversion accuracy within each pair with the largest difference being around 1 however training the model with 20 small batches takes longer for the same number of epochs it may be because training with more batches needs to execute more switching batches in extreme cases when the batch size is too large the model performance suffers severely we generate one batch with 3000 and 9000 grids n b 1 and m b 3000 9000 the model is trained for 6000 epochs using a single batch with the learning rate decreased from 1 10 3 to 1 10 4 the training time is orders of magnitude longer than n b 10 and m b 300 900 but the inverse accuracy is unmatched due to the high dimensional inverse problem caused by large batches that is harder to converge in the supplementary material fig s1 we also present a small scale 64 64 field and use all the grids in a single batch to train the model the training time is also orders of magnitude longer than the high resolution base experiment presented above 6 data demands for ht pinn in this section we investigate the performance of ht pinn on different data volumes of indirect and direct measurements we choose the random and recurrent method for batch generation with a batch number of 10 and a batch size of 100 the number and distribution of direct and indirect measurements are provided in different scenarios all data is corrupted with 5 noise 6 1 effect of indirect measurements for the indirect measurement of hydraulic heads two pumping scenarios are considered one scenario is the same as the base steady state experiment with pumping tests performed at 5 wells i e p1 p5 p13 p21 and p25 and the other includes pumping tests at 9 uniformly located wells i e p1 p3 p5 p11 p13 p15 p21 p23 and p25 in the second scenario the number of forward networks and indirect measurements are 9 and 216 respectively the transmissivity field and direct measurements remain the same as the base experiment shown in fig 2b fig 9 shows the true transmissivity field and inverse estimates for both scenarios for the scenario with 5 pumping tests the map accuracy is 93 58 the inverse relative residual is 10 33 and the mean of five forward model relative residuals is 10 17 in contrast the inversion performance of the 9 pumping test scenario is slightly better with a map accuracy of 96 40 an inverse relative residual of 9 73 and an average of the nine forward model relative residuals of 8 83 this is because more indirect measurements and pde constraints help improve inversion accuracy correspondingly the computation cost increases with the number of pumping tests in this experiment the training time is about 80 and 154 s per 100 epochs for 5 and 9 pumping tests respectively the training time increases approximately linearly with the number of pumping tests thus using more pumping tests may not always be the optimal plan for training ht pinn given the increased computational and experimental cost and slight enhancement in performance fig 10 6 2 effect of direct measurements as discussed by tartakovsky et al 2020 the requirement for direct measurements of local transmissivity is related to the spatial distribution characteristics of the field in the base experiment 61 direct measurements of transmissivity are used to constrain the parameter field which is significantly lower than previous research tartakovsky et al 2020 to investigate the effect of direct measurements we change the structural parameters to generate random fields with different variance and correlation length and invert them by feeding ht pinn a different number of direct measurements table 3 lists the structural parameters used to generate two random fields both fields have a resolution of 1024 1024 compared with the base experiment field a has a shorter correlation length and a smaller scale of peak to valley regionalization in contrast field b has the same correlation length as the base experiment but with much greater variance representing a highly heterogeneous field we consider three cases with the number of measurements n k 61 85 and 113 corresponding to 0 006 0 008 and 0 011 of the parameters to be estimated respectively and the locations are uniformly distributed ht pinn uses five pumping tests the same as the base experiment and the batch generation uses the random and recurrent sampling method with a batch number of 10 and a batch size of 100 due to the large value range of field b we modify the network structure by adding an exponential activation function to the output layer the gradient propagating from the exponential activation function decays faster therefore we train the networks with more epochs and higher learning rates to minimize the loss function we set the learning rate to 1 10 3 for the first 2000 epochs and 1 10 4 for the other 1000 epochs in fig 8 a2 the ht pinn trained with 61 measurements can locate large patterns in the peak and valley region but loses many details in contrast fig 8 a3 and a4 show that as the number of measurements increases to 85 and 113 ht pinn gradually solves this problem and provides a better description of the distribution details this is also illustrated by the map accuracy and inverse estimate relative residuals summarized in table 3 the relative residuals of forward models are comparable for all three cases indicating that the fitting to the indirect measurements of hydraulic heads are similar because they are all underdetermined inverse problems compared with the base experiment where 61 direct measurements provide high inversion map accuracy it is advantageous to have more direct measurements to estimate transmissivity fields with shorter correlation lengths fig 8 b2 b4 show the estimation of the highly heterogeneous field field b when 113 direct measurements are used as the training data ht pinn can provide a much smoother estimation with a higher inverse accuracy in addition table 3 shows that the relative residuals of both inverse estimates and forward models are much larger than the base experiment and all the experiments presented above this is because in highly heterogeneous transmissivity fields where both direct and indirect measurements differ by orders of magnitude optimizing the loss contribution is more challenging when assimilating these different types of data together compared to the effect of indirect measurements we can see that the addition of direct measurements can improve the inversion especially in highly heterogeneous fields and fields with short correlation lengths furthermore in the supplementary material fig s3 we also show that our base experiment results are better than kriging results of the direct measurements based on the corrupted data in the base experiment and true covariance function 7 model scalability for field resolution we compare the performance of the developed ht pinn with batch training techniques and a recently developed reformulated geostatistical approach rga to inversely estimate fields with resolutions ranging from coarse 64 64 to fine 1024 1024 except for resolution other field characteristics including spatial covariance and domain bcs and the pumping test strategy are the same as the base experiment for ht pinn direct measurements of transmissivity are collected at fixed spatial coordinates in the domain regardless of the field resolution the method of random and recurrent sampling is used to generate 10 batches of 100 grids with pde constraints in each forward model rga is a gradient based optimization approach as a dimensionality reduction method rga projects spatially correlated transmissivity on dominant principal components of its covariance matrix and directly estimates these projections hence the number of forward model runs and normal equations to be solved is reduced to the number of retained principal components which is usually much smaller than the field dimension in this experiment we use the correct covariance model to calculate the principal components this condition is not necessary because biased spatial covariance can be iteratively corrected zhao and luo 2021a the first 100 principal components are retained which means that there are 100 unknown projections to be estimated the rga forward model for simulating hydraulic tomography is a numerical finite element solver that is also used to generate the reference data of hydraulic heads for both ht pinn and rga computation is implemented on a desktop computer with an intel core i7 7700 cpu at 3 60 ghz and 16 0 gb ram table 4 summarizes the map accuracy the inverse relative residuals and running time for each model fig 11 shows the inverse results of ht pinn and rga for each resolution fig 12 directly compares the map accuracy and running time of the two methods both methods produce high quality inversions with over 90 accuracy at all resolutions for ht pinn the map accuracy slightly decreases from the coarse resolution 64 64 to the fine resolution 1024 1024 this is mainly because we use constant batch numbers and sizes for all resolutions therefore for coarse resolution the collocation points may cover almost the entire grid while for fine resolution they are only sparsely distributed the accuracy can be further improved with more epochs however this also depends on the random field generated as the same sampling method yields over 95 accuracy in the high resolution base experiment see table 2 the model scalability is reflected by both the data requirements and trends of the running time for the iterative method of rga the running time per iteration increases with the field resolution and the number of iterations also increases this is due to the increased computational cost of forward model simulations required to determine the jacobian matrix and associated matrix computation for ht pinn with batch training techniques the running time remains almost the same for all resolutions this is because the mesh free nature of ht pinn makes the running time only depend on the batch size and number rather than the field resolution which is more advantageous for fine resolution inversion in terms of total running time ht pinn with batch training surpasses rga after fields finer than 512 512 in fact according to zhao et al 2022 rga can be implemented with upscaled principal components i e upcia which has already achieved constant runtime for estimating fields with different resolutions the total runtime of upcia depends on upscaling factors for example the principal components of dimension 1024 1024 can be upscaled to 16 16 so that a 1024 1024 field can be inverted faster than all the cases above even though the developed ht pinn may not be better than upcia on computation efficiency it still shows broad applicability and robustness to various resolutions considering that the network structure of ht pinn and the batch generation method remain unchanged at all resolutions we have also successfully applied the developed ht pinn to groundwater flow inverse problems without pumping which have been the main cases discussed in the literature fig s2 in the supplementary material 8 conclusion the developed ht pinn involves a neural network model for transmissivity and a series of neural network models to describe steady state and transient sequential pumping tests it jointly trains all neural network models by minimizing the total loss function including data fitting errors and pde constraints new advances and findings include 1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first pinn application to invert the transmissivity field with pumping test data especially multiple pumping tests considering that the pumping test is one of the main field tests for aquifer characterization the development of ht pinn is necessary and important especially for extending pinn to field applications 2 we incorporate batch training technique into ht pinn to accurately and efficiently invert the high dimensional transmissivity field with over a million unknowns 1024 1024 resolution a significant advance over the literature the data requirements are suitable and the number of direct measurements is only 0 006 of the estimated parameters in the presented high dimensional field 3 we systematically study the effect of different batch training methods including batch generation methods batch number and size compared to batch number and size the batch generation method has a negligible impact on the inversion results and running time for the gaussian field used in our experiment a few batches 10 in our experiments consisting of hundreds of randomly sampled collocation grids can meet the minimum requirement of pde constraints and yield satisfactory inversion results the batch training technique is more efficient than a single batch with the same total collocation grids 4 the data requirements for indirect and direct measurements are studied for random fields with different structural parameters in our experiment 5 pumping test hydraulic tomography can provide sufficient indirect measurements of the hydraulic head for high accuracy inversion performing more pumping tests may only slightly enhance the inversion in contrast increasing direct measurements of transmissivity can greatly improve the inversion as direct measurements are often limited and expensive in the field especially for highly heterogeneous fields and fields with short correlation lengths 5 compared with the gradient based rga the developed ht pinn exhibits great scalability in inverting fields with different resolutions due to its mesh free nature in specific the computational cost of ht pinn remains almost unchanged while maintaining high inversion accuracy for high resolution fields conversely the computational cost of rga increases significantly with increasing field resolution due to forward model simulations required to determine the jacobian matrix furthermore data requirements for ht pinn do not increase with problem dimensionality this shows that the developed ht pinn with batch training technique is particularly effective for large scale inverse modeling of high resolution fields in addition the performance of ht pinn shows higher inversion accuracy compared to dnn with no physics information i e pde constraints included in the loss function it demonstrates that pinn is more capable than dnn in solving inverse problems with sparse data particularly for problems with well known forward models huang et al 2022 wang et al 2021b xu et al 2021b although the effectiveness of the developed ht pinn with batch training technique has been improved to be efficient for inverting high dimensional fields presented there is still a long way to go before we can claim that ht pinn is superior to other inverse methods a serious issue is that the developed ht pinn relies on direct measurements to constrain the smoothness of model predictions and the dependence becomes stronger when the geostatistical pattern is complex and variable bengio et al 2006 such as highly heterogeneous and short correlation length ga relies on the prior information of spatial covariance to regularize the underlying parameter field which also requires direct measurements to estimate but it is not necessary to have accurate prior structural parameters because biased spatial covariance can be iteratively corrected zhao and luo 2021a that is it may not be necessary to have many direct measurements to obtain an accurate estimation of the spatial covariance a feasible solution for ht pinn is to incorporate additional constraints such as spatial correlation and adapt it to inverse problems with fewer direct measurements however it is challenging to account for the uncertainty of spatial covariance another limitation is that most of the parameter fields used in the literature and this study are smooth either described by a gaussian covariance model or only by a few principal components i e dominant large scale distribution patterns of an exponential covariance model since there is no smoothness regularization in the developed ht pinn it has the potential to apply to parameter fields with complex distribution patterns such as non gaussian fields however it can be data hungry and requires much more collocation points to capture small scale and complex patterns of variation dong et al 2019 these all need to be addressed in the application of pinn for inverse modeling of large scale complex

2628,a hydraulic tomography physics informed neural network ht pinn is developed for inverting two dimensional large scale spatially distributed transmissivity ht pinn involves a neural network model of transmissivity and a series of neural network models to describe transient or steady state sequential pumping tests all the neural network models are jointly trained by minimizing the total loss function including data fitting errors and pde constraints batch training of collocation points is used to amplify the advantage of the mesh free property of neural networks thereby limiting the number of collocation points per training iteration and reducing the total training time the developed ht pinn accurately and efficiently inverts two dimensional gaussian transmissivity fields with more than a million unknowns 1024 1024 resolution and the inversion map accuracy exceeds 95 the effects of batch sampling methods batch number and size and data requirements for direct and indirect measurements are systematically investigated in addition the developed ht pinn exhibits great scalability and structure robustness in inverting fields with different resolutions ranging from coarse 64 64 to fine 1024 1024 specifically data requirements do not increase with the problem dimensionality and the computational cost of ht pinn remains almost unchanged due to its mesh free nature while

transmissivity in the field is prohibitive leading to inverse problems of estimating these parameters through indirect measurements such as hydraulic heads or tracer concentrations hydraulic tomography ht also known as sequential pumping tests has demonstrated great potential for aquifer characterization with relatively low cost and simple data collection techniques yeh and liu 2000 by alternatively switching pumping and monitoring wells in a well network ht can provide larger and more informative data than a traditional single well pumping test the enhanced information density reduces the non uniqueness of potential inverse solutions for the unknown parameter field like hydraulic conductivities a common and effective approach to solving ht inverse problems is the gradient based geostatistical approach ga ga formulates the posterior distribution of target variables according to the likelihood of data matching and the prior for the smoothness regularization under the bayesian framework kitanidis 1995 the posteriori is maximized to obtain the best linear estimate and associated uncertainty the major challenge faced by ga is its applicability when the dimension of the target variable is large for estimating a high resolution parameter field the cost of computing and storing the associated full rank covariance matrix is very high especially when using gradient based methods such as newton s method to evaluate the jacobian matrix at each iteration ambikasaran et al 2013 klein et al 2017 liu and kitanidis 2011 liu et al 2013 obiefuna and eslamian 2019 many efforts have been made to optimize ga for large scale inverse problems from two aspects dimensionality reduction and efficient numerical methods dimensionality reduction encodes the original high dimensional parameter field as low dimensional random parameters and reformulates the computations on the original field to the random parameters so that the computations are more concise and efficient for example gaussian random fields can be encoded through combinations of independent projective vectors and identified with about tens of independent and identically distributed random variables the combinations of independent projective vectors which is usually referred as projection matrix can be obtained by principal component analysis pca kitanidis and lee 2014 lee and kitanidis 2014 lee et al 2016 zhao and luo 2020 zhao and luo 2021a for more complicated non gaussian fields machine learning or deep learning methods can be used for dimensionality reduction chen et al 2022 chen et al 2021 laloy et al 2018 laloy et al 2017 pang et al 2020 efficiency of numerical methods can be improved through accelerating the process of solving the linear system related to forward problems such as using efficient embeddings on the covariance matrix upscaling the parameter fields or implementing quasi newton methods for approximating jacobian matrices broyden 1965 nowak and cirpka 2004 nowak et al 2003 saibaba et al 2012 zhao et al 2022 zhao and luo 2021b in the present research we aim to explore a new method physics informed neural network pinn for solving high dimensional ht inverse problems pinn has demonstrated good potential in inverse modeling due to its pointwise computation and mesh free property pinn is a deep neural network dnn in structure but unlike dnn which only contains the loss function of the residuals of data matching pinn integrates additional constraints from prior physics information in the loss function to overcome the inability of traditional dnns for absorbing prior physics knowledge raissi et al 2017a raissi et al 2017b raissi et al 2017c raissi et al 2017d these constraints are mathematically expressed in partial differential equations pdes and derivative values approximated by automatic differentiation ad griewank 2003 after optimizing such a loss function pinn can make effective predictions in accordance with the governing pdes in addition to the observed data jagtap et al 2020 karniadakis 2019 kharazmi et al 2021 raissi and karniadakis 2018 for groundwater inverse problems tartakovsky et al 2020 used two pinns to jointly solve the forward and inverse groundwater flow problems one was used as the forward model for approximating hydraulic heads and the other as the inverse model for estimating heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities the study was extended to groundwater transport problems by assimilating tracer concentration and hydraulic heads data together for inversing the hydraulic conductivity field he et al 2020 he and tartakovsky 2021 wang et al 2020 developed a theory guided neural network tgnn which was incorporated with weak form pde constraints and used to infer the inverse solution of a gaussian hydraulic conductivity field with known spatial covariance information wang et al 2021a pinn has also been applied to inverse problems in unsaturated groundwater flow depina et al 2022 compared with gradient based ga pinn transformed the inverse problem into a predictive task and solved it directly by a continuous function on mesh coordinates bottou and bousquet 2008 zhu et al 2019 the required gradients whether in the variable space or the model coefficient space were evaluated using ad which was mesh free and much faster than implementing groundwater flow simulation to determine the jacobian matrix yang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 yang and perdikaris 2019 although pinn theoretically has the potential to deal with large scale inverse problems due to its pointwise computation and mesh free property it has not been tested for estimating high resolution parameter fields for example in the above mentioned groundwater application literature the number of hydraulic conductivity to be estimated is on the order of 103 104 for pinn while ga has been successfully applied to estimate high resolution hydraulic conductivity fields with millions of unknowns lee and kitanidis 2014 zhao and luo 2020 tartakovsky et al 2020 investigated the effect of the number of collocation points with pde regularization and demonstrated that approximately 10 of the total grid can provide inverse results comparable to the full grid however their problem dimension is only 1 024 i e a 32 32 field for a high resolution field with millions of unknowns 10 of the total collocation points for pde regularization are computationally unaffordable in this study we develop a hydraulic tomography pinn ht pinn to jointly solve forward and inverse problems for two dimensional large scale hydraulic tomography to the best of our knowledge this is the first pinn for groundwater inverse problems involving pumping tests especially multiple pumping tests we extend the application of pinn by incorporating the batch training technique to solve large scale inverse problems for estimating high resolution parameter fields with over millions of unknowns unlike traditional batch training techniques that divide big data into subsets we divide collocation points with pde regularization into subsets while keeping all measurement data as one batch to train the network sequentially we investigate the collocation point batch training for the developed ht pinn to demonstrate high computational efficiency based on pointwise computation and mesh free property furthermore we compare the performance of ht pinn with ga for estimating parameter fields at different resolutions and discuss the measurement data required for the developed ht pinn 2 models and method 2 1 groundwater flow with pumping the general governing equation for groundwater flow in saturated porous media with source sink terms is given by 1 s s h t q q where s s is specific storage t is time h is hydraulic head q is the water accumulation reduction rate in the selected control volume and q is specific discharge vector for simplicity we consider hydraulic tomography in a confined isotropic heterogeneous aquifer in a 2d spatial domain ω in a time window 0 t thus at a location or grid x e y e in the domain with no source sink q 0 the specific governing pde becomes 2 s s h x e y e t e t t x e y e h x e y e t e 0 x e y e ω t e 0 t where t is isotropic heterogeneous hydraulic transmissivity at the initial condition ic t 0 we have background hydraulic heads 3 h x init y init 0 h init x init y init ω to satisfy neumann γ n and dirichlet γ d boundary conditions bcs of the domain we have 4 n h x n y n t n q n x n y n γ n t n 0 t 5 h x d y d t d h d x d y d γ d t d 0 t where n is the unit vector normal to neumann bc if water is extracted from a pumping well located in a specific grid x p y p at a constant flow rate q p the governing equation for this grid is 6 s s h x p y p t p t t x p y p h x p y p t p q p x p y p ω t p 0 t eqs 2 6 complete a pde system for groundwater flow in a pumping test if t x y is fully characterized h x y t can be solved with numerical solvers for given initial and boundary conditions and pumping schedules this is known as a forward problem reversely estimating spatially variable t x y with measurements of h x y t at specific monitoring locations and time and limited local measurements of hydraulic transmissivity is an inverse problem which is the focus of the present study in hydraulic tomography multiple sets of h x y t can be collected by conducting pumping tests sequentially at different pumping wells 2 2 pinn forward model to construct a pinn forward model n n x y t for hydraulic responses h x y t in a pumping test the loss function is composed of residuals from data matching ic constraint bc constraints and pde constraints these residuals should be evaluated at separate time steps in the time window 0 t except for the residual of ic constraint which is determined at t 0 the pde constraint residual is the left hand side of eq 2 7 f nn t x y t s s n n x y t t t x y n n x y t where f nn t means that residual is evaluated with nn x y t and t x y the partial derivatives and gradients on the right hand side are approximated by ad the residuals are evaluated for two types of grids pumping and non pumping grids for a non pumping grid x e y e i e no pumping well is located in the grid using mean squared error mse as a metric the pde loss los s e is expressed as 8 los s e 1 n e j 1 n e f nn t x e j y e j t e j 2 for simplicity the total number of non pumping grids n e may be the total grid number if no pumping is applied in the domain however n e can be selected and does not necessarily depend on the domain resolution for a pumping grid x p y p the pumping pde loss los s p in mse is given by 9 los s p 1 n p j 1 n p f nn t x p j y p j t p j q p 2 in a pumping test if water is drawn from a single well located in a grid n p 1 and x p y p are the coordinates of the grid where the pumping well is located the ic constraint from eq 3 is applied to ic grids x init y init which can be anywhere in the spatial domain the resulted mse loss los s init is expressed as 10 los s init 1 n init j 1 n init n n x init y init 0 h x init y init 0 2 bc constraint residuals are evaluated for two types of domain boundary grids neumann and dirichlet boundary grids described by eqs 4 and 5 respectively for neumann bc grids x n y n the mse loss los s n evaluation requires the partial derivatives on n n x y t 11 los s n 1 n n j 1 n n n n n x n y n t n q n 2 the partial derivatives should be determined across the boundary for example for a rectangular domain if neumann bc is on the left or right boundary then n n n x n y n t n n n x n y n x n and n n n x n y n t n n n x n y n t n y n is used for the top or bottom boundary the partial derivatives in eq 11 are approximated by ad for dirichlet bc grids x d y d the mse loss los s d is 12 los s d 1 n d j 1 n d n n x d j y d j t d j h x d j y d j t d j 2 the numbers of grids n n and n d and the spatial coordinates x n y n x d y d of neumann and dirichlet bc grids depend on the domain resolution and boundary setup data matching residuals are evaluated for grids with monitoring wells and hydraulic head measurements for monitoring grids x m y m and measured hydraulic heads h x m y m t m the mse loss los s m has the same form as los s d 13 los s m 1 n m j 1 n m n n x m j y m j t m j h x m j y m j t m j 2 n m is the number of measurements and x m y m are the coordinates of monitoring wells the total loss of the forward problem los s fp is the sum of the weighted loss terms 14 los s fp λ m l o s s m λ e l o s s e λ n l o s s n λ d l o s s d λ p l o s s p λ init l o s s init the weights of the loss terms λ m λ e λ p λ n λ d are hyperparameters it should be noted that in different pumping tests the coordinates of the pumping well x p y p are different and the coordinates of other types of grids other than the domain boundary have also changed consequently different n n x y t need to be trained as forward models corresponding to different pumping wells therefore to simulate a hydraulic tomography consisting of n sequential pumping tests at different locations n pinn forward models n n i x y t i 1 2 n are needed to serve in ensemble as the surrogate model and the total loss function is the sum of eq 18 for all individual pumping tests 2 3 pinn inverse model to estimate the hydraulic transmissivity field t x y we develop an inverse pinn model t n n x y its data matching loss los s t is given by 15 los s t 1 n t j 1 n t t n n x t j y t j t x t j y t j 2 where x t y t are the coordinates of the grids with direct measurements of hydraulic transmissivity and n t is the number these measurements are directly used to constrain the hydraulic transmissivity distribution and no more information or assumptions such as spatial covariance are needed the bc and ic constraints do not apply to t n n x y but the pde constraints are involved substituting t x y in eq 11 with t n n x y the pde residual function of the pumping test i is expressed as f n n i t n n x y t s s n n i x y t t 16 t n n x y n n i x y t i 1 2 n this updated residual function is used in eqs 8 and 9 to evaluate the pde constraint loss for pumping and non pumping grids the total loss of the inverse problem los s ip is given by 17 los s ip i 1 2 n l o s s fp i λ t l o s s t where λ t is the weight of data matching loss on direct measurements los s fp i is the forward problem loss corresponding to the pumping test i where a specific pinn surrogate forward model n n i x y t is trained to approximate its water heads all time steps and pumping tests in hydraulic tomography analysis provide equivalent inferences for the inversion leading to the same weight in the loss function although eq 17 is labeled as the inverse problem loss it is the combined loss of the inverse problem and all forward pumping tests to minimize this loss we train all networks simultaneously even though it looks more complicated however since model coefficients in n n i x y t and tnn x y are randomly initialized their predictions at the beginning are usually far from the reference field training one network with meaningless predictions from other networks probably misguides the optimizing direction which makes it harder to achieve co convergence when the inverse problem loss is minimized ht pinn can provide an inverse network for estimating hydraulic transmissivity as well as an ensemble surrogate forward model for approximating hydraulic heads under different pumping tests fig 1 shows the flowchart and structure of ht pinn including all the loss functions presented above 2 4 batch training of collocation points we design batch or mini batch training for the developed ht pinn inverse model to solve large scale inverse problems for estimating high resolution hydraulic conductivity fields up to millions of unknowns batch training has been commonly used to prevent dnn from overfitting and shorten the training time for big data problems jacob et al 2022 however in groundwater inverse problems measurements including both direct and indirect measurements are not large the primary problem is the high resolution parameter field to be estimated which corresponds to computationally expensive forward model simulations for pinn applications to estimate a high resolution hydraulic conductivity or permeability field with up to millions of unknowns it is impossible to include the pde constraints at all grids even a small fraction such as 10 is computationally expensive thus instead of collocating all grids in one batch we use a series of mini batches containing sampled non pumping grids three hyperparameters need to be determined batch size number of batches and sampling method a large batch size may lead to global optima at the cost of slow convergence ioffe and szegedy 2015 li et al 2021 masters and luschi 2018 wilson and martinez 2003 on the other hand using mini batches may have fast convergence but may not be guaranteed to converge to the global optima here we use three methods for generating batches 1 random and non recurrent generate a new batch at each iteration through random sampling from non pumping grids 2 random and recurrent generate a certain number of batches by randomly sampling before training and use these batches repeatedly in subsequent training iterations 3 uniform recurrent uniformly sample non pumping grids to generate a certain number of batches and use these batches repeatedly in subsequent training mccandlish et al 2018 3 numerical experiments 3 1 high dimensional ht base experiment a two dimensional base experiment of ht is implemented in a large scale high resolution 1024 1024 transmissivity field the experimental lnt field is generated with a gaussian spatial covariance function the generation method implements pca decomposition on the covariance matrix 50 top ranked principal components are retained as the projection matrix and normally distributed random variables are generated as projections which retains over 90 of the total variance fig 2 b the field is scaled to a unit square domain so that the spatial coordinates are dimensionless x 0 1 y 0 1 the top and bottom boundaries are impermeable neumann boundary and left and right boundaries are constant head dirichlet boundary initially hydraulic head on the field is 0 m the geostatistical and hydrogeological parameters are listed in table 1 the geostatistical parameters for the gaussian covariance model are similar to previous pinn applications tartakovsky et al 2020 the well network for the ht survey consists of 25 wells numbered from p1 to p25 evenly distributed in the central area of the domain fig 2a pumping events are performed sequentially in 5 pumping wells located at the center p13 and corners p1 p5 p21 and p25 for each pumping test event water is withdrawn at a constant rate from one of the 5 pumping wells and hydraulic heads are observed from the other 24 monitoring wells as indirect measurements for transient data hydraulic heads are evenly observed 10 times within 1 h the time interval between two consecutive observations is 0 1 h time input can also be seen as dimensionless given that the scaler is 1 h for steady state data hydraulic heads are only observed once at the steady state phase random noises with a variation of 5 from the true value are added to corrupt both these indirect measurements and direct measurements of transmissivities values of direct and indirect measurements are normalized through dividing by l2 norm before being used by ht pinn as reference data 3 2 ht pinn implementation for the steady state ht experiment described above the developed ht pinn contains 5 forward neural networks n n i x y t i 1 5 13 21 25 corresponding to different pumping well and 1 inverse network tnn x y all networks have 6 fully connected layers with tanh activation functions each containing 50 hidden units the sample grids for evaluating los s n i and los s d i are uniformly distributed on neumann top bottom and dirichlet left right boundaries with n d and n n 128 according to the pumping schedule the well grids are separated as samples for los s p i and los s m i with n p 1 and n m 24 direct measurements of transmissivity are uniformly distributed in the domain with n t 61 fig 2 b in the developed ht pinn a relax region is defined as a square area 30 m 30 m centered on the pumping well xu et al 2021a discussed that the solution in a pumping test always has control volumes near the pumping point source sink with significantly larger pde residuals than the outer region thus the loss function may be dominated by the collocation points in this region setting the relax region is a tradeoff between the pde regularization and the solution smoothness outside the relax region is the pde regularization region where the grid is strictly governed by eq 2 i e the non pumping grid we implement the random and recurrent batching method i e the method 2 discussed in the previous section to train the ht pinn we generate 10 batches each containing 900 randomly sampled non pumping collocation points with pde constraints for each pumping test these collocation point batches are recurrently used to evaluate los s e with n e 900 at each iteration in total we include 9 000 pde constrained collocation points for each pumping test and 45 000 collocation points for all the five pumping tests for the transient ht experiment we have 10 determined time steps t 0 1 0 2 1 0 at each time step the data composition mainly refers to the steady state experiment except for the pde batch size which is reduced to 300 n e 300 aggregately the number of collocation points in one transient pumping test with 10 time steps will be 30 000 and in the whole experiment will be 150 000 with consideration of unique ic constraints we add monitoring wells as sample grids for evaluating los s init i causing n init 24 in both types of experiments neural networks are trained with adam optimizer on the google colab platform training is counted by epoch each containing 100 iterations for the transient experiment in each iteration a specific pde batch measurements of hydraulic heads and transmissivities neumann and dirichlet boundary grids ic grids and the pumping grid are fed to backpropagation so one epoch can cover data batches at every time step ht pinn is trained for 3000 epochs and the learning rate decays from 1 10 3 to 1 10 4 after 1000 epochs the weights of each loss term are λ m 10 4 λ f 50 λ p 1 λ n 10 4 λ d 2 10 4 λ t 10 3 λ init 10 4 these weights are determined to keep each loss term at a similar magnitude to balance their contributions to the total loss kingma and ba 2017 in a steady state ht experiment each epoch only contains 10 iterations to cover the data batches and only 2000 epochs are needed to achieve comparative convergence with the learning rate decaying from 1 10 3 to 1 10 4 after 1000 epochs the weight of λ init is not considered due to the removal of loss init and weights of other loss terms are unchanged 3 3 quantitative measures for the forward model surrogate the prediction error is quantified by the forward relative residual metric which is formulated as 18 n n i n n i x y t h i x y t 2 2 h i x y t 2 2 x y ω t 0 t where h i x y t and n n i x y t represent the true and approximated hydraulic heads in vector form respectively similarly the inverse relative residual t is evaluated by 19 t t n n x y t x y 2 2 t x y 2 2 x y ω where t x y and t n n x y are the true and estimated transmissivity vectors moreover the inverse result is accessed by map accuracy map accuracy refers to what percentage of the grid has transmissivity correctly inverted kang et al 2017 the condition for correct inversion is that pointwise estimation error ε x y is less than a predefined threshold set to 10 in this study 20 ε x y t n n x y t x y t max t min x y ω 4 results of numerical experiments 4 1 transient base experiment 4 1 1 forward model of transient problem evaluation fig 3 shows the performance of the forward model in the transient experiment fig 3a shows the true first row and approximated second row hydraulic heads at time steps from 0 1 to 1 h in a pumping test with the pumping well located at the left bottom corner p1 of the well network the approximated heads are from nn 1 x y t prediction and the true hydraulic heads are solved from a numerical solver the color map and contour lines show that the n n 1 model prediction agrees with the numerical simulation result at every time step specifically at 0 and 1 the nn 1 model reproduces the hydraulic heads of 0 defined by dirichlet bc and at y 0 the contour lines are perpendicular to the boundaries defined by the impermeable neumann bc fig 3b plots the indirect measurements collected from monitoring wells and model prediction at monitoring wells on the time axis in the plot each color indicates a specific monitoring well stars note indirect measurements and solid lines note prediction from nn 1 it shows that nn 1 well learns the temporal trends implied by those indirect measurements and initial conditions at t 0 predicted hydraulic heads are 0 as a result of initial condition constraints then they start dropping down until t 0 7 after that hydraulic heads become unchanged and stay at a steady state fig 3c shows a scattered plot of the whole indirect measurements in all five pumping tests and relative predicted hydraulic heads the r 2 coefficient of determination is greater than 0 99 the relative residuals of n n t i for i 1 5 13 21 25 are 6 14 6 26 6 23 6 58 6 53 all five nn models produce a satisfactory prediction of hydraulic heads and are collectively supported as surrogate models for inversion 4 1 2 inverse model under transient problem evaluation fig 4 shows the inverse modeling results of tnn in the transient experiment by comparing fig 4a and b the estimated transmissivity field from tnn well describes the main distribution pattern of the true field fig 4c shows the scatterplot of true and estimated transmissivities for the entire field with over a million values r 2 coefficient is greater than 0 92 the relative residual tnn is 10 32 and the map accuracy is 94 93 in this study the number of known hydraulic transmissivity data is only about 0 006 of the number of parameters to be estimated which is far less than the number in previous studies tartakovsky et al 2020 but the estimation is sufficiently accurate the total running time of this experiment is about 34 260 s 4 2 steady state base experiment 4 2 1 forward model of steady state problem evaluation fig 5 shows the performance of the steady state forward model fig 5a shows the numerically solved true steady state hydraulic heads in the pumping test p21 whose location is at the right bottom corner of the well network fig 5b shows the approximated steady state hydraulic heads from the corresponding forward model nn 21 x y the map can be regarded as a stagnant moment in the later phase of a pumping test and a comparison of them shows that the nn 21 model is in good agreement with the numerical simulation result and follows the defined dirichlet bc and impermeable neumann bc explicitly as the model in the transient experiment one more detail is the perpendicularity of the contour line at y 1 which is not shown in fig 3a fig 5c shows the scattered plot of the true and predicted steady state hydraulic heads in all five pumping tests the r 2 is greater than 0 99 the relative residuals n n i for i 1 5 13 21 25 are 6 00 9 37 6 57 7 13 8 40 the steady state forward model performs equivalently well as the transient model 4 2 2 inverse model under steady state problem evaluation fig 6 shows the inverse modeling results of steady state tnn fig 6a shows the true lnt field fig 6b shows tnn estimation which presents the main pattern of the true field fig 6c shows the scatterplot of true and estimated transmissivities on the whole field r 2 coefficient is nearly 0 95 the relative residual tn n t is 9 09 and the map accuracy is 96 85 this performance is even better than that in the transient experiment more attractively the total running time of this experiment is only 2769 s which is much faster than the transient experiment and computationally efficient for such a large scale inverse problem for simplicity in the following sections ht pinn in steady state experiments is used for further discussion 4 3 uncertainty quantification there are mainly two uncertainty sources for implementing the ht pinn initial guesses of model coefficients and randomly selected batches the implementation is repeated by 50 times with different initial guesses and batch generation to analyze the model uncertainty fig 7 a shows the uncertainty of the evaluation metrics inverse map accuracy inverse residual and forward residual the mean and standard deviation of each metric are presented as dot and error bars for map accuracy the mean and standard deviation are 95 82 and 1 73 respectively for inverse relative residual the mean and standard deviation are 9 84 and 0 78 respectively overall with a relatively small standard deviation ht pinn performs consistently well in all repeats thus it can be concluded that the initial guess of the network coefficients and the random generation of batches have a limited effect on the model performance this implies that the developed ht pinn has a robust structure and contains enough coefficients which make it very likely to converge to a global minimum in addition ht pinn is also robust to error noise added to the direct transmissivity and indirect hydraulic heads measurements the pde constraints enhance the smoothness of model estimation and robustness which can overcome the influences of added data noises fig 7b shows the variance map of the best estimate the variance is quite uniformly distributed with peak zones slightly larger than the rest of the map the uniform variance is mainly due to the constraints from the direct and indirect measurements distributed over the domain 5 effect of batching training strategy a specific batch training method is used for the steady state model presented above that is among all the collocation grids with pde constraints greater than1 million 10 batches are randomly generated with 900 points per batch for each pumping test and recurrently use them for training the ht pinn to investigate the impact of batch size the number of batches and batch generation method the same transmissivity field and ht data of the base experiment are used and the number of epochs and learning rate are kept the same for the model training table 2 summarizes all the experiments and results 5 1 effect of batch sampling method to compare the three batch generation methods listed in table 2 we choose the same batch number n b 10 and batch size m b 100 300 600 the second method of random sampling and non recurrent batches can be regarded as an extreme case in which a new batch is generated for each iteration and the batch number is equal to the number of training iterations thus the total collocation points used in the non recurrent method are much larger than the recurrent methods considering that 15 000 iterations and 5 pumping tests are used in this test the total size of the collocation points used is actually many times the total grid number thus many collocation points are resampled in the iterative process the method of uniform sampling is designed to cover the entire domain except for the relax region the map accuracy of the inversion results of different batch generation methods is very close all around 95 which implies that the impact of different batch generation methods on the inverse estimation accuracy is insignificant for all batch sizes the training time of the non recurrent method is consistently slightly longer than the other two recurrent methods this is because of the resampling at each iteration and the convergence time for new samples in addition all methods exhibit an approximately linear increase in training time with increasing batch size as shown in fig 8 a 5 2 effect of batch size we then choose to use the method with recurrent random samples to study the effect of batch number and size with constant batch number n b 10 the batch size m b is set from 0 to 1200 used in ht pinn to evaluate non pumping pde loss los s e i we repeat such tests ten times each time generating new batches and reinitializing the network for uncertainty quantification fig 8b shows the mean and standard deviation for accuracy and training time results are also summarized in table 2 along with the inverse relative residuals we should notice that when m b 0 the training data does not contain any non pumping grids and los s e i is not evaluated that is the pde constraint has no role in the total loss therefore the ht pinn is relegated to a dnn that only learns inversion from data fitting the mean accuracy and relative residual of the dnn are hardly as satisfactory as the developed ht pinn additionally the associated inversion uncertainty is much larger for the dnn suggesting that the dnn is significantly affected by the initialization of network coefficients the training time of ht pinn is longer than dnn because it uses ad to evaluate the partial derivatives in pde loss terms and takes longer to converge the results show that the dnn is not as good as the ht pinn in providing robust predictions given the small number of direct measurements in our experiment or that the dnn may require much larger data to achieve the accuracy of ht pinn with physical constraints lecun et al 2015 staring from m b 100 the ht pinn gains high accuracy and small uncertainty it illustrates that ht pinn behaves more robustly to sparse data at the batch size m b 100 a total of 5000 pde grids are collocated which is about 0 48 of the total grids in the domain since random sampling and pde regions do not prohibit repetition there may be duplicate grids sampled and the actual grids with pde coverage may be lower however such a low coverage makes it possible to achieve a high level of mean accuracy and low uncertainty already and scaling up the batch size does not improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty fig 8b similar discussions can be found in other groundwater applications where only a single batch with different sizes is considered for example tartakovsky et al 2020 used one batch of 300 pde grids to invert a groundwater flow field with a resolution of 32 32 without pumping its coverage is about 30 in another groundwater flow and transport application he et al 2020 used a batch of only 200 pde grids to invert a field with a resolution of 256 128 the coverage is about 0 61 xu et al 2021a used 5000 pde grids to train a pumping test forward model surrogate in a field with a resolution of 51 51 we should note that neither absolute numbers nor coverage can provide us with a constant collocation size threshold as the results depend on the specific forward pde problem field resolutions and underlying parameter field smoothness the uncertainty in all cases standard deviation around 1 5 is small indicating that the network initialization and random sampling have little effect on the inverse estimation in contrast training time increases with the number of total pde collocation grids fig 8b thus we can choose fewer pde grids since no manifest improvement is seen after m b 100 hoffer et al 2018 nitish et al 2017 5 3 effect of batch number to examine the effect of batch number we control for the total number of collocated pde grids and investigate whether training with a small number of large batches or a large number of small batches is superior the total number of collocated grids for a forward problem is set to 2000 6000 and 12 000 for n b 20 batches with m b 100 300 and 600 respectively considering the ht pinn performance is quite stable with a small uncertainty we do not repeat the test and only compare with the average performance of n b 10 and m b 200 600 900 fig 8c shows the comparison and table 2 lists the specific numbers there is no significant difference in inversion accuracy within each pair with the largest difference being around 1 however training the model with 20 small batches takes longer for the same number of epochs it may be because training with more batches needs to execute more switching batches in extreme cases when the batch size is too large the model performance suffers severely we generate one batch with 3000 and 9000 grids n b 1 and m b 3000 9000 the model is trained for 6000 epochs using a single batch with the learning rate decreased from 1 10 3 to 1 10 4 the training time is orders of magnitude longer than n b 10 and m b 300 900 but the inverse accuracy is unmatched due to the high dimensional inverse problem caused by large batches that is harder to converge in the supplementary material fig s1 we also present a small scale 64 64 field and use all the grids in a single batch to train the model the training time is also orders of magnitude longer than the high resolution base experiment presented above 6 data demands for ht pinn in this section we investigate the performance of ht pinn on different data volumes of indirect and direct measurements we choose the random and recurrent method for batch generation with a batch number of 10 and a batch size of 100 the number and distribution of direct and indirect measurements are provided in different scenarios all data is corrupted with 5 noise 6 1 effect of indirect measurements for the indirect measurement of hydraulic heads two pumping scenarios are considered one scenario is the same as the base steady state experiment with pumping tests performed at 5 wells i e p1 p5 p13 p21 and p25 and the other includes pumping tests at 9 uniformly located wells i e p1 p3 p5 p11 p13 p15 p21 p23 and p25 in the second scenario the number of forward networks and indirect measurements are 9 and 216 respectively the transmissivity field and direct measurements remain the same as the base experiment shown in fig 2b fig 9 shows the true transmissivity field and inverse estimates for both scenarios for the scenario with 5 pumping tests the map accuracy is 93 58 the inverse relative residual is 10 33 and the mean of five forward model relative residuals is 10 17 in contrast the inversion performance of the 9 pumping test scenario is slightly better with a map accuracy of 96 40 an inverse relative residual of 9 73 and an average of the nine forward model relative residuals of 8 83 this is because more indirect measurements and pde constraints help improve inversion accuracy correspondingly the computation cost increases with the number of pumping tests in this experiment the training time is about 80 and 154 s per 100 epochs for 5 and 9 pumping tests respectively the training time increases approximately linearly with the number of pumping tests thus using more pumping tests may not always be the optimal plan for training ht pinn given the increased computational and experimental cost and slight enhancement in performance fig 10 6 2 effect of direct measurements as discussed by tartakovsky et al 2020 the requirement for direct measurements of local transmissivity is related to the spatial distribution characteristics of the field in the base experiment 61 direct measurements of transmissivity are used to constrain the parameter field which is significantly lower than previous research tartakovsky et al 2020 to investigate the effect of direct measurements we change the structural parameters to generate random fields with different variance and correlation length and invert them by feeding ht pinn a different number of direct measurements table 3 lists the structural parameters used to generate two random fields both fields have a resolution of 1024 1024 compared with the base experiment field a has a shorter correlation length and a smaller scale of peak to valley regionalization in contrast field b has the same correlation length as the base experiment but with much greater variance representing a highly heterogeneous field we consider three cases with the number of measurements n k 61 85 and 113 corresponding to 0 006 0 008 and 0 011 of the parameters to be estimated respectively and the locations are uniformly distributed ht pinn uses five pumping tests the same as the base experiment and the batch generation uses the random and recurrent sampling method with a batch number of 10 and a batch size of 100 due to the large value range of field b we modify the network structure by adding an exponential activation function to the output layer the gradient propagating from the exponential activation function decays faster therefore we train the networks with more epochs and higher learning rates to minimize the loss function we set the learning rate to 1 10 3 for the first 2000 epochs and 1 10 4 for the other 1000 epochs in fig 8 a2 the ht pinn trained with 61 measurements can locate large patterns in the peak and valley region but loses many details in contrast fig 8 a3 and a4 show that as the number of measurements increases to 85 and 113 ht pinn gradually solves this problem and provides a better description of the distribution details this is also illustrated by the map accuracy and inverse estimate relative residuals summarized in table 3 the relative residuals of forward models are comparable for all three cases indicating that the fitting to the indirect measurements of hydraulic heads are similar because they are all underdetermined inverse problems compared with the base experiment where 61 direct measurements provide high inversion map accuracy it is advantageous to have more direct measurements to estimate transmissivity fields with shorter correlation lengths fig 8 b2 b4 show the estimation of the highly heterogeneous field field b when 113 direct measurements are used as the training data ht pinn can provide a much smoother estimation with a higher inverse accuracy in addition table 3 shows that the relative residuals of both inverse estimates and forward models are much larger than the base experiment and all the experiments presented above this is because in highly heterogeneous transmissivity fields where both direct and indirect measurements differ by orders of magnitude optimizing the loss contribution is more challenging when assimilating these different types of data together compared to the effect of indirect measurements we can see that the addition of direct measurements can improve the inversion especially in highly heterogeneous fields and fields with short correlation lengths furthermore in the supplementary material fig s3 we also show that our base experiment results are better than kriging results of the direct measurements based on the corrupted data in the base experiment and true covariance function 7 model scalability for field resolution we compare the performance of the developed ht pinn with batch training techniques and a recently developed reformulated geostatistical approach rga to inversely estimate fields with resolutions ranging from coarse 64 64 to fine 1024 1024 except for resolution other field characteristics including spatial covariance and domain bcs and the pumping test strategy are the same as the base experiment for ht pinn direct measurements of transmissivity are collected at fixed spatial coordinates in the domain regardless of the field resolution the method of random and recurrent sampling is used to generate 10 batches of 100 grids with pde constraints in each forward model rga is a gradient based optimization approach as a dimensionality reduction method rga projects spatially correlated transmissivity on dominant principal components of its covariance matrix and directly estimates these projections hence the number of forward model runs and normal equations to be solved is reduced to the number of retained principal components which is usually much smaller than the field dimension in this experiment we use the correct covariance model to calculate the principal components this condition is not necessary because biased spatial covariance can be iteratively corrected zhao and luo 2021a the first 100 principal components are retained which means that there are 100 unknown projections to be estimated the rga forward model for simulating hydraulic tomography is a numerical finite element solver that is also used to generate the reference data of hydraulic heads for both ht pinn and rga computation is implemented on a desktop computer with an intel core i7 7700 cpu at 3 60 ghz and 16 0 gb ram table 4 summarizes the map accuracy the inverse relative residuals and running time for each model fig 11 shows the inverse results of ht pinn and rga for each resolution fig 12 directly compares the map accuracy and running time of the two methods both methods produce high quality inversions with over 90 accuracy at all resolutions for ht pinn the map accuracy slightly decreases from the coarse resolution 64 64 to the fine resolution 1024 1024 this is mainly because we use constant batch numbers and sizes for all resolutions therefore for coarse resolution the collocation points may cover almost the entire grid while for fine resolution they are only sparsely distributed the accuracy can be further improved with more epochs however this also depends on the random field generated as the same sampling method yields over 95 accuracy in the high resolution base experiment see table 2 the model scalability is reflected by both the data requirements and trends of the running time for the iterative method of rga the running time per iteration increases with the field resolution and the number of iterations also increases this is due to the increased computational cost of forward model simulations required to determine the jacobian matrix and associated matrix computation for ht pinn with batch training techniques the running time remains almost the same for all resolutions this is because the mesh free nature of ht pinn makes the running time only depend on the batch size and number rather than the field resolution which is more advantageous for fine resolution inversion in terms of total running time ht pinn with batch training surpasses rga after fields finer than 512 512 in fact according to zhao et al 2022 rga can be implemented with upscaled principal components i e upcia which has already achieved constant runtime for estimating fields with different resolutions the total runtime of upcia depends on upscaling factors for example the principal components of dimension 1024 1024 can be upscaled to 16 16 so that a 1024 1024 field can be inverted faster than all the cases above even though the developed ht pinn may not be better than upcia on computation efficiency it still shows broad applicability and robustness to various resolutions considering that the network structure of ht pinn and the batch generation method remain unchanged at all resolutions we have also successfully applied the developed ht pinn to groundwater flow inverse problems without pumping which have been the main cases discussed in the literature fig s2 in the supplementary material 8 conclusion the developed ht pinn involves a neural network model for transmissivity and a series of neural network models to describe steady state and transient sequential pumping tests it jointly trains all neural network models by minimizing the total loss function including data fitting errors and pde constraints new advances and findings include 1 to the best of our knowledge this is the first pinn application to invert the transmissivity field with pumping test data especially multiple pumping tests considering that the pumping test is one of the main field tests for aquifer characterization the development of ht pinn is necessary and important especially for extending pinn to field applications 2 we incorporate batch training technique into ht pinn to accurately and efficiently invert the high dimensional transmissivity field with over a million unknowns 1024 1024 resolution a significant advance over the literature the data requirements are suitable and the number of direct measurements is only 0 006 of the estimated parameters in the presented high dimensional field 3 we systematically study the effect of different batch training methods including batch generation methods batch number and size compared to batch number and size the batch generation method has a negligible impact on the inversion results and running time for the gaussian field used in our experiment a few batches 10 in our experiments consisting of hundreds of randomly sampled collocation grids can meet the minimum requirement of pde constraints and yield satisfactory inversion results the batch training technique is more efficient than a single batch with the same total collocation grids 4 the data requirements for indirect and direct measurements are studied for random fields with different structural parameters in our experiment 5 pumping test hydraulic tomography can provide sufficient indirect measurements of the hydraulic head for high accuracy inversion performing more pumping tests may only slightly enhance the inversion in contrast increasing direct measurements of transmissivity can greatly improve the inversion as direct measurements are often limited and expensive in the field especially for highly heterogeneous fields and fields with short correlation lengths 5 compared with the gradient based rga the developed ht pinn exhibits great scalability in inverting fields with different resolutions due to its mesh free nature in specific the computational cost of ht pinn remains almost unchanged while maintaining high inversion accuracy for high resolution fields conversely the computational cost of rga increases significantly with increasing field resolution due to forward model simulations required to determine the jacobian matrix furthermore data requirements for ht pinn do not increase with problem dimensionality this shows that the developed ht pinn with batch training technique is particularly effective for large scale inverse modeling of high resolution fields in addition the performance of ht pinn shows higher inversion accuracy compared to dnn with no physics information i e pde constraints included in the loss function it demonstrates that pinn is more capable than dnn in solving inverse problems with sparse data particularly for problems with well known forward models huang et al 2022 wang et al 2021b xu et al 2021b although the effectiveness of the developed ht pinn with batch training technique has been improved to be efficient for inverting high dimensional fields presented there is still a long way to go before we can claim that ht pinn is superior to other inverse methods a serious issue is that the developed ht pinn relies on direct measurements to constrain the smoothness of model predictions and the dependence becomes stronger when the geostatistical pattern is complex and variable bengio et al 2006 such as highly heterogeneous and short correlation length ga relies on the prior information of spatial covariance to regularize the underlying parameter field which also requires direct measurements to estimate but it is not necessary to have accurate prior structural parameters because biased spatial covariance can be iteratively corrected zhao and luo 2021a that is it may not be necessary to have many direct measurements to obtain an accurate estimation of the spatial covariance a feasible solution for ht pinn is to incorporate additional constraints such as spatial correlation and adapt it to inverse problems with fewer direct measurements however it is challenging to account for the uncertainty of spatial covariance another limitation is that most of the parameter fields used in the literature and this study are smooth either described by a gaussian covariance model or only by a few principal components i e dominant large scale distribution patterns of an exponential covariance model since there is no smoothness regularization in the developed ht pinn it has the potential to apply to parameter fields with complex distribution patterns such as non gaussian fields however it can be data hungry and requires much more collocation points to capture small scale and complex patterns of variation dong et al 2019 these all need to be addressed in the application of pinn for inverse modeling of large scale complex

2629,over the past two decades geostatistics based hydraulic tomography ht has been proven to be a robust method for subsurface heterogeneity characterization however the reproducibility of estimated parameter fields namely the hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss obtained over different data collection periods and under different flow scenarios have been rarely studied in this study we investigate the reproducibility and predictivity of ht estimates using data collected in 2019 and 2020 at a field site of varying boundary conditions underlain by sedimentary units in japan with different data density and prior geological information model performance of each case is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by examining results from model calibration self validation and cross validation in terms of parameter fields comparison drawdown matches and cross correlation distributions results of this study reveal that 1 overall the parameter fields for 2019 and 2020 ht estimates are generally reproducible while fine scale discrepancy exists 2 they are also found to be reproducible in terms of consistency of estimated geostatistical parameters 3 higher levels of reproducibility and predictivity associated with estimated k and ss fields are obtained when higher data density is included for geostatistical inverse modeling with more accurate prior geological information and 4 the different spatial distributions of cross correlation between head and parameter fields induced through the significant variation of the groundwater flow field from 2019 to 2020 strengthen the notion of reproducibility of ht results these results collectively suggest that ht has the potential for mapping changes to k and ss heterogeneity over time broadening its future applications to various practical problems keywords hydraulic tomography geostatistical inverse modeling subsurface heterogeneity reproducibility data density prior models hydraulic conductivity specific storage model validation cross correlation analysis data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction heterogeneity in hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss is prevalent in aquifers over multiplicity of scales these parameters have significant controls on transient groundwater flow and solute transport thus the accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity in k and ss is critical for improvements to groundwater resource evaluation and management as well as contamination prevention and its remediation traditionally k is determined through inference from grain size analyses or permeameter tests using collected core samples in the laboratory or type curve fitting methods using data from slug single hole or pumping tests and ss is estimated from pumping single hole or consolidation tests domenico and mifflin 1965 neuman and witherspoon 1972 however most of these laboratory and in situ methods rely on empirical krumbein and monk 1943 freeze and cherry 1979 wolf et al 1991 or analytical solutions e g theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 with the assumption of homogeneous geological medium yet based on wu et al 2005 and straface et al 2007 the homogeneous medium assumption can yield biased results since the effective estimates are influenced by the development of the cone of depression and degree of heterogeneity moreover permeameter slug consolidation and direct push tests only provide information at or near the testing location therefore numerous small scale measurements need to be obtained and interpolated to capture the heterogeneity at a given site accordingly the characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is challenging as numerous samples or tests are needed to adequately delineate the hydraulic parameters distribution as well as their spatial correlation connectivity and uncertainty which is undoubtedly time consuming and burdensome besides small scale hydraulic parameter estimates are typically not representative of site or regional scale hydraulic properties e g tong et al 2021 luo et al 2020 luo et al 2022 geostatistical or stochastic estimation techniques are common approaches used to map the spatial heterogeneities of k and ss over the last few decades inverse modeling methods based on geostatistics have been developed and utilized by researchers to estimate hydraulic parameters e g rubin and dagan 1987 harvey and gorelick 1995 yeh et al 1995 recently hydraulic tomography ht has been developed as a robust method to characterize subsurface heterogeneity ht relies on conducting a series of spatially varying cross hole pumping or injection tests in an aquifer during each test hydraulic heads are monitored at different observation intervals yielding ht data sets compared to traditional characterization methods such as permeameter and slug tests geostatistical interpretation of ht data can characterize hydraulic parameters between boreholes as well as their connectivity and uncertainty since then various inverse methods have been developed to interpret ht data sets sequentially or simultaneously for hydraulic parameters

this study we focused on utilizing the successive linear estimator sle developed by yeh et al 1996 to interpret ht data sets for estimating the spatial variations of k and ss and their uncertainties a sequential successive linear estimator ssle was proposed by yeh and liu 2000 to sequentially interpret steady state ht ssht data sets from multiple pumping tests then zhu and yeh 2005 developed a transient ht tht algorithm which allowed for the joint estimation of both k and ss zhu and yeh 2005 added a loop iteration scheme to the ssle for the purpose of avoiding convergence issues caused by inverting ht data sets sequentially and improving the accuracy of inverse modeling results followed by ssle a simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle xiang et al 2009 mao et al 2013a mao et al 2013b was developed to simultaneously include all observed data sets in the inversion process for delineating subsurface heterogeneity simsle avoids the use of loop iterations and provides more constraints to the inverse problem however with much larger size of the covariance and cross covariance matrices than those of ssle simsle requires significantly more computational resources in terms of memory storage and could take much more time to converge to date the performance of ht has been investigated through a number of numerical e g yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 zhu and yeh 2006

illman 2017 2018 chen et al 2019 fischer et al 2020 tiedeman and barrash 2020 in porous and fractured geologic media unequivocally these aforementioned ht studies have demonstrated the robustness of ht in characterizing subsurface heterogeneity under complex conditions e g multiple aquifer aquitard systems and fractured geologic media practical issues related to the performance of ht such as data density illman et al 2015 prior geological information zhao et al 2016 luo et al 2017 2020 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2017 2018 and quality of conditioning data illman et al 2008 were investigated previously their studies have collectively showed that with higher data density more accurate geological information and use of higher signal to noise ratio datasets ht estimated fields tend to have higher resolution of heterogeneity decreased uncertainty and more robust validation results using independent test data not used in calibration efforts however another practical issue namely the reproducibility of the parameter fields estimated by ht analyses over different time periods with different boundaries conditions has not been studied rigorously to date except for the work of chen et al 2019 the term reproducibility here refers to whether the estimated fields using ht test data collected at different years for a given site would lead to the same or similar estimates from one year to another during pumping events conducted at different times forcing functions initial and boundary conditions as well as source sink terms could vary significantly while subsurface conditions in terms of stratigraphy and heterogeneity tend to remain unchanged without severe disturbance such as construction excavation or land subsidence the investigation of reproducibility provides assessments of the accuracy of ht estimates and their predictivity of independent ht tests conducted under different flow scenarios that is similar ht estimates obtained from different pumping scenarios is one evidence showing that ht is a robust approach that could be used to map subsurface heterogeneities from one period to the next chen et al 2019 investigated the reproducibility of ht estimates and their predictivity for different flow scenarios obtained from two different years 2010 and 2012 using a two dimensional 2d model which was depth averaged over the aquifer thickness b two validation approaches were used in their study namely self validation and cross validation which are described in the following section based on their results they indicated that the reproducibility of ht estimates was generally satisfactory and promising even though inconsistency did exist in both transmissivity t kb and storativity s ssb fields especially near model boundaries they concluded these differences might be attributed to unexplored processes omitted by the depth averaged 2d model used in the analyses due to the fact that chen et al 2019 s study was 2d with similar forcing functions it is unclear whether their results are also valid in 3d and under conditions when the forcing functions are different besides the reproducibility and predictivity of ht results need to be examined for different sites with different geological information moreover various commingling factors that may influence reproducibility have not been previously investigated rigorously specifically variations in forcing functions data density and prior information could all potentially influence the reproducibility and predictivity of ht results therefore the first purpose of this study is to examine the reproducibility of ht using hydraulic test data collected in 2019 and 2020 at the narashino site japan secondly the effects of data density and the accuracy of prior geological information on the reproducibilty are investigated in terms of comparing corresponding k and ss estimates and their performances in predicting independent pumping test data not used in calibration efforts finally cross correlation analyses between parameter fields and observed heads are conducted to further examine whether reproducibility can be achieved with different heterogeneity content contained in pumping tests performed over different time periods 2 experimental setup 2 1 site description and hydraulic tomography tests the field experiments were conducted at the narashino site located on land managed by takenaka corporation in narashino city chiba prefecture japan the site was developed to evaluate various groundwater remediation technologies based on borehole logs from wells o2 and o3 shown in fig 1 the stratigraphy beneath the narashino site generally consists of five layers which are from younger to older age the fill soil layer f joso clay layer dc and the first second and third sandy layers ds1 ds2 ds3 the fill soil layer f mainly consists of fill soil with some clay the clay layer dc located between 2 8 and 6 1 mbgs meters below ground surface is composed mainly of clay mixed with clayey silt few scoria rock and fine sand in fig 1a fill f is merged with the clay layer to simplify the stratigraphy of the top most confining layer dc beneath this layer the aquifer zone consists of the ds1 ds2 and ds3 layers which are all composed of silty fine sand to fine sand silt was also found with limited amount in layers ds1 and ds3 fig 1b shows the stratigraphy information from well o3 which shows a finer classification of dc ds1 ds2 and ds3 units as shown in fig 2 there are 17 wells installed at the narashino site including 4 pumping injection wells wells a1 a5 c1 c5 and 13 multi screened monitoring wells wells a3 b2 b3 b4 b5 c1 5 c2 c2 5 c3 c4 o1 o2 o3 wells a1 a5 c1 and c5 are completed to a depth of 18 m with 7 5 m long screens located between 9 5 mbgs and 17 mbgs among the observation wells wells a3 b2 b4 b5 c2 c3 and c5 are 17 8 m in length which have three screens located between 10 and 16 mbgs with each screen center spaced 3 m apart wells c1 5 and c2 5 are 14 8 m deep with 2 screens at a depth of 10 and 13 mbgs respectively wells b3 and o1 have exact the same configuration and both of these wells extend to 29 8 m with 6 screens along the borehole in terms of wells o2 and o3 they both have a 11 m long screen between 7 and 18 mbgs except for wells o2 and o3 all screens have a length of 40 cm and packers are installed between screens to isolate multiple screens installed within a well to limit vertical groundwater flow besides these 18 wells cut off walls with dimensions of 20 m by 13 m in plan view penetrated the subsurface to a depth of 19 2 m during the 2019 ht tests but were removed during the 2020 ht tests it is important to note that the groundwater flow behavior was significantly impacted by the cut off walls among these 17 wells wells o1 o2 and o3 are located outside the cut off walls while the other 14 wells are inside the cut off walls to date various types of tests have been conducted at the narashino site initially during the development of the site in 2014 soil samples were collected and used to obtain physical and thermal properties then 25 slug tests were conducted separately along the screen locations of nine observation wells with packers installed to isolate the screen interval the estimated k from 25 slug tests ranged between a minimum k of 8 38 10 5 m min to a maximum k of 4 21 10 3 m min with a geometric mean k of 1 63 10 3 m min and a lnk variance of 1 23 besides step up pumping injection tests heat tracer tests salt tracer tests as well as ht tests were conducted from 2015 to 2020 in this study we focused on analyzing the ht test data conducted in 2019 and 2020 to conduct the ht analyses of hydraulic test data collected in 2019 and 2020 8 out of 12 ht tests during 2019 and 2020 four tests from each time period were selected the eight selected tests all lasted for 24 h the four tests from 2019 selected for ht analysis have the most similar configurations in terms of pumping location pumping duration observation well placements and well configurations compared to the other four ht tests conducted in 2020 the other four tests are not used for analyses due to the different configurations that could lead to an unfair comparison from now on we refer to the ht tests conducted in 2019 as 2019 ht tests and those conducted in 2020 as 2020 ht tests the 2019 ht tests were conducted during the months of august and september 2019 with the cut off walls installed while 2020 ht tests were conducted during the months of august and september 2020 with the cut off walls removed details to the selected 2019 and 2020 ht tests are summarized in table 1 a network of pressure transducers was installed at various monitoring wells and ports to collect hydraulic head data during the ht tests depending on the test up to 36 observation ports were utilized for water level variation monitoring during each test two types of pressure transducers were used at the site the observation ports that were located at 10 mbgs were monitored with 0 20 m range pressure transducers with an accuracy of 0 1 of full scale fs trv 500 keyence co ltd all other observation ports were monitored with 0 10 m range pressure transducers with an accuracy of 0 2 fs dik 612a b1 daiki rika kogyo co ltd all transducers collected and recorded data every second throughout the duration of each test 2 2 data used for analyses in this study transient head data from 2019 and 2020 ht tests 1 to 3 were utilized for ht analysis and test 4 conducted during 2019 and 2020 was used for model validation based on the cross correlation analysis conducted by sun et al 2013 k is most sensitive to late time data while ss is most sensitive to the early time portion of drawdown curves thus instead of including all collected hydraulic data five to six transient data that captured the shape of drawdown curves were selected manually from the early intermediate and late time for inverse modeling which provided adequate information while limiting the computational burden fig s1 illustrates an example of the selected hydraulic data from 2019 and 2020 ht tests it should be noted that for the drawdown curves containing noticeable noise and fluctuation such as data collected in well c2 5 for 2020 ht test 1 which is shown in fig s1 drawdown data were selected from a fitted 3rd order polynomial curve instead of selecting directly from raw data depending on the case up to 380 drawdown data which is the highest data density case were used for model calibration it is worthy to point out that the number of data used for ht analysis varied for different data densities furthermore we selected 312 drawdown data for model validation and kept the number of data the same for all cases for a fair comparison besides to eliminate the influence of selected data and time as well as make the investigation of reproducibility reliable data from the same time along the drawdown curves were selected for 2019 and 2020 ht tests examination of water level data of 2020 ht tests revealed that the water level at the narashino site kept decreasing throughout the test period during august and september of 2020 which was not observed during the 2019 ht tests as shown in fig 3 a the water level decreased even between the testing periods of two ht tests when no known pumping events occurred this overall decline in hydraulic head might have been caused by unknown pumping events occurring near the study area that stressed the aquifer and lowered the water level thus in order to properly capture the water level changes induced by 2020 ht tests only raw data were adjusted to eliminate the influence of the steady decrease in water levels to achieve this purpose data were selected from each observation port every 30 min except for the pumping and recovery periods of 2020 ht tests to capture the linear relationship between the decreasing water level and time upon obtaining the best fit line of these data all observed data were adjusted based on that fitted relationship shown as fig 3b and c detailed adjustment procedures are included in the supplementary information si section it should be noted that the adjusted data sets of 2020 ht tests rather than the original data sets were used for the analyses in this study 3 description of various cases of ht analyses 3 1 description of ht analyses approach and simulation domain a highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach was considered for inverting the ht data in this study considering the variations of boundary conditions between each test and between two time periods of 2019 and 2020 the ssle algorithm was used in this study moreover the ssle algorithm zhu and yeh 2005 limits computational burdens compared to the simsle algorithm xiang et al 2009 as the former incorporates data sequentially rather than the latter which incorporates all data simultaneously to improve the accuracy of sequentially incorporating hydraulic data the loop iteration scheme zhu and yeh 2005 was used during inverse modeling we investigated the issue of reproducibility of ht estimates under two groundwater flow scenarios by varying data density and prior geological information in order to simulate transient groundwater flow for both forward and inverse modeling a 3d groundwater model with dimensions of 40 0 m 33 0 m 25 0 m was built and discretized into 24 336 variably sized rectangular finite elements with 27 000 nodes the model grid was refined gradually from the boundaries to the well screen locations with a maximum element size of 4 0 m 4 0 m 2 0 m and a minimum element size of 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m a perspective view of the three dimensional grid is included in the si section as fig s2 in terms of boundary conditions the top and bottom faces were treated as no flow boundaries while the other four faces were treated as constant head boundaries in ssle the natural log of hydraulic parameters such as lnk and lnss are assumed to be stationary stochastic processes and the geostatistical properties such as unconditional means covariances and correlation lengths of hydraulic parameters are assumed to be known as prior information for all cases in this study the variances of k and ss σ lnk 2 σ ln s s 2 were initially set as 6 5 and 2 5 respectively these values are obtained from previous ht analyses conducted at the narashino site ning 2021 in terms of correlation lengths we specified λ x 10 m λ y 10 m and λ z 1 m for both k and ss fields considering the stratigraphy at the site which is approximately horizontal for all the layers to mimic the cut off walls the k and ss of the elements corresponding with the cut off wall were assigned extremely low values of 1 00 10 12 m m i n and 1 00 10 12 m 1 respectively 3 2 reproducibility of ht analyses under different data density to investigate the reproducibility of ht estimates under different data densities three different case series depending on the number of hydraulic data used for inverse modeling were considered cases a and a series which used data from four pumping wells a1 c1 a5 and c5 and ten observation wells wells a3 b2 b3 b4 b5 c1 5 c2 c2 5 c3 and c4 cases b and b series which used data from four pumping and four observation wells wells a3 b2 b4 and c3 and cases c and c series which used data from four pumping wells and one observation well well b2 the letters a b and c refer to the ht analyses conducted with 2019 ht test data while a b and c refer to the ht analyses conducted with 2020 ht test data overall 380 hydraulic data were used for inverse modeling for cases a and a series 156 data were used for cases b and b series and 69 data were used for cases c and c series 3 3 reproducibility of ht analyses under different prior information with the intention of investigating the reproducibility of ht estimates with variation in prior geological information included in ht analyses three cases with different subsurface geological information were conducted for both 2019 and 2020 ht analyses case 1 homogeneous initial k and ss fields for model calibration homo moreover based on the borehole logs collected at the narashino site two geological prior model were built 1 a 4 layer geological model case 2 geo 4 and 2 a 10 layer geological model case 3 geo 10 in these two geological prior models each layer is assumed to be horizontal based on two borehole logs collected at the site furthermore a homogeneous initial input of k and ss are assigned to each layer detailed initial inputs for these cases are provided in table 2 it should be noted that the k is determined based on the core samples collected at the site while a typical value of ss for corresponding soil types at narashino site was chosen from batu 1998 due to lack of in situ and laboratory values in total 18 cases cases 1a to 3c and 1a to 3c for 2019 and 2020 ht tests respectively are analyzed to investigate the reproducibility of ht estimates under three different data density and three different prior geological information summarized in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimated k and ss fields using data from 2019 and 2020 ht tests ht analyses of 2019 and 2020 ht tests were performed on two pc clusters one using 16 processors with 192 gb of ram and the other using 32 processors with 192 gb of ram depending on the complexity of the model and the pc clusters used for inverse modeling the model convergence varied from 7 to 14 days the biggest head misfit between simulated and observed drawdown are used to assess the convergence and to determine the model results for visualization and further analysis we selected inversion results from iterations where the biggest misfit has sufficiently decreased and stabilized indicating the convergence of the inverse model the biggest head misfit versus iterations are plotted in the si section as fig s3 4 1 1 ht estimates obtained from 2019 ht tests the estimated k and ss fields for all nine cases analyzed with 2019 ht tests are shown in fig 4 a i and 5a i respectively the corresponding residual variance maps of lnk and lnss of 2019 tht analyses are shown in figs s4 and s5 respectively as shown in fig 4a i for all nine cases a high k zone near the interface of layer ds1 and ds2 is captured however the mapped detail of heterogeneity patterns varied from one case to another examination of 2019 cases 1 2 and 3 reveals that the low k clay layer dc was only captured when geological zonation models geo 4 and geo 10 were used as prior information the omission of the dc layer in the ht estimates from the homogeneous prior case fig 4a c is caused by the lack of hydraulic data collected in the dc layer as there are no observation points located in the dc no information is provided to delineate that layer when using a homogeneous initial guess data density also exhibits noticeable impacts on ht estimates as well when the same number of data is included in the inverse model similar results were obtained from all three geological zonation models case 1 homo case 2 geo 4 and case 3 geo 10 however with a decrease in data density details to k distributions gradually disappeared for 2019 case c series i e cases 1c 2c and 3c in fig 4c f and i respectively the high k zone in the middle of the ds1 layer does not appear compared with cases a series i e cases 1a 2a and 3a in fig 4a d and g respectively and b series i e cases 1b 2b and 3b in fig 4b e and h respectively besides a high k zone near the dc layer is mapped in case c series which is not captured by the other two cases of 2019 ht tests i e cases 1a 1b 2a 2b 3a 3b in fig 4a b d e g h respectively furthermore similar results in terms of mean and variance of lnk around 7 0 and 1 9 respectively are obtained from ht estimates of all 9 cases when comparing the k values to those of slug test results at corresponding locations meanwhile the estimated ss fields for the 2019 tht analyses are shown in fig 5 a i the estimated ss distributions in general do not reveal too many differences among cases and all these cases capture a high ss zone at the top of the ds1 layer and relatively low ss zones beneath it however for the 2019 case 1 series i e cases 1a 1b and 1c in fig 5a b c respectively the dc layer which is known as a high ss zone is estimated as a low ss zone with values similar to sand in contrast when the geological prior information is provided in terms of the initial guess of a geological zonation model the difference between the top clay layer dc and the sandy layers beneath it ds1 ds2 and ds3 becomes more distinguishable this indicates that when data is lacking or limited prior geological information provided to the inverse model when they are reliable can compensate for the loss of information and improves the accuracy of the estimates to a certain extent besides fig 5a i shows that the estimated ss fields of 2019 cases 1c 2c and 3c fig 5c f i respectively are smoother than those of 2019 cases 1a 2a 3a fig 5a d g respectively and 1b 2b 3b fig 5b e h respectively which suggests that decreasing the data density leads to the absence of detailed heterogeneity pattern one significant advantage of using ssle algorithm for ht analyses is that it can yield uncertainty estimates that represent the reliability of ht estimates in terms of providing the residual variance map of the natural log of the parameter values higher residual variance values indicate higher uncertainty of estimated parameters while lower residual variance values indicate lower uncertainty i e higher reliability examination of the residual variance tomograms of lnk and lnss of 2019 ht analyses shown in figs s4 and s5 reveals that for both lnk and lnss lower residual variance values are mainly concentrated in the ds1 layer where observation points are located while for the dc ds2 and ds3 layers relatively larger residual variance values are found indicating that the uncertainty of parameter estimates in those layers are higher furthermore comparison of case 1 series figs s4a c and s5a c 2 series figs s4d f and s5d f and 3 series figs s4g i and s5g i shows that lower residual variance values are found in the ds1 layer for cases 2 and 3 series when incorporating prior geological information instead of utilizing a homogeneous initial guess besides results from case a series figs s4a d g and s5a d g exhibit lower residual variances than cases b figs s4b e h and s5b e h and c series figs s4c f i and s5c f i these results collectively reveal that using reliable geological prior information and increasing data density both lead to improving the reliability of ht estimates 4 1 2 ht estimates obtained from 2020 ht tests with regards to the results from the 2020 ht analyses the estimated k and ss fields for all nine analyzed cases are shown in fig 6 a i and 7a i respectively the corresponding residual variance maps of lnk and lnss of 2020 ht analyses are shown in figs s6 and s7 respectively examination of 2020 ht estimated k fields shown in fig 6a i reveals that a high k zone in the middle of the ds1 layer is captured when compared with the results from slug tests conducted in ds1 layer a similar mean of lnk is obtained from ht results while larger variances which represent a higher level of heterogeneity is found moreover there are some high k zones shown in ds2 and ds3 for all nine cases although the locations of these zones varies to some degree in terms of the top clay dc layer similar findings as the 2019 ht analyses are obtained in that the dc layer is delineated properly only when prior geological information is provided besides as data density decreases details to heterogeneity becomes less apparent as shown in fig 7 a i a high ss zone is captured at the interface between layers dc and ds1 for all 2020 ht analyses cases which is identical to what is observed in the estimated ss fields of 2019 ht analyses through the comparison of cases 1 fig 7a c 2 fig 7d f and 3 fig 7g i it is noticeable that without the constraints of prior information and pumping data layers ds2 and ds3 of case 1 series are delineated as high ss zones which is inconsistent with geological data however with prior geological information provided into the inverse models the inconsistency between estimated values and geological knowledge is ameliorated for cases 2 and 3 series in which the estimated ss values of layers ds2 and ds3 were in the similar range as those of layer ds1 for the 2020 ht analyses the residual variance maps of lnk and lnss computed by the ssle algorithm showing the uncertainty estimates are depicted in figs s6 and s7 respectively through jointly comparing the residual variances of lnk of these 9 cases we find out that case a series fig s6a d g show a larger area with lower residual variance values while cases b and c series fig s6b e h and c f i exhibit a smaller area that contains low residual variance values a similar trend is also observed when examining the residual variances of lnss from the 2020 ht analyses that case 3 series fig s7g i with more detailed geological prior information behave more reliably than the other cases and the case a series fig s7a d g with higher data density exhibits higher reliability than those with lower data density based on these results it is concluded that higher data density and detailed geological prior information improve ht estimates in terms of decreasing the residual variances which is similar to the finding from the 2019 ht analyses 4 1 3 evaluation of the reproducibility of ht estimates the reproducibility of ht estimates is first evaluated by visual comparison of estimated parameters figs 4 7 residual variances figs s4 s7 and relative difference maps figs s8 s9 through the visual comparisons of corresponding cases for 2019 and 2020 ht analyses figs 4 7 both estimates from these two time periods namely 2019 and 2020 capture a similar heterogeneity pattern of k fields in the ds1 layer in contrast noticeable differences are observed for the other layers for example the locations of high k zones in ds2 and ds3 mapped with the 2020 ht analyses are different from the 2019 ht analyses this finding meets our expectations since with all the observation points located in the ds1 layer parameter estimates of ds1 should be more reasonable than the other three layers due to more information provided in the inverse model the discrepancy in ds2 and ds3 layers between 2019 and 2020 estimates could be caused by differences in flow paths during the ht tests of these two time periods induced by the removal of the cut off walls as stated in section 2 1 observation points are only located in the ds1 layer besides cut off walls were installed at the site for 2019 but not for 2020 the existence of cut off walls prevented water flow to take place horizontally within the layers inside the cut off walls which led to groundwater recharging the layers beneath the cut off walls and causing flow to take place in both upward and horizontal directions however after removing the cut off walls flow became mainly horizontal during 2020 ht tests with large differences in flow regimes observed in 2019 and 2020 ht tests noticeable discrepancies exist between 2019 and 2020 k estimates especially in layers ds2 and ds3 when comparing the residual variance maps of lnk and lnss from both 2019 and 2020 ht analyses figs s4 s7 it is found that the residual variance values located adjacent to the boundaries of the model of 2020 ht analyses figs s6 and s7 are noticeably smaller than the corresponding cases of 2019 ht analyses figs s4 and s5 this suggests that the estimated k and ss distributions outside the cut off walls have higher certainty for 2020 ht analyses than that of 2019 ht analyses one major reason for this phenomenon could be the flow path difference caused by the presence of cut off walls with cut off walls installed at the narashino site during 2019 ht tests groundwater is not able to flow horizontally through it which suggests that hydraulic data does not contain information beyond the cut off walls thus uncertainty of estimated k values significantly increases outside the cut off walls however after removing the cut off walls the hydraulic connection between the region within and outside of the cut off walls are restored which allows for the hydraulic head data collected during 2020 ht tests to reflect the heterogeneity of a larger area thus ssle can map the parameter fields with higher certainty i e lower residual variance of ln k and ss beyond the original cut off wall location regarding the relative differences between elemental parameter values of 2019 and 2020 cases it is calculated using the elemental parameter values of 2019 cases as the reference for this calculation elements that comprise the cut off walls were not used for comparison and marked by dark blue in figs s8 and s9 the relative difference between the estimated k fields from 2019 and 2020 cases fig s8 shows that in general the relative difference in k is smaller in the dc layer while higher relative difference zones are found mainly in the ds1 layer with some others in the ds2 and ds3 layers besides for case 1 series which start with homogeneous initial inputs of k and ss the relative difference in the dc layer is smaller compared to cases 2 and 3 which start with geological zonation models i e geo 4 and geo 10 this indicates that when prior geological information is provided reproducibility of k fields can be increased to a higher level in terms of decreasing the difference between the two estimated k fields as shown in fig s9 the relative differences between estimated ss fields from 2019 and 2020 cases are less than those between estimated k fields which suggest that the estimated ss fields are less heterogeneous than the estimated k fields besides similar to the relative difference between estimated k fields the larger difference areas mainly exist in the sand layers for the estimated ss fields 4 2 model calibration results the performances of different cases were then evaluated by comparing the simulated versus observed drawdowns of the three tests used for model calibration for both 2019 and 2020 ht analyses the mean absolute error l 1 and the mean square error l 2 norms the slope of the linear model fit as well as the coefficient of determination r 2 were calculated and compared to evaluate the model calibration performances of these cases quantitatively the l 1 l 2 and r 2 values were calculated as 1 l 1 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 l 2 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 3 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x i 1 n y i y where n is the total number of drawdown data i is the data number x i represents the i th observed drawdown y i represents the i th simulated drawdown x is the mean value of observed drawdown and y is the mean value of simulated drawdown the scatter plots that compare the simulated versus observed drawdowns for model calibration of 2019 and 2020 tht analyses are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively in each scatterplot the data points corresponding to the three tests used for inverse modeling are differentiated with distinct symbols and colors a linear model that fits all data points is included along with the computed r 2 l 1 and l 2 values in general the slopes of the linear model fit for all 18 cases vary from 0 9 to 1 28 which are all close to 1 0 moreover the r 2 varied from 0 83 to 0 98 examination of figs 8 and 9 reveals that l 1 and l 2 norms for both 2019 and 2020 tht analyses were about 10 2 and 10 3 which is relatively small besides l 1 and l 2 norms varied over a small range these all indicate a good match between the simulated and observed drawdowns for model calibration the difference or improvement between these cases are virtually imperceptible as the match of simulated and observed drawdowns are satisfactory for all cases one thing that is worthy to point out is that among the three tests used for inverse modeling tests 1 2 and 3 test 3 for both 2019 and 2020 ht tests exhibited the best match of simulated and observed drawdowns while the other two tests showed more noticeable biases this can be explained by the nature of the ssle algorithm since these three tests are sequentially included into the inverse model and test 3 is the last one included it is reasonable to expect that the parameter fields estimated has more ability to reproduce the last test included even though the loop iteration scheme is used in this study to minimize the impact of including data sequentially on the parameter estimation this effect still exists and might be observed in terms of simulated hydraulic data 4 3 comparison of parameter estimates from 2019 and 2020 ht surveys one direct way to assess the reproducibility of k and ss estimated from 2019 and 2020 ht tests is to quantitively compare the values using scatter plots along with statistical properties l 1 l 2 r 2 and slope of the linear model figs 10 and 11 illustrate the scatter plots of estimated lnk and lnss respectively as shown in fig 10 for the estimated k fields the cases provided with prior geological information cases 2 fig 10d f and 3 series fig 10g i exhibit a better linear fit of parameter fields estimated from 2019 and 2020 ht tests in terms of linear model fit results r 2 as well as l 1 and l 2 norms suggesting a higher level of reproducibility than the case 1 series starting with a homogeneous initial guess fig 10a c however the effect of data density on reproducibility of ht estimates is not as obvious as the that of prior information when examining the linear fit of 2019 lnk and 2020 lnk one possible reason could be that with limited or reduced number of hydraulic head data heterogeneity details captured through ht analysis could be degraded which leads to a smoother distribution and smaller variation between estimates and initial inputs this smoother distribution and smaller variation could lead to a better linear fit in fig 11 the estimated lnss of 2019 ht versus 2020 ht are plotted in general the estimated ss has promising linear fit results suggesting that the estimated ss fields are reproducible compared with the k estimates less scattering is observed between the ss estimates from 2019 and 2020 ht tests as discussed in sections 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 the estimated ss distributions are smoother and exhibit less heterogeneity which leads to a smaller variation of ss values between initial guesses and final estimates when compared to k thus ss estimates are concentrated in a relatively narrow area around the 1 1 line while the k estimates are scattered over a wider range 4 4 comparison of geostatistical parameter estimates from 2019 and 2020 ht surveys another approach to assess the reproducibility of estimated k and ss fields from 2019 and 2020 ht surveys is the comparison of geostatistical parameters namely the mean variance and correlation lengths for lnk table 4 and lnss table 5 examination of tables 4 and 5 reveals that the geometric mean and variance are close for all corresponding cases for both k and ss fields this similarity in geometric means and variances suggest that these geostatistical parameters are reproducible in terms of the correlation lengths the correlation lengths in ss fields have smaller relative differences for the corresponding cases compared to those of k fields besides the correlation lengths in ss fields are larger than those of k fields this is consistent with the results that ss fields are smoother and reproducible than k fields 4 5 model validation results to further evaluate the reproducibility of different cases the estimated k and ss fields are used to predict the drawdown data of two independent pumping tests results in terms of matches between predicted drawdown and observed drawdown are another indicator of reproducibility the independent pumping tests here refer to those tests whose head data are not included in model calibration specifically test 4 of 2019 and 2020 ht tests are treated as independent pumping tests and used for model validation in this study two validation methods are used namely self validation and cross validation 4 5 1 self validation results self validation refers to the use of estimated k and ss fields from 2019 and 2020 ht analyses with tests 1 3 to predict the drawdowns of 2019 and 2020 ht test 4 scatter plots that compare simulated versus observed drawdowns of 2019 and 2020 ht test 4 for self validation are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively with data from different observation wells marked with different symbols and colors the drawdown versus time curves of each case of 2019 and 2020 ht analyses for self validation are shown in figs s10 and s11 in the si section examination of figs 12 and 13 reveals that overall 2020 ht estimates exhibit better predictions while more biases are evident in 2019 ht estimates in terms of the linear model fit of simulated and observed drawdowns that is most biased predictions of 2019 ht test 4 occurred in wells c1 5 and c2 such biased predictions indicate that while k and ss fields from 2019 and 2020 ht surveys show similar overall heterogeneity patterns the fine scale differences of parameter fields could lead to significantly different drawdown predictions at some observation points when comparing cases with different data density cases a fig 12a d g and a series fig 13a d g yield the best fit of simulated versus observed drawdown however the drawdown fit results deteriorate with decreasing data density with the head misfit being largest for cases c fig 12c f i and c series fig 13c f i this indicates that with higher density of hydraulic head data that are distributed evenly in the targeted investigation area the ht estimates have more ability to predict drawdowns of independent pumping tests which suggest that higher data density leads to improvements to reproducibility of ht estimates in figs s10 and s11 drawdown predictions of all these nine cases with different prior geological information and data density are plotted versus time for both 2019 and 2020 ht test 4 through the visual examination of match quality between the simulated and observed curves we find that the predictions from cases 2 and 3 series which start from 4 and 10 layer prior geological models respectively capture the observed drawdown for most observation intervals in contrast poor matches are found between simulated drawdowns of homogeneous initial guess solid dashed dash dot blues curves and observed drawdowns solid black dots figs s10 and s11 besides compared with cases a and a series included data from 10 observation wells and b and b included data from 4 observation wells cases c and c series generally generate simulated drawdowns that are closer to observed drawdown curves 4 5 2 cross validation results in addition to self validation of these cases cross validations are conducted in which the estimated k and ss fields from 2019 tht analyses are used to predict the observed drawdowns induced by the independent 2020 ht test 4 similarly the estimated k and ss fields from 2020 ht analyses are used to predict the observed drawdowns from 2019 ht test 4 the scatter plots that compared simulated versus observed drawdown of 2019 and 2020 ht test 4 for cross validation are shown in figs 14 and 15 the drawdown versus time curves of each case for cross validation are shown in figs s12 and s13 in the si section examination of figs 14 and 15 reveals that similar results are displayed for cross validation in terms of the linear fit of observed and simulated drawdowns that is cases with higher data density performed better than those with lower data density and the homogeneous initial guess model exhibited more biases compared to the cases with prior geological zonation models in general the examination of self validation and cross validation results reveals that when a higher density of head data are included in the inverse model a higher level of reproducibility is observed moreover providing prior geological information to the inverse model helps to improve the reproducibility of results compared with providing a uniform parameter distribution to the inverse model however utilization of a 10 layer geological model did not improve the linear fit of cross validation results in contrast the 4 layer geological model showed better overall linear fits than those of the 10 layer model this may be attributed to the accuracy of the constructed geological model with limited number of borehole logs it is acknowledged that in this study the 4 layer and 10 layer geological models are constructed with two borehole logs collected at the narashino site thus the better linear fit of 4 layer model compared to that of 10 layer model suggests that when there is lack of borehole logs for accurate geological model construction using a simplified geological model as prior information might be a better choice in comparison to the utilization of a complex geological model with unknown errors comparison of simulated versus observed drawdown for both self and cross validation as shown in figs s10 s13 indicates that the misfits observed from cross validation are much larger than those from self validation which illustrates that minor differences in heterogeneity distributions of the two estimated fields can lead to noticeable differences in drawdown behaviors from these two fields moreover for both self and cross validation the 2020 ht analyses shown in figs 13 and 15 produced better drawdown fits than 2019 ht analyses shown in figs 12 and 14 one possible reason may be a relatively simpler flow condition during the 2020 ht tests as the cut off walls were removed during 2020 ht tests this has led to groundwater flow occurring mainly in the horizontal direction whereas the impermeable cut off walls rendered the flow to be considerably more complex which may have contributed to difficulties in inverse modeling 4 6 cross correlation analyses results of 2019 and 2020 ht tests in this study reproducibility assessment of ht estimates from 2019 and 2020 ht tests involves the use of datasets collected under identical well configurations including the same pumping and observation locations in addition pumping rates and their durations are similar for various pumping tests conducted in 2019 and 2020 this can lead to a concern that identical well configurations including its pumping and observation locations for both 2019 and 2020 ht tests will lead to highly reproducible ht estimates that may be considered a trivial result however for this study it is important to keep in mind that the presence of cut off walls during the 2019 ht tests and its removal during the 2020 ht tests have significantly impacted groundwater flow within the investigated volume therefore to further validate the reproducibility of parameter fields from ht analyses we investigated the information content of a given drawdown curve from the same observation port e g well a3 with pumping taking place at the same location e g well a5 for both 2019 and 2020 ht tests as the flow regime is significantly different from 2019 and 2020 we anticipate that the information content will also be quite different to gain additional insight into the relationship between observed heads and the estimated k and ss fields during a pumping test one can rely on cross correlation analyses in particular cross correlation analysis is a weighted sensitivity analysis which determines the relative impact of each parameter with respect to others in time and space and reveal the information content in drawdown data on heterogeneity mao et al 2013 in the ssle algorithm cross correlation analyses consider the variance of parameter and its spatial structure i e covariance function and correlation lengths we briefly introduce the calculation of cross correlation between heads and estimated parameters below while a detailed description and derivation of the cross correlation and its computations can be found in yeh and zhang 1996 mao et al 2013a mao et al 2013b and wen et al 2020 the cross correlations matrix between head at x i t and estimated parameters are calculated in ssle mao et al 2013a mao et al 2013b as 4 ρ hf t r hf t σ h 2 x i t σ f 2 j hf t r ff σ h

perturbations k and ss respectively in this study the estimated k and ss fields of cases a and a series which has the highest data density were used to analyze the cross correlation with observed head collected at 13 mbgs from well a3 during test 1 which involved pumping at well a5 for both 2019 and 2020 by comparing the cross correlation between heads and k as well as between heads and ss one can further investigate the validity of reproducibility of ht estimates from 2019 and 2020 specifically if the spatial distribution of cross correlation between heads and k and between heads and ss are different respectively for two tests conducted at different time periods but with the same well configuration we can conclude that the measured drawdowns of each test contain different information about the heterogeneity even with the same well configuration furthermore we can conclude that the ht estimated parameter fields are reproducible and reflects the robustness of ht analyses moreover we can conclude that well configuration has negligible impacts on reproducibility otherwise the spatial distributions of cross correlation between heads and k and between heads and ss from the pumping test conducted in 2019 would be the same as those from 2020 4 6 1 cross correlation between heads and k cross sections of cross correlations between heads at 13 mbgs in well a3 while pumping at well a5 and the k fields from cases 1a and 1a 2a and 2a as well as 3a and 3a are illustrated in figs 16 s14 and s15 respectively in each figure snapshots of cross correlations are provided for early 10 min intermediate 50 min and late 1 400 min time periods of a pumping test the selected cross section y 12 m cuts though the observation points in well a3 and pumping well a5 in addition to the computed cross correlations flow lines and drawdown contours are also included in figs 16 s14 and s15 the three contour lines plot the drawdowns of 0 13 0 27 and 0 40 m in the direction that approaches the pumped interval at well a5 it should be noted that since the aim of this analyses is to compare the spatial distribution of the cross correlation between the observation head and estimated parameters we focus on differences in cross correlation distributions between 2019 and 2020 examination of the flow patterns of cases 1a and 1a shown in figs 16 and 17 reveals that despite the use of the same well configuration for 2019 and 2020 ht tests due to the presence of cut off walls flow lines and drawdown distributions of 2019 case 1a and 2020 case 1a are markedly different for early 10 min intermediate 50 min and late times 1 400 min respectively during 2019 ht test 1 groundwater flows into the inner part of the site beneath the cut off walls and then moves upwards towards the pumping well moreover the cone of depression gradually propagates from the pumping well to adjacent areas while it is confined within the cut off walls for the entire pumping period fig 16a c however when the cut off walls were removed prior to 2020 ht tests groundwater beyond the cut off walls can flow directly into the inner part and groundwater flow takes place spherically radially in the 2d cross section toward the pumping well at early and intermediate times fig 16d and 16e as pumping takes place over a long time and the corresponding head distribution approaches late time groundwater flow becomes nearly horizontal with the cone of depression propagating outward to the area that was previously confined by the cut off walls fig 16f this difference is also observed in groundwater flow patterns for cases 2a versus 2a shown in figs s14 and s16 and cases 3a versus 3a shown in figs s15 and s17 examination of fig 16a reveals that during early time there are two zones with higher positive cross correlation at z 8 and 14 m while a higher negative cross correlation zone is sandwiched in between however with the increase in pumping duration the higher positive cross correlation zone at the top z 14 m as well as the negative cross correlation zone beneath it gradually diminishes and become less cross correlated while the higher positive cross correlation zone at z 8 m becomes more significant moreover it should be noted that these zones are extended beyond the cut off walls this is due to the fact that there are no observation points outside the cut off walls it is acknowledged that the cross correlation is calculated using the head and parameters at the observation location without the information from outside the cut off walls the distribution of cross correlation tends to be smooth the spatial distributions of cross correlation between the heads and k of 2019 cases 1a 2a and 3a for three different times are significantly different from those of 2020 cases 1a 2a 3a for corresponding cases and times specifically for the spatial pattern of cross correlation between the heads and k of 2020 case 1a heads are positively and highly cross correlated with k only within a single horizontally elongated zone around z 15 m at t 10 min fig 16d moreover a comparison of fig 16d e and f reveals that the head is highly correlated with k at early 10 min and late time 1 400 min while during intermediate time 50 min head is less correlated with k which is similar to those found by mao et al 2013 and sun et al 2013 through synthetic simulations comparison of cross correlation between the heads and k between cases 2a and 2a as well as cases 3a and 3a reveals significant differences which is similar to differences observed between cases 1a and 1a 4 6 2 cross correlation between heads and ss the cross correlation between heads at 13 mbgs in well a3 and the ss fields from cases 1a and 1a 2a and 2a as well as 3a and 3a are shown in figs 17 s16 and s17 respectively for early 10 min intermediate 50 min and late 1 400 min times for the same cross section at y 12 m selected in figs 16 s14 and s15 the flow lines and drawdown contours in figs 17 s16 and s17 are the same as those shown in figs 16 s14 and s15 for the corresponding time respectively examination of the cross correlation between heads and ss from 2019 case 1a reveals that there is a positively correlated zone that exists in the central area located around z 15 m at early 10 min fig 17a and intermediate times 50 min fig 17b of the pumping test in general with an increase in pumping duration cross correlation values between observed heads and ss gradually decrease over the entire field especially in the ds1 and ds2 layers in particular fig 17c shows that the cross correlation values diminish to nearly zero for ds1 and ds2 layers during the late time period moreover the high correlated zones that extend outside the cut off walls shown in fig 17a c are also due to the lack of observations outside the cut off wall as discussed in section 4 6 1 compared to the significant differences in the distribution of cross correlation between the observed heads and k the spatial patterns of cross correlation values between observed heads and ss are more similar between 2019 case 1a and 2020 case 1a as shown in fig 17d e and f head exhibits higher positive correlation at early 10 min and intermediate 50 min times while cross correlation values diminish to nearly zero at late time of the pumping tests for 2020 case 1a however it should be noted that differences still exist between the cross correlation fields of 2019 case a series and 2020 case a series besides at late time 1 400 min head is less correlated with ss in ds1 layer for the 2020 case a series fig 17f s16f and s17f compared with those of 2019 case a series even though for both 2019 and 2020 cases cross correlation between the observed heads and ss is almost nonexistent which agrees with mao et al 2013 and sun et al 2013 4 6 3 evaluation of cross correlation analyses results as discussed in previous sections comparisons of spatial distributions of cross correlations between head and k or ss fields for early intermediate and late times reveal significant differences in cross correlation between the observed heads and k fields and noticeable discrepancies between observed heads and ss fields from 2019 case a and 2020 case a series ht analyses these all suggest that the heterogeneity information contained in the head data collected from 2019 ht test 1 are different from that of 2020 ht test 1 even with usage of the same well configuration for 2019 and 2020 ht tests the different heterogeneity information contained in 2019 and 2020 ht test 1 further strengthens the notion of reproducibility in ht estimates that is similar k and ss fields are obtained for 2019 and 2020 ht analyses even though different heterogeneity information is contained in 2019 and 2020 ht tests used for inverse modeling besides differences in spatial distributions of cross correlations between head and parameter fields are evidence that the reproducibility is not caused by the effect of same well configuration otherwise if well configuration is the only reason that leads to the reproducibility of ht estimates cross correlation fields of 2019 a series and 2020 a series cases should be similar aside of differences in forcing functions moreover it is worth noting that similar spatial distribution patterns of cross correlation between heads and k and between heads and ss were observed when comparing the cross correlation results from the same year e g 2019 case 1a vs 2019 case 2a vs 2019 case 3a 2020 case 1a vs 2020 case 2a vs 2020 case 3a this suggests that the initial guesses of the inverse models have negligible impacts on spatial distributions of cross correlations between observed heads and k as well as ss this is reasonable and can be explained by the same flow regime of different cases in the same year specifically taking 2019 cases 1a 2a and 3a as an example even though the prior model used for inverse modeling is different the estimated fields for both k and ss were similar with the same data density besides the same test test 1 pumping at well a5 used for cross correlation analyses leads to identical flow regime thus with an identical flow regime and similar parameter fields it is reasonable to have similar spatial patterns of cross correlation between heads and k and between heads and ss 5 summary and conclusions in this study we investigated the reproducibility of k and ss fields using ht test data collected in 2019 and 2020 at a field site underlain by sedimentary units in japan cut off walls encompassed the wellfield utilized for ht survey during 2019 while the walls were removed during the 2020 ht survey resulting in significant differences to groundwater flow patterns the reproducibility of estimated k and ss fields obtained with pumping tests conducted under varying groundwater flow patterns various data density and the resolution of prior geological information included was examined though visual examination of estimated k and ss fields residual variance maps geostatistical parameters linear fit of observed and simulated drawdowns drawdown curve fits and cross correlation between head and parameter fields transient hydraulic data from three pumping tests were used to conduct model calibration and transient data from one independent pumping test were used for model validation for both 2019 and 2020 ht analyses in total 18 different ht analyses cases with different model complexities in terms of data density and prior geological information were completed and discussed through these cases three data density and three prior geological information scenarios were tested to investigate practical issues related to reproducibility our studies resulted in the following major findings and conclusions 1 the estimated k and ss tomograms for 2019 and 2020 ht tests exhibited reproducibility in the overall heterogeneity patterns for corresponding cases thus ht can be repeated at a given site to monitor variations in k and ss over time if forcing functions i e initial and boundary conditions as well as source and sink terms are properly accounted for from one period to the next however fine scale discrepancies that may induce different drawdown predictions still existed in ht estimates obtained from 2019 and 2020 ht tests thus improving the resolution and accuracy of individual ht analyses should help in improving the reproducibility of ht estimates 2 through the geostatistical analyses of estimated k and ss fields from 2019 and 2020 ht analyses we find that the geometric means and variances are similar this suggests that estimated fields from ht analyses are reproducible geostatistically moreover correlation lengths of ss fields are larger with smaller relative differences between 2019 and 2020 ht analyses compared with those from the k fields this suggest that ss fields are smoother and easier to reproduce than k fields 3 data density showed noticeable influences on reproducibility of ht estimates namely k and ss when increasing the data density by including more evenly distributed head data into inverse models ht estimates exhibited higher level of reproducibility and prediction capability in terms of obtaining better linear fits of observed and simulated data 4 as expected the use of an accurate geological zonation model as an initial guess led to a higher level of reproducibility than the homogeneous initial guess under the same data density this suggests that with limited or fixed number of head data available including accurate geological information as an initial guess of ht analyses can provide more constraints to inverse modeling which is beneficial for obtaining reliable and reproducible estimates 5 although the use of a geological model as initial guess performed better than the homogeneous initial guess the 10 layer geological model cases did not yield significantly improve reproducibility compared to the 4 layer geological model cases this might be explained by the lack of detailed lithological information at various locations there are only two borehole logs collected at the narashino site thus the geological zonation was simplified as horizontal layers in this study this might induce errors to the stratigraphy and geological model input to ht thus leading to biased ht results and head predictions 6 differences in spatial distributions of cross correlations between head and k as well as between head and ss for the 2019 and 2020 ht tests indicate that head data from each year carry different heterogeneity information which strengthens the notion of reproducibility of k and ss estimates from ht analysis besides differences in cross correlation distributions between head and parameter fields are evidence that reproducibility is not caused by utilizing the same well configuration instead the use of pumping tests conducted at different locations and their joint interpretation with geostatistical inversion algorithms such as ssle and simsle results in parameter estimates that limit the impact caused by scenario dependence resulting in parameter estimates that are reproducible 7 overall this research shows that k and ss heterogeneity distributions mapped with ht analyses of tests conducted in 2019 and 2020 under different groundwater flow conditions are reproducible of course some discrepancies are noted between the parameter distributions from the two periods but the overall correspondence is reasonable based on different approaches used for the assessment these results suggest that ht has the potential for mapping changes to k and ss heterogeneity over time broadening its future applications to various practical problems credit authorship contribution statement zeren ning

2629,over the past two decades geostatistics based hydraulic tomography ht has been proven to be a robust method for subsurface heterogeneity characterization however the reproducibility of estimated parameter fields namely the hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss obtained over different data collection periods and under different flow scenarios have been rarely studied in this study we investigate the reproducibility and predictivity of ht estimates using data collected in 2019 and 2020 at a field site of varying boundary conditions underlain by sedimentary units in japan with different data density and prior geological information model performance of each case is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by examining results from model calibration self validation and cross validation in terms of parameter fields comparison drawdown matches and cross correlation distributions results of this study reveal that 1 overall the parameter fields for 2019 and 2020 ht estimates are generally reproducible while fine scale discrepancy exists 2 they are also found to be reproducible in terms of consistency of estimated geostatistical parameters 3 higher levels of reproducibility and predictivity associated with estimated k and ss fields are obtained when higher data density is included for geostatistical inverse modeling with more accurate prior geological information and 4 the different spatial distributions of cross correlation between head and parameter fields induced through the significant variation of the groundwater flow field from 2019 to 2020 strengthen the notion of reproducibility of ht results these results collectively suggest that ht has the potential for mapping changes to k and ss heterogeneity over time broadening its future applications to various practical problems keywords hydraulic tomography geostatistical inverse modeling subsurface heterogeneity reproducibility data density prior models hydraulic conductivity specific storage model validation cross correlation analysis data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction heterogeneity in hydraulic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss is prevalent in aquifers over multiplicity of scales these parameters have significant controls on transient groundwater flow and solute transport thus the accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity in k and ss is critical for improvements to groundwater resource evaluation and management as well as contamination prevention and its remediation traditionally k is determined through inference from grain size analyses or permeameter tests using collected core samples in the laboratory or type curve fitting methods using data from slug single hole or pumping tests and ss is estimated from pumping single hole or consolidation tests domenico and mifflin 1965 neuman and witherspoon 1972 however most of these laboratory and in situ methods rely on empirical krumbein and monk 1943 freeze and cherry 1979 wolf et al 1991 or analytical solutions e g theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 with the assumption of homogeneous geological medium yet based on wu et al 2005 and straface et al 2007 the homogeneous medium assumption can yield biased results since the effective estimates are influenced by the development of the cone of depression and degree of heterogeneity moreover permeameter slug consolidation and direct push tests only provide information at or near the testing location therefore numerous small scale measurements need to be obtained and interpolated to capture the heterogeneity at a given site accordingly the characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is challenging as numerous samples or tests are needed to adequately delineate the hydraulic parameters distribution as well as their spatial correlation connectivity and uncertainty which is undoubtedly time consuming and burdensome besides small scale hydraulic parameter estimates are typically not representative of site or regional scale hydraulic properties e g tong et al 2021 luo et al 2020 luo et al 2022 geostatistical or stochastic estimation techniques are common approaches used to map the spatial heterogeneities of k and ss over the last few decades inverse modeling methods based on geostatistics have been developed and utilized by researchers to estimate hydraulic parameters e g rubin and dagan 1987 harvey and gorelick 1995 yeh et al 1995 recently hydraulic tomography ht has been developed as a robust method to characterize subsurface heterogeneity ht relies on conducting a series of spatially varying cross hole pumping or injection tests in an aquifer during each test hydraulic heads are monitored at different observation intervals yielding ht data sets compared to traditional characterization methods such as permeameter and slug tests geostatistical interpretation of ht data can characterize hydraulic parameters between boreholes as well as their connectivity and uncertainty since then various inverse methods have been developed to interpret ht data sets sequentially or simultaneously for hydraulic parameters estimation e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 bohling et al 2002 brauchler et al 2003 zhu and yeh 2005 2006 fienen et al 2008 castagna and bellin 2009 xiang et al 2009 zha et al 2018 in this study we focused on utilizing the successive linear estimator sle developed by yeh et al 1996 to interpret ht data sets for estimating the spatial variations of k and ss and their uncertainties a sequential successive linear estimator ssle was proposed by yeh and liu 2000 to sequentially interpret steady state ht ssht data sets from multiple pumping tests then zhu and yeh 2005 developed a transient ht tht algorithm which allowed for the joint estimation of both k and ss zhu and yeh 2005 added a loop iteration scheme to the ssle for the purpose of avoiding convergence issues caused by inverting ht data sets sequentially and improving the accuracy of inverse modeling results followed by ssle a simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle xiang et al 2009 mao et al 2013a mao et al 2013b was developed to simultaneously include all observed data sets in the inversion process for delineating subsurface heterogeneity simsle avoids the use of loop iterations and provides more constraints to the inverse problem however with much larger size of the covariance and cross covariance matrices than those of ssle simsle requires significantly more computational resources in terms of memory storage and could take much more time to converge to date the performance of ht has been investigated through a number of numerical e g yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 zhu and yeh 2006

illman 2017 2018 chen et al 2019 fischer et al 2020 tiedeman and barrash 2020 in porous and fractured geologic media unequivocally these aforementioned ht studies have demonstrated the robustness of ht in characterizing subsurface heterogeneity under complex conditions e g multiple aquifer aquitard systems and fractured geologic media practical issues related to the performance of ht such as data density illman et al 2015 prior geological information zhao et al 2016 luo et al 2017 2020 zha et al 2017 zhao and illman 2017 2018 and quality of conditioning data illman et al 2008 were investigated previously their studies have collectively showed that with higher data density more accurate geological information and use of higher signal to noise ratio datasets ht estimated fields tend to have higher resolution of heterogeneity decreased uncertainty and more robust validation results using independent test data not used in calibration efforts however another practical issue namely the reproducibility of the parameter fields estimated by ht analyses over different time periods with different boundaries conditions has not been studied rigorously to date except for the work of chen et al 2019 the term reproducibility here refers to whether the estimated fields using ht test data collected at different years for a given site would lead to the same or similar estimates from one year to another during pumping events conducted at different times forcing functions initial and boundary conditions as well as source sink terms could vary significantly while subsurface conditions in terms of stratigraphy and heterogeneity tend to remain unchanged without severe disturbance such as construction excavation or land subsidence the investigation of reproducibility provides assessments of the accuracy of ht estimates and their predictivity of independent ht tests conducted under different flow scenarios that is similar ht estimates obtained from different pumping scenarios is one evidence showing that ht is a robust approach that could be used to map subsurface heterogeneities from one period to the next chen et al 2019 investigated the reproducibility of ht estimates and their predictivity for different flow scenarios obtained from two different years 2010 and 2012 using a two dimensional 2d model which was depth averaged over the aquifer thickness b two validation approaches were used in their study namely self validation and cross validation which are described in the following section based on their results they indicated that the reproducibility of ht estimates was generally satisfactory and promising even though inconsistency did exist in both transmissivity t kb and storativity s ssb fields especially near model boundaries they concluded these differences might be attributed to unexplored processes omitted by the depth averaged 2d model used in the analyses due to the fact that chen et al 2019 s study was 2d with similar forcing functions it is unclear whether their results are also valid in 3d and under conditions when the forcing functions are different besides the reproducibility and predictivity of ht results need to be examined for different sites with different geological information moreover various commingling factors that may influence reproducibility have not been previously investigated rigorously specifically variations in forcing functions data density and prior information could all potentially influence the reproducibility and predictivity of ht results therefore the first purpose of this study is to examine the reproducibility of ht using hydraulic test data collected in 2019 and 2020 at the narashino site japan secondly the effects of data density and the accuracy of prior geological information on the reproducibilty are investigated in terms of comparing corresponding k and ss estimates and their performances in predicting independent pumping test data not used in calibration efforts finally cross correlation analyses between parameter fields and observed heads are conducted to further examine whether reproducibility can be achieved with different heterogeneity content contained in pumping tests performed over different time periods 2 experimental setup 2 1 site description and hydraulic tomography tests the field experiments were conducted at the narashino site located on land managed by takenaka corporation in narashino city chiba prefecture japan the site was developed to evaluate various groundwater remediation technologies based on borehole logs from wells o2 and o3 shown in fig 1 the stratigraphy beneath the narashino site generally consists of five layers which are from younger to older age the fill soil layer f joso clay layer dc and the first second and third sandy layers ds1 ds2 ds3 the fill soil layer f mainly consists of fill soil with some clay the clay layer dc located between 2 8 and 6 1 mbgs meters below ground surface is composed mainly of clay mixed with clayey silt few scoria rock and fine sand in fig 1a fill f is merged with the clay layer to simplify the stratigraphy of the top most confining layer dc beneath this layer the aquifer zone consists of the ds1 ds2 and ds3 layers which are all composed of silty fine sand to fine sand silt was also found with limited amount in layers ds1 and ds3 fig 1b shows the stratigraphy information from well o3 which shows a finer classification of dc ds1 ds2 and ds3 units as shown in fig 2 there are 17 wells installed at the narashino site including 4 pumping injection wells wells a1 a5 c1 c5 and 13 multi screened monitoring wells wells a3 b2 b3 b4 b5 c1 5 c2 c2 5 c3 c4 o1 o2 o3 wells a1 a5 c1 and c5 are completed to a depth of 18 m with 7 5 m long screens located between 9 5 mbgs and 17 mbgs among the observation wells wells a3 b2 b4 b5 c2 c3 and c5 are 17 8 m in length which have three screens located between 10 and 16 mbgs with each screen center spaced 3 m apart wells c1 5 and c2 5 are 14 8 m deep with 2 screens at a depth of 10 and 13 mbgs respectively wells b3 and o1 have exact the same configuration and both of these wells extend to 29 8 m with 6 screens along the borehole in terms of wells o2 and o3 they both have a 11 m long screen between 7 and 18 mbgs except for wells o2 and o3 all screens have a length of 40 cm and packers are installed between screens to isolate multiple screens installed within a well to limit vertical groundwater flow besides these 18 wells cut off walls with dimensions of 20 m by 13 m in plan view penetrated the subsurface to a depth of 19 2 m during the 2019 ht tests but were removed during the 2020 ht tests it is important to note that the groundwater flow behavior was significantly impacted by the cut off walls among these 17 wells wells o1 o2 and o3 are located outside the cut off walls while the other 14 wells are inside the cut off walls to date various types of tests have been conducted at the narashino site initially during the development of the site in 2014 soil samples were collected and used to obtain physical and thermal properties then 25 slug tests were conducted separately along the screen locations of nine observation wells with packers installed to isolate the screen interval the estimated k from 25 slug tests ranged between a minimum k of 8 38 10 5 m min to a maximum k of 4 21 10 3 m min with a geometric mean k of 1 63 10 3 m min and a lnk variance of 1 23 besides step up pumping injection tests heat tracer tests salt tracer tests as well as ht tests were conducted from 2015 to 2020 in this study we focused on analyzing the ht test data conducted in 2019 and 2020 to conduct the ht analyses of hydraulic test data collected in 2019 and 2020 8 out of 12 ht tests during 2019 and 2020 four tests from each time period were selected the eight selected tests all lasted for 24 h the four tests from 2019 selected for ht analysis have the most similar configurations in terms of pumping location pumping duration observation well placements and well configurations compared to the other four ht tests conducted in 2020 the other four tests are not used for analyses due to the different configurations that could lead to an unfair comparison from now on we refer to the ht tests conducted in 2019 as 2019 ht tests and those conducted in 2020 as 2020 ht tests the 2019 ht tests were conducted during the months of august and september 2019 with the cut off walls installed while 2020 ht tests were conducted during the months of august and september 2020 with the cut off walls removed details to the selected 2019 and 2020 ht tests are summarized in table 1 a network of pressure transducers was installed at various monitoring wells and ports to collect hydraulic head data during the ht tests depending on the test up to 36 observation ports were utilized for water level variation monitoring during each test two types of pressure transducers were used at the site the observation ports that were located at 10 mbgs were monitored with 0 20 m range pressure transducers with an accuracy of 0 1 of full scale fs trv 500 keyence co ltd all other observation ports were monitored with 0 10 m range pressure transducers with an accuracy of 0 2 fs dik 612a b1 daiki rika kogyo co ltd all transducers collected and recorded data every second throughout the duration of each test 2 2 data used for analyses in this study transient head data from 2019 and 2020 ht tests 1 to 3 were utilized for ht analysis and test 4 conducted during 2019 and 2020 was used for model validation based on the cross correlation analysis conducted by sun et al 2013 k is most sensitive to late time data while ss is most sensitive to the early time portion of drawdown curves thus instead of including all collected hydraulic data five to six transient data that captured the shape of drawdown curves were selected manually from the early intermediate and late time for inverse modeling which provided adequate information while limiting the computational burden fig s1 illustrates an example of the selected hydraulic data from 2019 and 2020 ht tests it should be noted that for the drawdown curves containing noticeable noise and fluctuation such as data collected in well c2 5 for 2020 ht test 1 which is shown in fig s1 drawdown data were selected from a fitted 3rd order polynomial curve instead of selecting directly from raw data depending on the case up to 380 drawdown data which is the highest data density case were used for model calibration it is worthy to point out that the number of data used for ht analysis varied for different data densities furthermore we selected 312 drawdown data for model validation and kept the number of data the same for all cases for a fair comparison besides to eliminate the influence of selected data and time as well as make the investigation of reproducibility reliable data from the same time along the drawdown curves were selected for 2019 and 2020 ht tests examination of water level data of 2020 ht tests revealed that the water level at the narashino site kept decreasing throughout the test period during august and september of 2020 which was not observed during the 2019 ht tests as shown in fig 3 a the water level decreased even between the testing periods of two ht tests when no known pumping events occurred this overall decline in hydraulic head might have been caused by unknown pumping events occurring near the study area that stressed the aquifer and lowered the water level thus in order to properly capture the water level changes induced by 2020 ht tests only raw data were adjusted to eliminate the influence of the steady decrease in water levels to achieve this purpose data were selected from each observation port every 30 min except for the pumping and recovery periods of 2020 ht tests to capture the linear relationship between the decreasing water level and time upon obtaining the best fit line of these data all observed data were adjusted based on that fitted relationship shown as fig 3b and c detailed adjustment procedures are included in the supplementary information si section it should be noted that the adjusted data sets of 2020 ht tests rather than the original data sets were used for the analyses in this study 3 description of various cases of ht analyses 3 1 description of ht analyses approach and simulation domain a highly parameterized geostatistical inversion approach was considered for inverting the ht data in this study considering the variations of boundary conditions between each test and between two time periods of 2019 and 2020 the ssle algorithm was used in this study moreover the ssle algorithm zhu and yeh 2005 limits computational burdens compared to the simsle algorithm xiang et al 2009 as the former incorporates data sequentially rather than the latter which incorporates all data simultaneously to improve the accuracy of sequentially incorporating hydraulic data the loop iteration scheme zhu and yeh 2005 was used during inverse modeling we investigated the issue of reproducibility of ht estimates under two groundwater flow scenarios by varying data density and prior geological information in order to simulate transient groundwater flow for both forward and inverse modeling a 3d groundwater model with dimensions of 40 0 m 33 0 m 25 0 m was built and discretized into 24 336 variably sized rectangular finite elements with 27 000 nodes the model grid was refined gradually from the boundaries to the well screen locations with a maximum element size of 4 0 m 4 0 m 2 0 m and a minimum element size of 0 5 m 0 5 m 0 5 m a perspective view of the three dimensional grid is included in the si section as fig s2 in terms of boundary conditions the top and bottom faces were treated as no flow boundaries while the other four faces were treated as constant head boundaries in ssle the natural log of hydraulic parameters such as lnk and lnss are assumed to be stationary stochastic processes and the geostatistical properties such as unconditional means covariances and correlation lengths of hydraulic parameters are assumed to be known as prior information for all cases in this study the variances of k and ss σ lnk 2 σ ln s s 2 were initially set as 6 5 and 2 5 respectively these values are obtained from previous ht analyses conducted at the narashino site ning 2021 in terms of correlation lengths we specified λ x 10 m λ y 10 m and λ z 1 m for both k and ss fields considering the stratigraphy at the site which is approximately horizontal for all the layers to mimic the cut off walls the k and ss of the elements corresponding with the cut off wall were assigned extremely low values of 1 00 10 12 m m i n and 1 00 10 12 m 1 respectively 3 2 reproducibility of ht analyses under different data density to investigate the reproducibility of ht estimates under different data densities three different case series depending on the number of hydraulic data used for inverse modeling were considered cases a and a series which used data from four pumping wells a1 c1 a5 and c5 and ten observation wells wells a3 b2 b3 b4 b5 c1 5 c2 c2 5 c3 and c4 cases b and b series which used data from four pumping and four observation wells wells a3 b2 b4 and c3 and cases c and c series which used data from four pumping wells and one observation well well b2 the letters a b and c refer to the ht analyses conducted with 2019 ht test data while a b and c refer to the ht analyses conducted with 2020 ht test data overall 380 hydraulic data were used for inverse modeling for cases a and a series 156 data were used for cases b and b series and 69 data were used for cases c and c series 3 3 reproducibility of ht analyses under different prior information with the intention of investigating the reproducibility of ht estimates with variation in prior geological information included in ht analyses three cases with different subsurface geological information were conducted for both 2019 and 2020 ht analyses case 1 homogeneous initial k and ss fields for model calibration homo moreover based on the borehole logs collected at the narashino site two geological prior model were built 1 a 4 layer geological model case 2 geo 4 and 2 a 10 layer geological model case 3 geo 10 in these two geological prior models each layer is assumed to be horizontal based on two borehole logs collected at the site furthermore a homogeneous initial input of k and ss are assigned to each layer detailed initial inputs for these cases are provided in table 2 it should be noted that the k is determined based on the core samples collected at the site while a typical value of ss for corresponding soil types at narashino site was chosen from batu 1998 due to lack of in situ and laboratory values in total 18 cases cases 1a to 3c and 1a to 3c for 2019 and 2020 ht tests respectively are analyzed to investigate the reproducibility of ht estimates under three different data density and three different prior geological information summarized in table 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 estimated k and ss fields using data from 2019 and 2020 ht tests ht analyses of 2019 and 2020 ht tests were performed on two pc clusters one using 16 processors with 192 gb of ram and the other using 32 processors with 192 gb of ram depending on the complexity of the model and the pc clusters used for inverse modeling the model convergence varied from 7 to 14 days the biggest head misfit between simulated and observed drawdown are used to assess the convergence and to determine the model results for visualization and further analysis we selected inversion results from iterations where the biggest misfit has sufficiently decreased and stabilized indicating the convergence of the inverse model the biggest head misfit versus iterations are plotted in the si section as fig s3 4 1 1 ht estimates obtained from 2019 ht tests the estimated k and ss fields for all nine cases analyzed with 2019 ht tests are shown in fig 4 a i and 5a i respectively the corresponding residual variance maps of lnk and lnss of 2019 tht analyses are shown in figs s4 and s5 respectively as shown in fig 4a i for all nine cases a high k zone near the interface of layer ds1 and ds2 is captured however the mapped detail of heterogeneity patterns varied from one case to another examination of 2019 cases 1 2 and 3 reveals that the low k clay layer dc was only captured when geological zonation models geo 4 and geo 10 were used as prior information the omission of the dc layer in the ht estimates from the homogeneous prior case fig 4a c is caused by the lack of hydraulic data collected in the dc layer as there are no observation points located in the dc no information is provided to delineate that layer when using a homogeneous initial guess data density also exhibits noticeable impacts on ht estimates as well when the same number of data is included in the inverse model similar results were obtained from all three geological zonation models case 1 homo case 2 geo 4 and case 3 geo 10 however with a decrease in data density details to k distributions gradually disappeared for 2019 case c series i e cases 1c 2c and 3c in fig 4c f and i respectively the high k zone in the middle of the ds1 layer does not appear compared with cases a series i e cases 1a 2a and 3a in fig 4a d and g respectively and b series i e cases 1b 2b and 3b in fig 4b e and h respectively besides a high k zone near the dc layer is mapped in case c series which is not captured by the other two cases of 2019 ht tests i e cases 1a 1b 2a 2b 3a 3b in fig 4a b d e g h respectively furthermore similar results in terms of mean and variance of lnk around 7 0 and 1 9 respectively are obtained from ht estimates of all 9 cases when comparing the k values to those of slug test results at corresponding locations meanwhile the estimated ss fields for the 2019 tht analyses are shown in fig 5 a i the estimated ss distributions in general do not reveal too many differences among cases and all these cases capture a high ss zone at the top of the ds1 layer and relatively low ss zones beneath it however for the 2019 case 1 series i e cases 1a 1b and 1c in fig 5a b c respectively the dc layer which is known as a high ss zone is estimated as a low ss zone with values similar to sand in contrast when the geological prior information is provided in terms of the initial guess of a geological zonation model the difference between the top clay layer dc and the sandy layers beneath it ds1 ds2 and ds3 becomes more distinguishable this indicates that when data is lacking or limited prior geological information provided to the inverse model when they are reliable can compensate for the loss of information and improves the accuracy of the estimates to a certain extent besides fig 5a i shows that the estimated ss fields of 2019 cases 1c 2c and 3c fig 5c f i respectively are smoother than those of 2019 cases 1a 2a 3a fig 5a d g respectively and 1b 2b 3b fig 5b e h respectively which suggests that decreasing the data density leads to the absence of detailed heterogeneity pattern one significant advantage of using ssle algorithm for ht analyses is that it can yield uncertainty estimates that represent the reliability of ht estimates in terms of providing the residual variance map of the natural log of the parameter values higher residual variance values indicate higher uncertainty of estimated parameters while lower residual variance values indicate lower uncertainty i e higher reliability examination of the residual variance tomograms of lnk and lnss of 2019 ht analyses shown in figs s4 and s5 reveals that for both lnk and lnss lower residual variance values are mainly concentrated in the ds1 layer where observation points are located while for the dc ds2 and ds3 layers relatively larger residual variance values are found indicating that the uncertainty of parameter estimates in those layers are higher furthermore comparison of case 1 series figs s4a c and s5a c 2 series figs s4d f and s5d f and 3 series figs s4g i and s5g i shows that lower residual variance values are found in the ds1 layer for cases 2 and 3 series when incorporating prior geological information instead of utilizing a homogeneous initial guess besides results from case a series figs s4a d g and s5a d g exhibit lower residual variances than cases b figs s4b e h and s5b e h and c series figs s4c f i and s5c f i these results collectively reveal that using reliable geological prior information and increasing data density both lead to improving the reliability of ht estimates 4 1 2 ht estimates obtained from 2020 ht tests with regards to the results from the 2020 ht analyses the estimated k and ss fields for all nine analyzed cases are shown in fig 6 a i and 7a i respectively the corresponding residual variance maps of lnk and lnss of 2020 ht analyses are shown in figs s6 and s7 respectively examination of 2020 ht estimated k fields shown in fig 6a i reveals that a high k zone in the middle of the ds1 layer is captured when compared with the results from slug tests conducted in ds1 layer a similar mean of lnk is obtained from ht results while larger variances which represent a higher level of heterogeneity is found moreover there are some high k zones shown in ds2 and ds3 for all nine cases although the locations of these zones varies to some degree in terms of the top clay dc layer similar findings as the 2019 ht analyses are obtained in that the dc layer is delineated properly only when prior geological information is provided besides as data density decreases details to heterogeneity becomes less apparent as shown in fig 7 a i a high ss zone is captured at the interface between layers dc and ds1 for all 2020 ht analyses cases which is identical to what is observed in the estimated ss fields of 2019 ht analyses through the comparison of cases 1 fig 7a c 2 fig 7d f and 3 fig 7g i it is noticeable that without the constraints of prior information and pumping data layers ds2 and ds3 of case 1 series are delineated as high ss zones which is inconsistent with geological data however with prior geological information provided into the inverse models the inconsistency between estimated values and geological knowledge is ameliorated for cases 2 and 3 series in which the estimated ss values of layers ds2 and ds3 were in the similar range as those of layer ds1 for the 2020 ht analyses the residual variance maps of lnk and lnss computed by the ssle algorithm showing the uncertainty estimates are depicted in figs s6 and s7 respectively through jointly comparing the residual variances of lnk of these 9 cases we find out that case a series fig s6a d g show a larger area with lower residual variance values while cases b and c series fig s6b e h and c f i exhibit a smaller area that contains low residual variance values a similar trend is also observed when examining the residual variances of lnss from the 2020 ht analyses that case 3 series fig s7g i with more detailed geological prior information behave more reliably than the other cases and the case a series fig s7a d g with higher data density exhibits higher reliability than those with lower data density based on these results it is concluded that higher data density and detailed geological prior information improve ht estimates in terms of decreasing the residual variances which is similar to the finding from the 2019 ht analyses 4 1 3 evaluation of the reproducibility of ht estimates the reproducibility of ht estimates is first evaluated by visual comparison of estimated parameters figs 4 7 residual variances figs s4 s7 and relative difference maps figs s8 s9 through the visual comparisons of corresponding cases for 2019 and 2020 ht analyses figs 4 7 both estimates from these two time periods namely 2019 and 2020 capture a similar heterogeneity pattern of k fields in the ds1 layer in contrast noticeable differences are observed for the other layers for example the locations of high k zones in ds2 and ds3 mapped with the 2020 ht analyses are different from the 2019 ht analyses this finding meets our expectations since with all the observation points located in the ds1 layer parameter estimates of ds1 should be more reasonable than the other three layers due to more information provided in the inverse model the discrepancy in ds2 and ds3 layers between 2019 and 2020 estimates could be caused by differences in flow paths during the ht tests of these two time periods induced by the removal of the cut off walls as stated in section 2 1 observation points are only located in the ds1 layer besides cut off walls were installed at the site for 2019 but not for 2020 the existence of cut off walls prevented water flow to take place horizontally within the layers inside the cut off walls which led to groundwater recharging the layers beneath the cut off walls and causing flow to take place in both upward and horizontal directions however after removing the cut off walls flow became mainly horizontal during 2020 ht tests with large differences in flow regimes observed in 2019 and 2020 ht tests noticeable discrepancies exist between 2019 and 2020 k estimates especially in layers ds2 and ds3 when comparing the residual variance maps of lnk and lnss from both 2019 and 2020 ht analyses figs s4 s7 it is found that the residual variance values located adjacent to the boundaries of the model of 2020 ht analyses figs s6 and s7 are noticeably smaller than the corresponding cases of 2019 ht analyses figs s4 and s5 this suggests that the estimated k and ss distributions outside the cut off walls have higher certainty for 2020 ht analyses than that of 2019 ht analyses one major reason for this phenomenon could be the flow path difference caused by the presence of cut off walls with cut off walls installed at the narashino site during 2019 ht tests groundwater is not able to flow horizontally through it which suggests that hydraulic data does not contain information beyond the cut off walls thus uncertainty of estimated k values significantly increases outside the cut off walls however after removing the cut off walls the hydraulic connection between the region within and outside of the cut off walls are restored which allows for the hydraulic head data collected during 2020 ht tests to reflect the heterogeneity of a larger area thus ssle can map the parameter fields with higher certainty i e lower residual variance of ln k and ss beyond the original cut off wall location regarding the relative differences between elemental parameter values of 2019 and 2020 cases it is calculated using the elemental parameter values of 2019 cases as the reference for this calculation elements that comprise the cut off walls were not used for comparison and marked by dark blue in figs s8 and s9 the relative difference between the estimated k fields from 2019 and 2020 cases fig s8 shows that in general the relative difference in k is smaller in the dc layer while higher relative difference zones are found mainly in the ds1 layer with some others in the ds2 and ds3 layers besides for case 1 series which start with homogeneous initial inputs of k and ss the relative difference in the dc layer is smaller compared to cases 2 and 3 which start with geological zonation models i e geo 4 and geo 10 this indicates that when prior geological information is provided reproducibility of k fields can be increased to a higher level in terms of decreasing the difference between the two estimated k fields as shown in fig s9 the relative differences between estimated ss fields from 2019 and 2020 cases are less than those between estimated k fields which suggest that the estimated ss fields are less heterogeneous than the estimated k fields besides similar to the relative difference between estimated k fields the larger difference areas mainly exist in the sand layers for the estimated ss fields 4 2 model calibration results the performances of different cases were then evaluated by comparing the simulated versus observed drawdowns of the three tests used for model calibration for both 2019 and 2020 ht analyses the mean absolute error l 1 and the mean square error l 2 norms the slope of the linear model fit as well as the coefficient of determination r 2 were calculated and compared to evaluate the model calibration performances of these cases quantitatively the l 1 l 2 and r 2 values were calculated as 1 l 1 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 l 2 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 3 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x i 1 n y i y where n is the total number of drawdown data i is the data number x i represents the i th observed drawdown y i represents the i th simulated drawdown x is the mean value of observed drawdown and y is the mean value of simulated drawdown the scatter plots that compare the simulated versus observed drawdowns for model calibration of 2019 and 2020 tht analyses are shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively in each scatterplot the data points corresponding to the three tests used for inverse modeling are differentiated with distinct symbols and colors a linear model that fits all data points is included along with the computed r 2 l 1 and l 2 values in general the slopes of the linear model fit for all 18 cases vary from 0 9 to 1 28 which are all close to 1 0 moreover the r 2 varied from 0 83 to 0 98 examination of figs 8 and 9 reveals that l 1 and l 2 norms for both 2019 and 2020 tht analyses were about 10 2 and 10 3 which is relatively small besides l 1 and l 2 norms varied over a small range these all indicate a good match between the simulated and observed drawdowns for model calibration the difference or improvement between these cases are virtually imperceptible as the match of simulated and observed drawdowns are satisfactory for all cases one thing that is worthy to point out is that among the three tests used for inverse modeling tests 1 2 and 3 test 3 for both 2019 and 2020 ht tests exhibited the best match of simulated and observed drawdowns while the other two tests showed more noticeable biases this can be explained by the nature of the ssle algorithm since these three tests are sequentially included into the inverse model and test 3 is the last one included it is reasonable to expect that the parameter fields estimated has more ability to reproduce the last test included even though the loop iteration scheme is used in this study to minimize the impact of including data sequentially on the parameter estimation this effect still exists and might be observed in terms of simulated hydraulic data 4 3 comparison of parameter estimates from 2019 and 2020 ht surveys one direct way to assess the reproducibility of k and ss estimated from 2019 and 2020 ht tests is to quantitively compare the values using scatter plots along with statistical properties l 1 l 2 r 2 and slope of the linear model figs 10 and 11 illustrate the scatter plots of estimated lnk and lnss respectively as shown in fig 10 for the estimated k fields the cases provided with prior geological information cases 2 fig 10d f and 3 series fig 10g i exhibit a better linear fit of parameter fields estimated from 2019 and 2020 ht tests in terms of linear model fit results r 2 as well as l 1 and l 2 norms suggesting a higher level of reproducibility than the case 1 series starting with a homogeneous initial guess fig 10a c however the effect of data density on reproducibility of ht estimates is not as obvious as the that of prior information when examining the linear fit of 2019 lnk and 2020 lnk one possible reason could be that with limited or reduced number of hydraulic head data heterogeneity details captured through ht analysis could be degraded which leads to a smoother distribution and smaller variation between estimates and initial inputs this smoother distribution and smaller variation could lead to a better linear fit in fig 11 the estimated lnss of 2019 ht versus 2020 ht are plotted in general the estimated ss has promising linear fit results suggesting that the estimated ss fields are reproducible compared with the k estimates less scattering is observed between the ss estimates from 2019 and 2020 ht tests as discussed in sections 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 the estimated ss distributions are smoother and exhibit less heterogeneity which leads to a smaller variation of ss values between initial guesses and final estimates when compared to k thus ss estimates are concentrated in a relatively narrow area around the 1 1 line while the k estimates are scattered over a wider range 4 4 comparison of geostatistical parameter estimates from 2019 and 2020 ht surveys another approach to assess the reproducibility of estimated k and ss fields from 2019 and 2020 ht surveys is the comparison of geostatistical parameters namely the mean variance and correlation lengths for lnk table 4 and lnss table 5 examination of tables 4 and 5 reveals that the geometric mean and variance are close for all corresponding cases for both k and ss fields this similarity in geometric means and variances suggest that these geostatistical parameters are reproducible in terms of the correlation lengths the correlation lengths in ss fields have smaller relative differences for the corresponding cases compared to those of k fields besides the correlation lengths in ss fields are larger than those of k fields this is consistent with the results that ss fields are smoother and reproducible than k fields 4 5 model validation results to further evaluate the reproducibility of different cases the estimated k and ss fields are used to predict the drawdown data of two independent pumping tests results in terms of matches between predicted drawdown and observed drawdown are another indicator of reproducibility the independent pumping tests here refer to those tests whose head data are not included in model calibration specifically test 4 of 2019 and 2020 ht tests are treated as independent pumping tests and used for model validation in this study two validation methods are used namely self validation and cross validation 4 5 1 self validation results self validation refers to the use of estimated k and ss fields from 2019 and 2020 ht analyses with tests 1 3 to predict the drawdowns of 2019 and 2020 ht test 4 scatter plots that compare simulated versus observed drawdowns of 2019 and 2020 ht test 4 for self validation are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively with data from different observation wells marked with different symbols and colors the drawdown versus time curves of each case of 2019 and 2020 ht analyses for self validation are shown in figs s10 and s11 in the si section examination of figs 12 and 13 reveals that overall 2020 ht estimates exhibit better predictions while more biases are evident in 2019 ht estimates in terms of the linear model fit of simulated and observed drawdowns that is most biased predictions of 2019 ht test 4 occurred in wells c1 5 and c2 such biased predictions indicate that while k and ss fields from 2019 and 2020 ht surveys show similar overall heterogeneity patterns the fine scale differences of parameter fields could lead to significantly different drawdown predictions at some observation points when comparing cases with different data density cases a fig 12a d g and a series fig 13a d g yield the best fit of simulated versus observed drawdown however the drawdown fit results deteriorate with decreasing data density with the head misfit being largest for cases c fig 12c f i and c series fig 13c f i this indicates that with higher density of hydraulic head data that are distributed evenly in the targeted investigation area the ht estimates have more ability to predict drawdowns of independent pumping tests which suggest that higher data density leads to improvements to reproducibility of ht estimates in figs s10 and s11 drawdown predictions of all these nine cases with different prior geological information and data density are plotted versus time for both 2019 and 2020 ht test 4 through the visual examination of match quality between the simulated and observed curves we find that the predictions from cases 2 and 3 series which start from 4 and 10 layer prior geological models respectively capture the observed drawdown for most observation intervals in contrast poor matches are found between simulated drawdowns of homogeneous initial guess solid dashed dash dot blues curves and observed drawdowns solid black dots figs s10 and s11 besides compared with cases a and a series included data from 10 observation wells and b and b included data from 4 observation wells cases c and c series generally generate simulated drawdowns that are closer to observed drawdown curves 4 5 2 cross validation results in addition to self validation of these cases cross validations are conducted in which the estimated k and ss fields from 2019 tht analyses are used to predict the observed drawdowns induced by the independent 2020 ht test 4 similarly the estimated k and ss fields from 2020 ht analyses are used to predict the observed drawdowns from 2019 ht test 4 the scatter plots that compared simulated versus observed drawdown of 2019 and 2020 ht test 4 for cross validation are shown in figs 14 and 15 the drawdown versus time curves of each case for cross validation are shown in figs s12 and s13 in the si section examination of figs 14 and 15 reveals that similar results are displayed for cross validation in terms of the linear fit of observed and simulated drawdowns that is cases with higher data density performed better than those with lower data density and the homogeneous initial guess model exhibited more biases compared to the cases with prior geological zonation models in general the examination of self validation and cross validation results reveals that when a higher density of head data are included in the inverse model a higher level of reproducibility is observed moreover providing prior geological information to the inverse model helps to improve the reproducibility of results compared with providing a uniform parameter distribution to the inverse model however utilization of a 10 layer geological model did not improve the linear fit of cross validation results in contrast the 4 layer geological model showed better overall linear fits than those of the 10 layer model this may be attributed to the accuracy of the constructed geological model with limited number of borehole logs it is acknowledged that in this study the 4 layer and 10 layer geological models are constructed with two borehole logs collected at the narashino site thus the better linear fit of 4 layer model compared to that of 10 layer model suggests that when there is lack of borehole logs for accurate geological model construction using a simplified geological model as prior information might be a better choice in comparison to the utilization of a complex geological model with unknown errors comparison of simulated versus observed drawdown for both self and cross validation as shown in figs s10 s13 indicates that the misfits observed from cross validation are much larger than those from self validation which illustrates that minor differences in heterogeneity distributions of the two estimated fields can lead to noticeable differences in drawdown behaviors from these two fields moreover for both self and cross validation the 2020 ht analyses shown in figs 13 and 15 produced better drawdown fits than 2019 ht analyses shown in figs 12 and 14 one possible reason may be a relatively simpler flow condition during the 2020 ht tests as the cut off walls were removed during 2020 ht tests this has led to groundwater flow occurring mainly in the horizontal direction whereas the impermeable cut off walls rendered the flow to be considerably more complex which may have contributed to difficulties in inverse modeling 4 6 cross correlation analyses results of 2019 and 2020 ht tests in this study reproducibility assessment of ht estimates from 2019 and 2020 ht tests involves the use of datasets collected under identical well configurations including the same pumping and observation locations in addition pumping rates and their durations are similar for various pumping tests conducted in 2019 and 2020 this can lead to a concern that identical well configurations including its pumping and observation locations for both 2019 and 2020 ht tests will lead to highly reproducible ht estimates that may be considered a trivial result however for this study it is important to keep in mind that the presence of cut off walls during the 2019 ht tests and its removal during the 2020 ht tests have significantly impacted groundwater flow within the investigated volume therefore to further validate the reproducibility of parameter fields from ht analyses we investigated the information content of a given drawdown curve from the same observation port e g well a3 with pumping taking place at the same location e g well a5 for both 2019 and 2020 ht tests as the flow regime is significantly different from 2019 and 2020 we anticipate that the information content will also be quite different to gain additional insight into the relationship between observed heads and the estimated k and ss fields during a pumping test one can rely on cross correlation analyses in particular cross correlation analysis is a weighted sensitivity analysis which determines the relative impact of each parameter with respect to others in time and space and reveal the information content in drawdown data on heterogeneity mao et al 2013 in the ssle algorithm cross correlation analyses consider the variance of parameter and its spatial structure i e covariance function and correlation lengths we briefly introduce the calculation of cross correlation between heads and estimated parameters below while a detailed description and derivation of the cross correlation and its computations can be found in yeh and zhang 1996 mao et al 2013a mao et al 2013b and wen et al 2020 the cross correlations matrix between head at x i t and estimated parameters are calculated in ssle mao et al 2013a mao et al 2013b as 4 ρ hf t r hf t σ h 2 x i t σ f 2 j hf t r ff σ h 2 x i t σ f 2 5 ρ hs t r hs t σ h 2 x i t σ s 2 j hs t r ss σ h 2 x i t σ s 2 where ρ hf t and ρ hs t are the cross correlation matrices between head h and k and ss at time t respectively r hf t and r hs t are cross covariance matrices between h and k as well as between h and ss at time t respectively σ h 2 x i t is the head variance which represents head uncertainty at x i t x i is the observation location σ f 2 and σ s 2 are variances of perturbations of lnk and lnss j hf t and j hs t are jacobian matrices r ff and r ss are covariance matrixes describing the spatial statistics of parameter perturbations k and ss respectively in this study the estimated k and ss fields of cases a and a series which has the highest data density were used to analyze the cross correlation with observed head collected at 13 mbgs from well a3 during test 1 which involved pumping at well a5 for both 2019 and 2020 by comparing the cross correlation between heads and k as well as between heads and ss one can further investigate the validity of reproducibility of ht estimates from 2019 and 2020 specifically if the spatial distribution of cross correlation between heads and k and between heads and ss are different respectively for two tests conducted at different time periods but with the same well configuration we can conclude that the measured drawdowns of each test contain different information about the heterogeneity even with the same well configuration furthermore we can conclude that the ht estimated parameter fields are reproducible and reflects the robustness of ht analyses moreover we can conclude that well configuration has negligible impacts on reproducibility otherwise the spatial distributions of cross correlation between heads and k and between heads and ss from the pumping test conducted in 2019 would be the same as those from 2020 4 6 1 cross correlation between heads and k cross sections of cross correlations between heads at 13 mbgs in well a3 while pumping at well a5 and the k fields from cases 1a and 1a 2a and 2a as well as 3a and 3a are illustrated in figs 16 s14 and s15 respectively in each figure snapshots of cross correlations are provided for early 10 min intermediate 50 min and late 1 400 min time periods of a pumping test the selected cross section y 12 m cuts though the observation points in well a3 and pumping well a5 in addition to the computed cross correlations flow lines and drawdown contours are also included in figs 16 s14 and s15 the three contour lines plot the drawdowns of 0 13 0 27 and 0 40 m in the direction that approaches the pumped interval at well a5 it should be noted that since the aim of this analyses is to compare the spatial distribution of the cross correlation between the observation head and estimated parameters we focus on differences in cross correlation distributions between 2019 and 2020 examination of the flow patterns of cases 1a and 1a shown in figs 16 and 17 reveals that despite the use of the same well configuration for 2019 and 2020 ht tests due to the presence of cut off walls flow lines and drawdown distributions of 2019 case 1a and 2020 case 1a are markedly different for early 10 min intermediate 50 min and late times 1 400 min respectively during 2019 ht test 1 groundwater flows into the inner part of the site beneath the cut off walls and then moves upwards towards the pumping well moreover the cone of depression gradually propagates from the pumping well to adjacent areas while it is confined within the cut off walls for the entire pumping period fig 16a c however when the cut off walls were removed prior to 2020 ht tests groundwater beyond the cut off walls can flow directly into the inner part and groundwater flow takes place spherically radially in the 2d cross section toward the pumping well at early and intermediate times fig 16d and 16e as pumping takes place over a long time and the corresponding head distribution approaches late time groundwater flow becomes nearly horizontal with the cone of depression propagating outward to the area that was previously confined by the cut off walls fig 16f this difference is also observed in groundwater flow patterns for cases 2a versus 2a shown in figs s14 and s16 and cases 3a versus 3a shown in figs s15 and s17 examination of fig 16a reveals that during early time there are two zones with higher positive cross correlation at z 8 and 14 m while a higher negative cross correlation zone is sandwiched in between however with the increase in pumping duration the higher positive cross correlation zone at the top z 14 m as well as the negative cross correlation zone beneath it gradually diminishes and become less cross correlated while the higher positive cross correlation zone at z 8 m becomes more significant moreover it should be noted that these zones are extended beyond the cut off walls this is due to the fact that there are no observation points outside the cut off walls it is acknowledged that the cross correlation is calculated using the head and parameters at the observation location without the information from outside the cut off walls the distribution of cross correlation tends to be smooth the spatial distributions of cross correlation between the heads and k of 2019 cases 1a 2a and 3a for three different times are significantly different from those of 2020 cases 1a 2a 3a for corresponding cases and times specifically for the spatial pattern of cross correlation between the heads and k of 2020 case 1a heads are positively and highly cross correlated with k only within a single horizontally elongated zone around z 15 m at t 10 min fig 16d moreover a comparison of fig 16d e and f reveals that the head is highly correlated with k at early 10 min and late time 1 400 min while during intermediate time 50 min head is less correlated with k which is similar to those found by mao et al 2013 and sun et al 2013 through synthetic simulations comparison of cross correlation between the heads and k between cases 2a and 2a as well as cases 3a and 3a reveals significant differences which is similar to differences observed between cases 1a and 1a 4 6 2 cross correlation between heads and ss the cross correlation between heads at 13 mbgs in well a3 and the ss fields from cases 1a and 1a 2a and 2a as well as 3a and 3a are shown in figs 17 s16 and s17 respectively for early 10 min intermediate 50 min and late 1 400 min times for the same cross section at y 12 m selected in figs 16 s14 and s15 the flow lines and drawdown contours in figs 17 s16 and s17 are the same as those shown in figs 16 s14 and s15 for the corresponding time respectively examination of the cross correlation between heads and ss from 2019 case 1a reveals that there is a positively correlated zone that exists in the central area located around z 15 m at early 10 min fig 17a and intermediate times 50 min fig 17b of the pumping test in general with an increase in pumping duration cross correlation values between observed heads and ss gradually decrease over the entire field especially in the ds1 and ds2 layers in particular fig 17c shows that the cross correlation values diminish to nearly zero for ds1 and ds2 layers during the late time period moreover the high correlated zones that extend outside the cut off walls shown in fig 17a c are also due to the lack of observations outside the cut off wall as discussed in section 4 6 1 compared to the significant differences in the distribution of cross correlation between the observed heads and k the spatial patterns of cross correlation values between observed heads and ss are more similar between 2019 case 1a and 2020 case 1a as shown in fig 17d e and f head exhibits higher positive correlation at early 10 min and intermediate 50 min times while cross correlation values diminish to nearly zero at late time of the pumping tests for 2020 case 1a however it should be noted that differences still exist between the cross correlation fields of 2019 case a series and 2020 case a series besides at late time 1 400 min head is less correlated with ss in ds1 layer for the 2020 case a series fig 17f s16f and s17f compared with those of 2019 case a series even though for both 2019 and 2020 cases cross correlation between the observed heads and ss is almost nonexistent which agrees with mao et al 2013 and sun et al 2013 4 6 3 evaluation of cross correlation analyses results as discussed in previous sections comparisons of spatial distributions of cross correlations between head and k or ss fields for early intermediate and late times reveal significant differences in cross correlation between the observed heads and k fields and noticeable discrepancies between observed heads and ss fields from 2019 case a and 2020 case a series ht analyses these all suggest that the heterogeneity information contained in the head data collected from 2019 ht test 1 are different from that of 2020 ht test 1 even with usage of the same well configuration for 2019 and 2020 ht tests the different heterogeneity information contained in 2019 and 2020 ht test 1 further strengthens the notion of reproducibility in ht estimates that is similar k and ss fields are obtained for 2019 and 2020 ht analyses even though different heterogeneity information is contained in 2019 and 2020 ht tests used for inverse modeling besides differences in spatial distributions of cross correlations between head and parameter fields are evidence that the reproducibility is not caused by the effect of same well configuration otherwise if well configuration is the only reason that leads to the reproducibility of ht estimates cross correlation fields of 2019 a series and 2020 a series cases should be similar aside of differences in forcing functions moreover it is worth noting that similar spatial distribution patterns of cross correlation between heads and k and between heads and ss were observed when comparing the cross correlation results from the same year e g 2019 case 1a vs 2019 case 2a vs 2019 case 3a 2020 case 1a vs 2020 case 2a vs 2020 case 3a this suggests that the initial guesses of the inverse models have negligible impacts on spatial distributions of cross correlations between observed heads and k as well as ss this is reasonable and can be explained by the same flow regime of different cases in the same year specifically taking 2019 cases 1a 2a and 3a as an example even though the prior model used for inverse modeling is different the estimated fields for both k and ss were similar with the same data density besides the same test test 1 pumping at well a5 used for cross correlation analyses leads to identical flow regime thus with an identical flow regime and similar parameter fields it is reasonable to have similar spatial patterns of cross correlation between heads and k and between heads and ss 5 summary and conclusions in this study we investigated the reproducibility of k and ss fields using ht test data collected in 2019 and 2020 at a field site underlain by sedimentary units in japan cut off walls encompassed the wellfield utilized for ht survey during 2019 while the walls were removed during the 2020 ht survey resulting in significant differences to groundwater flow patterns the reproducibility of estimated k and ss fields obtained with pumping tests conducted under varying groundwater flow patterns various data density and the resolution of prior geological information included was examined though visual examination of estimated k and ss fields residual variance maps geostatistical parameters linear fit of observed and simulated drawdowns drawdown curve fits and cross correlation between head and parameter fields transient hydraulic data from three pumping tests were used to conduct model calibration and transient data from one independent pumping test were used for model validation for both 2019 and 2020 ht analyses in total 18 different ht analyses cases with different model complexities in terms of data density and prior geological information were completed and discussed through these cases three data density and three prior geological information scenarios were tested to investigate practical issues related to reproducibility our studies resulted in the following major findings and conclusions 1 the estimated k and ss tomograms for 2019 and 2020 ht tests exhibited reproducibility in the overall heterogeneity patterns for corresponding cases thus ht can be repeated at a given site to monitor variations in k and ss over time if forcing functions i e initial and boundary conditions as well as source and sink terms are properly accounted for from one period to the next however fine scale discrepancies that may induce different drawdown predictions still existed in ht estimates obtained from 2019 and 2020 ht tests thus improving the resolution and accuracy of individual ht analyses should help in improving the reproducibility of ht estimates 2 through the geostatistical analyses of estimated k and ss fields from 2019 and 2020 ht analyses we find that the geometric means and variances are similar this suggests that estimated fields from ht analyses are reproducible geostatistically moreover correlation lengths of ss fields are larger with smaller relative differences between 2019 and 2020 ht analyses compared with those from the k fields this suggest that ss fields are smoother and easier to reproduce than k fields 3 data density showed noticeable influences on reproducibility of ht estimates namely k and ss when increasing the data density by including more evenly distributed head data into inverse models ht estimates exhibited higher level of reproducibility and prediction capability in terms of obtaining better linear fits of observed and simulated data 4 as expected the use of an accurate geological zonation model as an initial guess led to a higher level of reproducibility than the homogeneous initial guess under the same data density this suggests that with limited or fixed number of head data available including accurate geological information as an initial guess of ht analyses can provide more constraints to inverse modeling which is beneficial for obtaining reliable and reproducible estimates 5 although the use of a geological model as initial guess performed better than the homogeneous initial guess the 10 layer geological model cases did not yield significantly improve reproducibility compared to the 4 layer geological model cases this might be explained by the lack of detailed lithological information at various locations there are only two borehole logs collected at the narashino site thus the geological zonation was simplified as horizontal layers in this study this might induce errors to the stratigraphy and geological model input to ht thus leading to biased ht results and head predictions 6 differences in spatial distributions of cross correlations between head and k as well as between head and ss for the 2019 and 2020 ht tests indicate that head data from each year carry different heterogeneity information which strengthens the notion of reproducibility of k and ss estimates from ht analysis besides differences in cross correlation distributions between head and parameter fields are evidence that reproducibility is not caused by utilizing the same well configuration instead the use of pumping tests conducted at different locations and their joint interpretation with geostatistical inversion algorithms such as ssle and simsle results in parameter estimates that limit the impact caused by scenario dependence resulting in parameter estimates that are reproducible 7 overall this research shows that k and ss heterogeneity distributions mapped with ht analyses of tests conducted in 2019 and 2020 under different groundwater flow conditions are reproducible of course some discrepancies are noted between the parameter distributions from the two periods but the overall correspondence is reasonable based on different approaches used for the assessment these results suggest that ht has the potential for mapping changes to k and ss heterogeneity over time broadening its future applications to various practical problems credit authorship contribution statement zeren ning
