introduction traditionally maize zea mays l crops in the most productive agricultural region of argentina i e the rolling pampas hall et al 1992 were sown during early spring september october otegui et al 1995a 1996 this region is characterized by a humid temperate climate and a long frost free period hence long growing seasons of early sowings provide high yields of rainfed crops however in recent years maize production has been widely adopted outside this traditional area i e towards arid and semi arid regions where late sowings stabilize maize yields across years and environments florio et al 2014 the causes of the reduction of yield variability for late sown crops relate to fewer climatic constraints such as low soil temperatures during seedling emergence and drought or heat stress during maize reproductive periods maddonni 2012 therefore although for these newest scenarios potential yields evans and fischer 1999 are lowering due to adoption of late sown crops actual farm yields van ittersum et al 2013 may be higher when faced with climatic and edaphic limitations in the southern pampas of argentina low rainfall and shallow soils generate low water availability during the growing season which is the major constraint for rainfed maize grain yield otegui et al 1995b sadras and calviño 2001 calviño et al 2003 in the most arid region of the southern pampas the southwestern pampas swp fig 1 high inter annual variation of solar radiation mean temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speeds modulate the effect of rainfall on water availability pascale and damario 2004 this region has a cold temperate climate with a slightly summer dominant rainfall pattern and high inter annual variability of precipitations penalba and vargas 2004 with mean annual rainfall values isohyets between 800 mm year 1 in the east to less than 600 mm year 1 in the west sadras and hall 1989 pascale and damario 2004 main soils are typic argiudolls typic haplustolls and

suero 1994 maximum soil available water is highly variable due to the presence of a widespread caliche layer that limits effective soil depth salazar lea plaza et al 1989 sadras and calviño 2001 pazos and mestelan 2002 historically agricultural land was destined to perennial pastures used for livestock grazing viglizzo and roberto 1998 paruelo et al 2006 during the last two decades grain crops were increasingly introduced with wheat as main winter crop and sunflower as dominant summer crop sadras and calviño 2001 soybean yields are highly limited due to sub optimal thermo photoperiodic conditions during most of the growing season kantolic and slafer 2001 maize was generally restricted to the most productive soils i e deep soils due to its high relative sensitivity to soil and water limitations when managed with traditional agronomical practices sadras and calviño 2001 calviño et al 2003 monzón et al 2018 recent on field work was aimed to better understand the adaptation of maize to limited growing conditions in the southern pampas region e g low water availability due to shallow soils by optimizing management practices such as sowing date and plant population density ppd cerrudo et al 2013b the evaluation of agricultural practices and crop behavior across a certain region can be done with the assistance of crop simulation models these models are programs that use mathematical equations to reproduce the growth and development of different crops depending on soil characteristics climate and crop husbandry boote et al 1996 hoogenboom et al 2004 phenology and soil water balance are some of the outputs of crop simulation models jones et al 2003 based on the capacity to evaluate the impact of many variables on crop production these models have a widespread use sadler et al 1999 despite of generally not being able to include the negative impact of biotic stresses i e weeds pests and diseases one of the main advantages of the use of crop simulation models is the ability to provide a probabilistic approach to simulated outputs e g giménez et al 2018 in order to meet this objective the models work with time series of climate data which comprise the existing inter annual variability of meteorological conditions in a given location outputs can be associated with a characterization of years based on published information of the different phases of the el niño southern oscillation enso phenomenon the enso phenomenon influences most of argentina s crop area enso warm oceanic phase el niño accompanies high air surface pressure while the cold oceanic phase la niña accompanies low air surface pressure climate prediction centre www cpc ncep noaa gov an increase in spring summer rainfalls and in many regions higher summer crops yields reflect el niño phase while the opposite occurs with la niña phase podestá et al 1999 iizumi et al 2014 associations between enso phases rainfalls and maize yields were strong for early sowing dates in several regions of argentina podestá et al 2002 bert et al 2006 fernández long et al 2011 giménez et al 2018 in the eastern southern pampas simulations of earlier sowing dates of rainfed maize crops september out yielded later sowing dates october in el niño and neutral phases while in la niña phases yield differences between sowing dates disappeared monzón et al 2012 however monzón et al 2012 did not found these associations in the western departments of the southern pampas that comprise the swp furthermore the method used to simulate potential evapotranspiration etc was the one proposed by priestley and taylor 1972 which does not take into account certain variables with high impact in the swp such as wind speed and dew point temperature one method that does take these into account and generates a better adjusted simulation of etc is penman monteith s modified by fao fao56 allen et al 1998 a better understanding of the particular crop water economy processes affected by the enso phenomenon between early and late sowing dates in the swp could provide tools to aid the agronomical decision making of farmers and technical advisors as a crucial crop management decision ppd has a strong influence on maize grain yield tetio kagho and gardner 1988 tokatlidis and kotroubas 2004 van roekel and coulter 2011 but grain yield ppd relationship is highly variable assefa et al 2016 and modulated by environmental conditions andrade et al 2002 ogola et al 2013 while the commonly found relationship is parabolic with an optimum ppd range that maximizes yield in low water availability environments the response is negative and optimum ppd is relatively low haarhoff and swanepoel 2018 low ppd may stabilize inter annual variability of maize yield in regions with high uncertainty of rainfalls tokatlidis et al 2015 due to a better physiological state of plants during more drought sensitive reproductive periods denmead and shaw 1960 cakir 2004 even in dry years higher ppds may maximize crop transpiration jiang et al 2014 but maize morpho physiological characteristics could generate reproductive partitioning restrictions for those suppressed individuals of the stand with very low plant transpiration and biomass accumulation leading to extremely low crop yields vega et al 2001a b probabilistic studies that analyze the effect of ppd on maize crop water economy in a semi arid region by means of historical climatic data and the enso phases are inexistent due to the recent changes in maize crop production systems in the swp region this kind of analysis would result of special interest the objective of this work was to provide an agro climatic and eco physiological framework of cultural changes that occurred in the maize cropping systems of the swp and the main implications of the climatic and edaphic constraints on crop management decisions the work combined i public data of regional maize cultivated area for the period 2008 2015 alongside with farmers

public data acquisition and farmer inquiries for each department maize area in the swp from 2008 to 2015 was obtained from the secretary of government of agroindustry of argentina https datos agroindustria gob ar and a linear regression was fitted to the relationship between maize area and year the slope value of fitted function quantified the change trend of annual variation of maize area for the period under study information of the evolution of ppd and sowing dates was obtained through inquiries to swp farmers belonging to grupo experimental agrícola del sudoeste agricultural experimental group of the southwest geaso https www creasudoeste org geaso1 geaso farmers meet on a monthly basis to share information on agronomic and economic performance of their enterprises in order to improve their decision making a technical manager who also provides agronomical advice to farmers based on experimental results organizes geaso meetings geaso farmers are distributed in all the departments of the swp and their total summer grain crops land sums ca 33000 ha during the 2008 2015 period total maize area of geaso represented between 5 and 10 of the total maize area of the swp providing a robust sample of the regional management practices used in maize crops for every year of the 2008 2015 period each of the geaso farmers noted the ppd of each maize sown field the mean annual ppd sown in maize fields was calculated and a linear regression was fitted to the relationship between ppd and year the slope value of the fitted function quantified the change trend of annual variation of maize ppd for the period under study for each year sowing dates were also noted and ranked in increasing order and expressed as cumulative frequencies median sowing date in the first 2008 and last year 2015 of the period under study was compared 2 3 experimental analysis 2 3 1 field experiments geaso technical management group fig 1 generated experimental data from on field experiments using machinery provided by farmers twenty three different intermediate cycle maize hybrids were sown under no till in different sowing dates early october and late november and a broad range of ppd from 2 to 8 plants m 2 in most cases the previous crop was soybean and in the other ones it was sunflower followed by a fallow period of approximately six months for early maize sowings and seven and a half months for late maize sowings in order to generate environmental variability thirteen different experiments were carried out during six growing seasons in different sites fig 1 not every site nor every genotype was represented in every growing season sites differed in soil depth and in most cases experiments were sown in contrasting soil depth sectors within each site shallow soils 40 cm to 60 cm deep soils more than 100 cm adversities weeds pests and diseases were effectively controlled following the common regional practices chemical and mechanical controls when crops reached physiological maturity ears from plants in a 10 m 2 area in each plot were harvested and threshed by hand grains were dried to constant weight and weighted grain yield was then corrected to 14 humidity 2 3 2 field experiments data analysis first in order to evaluate the average responses across contrasting soil depth and sowing date in a regional scale grain yield was analyzed using linear mixed effects models zuur et al 2009 sites were considered random effects blocks with soil depth and sowing date nested within blocks growing season genotypes and densities were included as random effects factors as their mean effect were not of interest for this analysis considering that each site carried out yield trials in different paddocks every growing season years were not considered repeated measures model fit was improved by including variances heterogeneity for soil and sowing treatments i e varident zuur et al 2009 and autocorrelation for trials within sites i e corarma zuur et al 2009 selection of variance and autocorrelation structure was performed throughout minimal akaike information criterion and likelihood ratio test following zuur et al 2009 analyses were carried out using nlme package function lme pinheiro et al 2018 and tests were performed through car package function anova fox and weisberg 2011 these analyses were performed using r r core team 2018 second maize crop behavior was analyzed by the mean and coefficient of variation cv of grain yield sowing date effect on grain yield was evaluated by the cumulative frequency distribution of grain yield values across all plots of all experiments for early and late sowing dates additionally yield values obtained in each sowing date were grouped in grain yield ranges in order to evaluate their respective frequency distributions furthermore an evaluation of the comparative behavior between early and late sown crops was carried out by a regression analysis fitted to grain yield difference of late and early crops gylate early vs grain yield of early crops gyearly at each case in which the same genotype was sown in the same ppd in early and late sowing dates for each environment combination of site year and sowing date optimum ppd oppd of each genotype was calculated using the methodology of hernández et al 2014 briefly eq 1 was used to estimate oppd the parameter b of the equation is the slope of a linear regression eq 2 a linear regression model was fit for each replicate in each experiment to relate natural logarithm of individual plant yield ln y with stand density duncan 1958 considering that universally ln y decreases with plant density 1 oppd 1 2 303 x b 2 ln y a b x in a similar way as with grain yield mean values of oppd obtained for hybrids at each site and sowing date were grouped in oppd ranges to evaluate the frequency distribution of oppd of early and late crops the comparative behavior of oppd between sowing dates was also evaluated by the regression fitted to the difference of oppd between sowings oppdlate early at each site vs oppd at early sowing oppdearly 2 4 simulations 2 4 1 location characteristics different productive strategies were

the fallow period started with 0 available water in the whole soil profile all determinations were set according to the typical available soil water content at the average physiological maturity date of soybean the main antecessor of maize crop in the region 2 4 3 simulations data analysis in the different locations and sowing dates inter annual variability of the different crop stages was described by their mean occurrence date and the standard deviation in days while inter annual variability of accumulated rainfall during the whole crop cycle rainfall ve r6 was described by its mean

frequency of estimated values the same procedure was carried out for comparing inter annual variability of es etacycle tc and tp in the different locations soil depths and ppd the 25th percentile p25 50th percentile p50 and 75th percentile p75 values were used for comparisons among conditions cate nelson graphical analysis cate and nelson 1971 was carried out to analyze the relationship between wdcp and total rainfalls mm during the same period rainfall r1 r2 for every combination of location soil depth and sowing date this analysis was commonly used for soil test calibration to divide bivariate data into two groups one where a change in the x variable is likely to correspond to a change in the y variable and the other group where a change in x is unlikely to correspond to a change in y when applied to this work the test allows recognizing a critical value in the y axis that describes the lowest possible level of wdcp obtained in every simulation scenario in addition a critical value in the x axis may also be recognized which determines the threshold necessary rainfall r1 r2 amount to attain that lowest possible level of wdcp the impact of the different phases of the enso phenomenon on rainfall ve r6 rainfall r1 r2 etar1 r6 etacycle and tp in every simulation scenario was also determined each year of the historical series of each location was classified as la niña neutral or el niño based on the events of temperature in the tropical pacific ocean events were defined as five consecutive overlapping three month periods at or above the 0 5 c anomaly for warm el

mean effect of management strategies enso phases and their interactions on crop water economy was evaluated using linear mixed effects models zuur et al 2009 first for the sowing date x soil depth management strategies model fixed effects included location enso phase sowing date and soil depth the random structure of the model included soil depth nested within enso phase enso nested within location and location nested within simulation year this structure considered the nested nature of the factors considered the simulated year were considered random blocks because each simulation was statistically independent each simulation started from the same initial conditions every year and was not dependent on the conditions of the previous year enso phase was nested within location as enso could have different effects in each location fernández long et al 2011 second for the ppd x soil depth management strategies model fixed effects terms included location enso phase ppd and soil depth similarly to the previous model the random structure included soil depth nested in enso phase enso nested in location and location nested in simulation year for both linear mixed effects model types i e sowing date x soil depth and ppd x soil depth variance heterogeneity was adjusted first and then the minimal fixed structure was selected top down strategy zuur et al 2009 on the one hand model fit was improved by including variances heterogeneity for treatments i e varident zuur et al 2009 the best variance structure selection was performed throughout minimal akaike information criterion and likelihood ratio test following zuur et al 2009 on the other the model was reduced trough stepwise selection by aic stepaic function in mass package venables and ripley 2002 for model selection procedure ml estimation was used instead of reml zuur et al 2009 and final model was adjusted with reml analyses were carried out using nlme package function lme pinheiro et al 2018 and tests were

ca 3500 kg ha 1 and ca 9000 kg ha 1 while late sowing dates resembled a normal distribution with a mean of ca 7500 kg ha 1 when taking into account only the experiments that included both sowing dates higher grain yields were obtained in late sown crops in those sites where grain yields of early sown crops were lower than 8500 kg ha 1 fig 2 right the frequency distribution of oppd of early sowing

nevertheless for both soil depths the threshold amount of rainfall r1 r2 needed to reduce wdcp to these minimum values was ca 40 mm and 55 mm for early and late sowings respectively in coronel suárez fig 5 middle both the minimum level of wdcp and the threshold amount of rainfall r1 r2 were similar between sowing dates and slightly differed between soil depths ca 8 mm and 35 mm for deep soils and ca 18 mm and 40 mm for shallow soils for the minimum wdcp and threshold amount of rainfall r1 r2 respectively in bordenave fig 5 bottom the minimum wdcp was higher absolute value for early 40 mm in shallow and 20 mm in deep soils than for late crops 18 mm in shallow and 7 mm in deep soils threshold amount of rainfall r1 r2 was higher for late ca 50 mm and 80 mm in shallow and deep soils respectively than for early crops ca 35 mm and 40 mm in shallow and deep soils respectively 3 3 2 ppd x soil depth effects in late sown crops in late sowing dates etacycle was similar among ppds in almost every location and soil depth table 7 this trend was not sustained in coronel suárez in deep soils frequency 0 50 where etacycle was higher at higher ppds in all locations es etacycle was higher at 2 plants m 2 ca 0 53 in shallow and ca 0 42 in deep soils intermediate at 4 plants m 2 ca 0 45 in shallow and ca 0 35 in deep soils and lower at 6 plants m 2 ca 0 40 in shallow and ca 0 30 in deep soils table 7 tc during the cycle increased with ppd and soil depth fig 6 the higher differences of tc among ppds were simulated for crops in coronel suárez and the lower ones for crops in bordenave at all locations differences among ppd magnified for high tc values i e the uppermost 25th percentile location affected tp depending on soil depth chi2 2 34 33 p 0 001 the highest tp values were simulated in deep soils in coronel suárez the lowest ones in shallow soils in barrow and bordenave while intermediate values were simulated for the other conditions increasing ppd reduced tp depending on soil depth chi2 1 26 74 p 0 001 fig 7 for instance at 2 pl m 2 transpiration was 32 mm pl 1 higher for deep respect to shallow soils i e 112 vs 80 mm pl 1 this difference was 15 mm pl 1 at 6 pl m 2 i e 48 vs 33 mm pl 1 from a probabilistic approach for the 25th percentile tp at 6 plants m 2 never surpassed 51 mm plant 1 coronel suárez deep soil and was as low as 21 mm plant 1 barrow and bordenave shallow soils at 4 plants m 2 these extreme values were 74 mm plant 1 coronel suárez deep soil and 30 mm plant 1 barrow and bordenave shallow soils finally enso phase effect on tp varied with soil depth chi2 2 26 33 p 0 001 only between extreme conditions deep soils under el niño year shallow soils under la niña year therefore in a field within a given combination of location x soil depth no differences of tp were simulated among enso phases 4 discussion farmers should tailor crop management to each environment to attain maximum productivity and lower failure probability hatfield and walthall 2015 this is particularly important in a semi arid region with both climatic and edaphic constraints were maize crop has recently expanded without a profound knowledge of the more suitable cultural practices this work addressed the expansion of maize production in the swp the main constraints for this crop and their implications on crop management by the means of combined data describing regional changes in cultivated area and management practices on field experimental data and the use of a crop simulation model it was possible to provide an agro climatic and eco physiologically based explanation of the occurred changes in crop management mainly sowing date and ppd following results of inquiries to regional farmers between 2008 and 2015 a one month delay of the sowing date from early to mid spring season and 50 decrease of ppd from ca 7 to 4 pl m 2 accompanied a five fold expansion of maize crop area in the swp based on regional public data of annual maize area in the southern pampas region traditional maize sowings at high ppd during early spring assured maximum light interception and high incident radiation during the critical period for kernel set aiming to maximize grain yields of rainfed maize crops cirilo and andrade 1994 otegui 1995a hence behavior of farmers at the western sites of this region swp appears not to meet these criteria although actual grain yields above 9000 kg ha 1 have a higher frequency at early 0 30 than at late sowing dates 0 10 late sown crops had the highest mean ca 7500 kg ha 1 and the lowest variability of yields table 3 and fig 2 moreover the bimodal distribution of grain yields in early sowing dates with large frequencies of grain yields below 6000 kg ha 1 0 40 and 4000 kg ha 1 ca 0 30 showed a more unpredictable behavior of maize crops under this management in the swp the analysis of this database of grain yields oppose those simulated by monzón et al 2012 in the southern pampas where early sowing dates out yielded late sowing dates however monzón et al 2012 did not explore sowing dates later than october 31st meaning that simulations only comprised earlier sowing dates consequently field based findings support the shift of sowing dates across the swp region and indicate that farmers resigned potential yield evans and fischer 1999 to achieve higher and more stable actual farm yields van ittersum et al 2013 the main constraint for maize production in the southern pampas is the low water availability during the growing season otegui et al 1995b sadras and calviño 2001 calviño et al 2003 therefore it was relevant to understand effectively the regional management changes of maize crops i e the delay of sowing date and the decrease of ppd within a crop water economy framework with a probabilistic approach simulations with ceres maize model showed that etacycle was similar for both sowing dates table 5 but the delay of sowing increased etar1 r6 etacycle with a higher magnitude order in the most arid environments fig 4 this effect could be related to the relatively shorter pre flowering period ca 82 vs 74 days for early and late sowing date respectively and the larger grain filling period ca 43 vs 48 days for early and late sowing date respectively influenced by higher temperatures during vegetative phases i e mid summer and lower temperatures during reproductive phases i e late summer and early autumn otegui et al 1995a maddonni 2012 another important result was the extremely low water availability simulated during the critical period and grain filling period of early sown crops table 5 wdcp may affect not only kernel number hall et al 1982 otegui et al 1995b cagnola et al 2018 but also potential kernel weight due to lower assimilates availability per kernel gambín et al 2006 2008 interestingly the relationships between simulated wdcp and rainfalls during that short timespan r1 to r2 11 days shown in fig 5 suggest that late sown maize crops may be exposed to less stressful conditions than early sown crops when adequate amount of rainfalls occurs immediately before female flowering atmospheric demand combined with soil characteristics determined these relationships jaafar et al 1978 ritchie 1981 ritchie and johnson 1990 thus in deeper soils lower wdcp were simulated with similar threshold amount of rainfalls than in shallow soils in both sowing dates which suggests that maize crops in shallow soils have limited capacity to uptake water and every extra cm of soil depth adds mm of water to crop demand this is of high relevancy in a region of high spatial variability of soil depth due to caliche layer presence such as the swp salazar lea plaza et al 1989 hall et al 1992 travasso and suero 1994 the high variability of wdcp values for rainfall levels below the threshold obtained with cate nelson analysis fig 5 indicates that for low immediate rainfalls wdcp might be unpredictable in this region further studies on the effect of atmospheric events rainfalls or cloudy days lowering atmospheric demand around flowering might clarify these relationships excessive wdgf during subsequent days of the grain filling period could interrupt maize kernel growth saini and westgate 1999 barnabás et al 2008 leading to lighter kernels and grain yield reductions hall et al 1981 nesmith and ritchie 1992 hence the less restrictive wdgf of late crops table 5 could counterbalance the declining photo thermal conditions during the same period in high latitudes such as the ones in the swp grain filling period of late crops is exposed to lower temperature levels and declining daily solar radiation otegui et al 1995a these photo thermal conditions determine both lower post flowering source sink ratio ruget 1993 otegui and bonhomme 1998 maddonni et al 1998 and radiation use efficiency andrade et al 1992 1993 which could constraint kernel growth cirilo and andrade 1996 borrás and otegui 2001 however larger maize kernels are achieved with late sowing dates in swp data not shown therefore simulated water status during reproductive periods wdcp and wdgf of early and late sown crops seems to support differences in actual grain yields between sowing dates maximizing soil water capture by crops eta and minimizing water losses i e es are crucial tools for improving water use efficiency of rainfed crops cooper et al 1987 sadras and rodriguez 2007 blum 2009 analyzing the impact of ppd on etacycle and es for late sown crops simulated etacycle resulted similar among ppds table 7 interestingly es was higher at the lowest ppd in response to the lower simulated leaf area index lai for most years data not shown ritchie 1972 kang et al 2003 however due to the low vegetative plasticity of maize maddonni et al 2001 there was a tradeoff between lai and tp with low per plant water availability with high ppd fig 7 in maize water use efficiency to generate biomass from transpiration g mm 1 otegui 1992 is relatively stable across environments within a region otegui 1992 grassini et al 2009 and in consequence conversion of simulated tp to biomass can be conceptualized and management practices compared lowering ppd in maize increases tp fig 7 and lowers plant to plant biomass variability rossini et al 2016 thus improving individual plants physiological state during vegetative phases and more importantly during the critical period for kernel setting denmead and shaw 1960 cakir 2004 and grain filling fig 8 conceptualizes the expected population distribution of individual biomass and the subsequent yield for the median year in an environment such as the one of bordenave in a shallow soil when sowing 2 4 or 6 pl m 2 based on the results from the simulations in this water limited environment with a relatively high ppd a proportion of the individual plants would not surpass the minimum biomass required for kernel set echarte and andrade 2003 reproductive partitioning would be limited vega et al 2001a and grain yield of the dominant high biomass individuals would not compensate the barrenness of dominated low biomass plants vega et al 2001b final grain yield per area unit would be lower than that of a crop with lower ppds in which no proportion of the population falls below the threshold biomass for kernel set given the large inter annual variability of water availability observed low ppds also work as risk insurance for unpredictable dry years low ppds can nullify the risk of attaining low yields with high ppds in dry years due to extremely low reproductive partitioning evidence in other crop species of reduced water use efficiency in environments with high vapor pressure deficit abbate et al 2004 kemanian et al 2005 such as the ones in the swp would indicate further constraints to biomass accumulation in dry years and differences between low and high ppds would magnify the decision of the swp farmers to lower ppd throughout the studied period therefore could be supported by means of eco physiological principles and obeying to the climatic characteristics of this region when furthering the analysis of the climatic constraints for maize production in a semi arid region such as the swp it was of interest to forecast the occurrence of favorable conditions by the means of characterizing the effect of enso phases on crop water economy processes enso effects on maize yield have been widely documented for the central and eastern pampas podestá et al 1999 ferreyra et al 2001 podestá et al 2002 bert et al 2006 fernández long et al 2011 but results for the swp showed not clear effect monzón et al 2012 in this work simulations revealed that when considering the whole crop cycle in early or late sowing dates there was a general trend of el niño phase being wetter in terms of rainfalls than neutral or la niña phases table 6 however the impact of enso on crop water economy processes such as etar1 r6 etacycle or tp was not evident the probability of enso having a strong effect on rainfalls in the swp is high for spring months october november december but there is no evident signal for the summer months january february march as was reported by the agricultural risk office of the secretary of state of agroindustry of argentina http www ora gob ar enso precipitacion php when flowering of early and late crops takes place fernández long et al 2011 found that the enso signal weakens to the southern and western regions of the pampas in consequence predictability of rainfall occurrence during the reproductive stages of maize crops is extremely low in the swp and no clear management strategy could be derived from anticipating enso phases as late sown maize crops had higher etar1 r6 etacycle than early sown crops regardless of the enso phase the decision of sowing crops in late november to lower production risks is strongly supported finally for late sown crops at low ppd other management practices should be considered to reduce es an unproductive component of eta and maximize tc guided by regional common practices simulations started with soybean as previous crop yielding 1800 kg ha 1 and a long fallow period of ca seven months although no till has been widely adopted in the swp peiretti and dumanski 2014 its benefits on soil water relationships mainly reducing es ad increasing water infiltration are reduced when stubble biomass is low aase and siddoway 1980 li et al 2015 wang et al 2011 cover crops with winter cereal or legume species or a combination of both improve rain infiltration and generate biomass that acts as mulching and reduces es during the subsequent crop cycle tolk et al 1999 cover crops can be cultivated in the swp with caution on the timing of herbicide application to end the growth cycle in order to ensure adequate soil water reload pinto et al 2017 and improve water economy of rainfed late sown maize crops 5 conclusions this work analyzed the recent expansion of maize production in a semi arid region of argentina scarcely addressed previously within a crop water economy and eco physiological framework description of occurred changes was possible by using public data of maize area and a representative sample of farmers management practices a large database of on field experiments provided useful data to understand crop behavior with different management practices the use of a crop simulation model with historical climatic data in three different locations and different soil depths within the swp with a probabilistic approach supported experimental data and gave useful insights on important crop water economy variables affected by management practices especially sowing date and ppd in this semi arid region late sowing and low ppd stabilized maize grain yield regardless of soil depth etar1 r6 etacycle water deficit during reproductive phases and tp were the main water economy variables affected by mentioned crop management practices the impacts of sowing date and ppd on crop water economy did not vary among enso phases not supporting the use of enso as a decision criterion for maize management in the swp

introduction traditionally maize zea mays l crops in the most productive agricultural region of argentina i e the rolling pampas hall et al 1992 were sown during early spring september october otegui et al 1995a 1996 this region is characterized by a humid temperate climate and a long frost free period hence long growing seasons of early sowings provide high yields of rainfed crops however in recent years maize production has been widely adopted outside this traditional area i e towards arid and semi arid regions where late sowings stabilize maize yields across years and environments florio et al 2014 the causes of the reduction of yield variability for late sown crops relate to fewer climatic constraints such as low soil temperatures during seedling emergence and drought or heat stress during maize reproductive periods maddonni 2012 therefore although for these newest scenarios potential yields evans and fischer 1999 are lowering due to adoption of late sown crops actual farm yields van ittersum et al 2013 may be higher when faced with climatic and edaphic limitations in the southern pampas of argentina low rainfall and shallow soils generate low water availability during the growing season which is the major constraint for rainfed maize grain yield otegui et al 1995b sadras and calviño 2001 calviño et al 2003 in the most arid region of the southern pampas the southwestern pampas swp fig 1 high inter annual variation of solar radiation mean temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speeds modulate the effect of rainfall on water availability pascale and

cerrudo et al 2013b the evaluation of agricultural practices and crop behavior across a certain region can be done with the assistance of crop simulation models these models are programs that use mathematical equations to reproduce the growth and development of different crops depending on soil characteristics climate and crop husbandry boote et al 1996 hoogenboom et al 2004 phenology and soil water balance are some of the outputs of crop simulation models jones et al 2003 based on the capacity to evaluate the impact of many variables on crop production these models have a widespread use sadler et al 1999 despite of generally not being able to include the negative impact of biotic stresses i e weeds pests and diseases one of the main advantages of the use of crop simulation models is the ability to provide a probabilistic approach to simulated outputs e g giménez et al 2018 in order to meet this objective the models work with time series of climate data which comprise the existing

regions of argentina podestá et al 2002 bert et al 2006 fernández long et al 2011 giménez et al 2018 in the eastern southern pampas simulations of earlier sowing dates of rainfed maize crops september out yielded later sowing dates october in el niño and neutral phases while in la niña phases yield differences between sowing dates disappeared monzón et al 2012 however monzón et al 2012 did not found these associations in the western departments of the southern pampas that comprise the swp furthermore the method used to simulate potential evapotranspiration etc was the one proposed by priestley and taylor 1972 which does not take into account certain variables with high impact in the swp such as wind speed and dew point temperature one method that does take these into account and generates a better adjusted simulation of etc is penman monteith s modified by fao fao56 allen et al 1998 a better understanding of the particular crop water economy processes affected by the enso phenomenon between early and late sowing dates in the swp could provide tools to aid the agronomical decision making of farmers and technical advisors as a crucial crop management decision ppd has a

environments the response is negative and optimum ppd is relatively low haarhoff and swanepoel 2018 low ppd may stabilize inter annual variability of maize yield in regions with high uncertainty of rainfalls tokatlidis et al 2015 due to a better physiological state of plants during more drought sensitive reproductive periods denmead and shaw 1960 cakir 2004 even in dry years higher ppds may maximize crop transpiration jiang et al 2014 but maize morpho physiological characteristics could generate reproductive partitioning restrictions for those suppressed individuals of the stand with very low plant transpiration and biomass accumulation leading to extremely low crop yields vega et al 2001a b probabilistic studies that analyze the effect of ppd on maize crop water economy in a semi arid region by means of historical climatic data and the enso phases are inexistent due to the recent changes in maize crop production systems in the swp region this kind of analysis would result of

using machinery provided by farmers twenty three different intermediate cycle maize hybrids were sown under no till in different sowing dates early october and late november and a broad range of ppd from 2 to 8 plants m 2 in most cases the previous crop was soybean and in the other ones it was sunflower followed by a fallow period of approximately six months for early maize sowings and seven and a half months for late maize sowings in order to generate environmental variability thirteen different experiments were carried out during six growing seasons in different sites fig 1 not every site nor every genotype was represented in every growing season sites differed in soil depth and in most cases experiments were sown in contrasting soil depth sectors within each site shallow soils 40 cm to 60 cm deep soils more than 100 cm adversities weeds pests and diseases were effectively controlled following the common regional practices chemical and mechanical controls when crops reached physiological maturity ears from plants in a 10 m 2 area in each plot were harvested and threshed by hand grains were dried to constant weight and weighted grain yield was then corrected to 14 humidity 2 3 2 field experiments data analysis first in order to evaluate the average responses across contrasting soil depth and sowing date in a regional scale grain yield was analyzed using linear mixed effects models zuur et al 2009 sites were considered random effects blocks with soil depth and sowing date nested within blocks growing season genotypes and densities were included as random effects factors as their mean effect were not of interest for this analysis considering that each site carried out yield trials in different paddocks every growing season years were not considered repeated measures model fit was improved by including variances heterogeneity for soil and sowing treatments i e varident zuur et al 2009 and autocorrelation for trials within sites i e corarma zuur et al 2009 selection of variance and autocorrelation structure was performed throughout minimal akaike information criterion and likelihood ratio test following zuur et al 2009 analyses were carried out using nlme package function lme pinheiro et al 2018 and tests were performed through car package function anova fox and weisberg 2011 these analyses were performed using r r core team 2018 second maize crop behavior was analyzed by the mean and coefficient of variation cv of grain yield sowing date effect on grain yield was evaluated by the cumulative frequency distribution of grain yield values across all plots of all experiments for early and late sowing dates additionally yield values obtained in each sowing date were grouped in grain yield ranges in order to evaluate their respective frequency distributions furthermore an evaluation of the comparative behavior between early and late sown crops was carried out by a regression analysis fitted to grain yield difference of late and early crops gylate early vs grain yield of early crops gyearly at each case in which the same genotype was sown in the same ppd in early and late sowing dates for each environment combination of site year and sowing date optimum ppd oppd of each genotype was calculated using the methodology of hernández et al 2014 briefly eq 1 was used to estimate oppd the parameter b of the equation is

bivariate data into two groups one where a change in the x variable is likely to correspond to a change in the y variable and the other group where a change in x is unlikely to correspond to a change in y when applied to this work the test allows recognizing a critical value in the y axis that describes the lowest possible level of wdcp obtained in every simulation scenario in addition a critical value in the x axis may also be recognized which determines the threshold necessary rainfall r1 r2 amount to attain that lowest possible level of wdcp the impact of the different phases of the enso

location and location nested within simulation year this structure considered the nested nature of the factors considered the simulated year were considered random blocks because each simulation was statistically independent each simulation started from the same initial conditions every year and was not dependent on the conditions of the previous year enso phase was nested within location as enso could have different effects in each location fernández long et al 2011 second for the ppd x soil depth management strategies model fixed effects terms included location enso phase ppd and soil depth

the 2008 2015 period based on public data and farmer inquiries according to public data between 2008 and 2015 maize area in the swp increased from ca 50000 ha to ca 250000 ha with a rate of 17881 ha y

ca 3500 kg ha 1 and ca 9000 kg ha 1 while late sowing dates resembled a normal distribution with a mean of ca 7500 kg ha 1 when taking into account only the experiments that included both sowing dates higher grain yields were obtained in late sown crops in those sites where grain yields of early sown crops were lower than 8500 kg ha 1 fig 2 right the frequency distribution of oppd of early sowing

slightly decreased 3 32 mm frequency 0 5 by the delay of sowing table 5 in almost every combination of location and soil depth maize crops were exposed to wdcp and wdgf table 5 but wd levels were higher in early than in late sown crops differences in wdcp between sowing dates were higher in barrow 15 mm and 21 mm for shallow and deep soils respectively and bordenave 16 mm and 15 mm for shallow

early sowing in shallow and deep soils respectively than in bordenave 0 34 vs 0 28 and 0 34 vs 0 29 for late vs early sowing in shallow and deep soils respectively small differences among sowing dates and soil depths in etar1 r6 etacycle were simulated for coronel suárez 0 40 vs 0 38 and 0 42 vs 0 40 for late vs early sowing in shallow and deep soils respectively in barrow early sown maize crops in both soil depths and early sown maize crops in shallow soils in bordenave had simulated etar1 r6 etacycle values lower than 0 10 in 25 of the years for these scenarios simulations ended during early stages of the effective grain filling period due to low soil water availability data not shown the same happened in nearly 20 of the years for early crops in deep soils in bordenave rainfall ve r6 was marginally higher for el niño years enso phase chi2 2 6 13 p 0 046 table 6 without statistically significant interaction among enso phases sowing dates or locations all double and triple interactions p 0 1 on the other hand rainfall r1 r2 was not affected neither by management location nor enso phase p 0 1 enso had no significant effect on etar1 r6 etacycle in any of the locations and did not modify the described pattern of etar1 r6 etacycle between sowing dates fig 4 right the relationships between wdcp and rainfall r1 r2 showed differences between locations sowing dates and soil depths fig 5 in barrow minimum possible levels of wdcp were 22 mm and 10 mm for shallow and deep soils in early sowing date and 15 mm and 3 mm for shallow and deep soils in late sowing date fig 5 top nevertheless for both soil depths the threshold amount of rainfall r1 r2 needed to reduce wdcp to these minimum values was ca 40 mm and 55 mm for early and late sowings respectively in coronel suárez fig 5 middle both the minimum level of wdcp and the threshold amount of rainfall r1 r2 were similar between sowing dates and slightly differed between soil depths ca 8 mm and 35 mm for deep soils and ca 18 mm and 40 mm for shallow soils for the minimum wdcp and threshold amount of rainfall r1 r2 respectively in bordenave fig 5 bottom the minimum wdcp was higher absolute value for early 40 mm in shallow and 20 mm in deep soils than for late crops 18 mm in shallow and 7 mm in deep soils threshold amount of rainfall r1 r2 was higher for late ca 50 mm and 80 mm in shallow and deep soils respectively than for early crops ca 35 mm and 40 mm in shallow and deep soils respectively 3 3 2 ppd x soil depth effects in late sown crops in late sowing dates etacycle was similar among ppds in almost every location and soil depth table 7 this trend was not sustained in coronel suárez in deep soils frequency 0 50 where etacycle was higher at higher ppds in all locations es etacycle was higher at 2 plants m 2 ca 0 53 in shallow and ca 0 42 in deep soils intermediate at 4 plants m 2 ca 0 45 in shallow and ca 0 35 in deep soils and lower at 6 plants m 2 ca 0 40 in shallow and ca 0 30 in deep soils table 7 tc during the cycle increased with ppd and soil depth fig 6 the higher differences of tc among ppds were simulated for crops in coronel suárez and the lower ones for crops in bordenave at all locations differences among ppd magnified for high tc values i e the uppermost 25th percentile location affected tp depending on soil depth chi2 2 34 33 p 0 001 the highest tp values were simulated in deep soils in coronel suárez the lowest ones in shallow soils in barrow and bordenave while intermediate values were simulated for the other conditions increasing ppd reduced tp depending on soil depth chi2 1 26 74 p 0 001 fig 7 for instance at 2 pl m 2 transpiration was 32 mm pl 1 higher for deep respect to shallow soils i e 112 vs 80 mm pl 1 this difference was 15 mm pl 1 at 6 pl m 2 i e 48 vs 33 mm pl 1 from a probabilistic approach for the 25th percentile tp at 6 plants m 2 never surpassed 51 mm plant 1 coronel suárez deep soil and was as low as 21 mm plant 1 barrow and bordenave shallow soils at 4 plants m 2 these extreme values were 74 mm plant 1 coronel suárez deep soil and 30 mm plant 1 barrow and bordenave shallow soils finally enso phase effect on tp varied with soil depth chi2 2 26 33 p 0 001 only between extreme conditions deep soils under el niño year shallow soils under la niña year therefore in a field within a given combination of location x soil depth no differences of tp were simulated among enso phases 4 discussion farmers should tailor crop management to each environment to attain maximum productivity and lower failure probability hatfield and walthall 2015 this is particularly important in a semi arid region with both climatic and edaphic constraints were maize crop has recently expanded without a profound knowledge of the more suitable cultural practices this work addressed the expansion of maize production in the swp the main constraints for this crop and their implications on crop management by the means of combined data describing regional changes in cultivated area and management practices on field experimental data and the use of a crop simulation model it was possible to provide an agro climatic and eco physiologically based explanation of the occurred changes in crop management mainly sowing date and ppd following results of inquiries to regional farmers between 2008 and 2015 a one month delay of the sowing date from early to mid spring season and 50 decrease of ppd from ca 7 to 4 pl m 2 accompanied a five fold expansion of maize crop area in the swp based on regional public data of annual maize area in the southern pampas region traditional maize sowings at high ppd during early spring assured maximum light interception and high incident radiation during the critical period for kernel set aiming to maximize grain yields of rainfed maize crops cirilo and andrade 1994 otegui 1995a hence behavior of farmers at the western sites of this region swp appears not to meet these criteria although actual grain yields above 9000 kg ha 1 have a higher frequency at early 0 30 than at late sowing dates 0 10 late sown crops had the highest mean ca 7500 kg ha 1 and the lowest variability of yields table 3 and fig 2 moreover the bimodal distribution of grain yields in early sowing dates with large frequencies of grain yields below 6000 kg ha 1 0 40 and 4000 kg ha 1 ca 0 30 showed a more unpredictable behavior of maize crops under this management in the swp the analysis of this database of grain yields oppose those simulated by monzón et al 2012 in the southern pampas where early sowing dates out yielded late sowing dates however monzón et al 2012 did not explore sowing dates later than october 31st meaning that simulations only comprised earlier sowing dates consequently field based findings support the shift of sowing dates across the swp region and indicate that farmers resigned potential yield evans and fischer 1999 to achieve higher and more stable actual farm yields van ittersum et al 2013 the main constraint for maize production in the southern pampas is the low water availability during the growing season otegui et al 1995b sadras and calviño 2001 calviño et al 2003 therefore it was relevant to understand effectively the regional management changes of maize crops i e the delay of sowing date and the decrease of ppd within a crop water economy framework with a probabilistic approach simulations with ceres maize model showed that etacycle was similar for both sowing dates table 5 but the delay of sowing increased etar1 r6 etacycle with a higher magnitude order in the most arid environments fig 4 this effect could be related to the relatively shorter pre flowering period ca 82 vs 74 days for early and late sowing date respectively and the larger grain filling period ca 43 vs 48 days for early and late sowing date respectively influenced by higher temperatures during vegetative phases i e mid summer and lower temperatures during reproductive phases i e late summer and early autumn otegui et al 1995a maddonni 2012 another important result was the extremely low water availability simulated during the critical period and grain filling period of early sown crops table 5 wdcp may affect not only kernel number hall et al 1982 otegui et al 1995b cagnola et al 2018 but also potential kernel weight due to lower assimilates availability per kernel gambín et al 2006 2008 interestingly the relationships between simulated wdcp and rainfalls during that short timespan r1 to r2 11 days shown in fig 5 suggest that late sown maize crops may be exposed to less stressful conditions than early sown crops when adequate amount of rainfalls occurs immediately before female flowering atmospheric demand combined with soil characteristics determined these relationships jaafar et al 1978 ritchie 1981 ritchie and johnson 1990 thus in deeper soils lower wdcp were simulated with similar threshold amount of rainfalls than in shallow soils in both sowing dates which suggests that maize crops in shallow soils have limited capacity to uptake water and every extra cm of soil depth adds mm of water to crop demand this is of high relevancy in a region of high spatial variability of soil depth due to caliche layer presence such as the swp salazar lea plaza et al 1989 hall et al 1992 travasso and suero 1994 the high variability of wdcp values for rainfall levels below the threshold obtained with cate nelson analysis fig 5 indicates that for low immediate rainfalls wdcp might be unpredictable in this region further studies on the effect of atmospheric events rainfalls or cloudy days lowering atmospheric demand around flowering might clarify these relationships excessive wdgf during subsequent days of the grain filling period could interrupt maize kernel growth saini and westgate 1999 barnabás et al 2008 leading to lighter kernels and grain yield reductions hall et al 1981 nesmith and ritchie 1992 hence the less restrictive wdgf of late crops table 5 could counterbalance the declining photo thermal conditions during the same period in high latitudes such as the ones in the swp grain filling period of late crops is exposed to lower temperature levels and declining daily solar radiation otegui et al 1995a these photo thermal conditions determine both lower post flowering source sink ratio ruget 1993 otegui and bonhomme 1998 maddonni et al 1998 and radiation use efficiency andrade et al 1992 1993 which could constraint kernel growth cirilo and andrade 1996 borrás and otegui 2001 however larger maize kernels are achieved with late sowing dates in swp data not shown therefore simulated water status during reproductive periods wdcp and wdgf of early and late sown crops seems to support differences in actual grain yields between sowing dates maximizing soil water capture by crops eta and minimizing water losses i e es are crucial tools for improving water use efficiency of rainfed crops cooper et al 1987 sadras and rodriguez 2007 blum 2009 analyzing the impact of ppd on etacycle and es for late sown crops simulated etacycle resulted similar among ppds table 7 interestingly es was higher at the lowest ppd in response to the lower simulated leaf area index lai for most years data not shown ritchie 1972 kang et al 2003 however due to the low vegetative plasticity of maize maddonni et al 2001 there was a tradeoff between lai and tp with low per plant water availability with high ppd fig 7 in maize water use efficiency to generate biomass from transpiration g mm 1 otegui 1992 is relatively stable across environments within a region otegui 1992 grassini et al 2009 and in consequence conversion of simulated tp to biomass can be conceptualized and management practices compared lowering ppd in maize increases tp fig 7 and lowers plant to plant biomass variability rossini et al 2016 thus improving individual plants physiological state during vegetative phases and more importantly during the critical period for kernel setting denmead and shaw 1960 cakir 2004 and grain filling fig 8 conceptualizes the expected population distribution of individual biomass and the subsequent yield for the median year in an environment such as the one of bordenave in a shallow soil when sowing 2 4 or 6 pl m 2 based on the results from the simulations in this water limited environment with a relatively high ppd a proportion of the individual plants would not surpass the minimum biomass required for kernel set echarte and andrade 2003 reproductive partitioning would be limited vega et al 2001a and grain yield of the dominant high biomass individuals would not compensate the barrenness of dominated low biomass plants vega et al 2001b final grain yield per area unit would be lower than that of a crop with lower ppds in which no proportion of the population falls below the threshold biomass for kernel set given the large inter annual variability of water availability observed low ppds also work as risk insurance for unpredictable dry years low ppds can nullify the risk of attaining low yields with high ppds in dry years due to extremely low reproductive partitioning evidence in other crop species of reduced water use efficiency in environments with high vapor pressure deficit abbate et al 2004 kemanian et al 2005 such as the ones in the swp would indicate further constraints to biomass accumulation in dry years and differences between low and high ppds would magnify the decision of the swp farmers to lower ppd throughout the studied period therefore could be supported by means of eco physiological principles and obeying to the climatic characteristics of this region when furthering the analysis of the climatic constraints for maize production in a semi arid region such as the swp it was of interest to forecast the occurrence of favorable conditions by the means of characterizing the effect of enso phases on crop water economy processes enso effects on maize yield have been widely documented for the central and eastern pampas podestá et al 1999 ferreyra et al 2001 podestá et al 2002 bert et al 2006 fernández long et al 2011 but results for the swp showed not clear effect monzón et al 2012 in this work simulations revealed that when considering the whole crop cycle in early or late sowing dates there was a general trend of el niño phase being wetter in terms of rainfalls than neutral or la niña phases table 6 however the impact of enso on crop water economy processes such as etar1 r6 etacycle or tp was not evident the probability of enso having a strong effect on rainfalls in the swp is high for spring months october november december but there is no evident signal for the summer months january february march as was reported by the agricultural risk office of the secretary of state of agroindustry of argentina http www ora gob ar enso precipitacion php when flowering of early and late crops takes place fernández long et al 2011 found that the enso signal weakens to the southern and western regions of the pampas in consequence predictability of rainfall occurrence during the reproductive stages of maize crops is extremely low in the swp and no clear management strategy could be derived from anticipating enso phases as late sown maize crops had higher etar1 r6 etacycle than early sown crops regardless of the enso phase the decision of sowing crops in late november to lower production risks is strongly supported finally for late sown crops at low ppd other management practices should be considered to reduce es an unproductive component of eta and maximize tc guided by regional common practices simulations started with soybean as previous crop yielding 1800 kg ha 1 and a long fallow period of ca seven months although no till has been widely adopted in the swp peiretti and dumanski 2014 its benefits on soil water relationships mainly reducing es ad increasing water infiltration are reduced when stubble biomass is low aase and siddoway 1980 li et al 2015 wang et al 2011 cover crops with winter cereal or legume species or a combination of both improve rain infiltration and generate biomass that acts as mulching and reduces es during the subsequent crop cycle tolk et al 1999 cover crops can be cultivated in the swp with caution on the timing of herbicide application to end the growth cycle in order to ensure adequate soil water reload pinto et al 2017 and improve water economy of rainfed late sown maize crops 5 conclusions this work analyzed the recent expansion of maize production in a semi arid region of argentina scarcely addressed previously within a crop water economy and eco physiological framework description of occurred changes was possible by using public data of maize area and a representative sample of farmers management practices a large database of on field experiments provided useful data to understand crop behavior with different management practices the use of a crop simulation model with historical climatic data in three different locations and different soil depths within the swp with a probabilistic approach supported experimental data and gave useful insights on important crop water economy variables affected by management practices especially sowing date and ppd in this semi arid region late sowing and low ppd stabilized maize grain yield regardless of soil depth etar1 r6 etacycle water deficit during reproductive phases and tp were the main water economy variables affected by mentioned crop management practices the impacts of sowing date and ppd on crop water economy did not vary among enso phases not supporting the use of enso as a decision criterion for maize management in the swp

therefore sun xihuan proposed a method of water storage pit irrigation w s p i in 1998 according to the local conditions this is a new irrigation method suitable for fruit trees in the arid mountainous areas of northern china sun 2002 the wspi method can improve the drought resistance of crops promote the deep growth of crop roots and effectively utilize rainwater resources in the past two decades breakthroughs have been made in many aspects through field experiments and laboratory tests combined with theoretical analysis of cutting edge frontiers guo 2010 2018 li et al 2018a which includes the main technical parameters of the wspi method soil moisture infiltration characteristics and simulation nitrogen transport characteristics and simulation and fruit tree root growth characteristics and simulation however there is still a lack of research on accurate prediction of fruit tree evapotranspiration under the wspi conditions accurately simulating fruit trees evapotranspiration is of great significance for rationally formulating high efficiency water storage pit irrigation systems and optimizing water management of the wspi orchard the most commonly method of calculating the amount of evapotranspiration in an orchard is the water balance method dzikitia et al 2018 this method is not affected by the characteristics of the underlying surface and meteorological conditions it is used to measure the evapotranspiration of the orchard within a certain period of time generally more than one week but does not reflect the daily evapotranspiration at present the most commonly used methods for measuring evapotranspiration in an orchard are the eddy covariance system dzikitia et al 2018 spinelli et al 2017 micro lysimeter runoff meter method li et al 2018b zhao et al 2015 isotope tracer zheng et al 2018 and remote sensing vanella et al 2019 bellvert et al 2018 however each measurement method has certain inevitable defects in theory or practice therefore in recent years the prediction models for orchard evapotranspiration have begun to be used as research focus attempting to use the model to simulate the evapotranspiration of orchards especially in arid and semi arid regions natural precipitation does not meet the actual water requirements of fruit trees so fruit trees need to be irrigated model research is a simpler and more accurate method to study the water requirement of fruit trees and provides a suitable theoretical basis for the actual irrigation management and precise irrigation of orchards the research on the prediction model of orchard evapotranspiration mainly focuses on single source model margonis et al 2018 ayyoub et al 2017 dual source model fuentes penailillo et al 2018 and multi source model sien et al 2013 the pm model is widely used in the world sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 ershadi et al 2015 dinpashoh et al 2019 but the error is large when simulating the sparse canopy evapotranspiration the shuttleworth wallace s w model is proposed for the sparse canopy based on the pm model which separates soil evaporation and crop transpiration to achieve more accurate prediction however the s w model is sensitive to the canopy resistance and the soil surface resistance which prediction effect is greatly affected by the underlying surface conditions crop type and meteorological conditions therefore many scholars have revised the sw model for different underlying conditions crop types and meteorological conditions and have established the multi source model to simulate crop evapotranspiration to optimize model performance and achieve accurate prediction results however research on this aspect of the wspi orchard has not yet been studied evapotranspiration is an important part of cycling and balance of water and energy crop evapotranspiration includes soil evaporation and crop transpiration there are many parameters involved in the calculation process accurate and effective measurement of crop evapotranspiration requires a lot of manpower and material resources therefore mathematical simulation model can be used to solve this problem the objectives of this paper are 1 to modify the s w model to establish a practical model s w p which can accurately predict the evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard 2 to comprehensively analyze the prediction error mechanism of the s w p model 2

crop canopy is regarded as a leaf located at the source and sink of the flux and the difference in hydrothermal characteristics between the crop canopy and the soil is neglected so it is also called a

the s w dual source model this paper deduced the s w p multi source model suitable for evapotranspiration in wspi orchard the s w p model is divided into three layers the first layer is the water heat exchange energy system between the reference plane and the canopy the second layer is the water heat exchange energy system between the canopy and the surface and the third layer is the water heat exchange energy system between the canopy and the water storage pit fig 2 b is the schematic diagram of s w p model calculations in the wspi orchard the energy in the canopy surface pit system is always balanced and the net radiation absorbed by the system r n is divided into total latent heat flux λ e t total sensible heat flux h and total soil heat flux g the total latent heat flux λ e t in the system is divided into the canopy latent heat flux λ t the latent heat flux of surface soil λ e s and the latent heat flux of pit λ e p the total sensible heat flux h in the system is divided into the canopy sensible heat flux h c the sensible heat flux of surface soil h s and the sensible heat flux of pit h p the total soil heat flux g in the system is divided into the soil heat flux of surface g s and the soil heat flux of pit g p in the energy system of the wspi orchard the net radiation absorbed by the system r n is divided into the net radiation absorbed by canopy r n c and the net radiation absorbed by soil r n s which can be expressed as r s r n c r n s the net radiation absorbed by canopy r n c is divided into the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux of the canopy which can be expressed as r n c λ t h c the net radiation absorbed by surface soil r n s is divided into the latent heat flux sensible heat flux and soil heat flux of the surface which can be expressed as r n s λ e s h s g s the net radiation absorbed by pit r n s is divided into the latent heat flux sensible heat flux and soil heat flux of the pit which can be expressed as r n s λ e p h p g p introducing the pit irrigation coefficient f p meng et al 2019 the total latent heat flux λ e t total sensible heat flux h and total soil heat flux g in the canopy surface pit system of the wspi orchard are calculated as follows 31 λ e t λ t 1 f p λ e s f p λ e p 32 h h c 1 f p h s f p h p 33 g 1 f p g s f p g p therefore according to the above analysis and calculation the fruit tree

calculation method can be found at meng et al 2019 in conclusion eqs 34 48 are the s w p multi source model for the evapotranspiration of fruit trees in wspi orchard which is proposed in this paper 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of simulated and measured values of evapotranspiration by three models under the wspi conditions in this paper three models of p m s w and s w p were used to simulate the evapotranspiration of fruit trees under the wspi conditions and the simulation values were compared with the measured values figs 3 5 shows the daily variation of the simulated and measured values of the three models under the three test treatments of wspi1 wspi2 and wspi3 during the growth period of the apple trees the e t values obtained by the p m model the s w model and the s w p model are the same as the measured values on the daily scale when the p m model simulated the evapotranspiration of fruit trees under the wspi condition the simulated values were less than the measured values and was about 11 45 smaller than the measured value however during the germination phase the simulated value was higher than the measured value which was caused by the fact that the p m model only considers the canopy transpiration and the leaf area index of the phenological period was too small when the s w model was used to simulate the evapotranspiration of fruit trees under the wspi conditions the simulated value was larger than the measured value during the whole growth period and the average value was 24 01 larger than the measured values when the s w p model was used to simulate the evapotranspiration of fruit trees under the wspi condition the simulated value was larger than the measured value during the whole growth period and the average was 5 55 larger than the measured value the evapotranspiration sources of the wspi orchard are the canopy transpiration and the soil evaporation while the soil evaporation sources of the wspi orchard are divided into two parts the surface soil evaporation and the water storage pit evaporation this is the fundamental reason for the difference in evapotranspiration from the orchard of the other irrigation methods for the surface soil evaporation of the wspi orchard the irrigation water is directly applied to the water storage pits and the surface soil moisture content can be kept at a low level without rainfall so the surface soil evaporation of the orchard is small for the water storage pit evaporation in the wspi orchard the microclimate environment of the pit is high humidity and low wind speed and the total areas of the water heat exchange interface between the pit and the atmospheric is small i e the total areas of pit opening of the wspi orchard so the amount of pit soil evaporation in the orchard is also small the s w p model was proposed to synthesize the above phenomenon and based on the s w model revealing the water saving mechanism of the wspi orchard therefore the simulated value of the s w p model is closer to the measured value the s w p model proposed by this paper is based on both the above phenomenon and the s w model it reveals the water saving mechanism of the wspi orchard therefore the simulated value of the s w p model is closer to the measured value than other models 4 2 simulation accuracy of three models figs 6 8 show the linear relationship between the predicted and measured values of the fruit trees evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard by using the three models of p m s w and s w p respectively using the p m s w and s w p models to simulate e t the slopes of the linear equation reached 0 69 1 08 and 1 04 respectively the fitting degrees reached 0 69 0 76 and 0 95 respectively the root mean square error values reached 1 12 m m d 1 37 m m d and 0 47 m m d respectively and the nash sutcliffe efficiency reached 0 59 0 38 and 0 93 respectively figs 9 11 shows the relative error three dimensional scatter plots of the p m s w and s w p models for predicting the fruit trees evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard the p m s w and s w p models were used to simulate the fruit trees evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard the predicted relative errors were 19 1 27 96 and 9 08 respectively compared with the p m model and the s w model the s w p model simulates the et to the measured value with a higher fit r 2 a higher nash efficiency coefficient n s e a lower root mean square error r m s e and a smaller relative error r e while the fitted curve of simulation value and the measured value of the s w p model is closer to the 1 1 line than other models therefore the simulation effect of s w p model is better than that of p m model and s w model s w p model is more suitable for simulation of evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard the p m model is a single source model which ignores ground evaporation when the canopy is sparse the soil evaporation has a greater contribution to the orchard evapotranspiration so the predicted value of the model is greater than the measured value when the canopy is closed the leaf area index is large in general l a i 2 at this time the contribution of the canopy transpiration to the orchard evapotranspiration is large and the prediction effect of p m model is better the s w model is a dual source model which considers both canopy transpiration and soil evaporation the s w p model is a multi source model which considers canopy transpiration surface soil evaporation and the pit evaporation combined with the meteorological factors of the atmosphere and the water storage pit and is realized by the pit irrigation coefficient f p therefore the predicted value is obtained the closest to the measured value in conclusion the predicted value of s w p model is the closest to the measured value 5 discussion 5 1 meteorological conditions during the apple growth period in 2018 the basic meteorological conditions of the institute of fruit research at shanxi academy of agricultural sciences were as follows the rainfall was 347 6 mm the mean air temperature was 20 17 the mean minimum air temperature was 13 36 the mean maximum air temperature was 27 48 and the mean wind speed was 16 04 k m h 1 the mean net radiation was 169 9 w m 2 and the relative air humidity was 74 11 the more special month of this year is july with continuous rainfall and net radiation reduction by about 70 compared to the same period last year the daily variation of basic meteorological factors is shown in fig 12 the orchard evapotranspiration is closely related to regional meteorological factors the multiple stepwise regression analysis between the fruit trees evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard e t and the meteorological factors of net radiation flux r n the leaf area index l a i the relative air humidity r h the daily mean wind speed v the mean air temperature t m e a n the mean maximum air temperature t m a x and the mean minimum air temperature t m i n and are shown in table 3 for e t factors of r h r n t m a x and l a i were included in the multiple stepwise regression analysis and all of them were significant factors p 0 05 and the partial correlation coefficients were 0 784 0 594 0 480 and 0 233 respectively there was a negative correlation between r h and e t while r n t m a x l a i and e t were positively correlated the relative air humidity r h had a great influence on the evapotranspiration during the growth period of apples the partial correlation coefficient is 0 784 and the fruit trees evapotranspiration decreased with the increase of the relative air humidity the fruit trees evapotranspiration increased with the increase of solar net radiation r n which is consistent with liu et al 2017 during the data collection period the leaf area index l a i showed a gradual increase trend the increase of leaf area index caused the canopy transpiration to increase continuously so the fruit trees evapotranspiration e t also kept rising for the three indicators of air temperature namely the mean air temperature t m e a n the mean maximum air temperature t m a x and the mean minimum air temperature t m i n only t m a x was included in the multivariate stepwise regression analysis while t m e a n and t m i n were not the significant factors to e t this is because that the daily variation trend of fruit trees evapotranspiration in different treatments were the same and they all were the single peak curve in other words in the morning the air temperature is the lowest in the day i e t m i n and then gradually rises to noon the air temperature is the highest in the day i e t m a x the fruit trees evapotranspiration reaches its peak and then the air temperature decreases again the reason why the daily peak value of e t is different is due to the difference daily maximum temperature at this time this can also indirectly prove that t m i n has little effect on the value of e t and t m a x has a significant effect on the value of e t the daily mean wind speed v was not a significant factor for the e t in this study area which may be related to the wind speed in the area during the 2018 test the wind speed was higher during the 12 days from 15th to 26th july which was a strong wind level however the wind speed was generally maintained between 8 20 k m h 1 in most of the measurement days which was the breeze belonging to the 2 3 level the difference could be negligible so v was not a significant factor for e t in this study 5 2 sensitivity analysis of s w p model in order to explore the error mechanism caused by s w p model in simulating the fruit trees evapotranspiration under the wspi conditions this paper analyzed the sensitivity of the s w p model to six resistance parameters aerodynamic resistance from the reference height to the canopy r a a aerodynamic resistance between the canopy and the soil surface r a s canopy boundary layer resistance r a c canopy resistance r s c soil surface resistance r s s and soil surface resistance of the pit wall r s p the analysis results were shown in table 4 there are many input parameters in the s w p model but the above six resistance parameters need to be estimated and the other parameters can be obtained more accurate values through reasonable experimental methods therefore this paper only studies the sensitivity of the s w p model to these six resistance parameters in this study the fruit trees evapotranspiration under the wspi conditions was calculated under the condition that the six resistance variables were increased and decreased by 30 respectively which were compared with the simulated value of the s w p model under the actual resistance values to analyze the sensitivity of the s w p model to each resistance variable change research indicated that the s w p model was sensitive to the canopy resistance r s c the soil surface resistance r s s and the soil surface resistance of the pit wall r s p while was least sensitive to the canopy boundary layer resistance r a c the effects of the two aerodynamic resistances r a a and r a s on the s w p model were basically equal both of the two aerodynamic resistances were calculated using meteorological factors so the calculation results were more accurate therefore only the canopy resistance the soil surface resistance and the soil surface resistance of the pit wall would cause large errors in the prediction effect of the s w p model the two kinds of soil surface resistances under the wspi conditions had been studied in the previous period meng et al 2019 therefore in order to calculate the e t of the wspi orchard more accurately it is necessary to study the canopy resistance under the wspi conditions to further improve the accuracy of the s w p model 6 conclusions considering the effect of water storage pit on the orchard evapotranspiration under the wspi conditions the evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard is divided into three parts which are the crop transpiration and the evaporation of the surface soil and the pit wall based on the s w model the pit irrigation coefficient f p was introduced and the s w p model suitable for evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard was established in this paper the three models of p m s w and s w p were used to simulate the evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard the relative error reached

10841,accurately predicting the evapotranspiration of the orchard is of great significance for improving the water use efficiency of orchard and optimizing the water management of orchard based on both the evapotranspiration mechanism of the water storage pit irrigation orchard and the shuttleworth wallace dual source evapotranspiration model an evapotranspiration model s w p suitable for water storage pit irrigation trees was established in this study the evapotranspiration measured by the thermal diffusion sap flow meter and mic lysimeter methods during 2018 were used to verify the performance of the pm model the sw model and the s w p model under the water storage pit irrigation conditions the results show that 1 an evapotranspiration model of the water storage pit irrigation trees is established and the nash efficiency coefficient of the model is 0 93 2 the diurnal variation of the evapotranspiration obtained by the three models of p m s w and s w p are the same as the measured value the simulated value of p m model is 11 45 lower than the measured value the simulated value of s w model is 24 01 higher than the measured value and the simulated value of s w p model is 5 55 higher than the measured value and 3 sensitivity analysis is performed on the six resistance variables in the s w p model which reveals the mechanism of the simulation error of the s w p model thus the s w p model significantly improved the accuracy against the pm and sw models and can be used to estimate the evapotranspiration under the water storage pit irrigation conditions keywords water storage pit irrigation evapotranspiration model penman monteith model shuttleworth wallace model 1 introduction apple is one of the four major fruits in the world zhao et al 2014 china has become the world s largest apple producer suo et al 2019 the loess plateau is one of the two largest apple producing regions in china accounting for more than half of the country s total orchards and production chen et al 2014 cao et al 2012 with the continuous expansion of the planting area of fruit trees the orchard irrigation should not only satisfy the normal growth of fruit trees but also ensure the highly water use efficiency of the orchards in order to achieve the dual purpose of saving and optimizing water resources water scarcity and uneven distribution in the loess plateau of china deng et al 2018 where the orchards are highly dependent on irrigation and adequate water supply is critical to the sustainable development and yield growth of orchards dzikiti et al 2017 2018 therefore sun xihuan proposed a method of water storage pit irrigation w s p i in 1998 according to the local conditions this is a new irrigation method suitable for fruit trees in the arid mountainous areas of northern china sun 2002 the wspi method can improve the drought resistance of crops promote the deep growth of crop roots and effectively utilize rainwater resources in the past two decades breakthroughs have been made in many aspects through field experiments and laboratory tests combined with theoretical analysis of cutting edge frontiers guo 2010 2018 li et al 2018a which includes the main technical parameters of the wspi method soil moisture infiltration characteristics and simulation nitrogen transport characteristics and simulation and fruit tree root growth characteristics and simulation however there is still a lack of research on accurate prediction of fruit tree evapotranspiration under the wspi conditions accurately simulating fruit trees evapotranspiration is of great significance for rationally formulating high efficiency water storage pit irrigation systems and optimizing water management of the wspi orchard the most commonly method of calculating the amount of evapotranspiration in an orchard is the water balance method dzikitia et al 2018 this method is not affected by the characteristics of the underlying surface and meteorological conditions it is used to measure the evapotranspiration of the orchard within a certain period of time generally more than one week but does not reflect the daily evapotranspiration at present the most commonly used methods for measuring evapotranspiration in an orchard are the eddy covariance system dzikitia et al 2018 spinelli et al 2017 micro lysimeter runoff meter method li et al 2018b zhao et al 2015 isotope tracer zheng et al 2018 and remote sensing vanella et al 2019 bellvert et al 2018 however each measurement method has certain inevitable defects in theory or practice therefore in recent years the prediction models for orchard evapotranspiration have begun to be used as research focus attempting to use the model to simulate the evapotranspiration of orchards especially in arid and semi arid regions natural precipitation does not meet the actual water requirements of fruit trees so fruit trees need to be irrigated model research is a simpler and more accurate method to study the water requirement of fruit trees and provides a suitable theoretical basis for the actual irrigation management and precise irrigation of orchards the research on the prediction model of orchard evapotranspiration mainly focuses on single source model margonis et al 2018 ayyoub et al 2017 dual source model fuentes penailillo et al 2018 and multi source model sien et al 2013 the pm model is widely used in the world sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 ershadi et al 2015 dinpashoh et al 2019 but the error is large when simulating the sparse canopy evapotranspiration the shuttleworth wallace s w model is proposed for the sparse canopy based on the pm model which separates soil evaporation and crop transpiration to achieve more accurate prediction however the s w model is sensitive to the canopy resistance and the soil surface resistance which prediction effect is greatly affected by the underlying surface conditions crop type and meteorological conditions therefore many scholars have revised the sw model for different underlying conditions crop types and meteorological conditions and have established the multi source model to simulate crop evapotranspiration to optimize model performance and achieve accurate prediction results however research on this aspect of the wspi orchard has not yet been studied evapotranspiration is an important part of cycling and balance of water and energy crop evapotranspiration includes soil evaporation and crop transpiration there are many parameters involved in the calculation process accurate and effective measurement of crop evapotranspiration requires a lot of manpower and material resources therefore mathematical simulation model can be used to solve this problem the objectives of this paper are 1 to modify the s w model to establish a practical model s w p which can accurately predict the evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard 2 to comprehensively analyze the prediction error mechanism of the s w p model 2

the s w dual source model this paper deduced the s w p multi source model suitable for evapotranspiration in wspi orchard the s w p model is divided into three layers the first layer is the water heat exchange energy system between the reference plane and the canopy the second layer is the water heat exchange energy system between the canopy and the surface and the third layer is the water heat exchange energy system between the canopy and the water storage pit fig 2 b is the schematic diagram of s w p model calculations in the wspi orchard the energy in the canopy surface pit system is always balanced and the net radiation absorbed by the system r n is divided into total latent heat flux λ e t total sensible heat flux h and total soil heat flux g the total latent heat flux λ e t in the system is divided into the canopy latent heat flux λ t the latent heat flux of surface soil λ e s and the latent heat flux of pit λ e p the total sensible heat flux h in the system is divided into the canopy sensible heat flux h c the sensible heat flux of surface soil h s and the sensible heat flux of pit h p the total soil heat flux g in the system is divided into the soil heat flux of surface g s and the soil heat flux of pit g p in the energy system of the wspi orchard the net radiation absorbed by the system r n is divided into the net radiation absorbed by canopy r n c and the net radiation absorbed by soil r n s which can be expressed as r s r n c r n s the net radiation absorbed by canopy r n c is divided into the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux of the canopy

calculation method can be found at meng et al 2019 in conclusion eqs 34 48 are the s w p multi source model for the evapotranspiration of fruit trees in wspi orchard which is proposed in this paper 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison of simulated and measured values of evapotranspiration by three models under the wspi conditions in this paper three models of p m s w and s w p were used to simulate the evapotranspiration of fruit trees under the wspi conditions and the simulation values were compared with the measured values figs 3 5 shows the daily variation of the simulated and measured values of the three models under the three test treatments of wspi1 wspi2 and wspi3 during the growth period of the apple trees the e t values obtained by the p m model the s w model and the s w p model are the same as the measured values on the daily scale when the p m model simulated the evapotranspiration of fruit trees under the wspi condition the simulated values were less than the measured values and was about 11 45 smaller than the measured value however during the germination phase the simulated value was higher than the measured value which was caused by the fact that the p m model only considers the canopy transpiration and the leaf area index of the phenological period was too small when the s w model was used to simulate the evapotranspiration of fruit trees under the wspi conditions the simulated value was larger than the measured value during the whole growth period and the average value was 24 01 larger than the measured values when the s w p model was used to simulate the evapotranspiration of fruit trees under the wspi condition the simulated value was larger than the measured value during the whole growth period and the average was 5 55 larger than the measured value the evapotranspiration sources of the wspi orchard are the canopy transpiration and the soil evaporation while the soil evaporation sources of the wspi orchard are divided into two parts the surface soil evaporation and the water storage pit evaporation this is the fundamental reason for the difference in evapotranspiration from the orchard of the other irrigation methods for the surface soil evaporation of the wspi orchard the irrigation water is directly applied to the water storage pits and the surface soil moisture content can be kept at a low level without rainfall so the surface soil evaporation of the orchard is small for the water storage pit evaporation in the wspi orchard the microclimate environment of the pit is high humidity and low wind speed and the total areas of the water heat exchange interface between the pit and the atmospheric is small i e the total areas of pit opening of the wspi orchard so the amount of pit soil evaporation in the orchard is also small the s w p model was proposed to synthesize the above phenomenon and based on the s w model revealing the water saving mechanism of the wspi orchard therefore the simulated value of the s w p model is closer to the measured value the s w p model proposed by this paper is based on both the above phenomenon and the s w model it reveals the water saving mechanism of the wspi orchard therefore the simulated value of the s w p model is closer to the measured value than other models 4 2 simulation accuracy of three models figs 6 8 show the linear relationship between the predicted and measured values of the fruit trees evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard by using the three models of p m s w and s w p respectively using the p m s w and s w p models to simulate e t the slopes of the linear equation reached 0 69 1 08 and 1 04 respectively the fitting degrees reached 0 69 0 76 and 0 95 respectively the root mean square error values reached 1 12 m m d 1 37 m m d and 0 47 m m d respectively and the nash sutcliffe efficiency reached 0 59 0 38 and 0 93 respectively figs 9 11 shows the relative error three dimensional scatter plots of the p m s w and s w p models for predicting the fruit trees evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard the p m s w and s w p models were used to simulate the fruit trees evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard the predicted relative errors were 19 1 27 96 and 9 08 respectively compared with the p m model and the s w model the s w p model simulates the et to the measured value with a higher fit r 2 a higher nash efficiency coefficient n s e a lower root mean square error r m s e and a smaller relative error r e while the fitted curve of simulation value and the measured value of the s w p model is closer to the 1 1 line than other models therefore the simulation effect of s w p model is better than that of p m model and s w model s w p model is more suitable for simulation of evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard the p m model is a single source model which ignores ground evaporation when the canopy is sparse the soil evaporation has a greater contribution to the orchard evapotranspiration so the predicted value of the model is greater than the measured value when the canopy is closed the leaf area index is large in general l a i 2 at this time the contribution of the canopy transpiration to the orchard evapotranspiration is large and the prediction effect of p m model is better the s w model is a dual source model which considers both canopy transpiration and soil evaporation the s w p model is a multi source model which considers canopy transpiration surface soil evaporation and the pit evaporation combined with the meteorological factors of the atmosphere and the water storage pit and is realized by the pit irrigation coefficient f p therefore the predicted value is obtained the closest to the measured value in conclusion the predicted value of s w p model is the closest to the measured value 5 discussion 5 1 meteorological conditions during the apple growth period in 2018 the basic meteorological conditions of the institute of fruit research at shanxi academy of

coefficients were 0 784 0 594 0 480 and 0 233 respectively there was a negative correlation between r h and e t while r n t m a x l a i and e t were positively correlated the relative air humidity r h had a great influence on the evapotranspiration during the growth period of apples the partial correlation coefficient is 0 784 and the fruit trees evapotranspiration decreased with the increase of the relative air humidity the fruit trees evapotranspiration increased with the increase of solar net radiation r n which is consistent with liu et al 2017 during the data collection period the leaf area index l a i showed a gradual increase trend the increase of leaf area index caused the canopy transpiration to increase continuously so the fruit trees evapotranspiration e t also kept rising for the three indicators of air temperature namely the mean air temperature t m e a n the mean maximum air temperature t m a x and the mean minimum air temperature t m i n only t m a x was included in the multivariate stepwise regression analysis while t m e a n and t m i n were not the significant factors to e t this is because that the daily variation trend of fruit trees evapotranspiration in different treatments were the same and they all were the single peak curve in other words in the morning the air temperature is the lowest in the day i e t m i n and then gradually rises to noon the air temperature is the highest in the day i e t m a x the fruit trees evapotranspiration reaches its peak and then the air temperature decreases again the reason why the daily peak value of e t is different is due to the difference daily maximum temperature at this time this can also indirectly prove that t m i n has little effect on the value of e t and t m a x has a significant effect on the value of e t the daily mean wind speed v was not a significant factor for the e t in this study area which may be related to the wind speed in the area during the 2018 test the wind speed was higher during the 12 days from 15th to 26th july which was a strong wind level however the wind speed was generally maintained between 8 20 k m h 1 in most of the measurement days which was the breeze belonging to the 2 3 level the difference could be negligible so v was not a significant factor for e t in this study 5 2 sensitivity analysis of s w p model in order to explore the error mechanism caused by s w p model in simulating the fruit trees evapotranspiration under the wspi conditions this paper analyzed the sensitivity of the s w p model to six resistance parameters aerodynamic resistance from the reference height to the canopy r a a aerodynamic resistance between the canopy and the soil surface r a s canopy boundary layer resistance r a c canopy resistance r s c soil surface resistance r s s and soil surface resistance of the pit wall r s p the analysis results were shown in table 4 there are many input parameters in the s w p model but the above six resistance parameters need to be estimated and the other parameters can be obtained more accurate values through reasonable experimental methods therefore this paper only studies the sensitivity of the s w p model to these six resistance parameters in this study the fruit trees evapotranspiration under the wspi conditions was calculated under the condition that the six resistance variables were increased and decreased by 30 respectively which were compared with the simulated value of the s w p model under the actual resistance values to analyze the sensitivity of the s w p model to each resistance variable change research indicated that the s w p model was sensitive to the canopy resistance r s c the soil surface resistance r s s and the soil surface resistance of the pit wall r s p while was least sensitive to the canopy boundary layer resistance r a c the effects of the two aerodynamic resistances r a a and r a s on the s w p model were basically equal both of the two aerodynamic resistances were calculated using meteorological factors so the calculation results were more accurate therefore only the canopy resistance the soil surface resistance and the soil surface resistance of the pit wall would cause large errors in the prediction effect of the s w p model the two kinds of soil surface resistances under the wspi conditions had been studied in the previous period meng et al 2019 therefore in order to calculate the e t of the wspi orchard more accurately it is necessary to study the canopy resistance under the wspi conditions to further improve the accuracy of the s w p model 6 conclusions considering the effect of water storage pit on the orchard evapotranspiration under the wspi conditions the evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard is divided into three parts which are the crop transpiration and the evaporation of the surface soil and the pit wall based on the s w model the pit irrigation coefficient f p was introduced and the s w p model suitable for evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard was established in this paper the three models of p m s w and s w p were used to simulate the evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard the relative error reached 19 17 27 96 and 9 08 respectively the root mean square error values reached 1 12 m m d 1 1 37 m m d 1 and 0 47 m m d 1 respectively and the nash sutcliffe efficiency reached 0 59 0 38 and 0 93 respectively therefore in the quantitative pre diction of evapotranspiration in the wspi orchard it is recommended to apply the high precision s w p model in order to analyze the evapotranspiration mechanism of the wspi orchard from the perspective of meteorological factors this paper conducts multiple stepwise regression analysis between the measured orchard evapotranspiration e t and meteorological factors r h r n t m a x and l a i were included in the multivariate stepwise regression analysis which were the significant factors p 0 05 the wind speed the mean minimum air temperature and the mean air temperature were not significant factors for the evapotranspiration of the wspi orchard in the region to reveal the mechanism of the simulation error of the s w p model the sensitivity of the model to the aerodynamic resistance from the reference height to the canopy r a a the aerodynamic resistance between the canopy and the soil surface r a s the canopy boundary layer resistance r a c the canopy resistance r s c soil surface resistance r s s and soil surface resistance of the pit wall r s p was analyzed this research showed that the sensitivity of the s w p model to the six resistance variables was r s c r s s r s p r a a r a s r a c in this paper the aerodynamic resistance of the pit r a p is neglected in the calculation process which needs to be further improved in future research for the canopy resistance r s c a common empirical formula is selected in this paper in future research it is necessary to study the canopy resistance under the wspi conditions and establish the corresponding canopy resistance model to further improve the prediction accuracy of the s w p model declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they

10842,the objective of this study was to identify the microbial community structures in rhizosphere soils of grapevine in protected cultivation and to assess the effects of soil water regulation on the main bacteria based on a two year field test soil samples from mild water stress and control ck treatments were collected during the flowering fs and early fruit development stages es of grapes soil microbial community structures were analyzed using 16s rrna gene sequencing method the species composition observed species species diversity index shannon simpson and pd whole tree and community richness values chao1 ace under the mild water stress treatments at fs and es were all significantly higher than under the ck treatment p 0 05 proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria were the main types of microbial phyla in grapevine rhizosphere soils the relative abundance of firmicutes under the mildwater stress treatments at fs and es was significantly lower than under the ck treatment xanthomonadales and clostridiales were the main orders and the frequency of clostridiales under the mild water stress treatments at fs and es were significantly lower than under the ck treatment clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the dominant genus the relative abundance of which reduced under the mild water stress both at the two sampling stages however water stress had little effect on the relative abundance of lysobacter meanwhile a compensatory effect on grape growth was detected after re watering results show that firmicutes clostridiales clostridium sensu stricto 1werethe main drought sensitive microorganisms at phylum order and genus levels respectively mild water stress was an appropriate water management which can increase the diversity and richness of soil microorganisms in greenhouse grape soils and can save water resources compared with the traditional irrigation regimes keywords grapevine waterstress soil microorganisms firmicutes clostridiales clostridium sensu stricto 1 1 introduction soil microorganisms play an important role in plant growth soil structure nutrient transformation and utilization li et al 2014 previous studies demonstrated that many environmental factors could affect soil microbes gilbert et al 2014 whipps et al 2008 especially soil moisture is one of the major factors that can change the microbial community structure and activity arikan and pirlak 2016 dietrich et al 2017 liu et al 2010 furthermore soil moisture could also influence the soil microbiological and biochemical activities by affecting soil osmotic potentiality borowik and wyszkowska 2016 nutrient energy transfer and microbial cell metabolism it could directly affect the biomass and community structure of soil microorganisms by changing the content of dissolved oxygen in soil at the same time it could influence the physicochemical characteristics of soil such as redox potential ph and contents of o2 co2 organic carbon and total nitrogen content which in turn indirectly affect the microbial population and activity berry et al 2016 dietrich et al 2017 bacteria are the most important components of soil microorganisms gans et al 2005 the influence of soil moisture on soil bacterial population have been researched in several studies which could be either negative if soil water content is too high or too low to threaten soil bacteria community or positive if the content is suitable for bacterial community activity mackie et al 2014 moreno et al 2017 sardans and penuelas 2010 at present supplementary irrigation and drainage measures are recognized to be the most safety method to eliminate those adverse effects for example supplementary irrigation can increase soil moisture which remarkably promotes the root zone soil bacterial communities wang et al 2017 increases the relative abundances of acidobacteria and planctomycetes in soil she et al 2018 and affects the ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa community structure zhang et al 2018 however high soil water condition or excessive water addition regulation patterns could reduce the relative abundances of pezizales verrucariales and agaricales she et al 2018 although soil moisture is an important factor affecting soil microorganisms little is known about the appropriate range of soil moisture which can enhance the positive effects or weaken the adverse effects of soil moisture on bacterial community especially in vineyards soil different types of microorganisms response differently to soil moisture taylor et al 2013 actually a reciprocal effect of soil microbiome on bacterial communities associated with grapevine parts leaves flowers grapes and roots has been reported zarraonaindia et al 2015 this effect can be either beneficial if the soil bacteria improve grapevine organs bacteria communities and the growth of grapes or harmful as such community inhibits grape growth or gives rise to the accumulation of plant pathogens both effects are common in grapevine cultivation for example arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf and other beneficial microorganisms can promote there sponse of grape to nitrogen metabolism balestrini et al 2017 amf in the rhizosphere could improve grape growth and fruit quality under stressed conditions holland et al 2014 vega avila et al 2015 on the other hand the negative feedback effect of soil microorganisms on grapevine growth would be highlighted under unsuitable soil moisture conditions too high or too low the beneficial bacteria will decrease sardans and penuelas 2010 tian et al 2012 and the harmful microorganisms will increase sharply which will weaken grapes pathogen protection ability and ultimately reduce the yield and quality thus carefully distinguish of water sensitive growth promoting and harmful bacteria in soils and appropriate soil water control measures may increase beneficial effects or alleviate adverse effects on soil microbial community structures and grape growth the protected cultivation grape was common in asia china japan and korea the netherlands and italy china was a major country involved in grape cultivation and the planting area reached about 799 200 ha up to 11 of the world total cultivation area in 2017 tian et al 2019 in recent years the protected cultivation grape rapidly developed in china and its planting area was 200 000 ha which played an important role in the annual supply of table grapes however there are few studies caring about the relationship between soil microorganisms and water regulation of protected cultivation grape the main types of water sensitive beneficial bacteria community and its suitable soil water content range in vineyards are still not clear in this study we conducted a greenhouse experiment which considered different soil water management schemes to distinguish water sensitive bacteria at two important grapevine growing stages flowering and fruit enlargement stages the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing method was used which allowed us to comprehensively explore the diversity of bacterial communities under different soil water content condition here we designed two hypotheses 1 water stress treatments can change the diversity richness and structure of the bacterial community in grapevine soil however the effects may be fluctuating and gradually disappear with the transformation from the drought stress to the re water condition 2 some beneficial bacteria in greenhouse grape soil are sensitive to moisture and their numbers are improved by drought stress during a suitable grapevine growth period on the contrary some hydrophilic bacteria decrease accordingly under the drought stress condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment description the field experiment was conducted at the yongdeng irrigation experiment station 36 43 34 n 103 16 24 e gansu province china the altitude here is 2100 m and the climate is typical continental monsoon climate the area belongs to a semiarid region with the mean annual rainfall and temperature are 290 mm and 5 9 c respectively the annual lowest and highest temperatures vary from 28 1 c min to 34 4 c max the grape used for the experiment was vitiscv red globe which cultivated in a local traditional greenhouse the size of the greenhouse was 8 60m2 and the walls were made of compacted local earth breadth about 80 cm the steel truss was used to support the roof that consisted of two layers plastic and straw curtain which could be raised or lowered manually according to the needs for indoor temperature humidity and light intensity the grapevine has cultivated for 7 years and the plant distance was 2 0 m between rows and 0 8 m along rows the growth period of the grape was divided into five stages i e budburst may 9th may 24th shoot elongation may 25th june 22th flowering june 23rd july 10th fruit enlargement july 11st september 8th coloring and mature september 9th december 9th stages according to the temperature humidity and rainfall table 1 the average field capacity fc of experimental soil was 0 272 cm3 cm 3 and the bulk density was about 1 41 g cm 3 the other soil properties were shown in table 2 the water stress experiment was conducted from 2015 to 2017 in order to study the effects of water stress on soil microorganisms at different growth stages a mild drought stress in soil according to the field water capacity with a percentage of 50 75 was considered at each growth stage of grapes zhang et al 2017b that means totally five water stress treatments were designed i e bs treatment mild water stress during budburst

mild water stress during coloring and mature period before and after the mild water stress grapes were irrigated normally with adequate water supply a control treatment ck with adequate water supply during each growth stages were also designed according to the soil water management regime of local farmers the soil water content of which was 75 100 fc during the whole growing period of grapes table3 each treatment had three replicates and totally 18 plots were used with each size of 8 m long and 2 m wide a randomized block design was used for the plot distribution small tube flow irrigation was used in this experiment with one tube on each row the outlet tube with a diameter of 4 mm was installed in the branch pipe with a diameter of 32 mm the installation distance of the tube was 50 cm and the tube flow rate was8l h the soil water content was tested by the oven drying method the irrigation for each plot was conducted only when the soil water content reached to the designed lower limit table 3 groundwater the features were shown in table 4 was used for the irrigation and the irrigation quota for each time was 270 m3 hm 2 the exact irrigation amount was monitored by water meters after irrigation the soil moisture contents of all treatments reached 100 fc however during the stress period the soil moisture contents of the mild drought stress treatments can only reach up to 75 fc the total irrigation amount for each water regulation treatment was different as shown in table 3 a polyethylene geomembrane with a thickness of 2 mm was laid between the plots to the soil depth of 1 m to prevent the diffusion of soil water between different plots the fertilization pruning pest control and weeding for all plots were the same according to the local grape cultivation and management 2 2 soil sampling soil samples for testing initial soil properties were collected at the beginning of grapevine budburst stage in 2017 five soil cores 3 cm diameter near the grapevine rows about 30 cm distance in each plot were taken to a depth of 80 cm and sectioned into 20 cm increments then the samples in each plot were pooled together by depth and transported to the laboratory for soil texture analysis at the same time five soil cores 3 cm diameter in each plot were taken from the top 20 cm and then combined to make homogeneous samples in the same plot before taken to the laboratory in the lab the samples were sieved through 2 mm mesh and air dried to determine soil reaction organic matter effective nitrogen available p and available p furthermore three large arbitrary

soil bulk density the testing methods of soil properties and initial soil properties value were shown in table 2 soil samples for dna extraction and microbial community structures were collected during the important phase of grapevine on july 14th flowering stage fs and august 10th early fruit development stage es 2017 after removing the surface layer soil 0 5 cm samples were collected close to randomly chosen vine root in each plot at 5 20 cm depth using a shovel three sites were chosen in each plot when the grape root was detected in the topsoil three soil cores 3 cm diameter were taken near the root the roots in the soil cores were removed and the soil close to the roots was collected using sterile gloves and considered as the part of the samples novello et al 2017 taylor et al 2014 the three soil cores were then pooled together in order to obtain a homogeneous sample all soil samples were packed in ice blocks and transported to the laboratory within 24 h for further analysis chen et al 2017 in the laboratory soil samples were stored at 20 c for dna extraction 2 3 dna extraction and pcr amplification soil dna was extracted using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab

volume of chloroform the tube was centrifuged at 4 c for 10 min under 12 000 r min this step was repeated at 1 2 times until the protein layer did not appear then the supernatant was precipitated at 20 c for 1 h centrifuged at 4 c for 10 min at 12 000 r min and washed twice with 70 ethanol and dried at room temperature for 5 15 min finally the precipitate was dissolved in 30 50 μl depc deionized water and stored at 20 c or 70 c for further analysis about 5 μl dna solution and 3 μl dna loading buffer was mixed and added carefully to 1 agarose spotting wells and110 v voltage electrophoresis for 30 min in order to detect the dna purity then tested the optical density od at 260 and 280 nm by uv spectrophotometer if the ratio of od260 to od280 was in the range of 1 8 2 0 it shows that the purity of dna was very high and meets the analysis requirements then the dna diluted with sterile water to 1 ng μl according to the ratio of od260 to od280 and stored at 80 c for further study

the chimera sequence haas et al 2011 to obtain the final effective tags table 5 all the effective tags of all samples were clustered by using the uparse software uparse v7 0 1001 http drive5 com uparse edgar 2013 the sequences were clustered into otus operational taxonomic units with 97 identity at the same time the representative sequence of otus was selected according to its algorithm principle the sequence with the highest frequency in otus would be selected as the representative sequence of otus the otus representative sequence was annotated by species species annotation was analyzed with mothur method and ssurrna database quast et al 2013 setting threshold of 0 8 1 of silva http www arb silva de wang et al 2007 to obtain taxonomic information and count the community composition of each species at each classification level phylum class order family genus species muscle software edgar 2004 version 3 8 31 http www drive5 com muscle was used to perform fast multi sequence alignment and obtained the phylogenetic relationships of all otus representative sequences finally the data of each sample was homogenized and the data with the least amount of data in the sample was homogenized for alpha diversity analysis 2 6 data analysis in order to analyze the alpha diversity the values of observed species shannon simpson chao1 ace goods coverage and pd whole tree sum of branch lengths between all representatives on phylogenetic tree were calculated using the qiime software version 1 9 1 the differences in alpha diversity index among treatments groups were analyzed using the lsd method in ibm spass statistics software version 19 and the lsd values were tested at 5 level of significance the r software version 2 15 3 was used to draw the relative abundance chart in different classification levels based on the results of the microbial sequencing and the main species with the largest abundances in three classification level phylum order genus were selected to draw the cumulative map under different water stress treatments the differences between different samples the change in the microbial community structure were analyzed using non metric multi dimensional scaling method r software version 2 15 3 3 results 3 1 effects of water stress on soil microbial diversity as can be seen from the table 6 the fs treatment got the highest observed median number of bacterial species at the flowering period 4903otus which was significantly higher than ck treatment the median value of shannon s index was higher in fs treatment than in ck and any other treatments at flowering stage in addition the fs treatment also obtained the maximum values of simpson chao1 and ace furthermore the value of pd whole tree index in fs treatment was significantly higher than in ck treatment p 0 05 however the value of goods coverage in fs treatment was significantly lower than in ck treatment table 7 was the analysis of alpha indices at early fruit enlargement stage the es treatment got the maximum values of observed species shannon s index chao1 ace pd whole tree index and simpson the values in es treatment were all significantly higher than in ck treatment p 0 05 except for the value of simpson however the value of goods coverage in es treatment was significantly lower than in ck treatment which was consistent with fs treatment at flowering stage 3 2 effects of water stress on soil microbial relative abundance at flowering stage the relative abundances of phyla at the flowering stage are shown in fig 1 a proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phylum which represented about 40 frequencies and there was no significant difference between different treatments firmicutes and actinomycetes were the other two main types of phyla and actinomycetes relative abundance did not significantly change between all water stress treatments the relative abundance of firmicutes was only 11 in fs treatment significantly lower than in ck treatment with the relative abundance of 16 in addition the abundance of firmicutes in gs and ps treatments was also lower than in ck es and cs treatments xanthomonadales nitrosomonadales and rhizobiales which belongs to proteobacteria were the three main orders fig 2 a the frequencies of them did not obviously vary in different treatments clostridiales and bacillales which belongs to 16 in addition the abundance of firmicutes in gs and ps treatments was also lower than in ck es and cs treatments xanthomonadales nitrosomonadales and rhizobiales which belongs to proteobacteria were the three main orders fig 2a the frequencies of them did not obviously vary in different treatments clostridiales and bacillales which belongs to firmicutes were the other main orders in grape rhizosphere soils and the relative abundance of clostridiales in fs treatment at the flowering stage was significantly lower than in ck treatment in addition the relative abundances of clostridiales in gs and ps treatments were also significantly lower than in other treatments es cs at genus level there were so many bacterial species types in the soil that the proportion of total others except top 10 genus was up to 80 even so clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the dominant genus which accounts for about 5 fig 3 a the lowest frequency of which appeared in fs treatment the relative abundances of clostridium sensu stricto 1 in bs and ss treatments were also significantly lower than in es cs and ck treatments 3 3 effects of water stress on soil microbial relative abundance at early fruit enlargement stage similar to the relative abundance observed in the rhizosphere soil sampled at the flowering stage proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria were the main phyla at the early fruit enlargement stage fig 1b although the frequency of proteobacteria was obviously lower for es treatment than for gs treatment no obvious difference in the frequency of proteobacteria and actinobacteria was found between water stress treatments and ck treatments however the firmicutes relative abundance in fs treatment was only 8 significantly lower than in ck treatment 15 in addition the abundances of firmicutes in other water stress treatments were also lower than in ck treatment xanthomonadales was one of the main bacteria in grapevine soil at the order level fig 2a and 2b especially at the early fruit enlargement stage its relative abundances was up to about 15 fig 2b which was nearly twice that at the flowering stage therefore it became a dominant bacteria order there was no significant difference of xanthomonadales s relative abundances between es treatment and other treatments but the frequency of xanthomonadales in fs treatment was significantly higher than in ck clostridiales was another main order of bacteria the relross ref a furthermore the soil sample with es treatment was also clearly separated from other samples at the early fruit enlargement stage fig 4 b 4 discussion the soil microbial activity in the rhizosphere plays a vital role in soil quality and nutrient transformation and utilization compant et al 2010 zarraonaindia et al 2015 which could be affected by soil moisture one of the most important environmental factors arikan and pirlak 2016 soil microbial activity would be limited under drought conditions dietrich et al 2017 burns et al 2015 proved that precipitation affected soil bacterial community structure by affecting soil moisture in wine grapevine vineyards zhang et al 2017a studied the effects of supplementary irrigation on the soil microorganisms of stipabaicalensis steppe suggesting that lower soil moisture moderate water stress was beneficial to increase the bacterial otu richness and diversity at high nitrogen levels consistent with above researches we found that the observed species shannon simpson chao1 ace and pd whole tree in fs and es treatments were significantly higher than in all of the other treatments at the two sampling times flowering and early fruiting tables 6 and 7 that means the application of mild water stress during flowering and fruit enlargement of greenhouse grapevine can increase the diversity and richness of soil microorganisms in grapevine rhizosphere on the contrary the goods coverage which is an index of gene sequencing depth was significantly lower for the fs and es treatments than for the ck treatment during each corresponding water stress period indicating that water stress would reduce the bacterial gene sequencing depth furthermore the aforementioned alpha diversity parameters for the fs treatment returned to the same level as for the ck treatment at the early fruiting stage on re watering again table 7 no significant difference in the values of these parameters was found between the ss treatment and the ck treatment on re watering at the flowering stage table 6 thus these conclusions confirm the hypothesis 1 that water stress treatments can change the diversity richness and structure of the bacterial community in grapevine soil however the effects may be fluctuating and gradually disappear with the transformation from the drought stress to the re water condition proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in grapevine rhizosphere soil fig 1a b there was no significant difference inthe relative abundance of proteobacteria in among all treatments the same results were found for actinobacteria the relative abundance of firmicutes in two water stress treatments fs es were significantly lower than ck during each corresponding water stress period in addition the relative abundance of firmicutes in other water stress treatments were also lower than in ck indicating that firmicutes were a very sensitive bacterium to drought stress the relative abundance of which would be reduced under drought stress largely confirming hypothesis 2 sanchez et al 2014 found that firmicutes were the prevalent microbial communities in irrigation systems of an experimental greenhouse for tobacco crop growing she et al 2018 obtained a conclusion that supplementary precipitation significantly increased bacterial diversity in desert shrub soils and changed community composition by increasing the relative abundance of acidobacteria however in our study the relative abundance of acidobacteria had no difference between ck and the other water stress treatments the main reason may be that the soil moisture content adequate water supply or water stress treatment of protected grapevine cultivation were generally higher than the soil moisture content of desert shrub annual precipitation was 284 8 mm novello et al 2017 found that actinobacteria proteobacteria were the two dominant phyla in the rhizosphere soil of wine grapevines and the irrelative abundance ratio did not change significantly because of the sampling time or site that was consistent with the conclusion of this study clostridiales belongs to firmicutes was one of the main orders in grape rhizosphere soils and the relative abundance of clostridiales in fs treatment and in es treatment at the flowering and early fruiting stage were significantly lower than in ck treatment respectively in addition the relative abundances of clostridiales in all other enduring water stress treatments bs and ss were also significantly lower than in other treatments that had not yet undergone water stress fig 2a b that means clostridiales was very sensitive to water stress at the grape flowering period and early fruiting stage and water stress would reduce the relative abundance of them thus partly confirming our hypothesis 2 the genus clostridium belongs to firmicutes clostridiales in order clostridium can antagonize many kinds of pathogenic fungi meanwhile clostridium had the function of promoting soil nitrogen accumulation qian et al 2018 mowlick et al 2013 studied the soil microorganisms under brassica juncea plants and avenastrigosa plants irrigated with 20 or 30 moisture content the results of which showed that species in the genus clostridium were the dominant microorganisms in our experiments clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the dominant genus of clostridium in all the samples and its relative abundance in all mild water stress treatments was significantly lower than no undergoing water stress treatment fig 3a b that means clostridium sensu stricto 1 was also very sensitive to drought stress under which the frequency would be reduced the genus lysobacter belongs to proteobacteria xanthomonadales in order lysobacter can antagonize many kinds of pathogenic fungi bacteria and nematodes and play an important role in improving plant disease resistance christensen and cook 1978 panthee et al 2016 sullivan et al 2003 in our study lysobacter was another main bacterium in greenhouse grapevine soil there was no significant difference between the relative abundance of lysobacter in fs treatment and in ck at flowering stage fig 3a but the lysobacter s relative abundance of fs treatment was rapidly improved at early fruit enlargement period fig 3b indicating that lysobacter have re compensatory growth effect after re watering pontibacter had a strong ability to resist high radiation arid environment and to remove chlorinated herbicide in soil li et al 2018 wang 2011 succeeded in extracting and separating pontibacter strains from sandy soil samples from desert areas in xinjiang china pontibacter sp was a kind of bacteria involved in soil nitrogen cycling the application of green manure in the vineyard can significantly improve its richness longa et al 2017 in our study pontibacter in es treatment was significantly higher than in other treatments at the early fruit enlargement stage fig 3b suggesting that water stress was beneficial to improving the richness of pontibacter thus those results partly support the hypothesis 2 that some beneficial bacteria in greenhouse grape soil are sensitive to moisture and their numbers are improved by drought stress during a suitable grapevine growth period water stress at the flowering stage or early fruit enlargement period would lead to the change of the microbial community the samples of different water stress treatment were far apart fig 4a b that means the effects of water stress on grapevine soil bacteria structure was significantly different compared with ck and the other treatments confirming hypothesis 1 5 conclusions proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria were the main types of phylum in greenhouse grapevine rhizosphere soil and firmicutes was a very sensitive phylum to drought stress proteobacteria and actinobacteria were not sensitive to soil water stress xanthomonadales nitrosomonadales rhizobiales were main order belonging to proteobacteria and their frequency did not change in different water stress treatments clostridiales bacillales were two other main orders in the grapevine rhizosphere soil belonging to firmicutes and clostridiales was very sensitive to the water stress at the flowering stage and fruit enlargement stage the relative abundance of which would be reduced in mild water stress clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the main genus in protected cultivation grapevine rhizosphere soil at the flowering and early fruiting stage and it was very sensitive to drought stress the relative abundance of which would be reduced under drought stress lysobacter was another main genus water stress had little effect on it but it had compensatory growth effect after re watering pontibacter was the only genus that able to adapt to drought stress environment in this study water stress was beneficial to its growth in a word water stress would lead to the change of rhizosphere soil microbial community of grape in protected cultivation mild water stress at the flowering stage or at the fruit enlargement stage can increase the diversity and richness of soil microorganisms re watering after mild water stress improved the greenhouse grapevine soil environment which can help the growth of beneficial bacteria such as lysobacter could improve grapevine resistance to disease acknowledgments this

10842,the objective of this study was to identify the microbial community structures in rhizosphere soils of grapevine in protected cultivation and to assess the effects of soil water regulation on the main bacteria based on a two year field test soil samples from mild water stress and control ck treatments were collected during the flowering fs and early fruit development stages es of grapes soil microbial community structures were analyzed using 16s rrna gene sequencing method the species composition observed species species diversity index shannon simpson and pd whole tree and community richness values chao1 ace under the mild water stress treatments at fs and es were all significantly higher than under the ck treatment p 0 05 proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria were the main types of microbial phyla in grapevine rhizosphere soils the relative abundance of firmicutes under the mildwater stress treatments at fs and es was significantly lower than under the ck treatment xanthomonadales and clostridiales were the main orders and the frequency of clostridiales under the mild water stress treatments at fs and es were significantly lower than under the ck treatment clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the dominant genus the relative abundance of which reduced under the mild water stress both at the two sampling stages however water stress had little effect on the relative abundance of lysobacter meanwhile a compensatory effect on grape growth was detected after re watering results show that firmicutes clostridiales clostridium sensu stricto 1werethe main drought sensitive microorganisms at phylum order and genus levels respectively mild water stress was an appropriate water management which can increase the diversity and richness of soil microorganisms in greenhouse grape soils and can save water resources compared with the traditional irrigation regimes keywords grapevine waterstress soil microorganisms firmicutes clostridiales clostridium sensu stricto 1 1 introduction soil microorganisms play an important role in plant growth soil structure nutrient transformation and utilization li et al 2014 previous studies demonstrated that many environmental factors could affect soil microbes gilbert et al 2014 whipps et al 2008 especially soil moisture is one of the major factors that can change the microbial community structure and activity arikan and pirlak 2016 dietrich et al 2017 liu et al 2010 furthermore soil moisture could also influence the soil microbiological and biochemical activities by affecting soil osmotic potentiality borowik and wyszkowska 2016 nutrient energy transfer and microbial cell metabolism it could directly affect the biomass and community structure of soil microorganisms by changing the content of dissolved oxygen in soil at the same time it could influence the physicochemical characteristics of soil such as redox potential ph and contents of o2 co2 organic carbon and total nitrogen content which in turn indirectly affect the microbial population and activity berry et al 2016 dietrich et al 2017 bacteria are the most important components of soil microorganisms gans et al 2005 the influence of soil moisture on soil bacterial population have been researched in several studies which could be either negative if soil water content is too high or too low to threaten soil bacteria community or positive if the content is suitable for bacterial community activity mackie et al 2014 moreno et al 2017 sardans and penuelas 2010 at present supplementary irrigation and drainage measures are recognized to be the most safety method to eliminate those adverse effects for example supplementary irrigation can increase soil moisture which remarkably promotes the root zone soil bacterial communities wang et al 2017 increases the relative abundances of acidobacteria and planctomycetes in soil she et al 2018 and affects the ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa community structure zhang et al 2018 however high soil water condition or excessive water addition regulation patterns could reduce the relative abundances of pezizales verrucariales and agaricales she et al 2018 although soil moisture is an important factor affecting soil microorganisms little is known about the appropriate range of soil moisture which can enhance the positive effects or weaken the adverse effects of soil moisture on bacterial community especially in vineyards soil different types of microorganisms response differently to soil moisture taylor et al 2013 actually a reciprocal effect of soil microbiome on bacterial communities associated with grapevine parts leaves flowers grapes and roots has been reported zarraonaindia et al 2015 this effect can be either beneficial if the soil bacteria improve grapevine organs bacteria communities and the growth of grapes or harmful as such community inhibits grape growth or gives rise to the accumulation of plant pathogens both effects are common in grapevine cultivation for example arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf and other beneficial microorganisms can promote there sponse of grape to nitrogen metabolism balestrini et al 2017 amf in the rhizosphere could improve grape growth and fruit quality under stressed conditions holland et al 2014 vega avila et al 2015 on the other hand the negative feedback effect of soil microorganisms on grapevine growth would be highlighted under unsuitable soil moisture conditions too high or too low the beneficial bacteria will decrease sardans and penuelas 2010 tian et al 2012 and the harmful microorganisms will increase sharply which will weaken grapes pathogen protection ability and ultimately reduce the yield and quality thus carefully distinguish of water sensitive growth promoting and harmful bacteria in soils and appropriate soil water control measures may increase beneficial effects or alleviate adverse effects on soil microbial community structures and grape growth the protected cultivation grape was common in asia china japan and korea the netherlands and italy china was a major country involved in grape cultivation and the planting area reached about 799 200 ha up to 11 of the world total cultivation area in 2017 tian et al 2019 in recent years the protected cultivation grape rapidly developed in china and its planting area was 200 000 ha which played an important role in the annual supply of table grapes however there are few studies caring about the relationship between soil microorganisms and water regulation of protected cultivation grape the main types of water sensitive beneficial bacteria community and its suitable soil water content range in vineyards are still not clear in this study we conducted a greenhouse experiment which considered different soil water management schemes to distinguish water sensitive bacteria at two important grapevine growing stages flowering and fruit enlargement stages the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing method was used which allowed us to comprehensively explore the diversity of bacterial communities under different soil water content condition here we designed two hypotheses 1 water stress treatments can change the diversity richness and structure of the bacterial community in grapevine soil however the effects may be fluctuating and gradually disappear with the transformation from the drought stress to the re water condition 2 some beneficial bacteria in greenhouse grape soil are sensitive to moisture and their numbers are improved by drought stress during a suitable grapevine growth period on the contrary some hydrophilic bacteria decrease accordingly under the drought stress condition 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment description the field experiment was conducted at the yongdeng irrigation experiment station 36 43 34 n 103 16 24 e gansu province china the altitude here is 2100 m and the climate is typical continental monsoon climate the area belongs to a semiarid region with the mean annual rainfall and temperature are 290 mm and 5 9 c respectively the annual lowest and highest temperatures vary from 28 1 c min to 34 4 c max the grape used for the experiment was vitiscv red globe which cultivated in a local traditional greenhouse the size of the greenhouse was 8 60m2 and the walls were made of compacted local earth breadth about 80 cm the steel truss was used to support the roof that consisted of two layers plastic and straw curtain which could be raised or lowered manually according to the needs for indoor temperature humidity and light intensity the grapevine has cultivated for 7 years and the plant distance was 2 0 m between rows and 0 8 m along rows the growth period of the grape was divided into five stages i e budburst may 9th may 24th shoot elongation may 25th june 22th flowering june 23rd july 10th fruit enlargement july 11st september 8th coloring and mature september 9th december 9th stages according to the temperature humidity and rainfall table 1 the average field capacity fc of experimental soil was 0 272 cm3 cm 3 and the bulk density was about 1 41 g cm 3 the other soil properties were shown in table 2 the water stress experiment was conducted from 2015 to 2017 in order to study the effects of water stress on soil microorganisms at different growth stages a mild drought stress in soil according to the field water capacity with a percentage of 50 75 was considered at each growth stage of grapes zhang et al 2017b that means totally five water stress treatments were designed i e bs treatment mild water stress during budburst period ss treatment mild water stress during shoot elongation period fs treatment mild water stress during flowering stage es treatment mild water stress during fruit enlargement period cs treatments mild water stress during coloring and mature period before and after the mild water stress grapes were irrigated normally with adequate water supply a control treatment ck with adequate water supply during each growth stages were also designed according to the soil water management regime of local farmers the soil water content of which was 75 100 fc during the whole growing period of grapes table3 each treatment had three replicates and totally 18 plots were used with each size of 8 m long and 2 m wide a randomized block design was used for the plot distribution small tube flow irrigation was used in this experiment with one tube on each row the outlet tube with a diameter of 4 mm was installed in the branch pipe with a diameter of 32 mm the installation distance of the tube was 50 cm and the tube flow rate was8l h the soil water content was tested by the oven drying method the irrigation for each plot was conducted only when the soil water content reached to the designed lower limit table 3 groundwater the features were shown in table 4 was used for the irrigation and the irrigation quota for each time was 270 m3 hm 2 the exact irrigation amount was monitored by water meters after irrigation the soil moisture contents of all treatments reached 100 fc however during the stress period the soil moisture contents of the mild drought stress treatments can only reach up to 75 fc the total irrigation amount for each water regulation treatment was different as shown in table 3 a polyethylene geomembrane with a thickness of 2 mm was laid between the plots to the soil depth of 1 m to prevent the diffusion of soil water between different plots the fertilization pruning pest control and weeding for all plots were the same according to the local grape cultivation and management 2 2 soil sampling soil samples for testing initial soil properties were collected at the beginning of grapevine budburst stage in 2017 five soil cores 3 cm diameter near the grapevine rows about 30 cm distance in each plot were taken to a depth of 80 cm and sectioned into 20 cm increments then the samples in each plot were pooled together by depth and transported to the laboratory for soil texture analysis at the same time five soil cores 3 cm diameter in each plot were taken from the top 20 cm and then combined to make homogeneous samples in the same plot before taken to the laboratory in the lab the samples were sieved through 2 mm mesh and air dried to determine soil reaction organic matter effective nitrogen available p and available p furthermore three large arbitrary soil scores were taken to a depth of 10 cm 30 cm 50 cm 70 cm using a steel cutter edge cylinders 5 05 cm diameter 5 cm heght 100cm3 volume in each plot and then were taken to the laboratory to test soil bulk density the testing methods of soil properties and initial soil properties value were shown in table 2 soil samples for dna extraction and microbial community structures were collected during the important phase of grapevine on july 14th flowering stage fs and august 10th early fruit development stage es 2017 after removing the surface layer soil 0 5 cm samples were collected close to randomly chosen vine root in each plot at 5 20 cm depth using a shovel three sites were chosen in each plot when the grape root was detected in the topsoil three soil cores 3 cm diameter were taken near the root the roots in the soil cores were removed and the soil close to the roots was collected using sterile gloves and considered as the part of the samples novello et al 2017 taylor et al 2014 the three soil cores were then pooled together in order to obtain a homogeneous sample all soil samples were packed in ice blocks and transported to the laboratory within 24 h for further analysis

the default quality threshold value is 19 and a set length the default length value is 3 b tags length filtering tags obtained from the interception of tags further filter out the tags in which the continuous high quality base length was less than 75 of the tags length tags obtained from the above processing needed to be processed to remove the chimera sequence http www drive5 com usearch manual chimera formation html and the tags sequence was compared with the database gold database http drive5 com uchime uchime download html edgar et al 2011 to detect the chimera sequence and finally remove the chimera sequence haas et al 2011 to obtain the final effective tags table 5 all the effective tags of all samples were clustered by using the uparse software uparse v7 0 1001 http drive5 com uparse edgar 2013 the sequences were clustered into otus operational taxonomic units with 97 identity at the same time the representative sequence of otus was selected according to its algorithm principle the sequence with the highest frequency in otus would be selected as the representative sequence of otus the otus representative sequence was annotated by species species annotation was analyzed with mothur method and ssurrna database quast et al 2013 setting threshold of 0 8 1 of silva http www arb silva de wang et al 2007 to obtain taxonomic information and count the community composition of each species at each classification level phylum class order family genus species muscle software edgar 2004 version 3 8 31 http www drive5 com muscle was used to perform fast multi sequence alignment and obtained the phylogenetic relationships of all otus representative sequences finally the data of each sample was homogenized and the data with the least amount of data in the sample was homogenized for alpha diversity analysis 2 6 data analysis in order to analyze the alpha diversity the values of observed species shannon simpson chao1 ace goods coverage and pd whole tree sum of branch lengths between all representatives on phylogenetic tree were calculated using the qiime software version 1 9 1 the differences in alpha diversity index among treatments groups were analyzed using the lsd method in ibm spass statistics software version 19 and the lsd values were tested at 5 level of significance the r software version 2 15 3 was used to draw the relative abundance chart in different classification levels based on the results of the microbial sequencing and the main species with the largest abundances in three classification level phylum order genus were selected to draw the cumulative map under different water stress treatments the differences between different samples the change in the microbial community structure were analyzed using non metric multi dimensional scaling method r software version 2 15 3 3 results 3 1 effects of water stress on soil microbial diversity as can be seen from the table 6 the fs treatment got the highest observed median number of bacterial species at the flowering period 4903otus which was significantly higher than ck treatment the median value of shannon s index was higher in fs treatment than in ck and any other treatments at flowering stage in addition the fs treatment also obtained the maximum values of simpson chao1 and ace furthermore the value of pd whole tree index in fs treatment was significantly higher than in ck treatment p 0 05 however the value of goods coverage in fs treatment was significantly lower than in ck treatment table 7 was the analysis of alpha indices at early fruit enlargement stage the es treatment got the maximum values of observed species shannon s index chao1 ace pd whole tree index and simpson the values in es treatment were all significantly higher than in ck treatment p 0 05 except for the value of simpson however the value of goods coverage in es treatment was significantly lower than in ck treatment which was consistent with fs treatment at flowering stage 3 2 effects of water stress on soil microbial relative abundance at flowering stage the relative abundances of phyla at the flowering stage are shown in fig 1 a proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phylum which represented about 40 frequencies and there was no significant difference between different treatments firmicutes and actinomycetes were the other two main types of phyla and actinomycetes relative abundance did not significantly change between all water stress treatments the relative abundance of firmicutes was only 11 in fs treatment significantly lower than in ck treatment with the relative abundance of 16 in addition the abundance of firmicutes in gs and ps treatments was also lower than in ck es and cs treatments xanthomonadales nitrosomonadales and rhizobiales which belongs to proteobacteria were the three main orders fig 2 a the frequencies of them did not obviously vary in different treatments clostridiales and bacillales which belongs to 16 in addition the abundance of firmicutes in gs and ps treatments was also lower than in ck es and cs treatments xanthomonadales nitrosomonadales and rhizobiales which belongs to proteobacteria were the three main orders fig 2a the frequencies of them did not obviously vary in different treatments clostridiales and bacillales which belongs to firmicutes were the other main orders in grape rhizosphere soils and the relative abundance of clostridiales in fs treatment at the flowering stage was significantly lower than in ck treatment in addition the relative abundances of clostridiales in gs and ps treatments were also significantly lower than in other treatments es cs at genus level there were so many bacterial species types in the soil that the proportion of total others except top 10 genus was up to 80 even so clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the dominant genus which accounts for about 5 fig 3 a the lowest frequency of which appeared in fs treatment the relative abundances of clostridium sensu stricto 1 in bs and ss treatments were also significantly lower than in es cs and ck treatments 3 3 effects of water stress on soil microbial relative abundance at early fruit enlargement stage similar to the relative abundance observed in the rhizosphere soil sampled at the flowering stage proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria were the main phyla at the early fruit enlargement stage fig 1b although the frequency of proteobacteria was obviously lower for es treatment than for gs treatment no obvious difference in the frequency of proteobacteria and actinobacteria was found between water stress treatments and ck treatments however the firmicutes relative abundance in fs treatment was only 8 significantly lower than in ck treatment 15 in addition the abundances of firmicutes in other water stress treatments were also lower than in ck treatment xanthomonadales was one of the main bacteria in grapevine soil at the order level fig 2a and 2b especially at the early fruit enlargement stage its relative abundances was up to about 15 fig 2b which was nearly twice that at the flowering stage therefore it became a dominant bacteria order there was no significant difference of xanthomonadales s relative abundances between es treatment and other treatments but the frequency of xanthomonadales in fs treatment was significantly higher than in ck clostridiales was another main order of bacteria the relross ref a furthermore the soil sample with es treatment was also clearly separated from other samples at the early fruit enlargement stage fig 4 b 4 discussion the soil microbial activity in the rhizosphere plays a vital role in soil quality and nutrient transformation and utilization compant et al 2010 zarraonaindia et al 2015 which could be affected by soil moisture one of the most important environmental factors arikan and pirlak 2016 soil microbial activity would be limited under drought conditions dietrich et al 2017 burns et al 2015 proved that precipitation affected soil bacterial community structure by affecting soil moisture in wine grapevine vineyards zhang et al 2017a studied the effects of supplementary irrigation on the soil microorganisms of stipabaicalensis steppe suggesting that lower soil moisture moderate water stress was beneficial to increase the bacterial otu richness and diversity at high nitrogen levels consistent with above researches we found that the observed species shannon simpson chao1 ace and pd whole tree in fs and es treatments were significantly higher than in all of the other treatments at the two sampling times flowering and early fruiting tables 6 and 7 that means the application of mild water stress during flowering and fruit enlargement of greenhouse grapevine can increase the diversity and richness of soil microorganisms in grapevine rhizosphere on the contrary the goods coverage which is an index of gene sequencing depth was significantly lower for the fs and es treatments than for the ck treatment during each corresponding water stress period indicating that water stress would reduce the bacterial gene sequencing depth furthermore the aforementioned alpha diversity parameters for the fs treatment returned to the same level as for the ck treatment at the early fruiting stage on re watering again table 7 no significant difference in the values of these parameters was found between the ss treatment and the ck treatment on re watering at the flowering stage table 6 thus these conclusions confirm the hypothesis 1 that water stress treatments can change the diversity richness and structure of the bacterial community in grapevine soil however the effects may be fluctuating and gradually disappear with the transformation from the drought stress to the re water condition proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria were the dominant phyla in grapevine rhizosphere soil fig 1a b there was no significant difference inthe relative abundance of proteobacteria in among all treatments the same results were found for actinobacteria the relative abundance of firmicutes in two water stress treatments fs es were significantly lower than ck during each corresponding water stress period in addition the relative abundance of firmicutes in other water stress treatments were also lower than in ck indicating that firmicutes were a very sensitive bacterium to drought stress the relative abundance of which would be reduced under drought stress largely confirming hypothesis 2 sanchez et al 2014 found that firmicutes were the prevalent microbial communities in irrigation systems of an experimental greenhouse for tobacco crop growing she et al 2018 obtained a conclusion that supplementary precipitation significantly increased bacterial diversity in desert shrub soils and changed community composition by increasing the relative abundance of acidobacteria however in our study the relative abundance of acidobacteria had no difference between ck and the other water stress treatments the main reason may be that the soil moisture content adequate water supply or water stress treatment of protected grapevine cultivation were generally higher than the soil moisture content of desert shrub annual precipitation was 284 8 mm novello et al 2017 found that actinobacteria proteobacteria were the two dominant phyla in the rhizosphere soil of wine grapevines and the irrelative abundance ratio did not change significantly because of the sampling time or site that was consistent with the conclusion of this study clostridiales belongs to firmicutes was one of the main orders in grape rhizosphere soils and the relative abundance of clostridiales in fs treatment and in es treatment at the flowering and early fruiting stage were significantly lower than in ck treatment respectively in addition the relative abundances of clostridiales in all other enduring water stress treatments bs and ss were also significantly lower than in other treatments that had not yet undergone water stress fig 2a b that means clostridiales was very sensitive to water stress at the grape flowering period and early fruiting stage and water stress would reduce the relative abundance of them thus partly confirming our hypothesis 2 the genus clostridium belongs to firmicutes clostridiales in order clostridium can antagonize many kinds of pathogenic fungi meanwhile clostridium had the function of promoting soil nitrogen accumulation qian et al 2018 mowlick et al 2013 studied the soil microorganisms under brassica juncea plants and avenastrigosa plants irrigated with 20 or 30 moisture content the results of which showed that species in the genus clostridium were the dominant microorganisms in our experiments clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the dominant genus of clostridium in all the samples and its relative abundance in all mild water stress treatments was significantly lower than no undergoing water stress treatment fig 3a b that means clostridium sensu stricto 1 was also very sensitive to drought stress under which the frequency would be reduced the genus lysobacter belongs to proteobacteria xanthomonadales in order lysobacter can antagonize many kinds of pathogenic fungi bacteria and nematodes and play an important role in improving plant disease resistance christensen and cook 1978 panthee et al 2016 sullivan et al 2003 in our study lysobacter was another main bacterium in greenhouse grapevine soil there was no significant difference between the relative abundance of lysobacter in fs treatment and in ck at flowering stage fig 3a but the lysobacter s relative abundance of fs treatment was rapidly improved at early fruit enlargement period fig 3b indicating that lysobacter have re compensatory growth effect after re watering pontibacter had a strong ability to resist high radiation arid environment and to remove chlorinated herbicide in soil li et al 2018 wang 2011 succeeded in extracting and separating pontibacter strains from sandy soil samples from desert areas in xinjiang china pontibacter sp was a kind of bacteria involved in soil nitrogen cycling the application of green manure in the vineyard can significantly improve its richness longa et al 2017 in our study pontibacter in es treatment was significantly higher than in other treatments at the early fruit enlargement stage fig 3b suggesting that water stress was beneficial to improving the richness of pontibacter thus those results partly support the hypothesis 2 that some beneficial bacteria in greenhouse grape soil are sensitive to moisture and their numbers are improved by drought stress during a suitable grapevine growth period water stress at the flowering stage or early fruit enlargement period would lead to the change of the microbial community the samples of different water stress treatment were far apart fig 4a b that means the effects of water stress on grapevine soil bacteria structure was significantly different compared with ck and the other treatments confirming hypothesis 1 5 conclusions proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria were the main types of phylum in greenhouse grapevine rhizosphere soil and firmicutes was a very sensitive phylum to drought stress proteobacteria and actinobacteria were not sensitive to soil water stress xanthomonadales nitrosomonadales rhizobiales were main order belonging to proteobacteria and their frequency did not change in different water stress treatments clostridiales bacillales were two other main orders in the grapevine rhizosphere soil belonging to firmicutes and clostridiales was very sensitive to the water stress at the flowering stage and fruit enlargement stage the relative abundance of which would be reduced in mild water stress clostridium sensu stricto 1 was the main genus in protected cultivation grapevine rhizosphere soil at the flowering and early fruiting stage and it was very sensitive to drought stress the relative abundance of which would be reduced under drought stress lysobacter was another main genus water stress had little effect on it but it had compensatory growth effect after re watering pontibacter was the only genus that able to adapt to drought stress environment in this study water stress was beneficial to its growth in a word water stress would lead to the change of rhizosphere soil microbial community of grape in protected cultivation mild water stress at the flowering stage or at the fruit enlargement stage can increase the diversity and richness of soil microorganisms re watering after mild water stress improved the greenhouse grapevine soil environment which can help the growth of beneficial bacteria such as lysobacter could improve grapevine resistance to disease acknowledgments this

10843,in this work a new nitrogen load apportionment tool was developed to quantify the anthropogenic pressures from point sources and diffuse sources dss on the water in a basin and to identify the areas contributing most of the total nitrogen tn the model which is an alternative approach to complex conceptual models was tested in the canale d aiedda basin se italy it integrates the tn soil system budget ssb tn riverine export nre and tn export coefficient modelling the results of the ssb showed a tn surplus for productive land 60 kg ha 1 yr 1 major tn inputs were derived from fertilisers 89 kg ha 1 yr 1 77 of the total input and animal manure 13 kg ha 1 yr 1 11 of the total input crop uptake was the main output 39 kg ha 1 yr 1 70 of the total output nre was estimated through the measurement of streamflow and tn concentrations in two stream sections the average nre per unit area of productive land was 5 22 kg ha 1 yr 1 groundwater was the major receptor of the tn from dss the tn runoff export coefficients estimated on the basis of environmental factors and calibrated with riverine load measurements were lower than the tn leaching fractions the results show that setting export coefficients based only on environmental factors without any calibration leads to an overestimation of tn load in runoff and to an underestimation of tn load in leaching keywords

al 2019a in 2008 the organization for economic co operation and development oecd reported how the problem of nutrient input output imbalance had become common in all industrialised countries oecd 2008 several studies have been conducted on the balance export and consequent alterations in the natural cycle of n bouwman et al 2005 bouraoui et al 2010 grizzetti et al 2011 balestrini et al 2013 tzoraki et al 2014 mockler et al 2017 pinardi et al 2018 viaroli et al 2018 soana et al 2019 such studies have increased the awareness that environmental policies are fundamental to managing the nutrient cycle in this context the european water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec and the nitrates directive directive 91 676 eec 1991 stand as the most significant european legislation the main objective of the wfd is the achievement of a good ecological status in all water bodies across europe meanwhile the nitrates directive requires the member states of the european union eu to control and reduce the water contamination by nitrates from agricultural sources that are polluting surface water and groundwater by promoting sustainable farming practices the implementation of both eu directives requires quantification of the anthropogenic pressures the estimation of nutrient riverine export and identification of the critical source areas malagó et al 2019b these tasks are difficult to manage especially in large areas where the heterogeneity of the environment and nutrient sources i e hot spots sinks is added to the complexity of hydrological and physical processes de girolamo et al 2017a in recent years several methodologies and tools have been developed to perform these tasks these methods include either simplified approaches such as statistical methods grizzetti et al 2005 export coefficient models centered on export coefficients or unit loads drewry et al 2006 and more complex approaches such as ecohydrological models schoumans et al 2009 lam et al 2010 sharifi et al 2019 or bayesian networks ticehurst et al 2007 nash et al 2010 lu et al 2013 the most suitable spatial unit for estimating diffuse pollution and developing nutrient balance is the basin scale barceló and sabater 2010 bartoli et al 2012 lassaletta et al 2012 castaldelli et al 2013 even if the variability of the environmental features entails a great uncertainty in the nutrient input and output estimations especially in data limited regions oenema et al 2003 de girolamo et al 2019 currently studies focusing on the total n tn budget in mediterranean basins are still scarce romero et al 2016 in these basins characterised by fragmented land use different management practices and high variability in climate as well as hydrological processes and environmental features the nutrient budget calculation is more difficult than in basins where the agronomic practices and environmental features are uniform de girolamo et al 2017a indeed the nutrient load that leaves the basin and reaches the river is the result of a complex interaction between the crop production system types and amounts of fertiliser and timing of their application and environmental factors slope soil properties hydrology and climate the overall objective of this paper was to develop a nitrogen load apportionment tool nat for basin scale application the specific objectives were the following i to estimate the annual tn budget at the basin scale ii to assess the tn riverine export through measurements of flow and nutrient concentrations iii to estimate the tn load in leaching and runoff by combining environmental features and monitoring data and iv to calculate the tn load apportionment and to identify the areas contributing most of the tn in the basin the proposed model constitutes an alternative approach to complex conceptual models for estimating nutrient load apportionment which generally require time and experienced staff in addition to specific knowledge of the processes acting in the basin the novel approach can be useful to support effective water management and long term sustainable land use planning in data limited areas characterised by intermittent river networks such as those that are typical of the mediterranean region the model was tested in the canale d aiedda basin se italy where the tn inputs and outputs were calculated using multiple data sources combined with field measurements it can be easily exported to other basins since it requires only a spreadsheet program gis software and data that are generally available 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the canale d aiedda stream basin area about 360 km2 is located in the apulia region se italy fig 1 and flows into the mar piccolo the basin area and its surroundings are subject to a considerable concentration of industries and mussel aquaculture in addition to agricultural activities due to the extent of the environmental impact in terms of health and ecological risk the area is included in the list of contaminated sites of national interest sito di interesse nazionale sin with the sin mare sea sin listed separately from the sin terra land sin the basin is characterised by a mean elevation of 168 m a s l ranging from 0 m to 517 m with morphologically depressed zones that are subject to flooding during particularly intense rainfall events i e the salina grande an area of about 10 km2 along the northern and eastern borders of the canale d aiedda basin the main lithological unit is fractured limestone the central part is characterised by clayey silty sandy and arenitic units and the north eastern part by terraced marine deposits www geositipuglia eu in the basin extensive agriculture is the predominant anthropogenic activity vineyards olive groves almond orange vegetables and arable crops are the main products breeding activity is limited three urban wastewater treatment plants discharge effluent into the stream system the main stream flows through the la vela wetland 1 16 km2 which is included in the site of community importance mar piccolo it9130004 that offers shelter and food to resident and migratory birds the climate is typically mediterranean with wet winters and warm dry summers the mean monthly temperatures range between 9 4 c in january and 27 5 c in august 1991 2012 a significant difference is recorded in the rainfall between the mountainous 855 9 mm and plains 576 2 mm areas from july to november rainfall is mostly concentrated in a few events of short duration and high intensity the stream system shows an intermittent character d ambrosio et al 2019 2 2 nitrogen load apportionment tool the nat is composed of three modules fig 2 module 1 the tn soil system budget ssb provides the tn surplus or deficit at the basin scale module 2 tn riverine export quantifies the tn riverine export at the outlet using measures of streamflow and tn concentrations module 3 the export coefficient model determines the tn load in the leaching and runoff integrating modules 1 and 2 the final result of the integration of the three modules is the estimation of tn load apportionment and the identification of the areas contributing most of the tn load to the surface waters and groundwater in the basin module 1 requires crop production data crop types and relative areas fertiliser types crop yields livestock data animal types numbers of animals and atmospheric deposition module 2 requires daily streamflow and tn concentration data for estimating riverine load module 3 requires spatial data land use soil rainfall distribution slope layers a geodatabase was implemented that includes distributed and point data d ambrosio et al 2019 the land cover map for the basin corine land cover level iv http www pcn minambiente it was reclassified according to field surveys data on local agricultural practices and animal farming i e fertiliser amount number and species of animals were collected from different sources local dealers the literature and integrated with official data such as that from the census of agriculture by the istituto nazionale di statistica istat 2010 and interviews with farmers since surface water and groundwater quality data were not available for the canale d aiedda basin a monitoring plan was defined on the basis of a limited economic budget the surface water was sampled over a period of 12 months from august 2017 to july 2018 in two stream sections near the outlet of the stream a and b fig 1 continuous measurements of streamflow were recorded and discrete samples were taken at a fortnightly or monthly frequency the concentrations of tn nitrate n no3 nitrite n no2 and ammonia n nh4 were determined d ambrosio et al 2019 to evaluate the pollution contribution from point sources pss such as urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharging into the stream system the tn concentrations were measured at the outlets of the wwtps fig 1 because official data were limited 2 2 1 total nitrogen soil system budget module 1 the tn balance δn was computed through the ssb on a yearly basis august 2017 july 2018 estimating the tn amount respectively entering and leaving the canale d aiedda basin according to the equation 1 nsf naf nbf nad ncu nv nd δn where nsf is the tn input from fertilisers naf is the tn input from animal farming nbf is the tn input from biological fixation nad is the tn input from atmospheric deposition ncu is the tn crop uptake nv is ammonia nh3 volatilisation from urea and ammonium nitrate and nd is denitrification in the soil a spreadsheet containing the formulae for the computation of each term in eq 1 was used for details see supplementary table s1 the naf was considered to be the supply of manure to herbage pasture fallow land bushes and shrubs based on livestock data istat 2010 the naf was calculated by multiplying the live weight each animal species by the animal specific tn excretion rates perelli and pimpini 2003 ministry of agriculture and forestry 2006 a reduction equal to 32 5 and 10 of the tn was applied in order to consider the denitrification and volatilisation losses due to the storage and handling of the manure soana et al 2011 castaldelli et al 2013 the nsf was estimated for each crop from official data istat 2010 which were available only at the province level since the canale d aiedda basin lies within two provinces and the average amount of fertiliser used at the province level was lower than that based on the farmers interviews an adjustment was performed the nbf the sum of the contributions of each n fixing crop species was obtained by multiplying the rate of tn biological fixation by the surface area of each crop e g broad beans vetch and legumes castaldelli et al 2013 de girolamo et al 2017a the nad was assumed to be equal to 5 5 kg ha 1 across the entire basin following the procedure of de girolamo et al 2017a based on that of the conecofor network marchetto et al 2014 in the n cycle ncu nv and nd represent the main outputs the nv was estimated as 16 and 6 of the tn from urea and ammonium nitrate respectively soana et al 2011 castaldelli et al 2013 the tn removed with the harvest was evaluated for the main cultivations by multiplying the specific yield by the crop uptake coefficient grignani et al 2003 lastly the nd was assumed to equal 10 of the tn supplied to the farmed land soana et al 2011 castaldelli et al 2013 while the denitrification from non productive lands was considered to be negligible smil 1999 2 2 2 total nitrogen riverine export module 2 the riverine export nre the tn that reaches a stream was determined in river sections a and b fig 1 via three methods i intersample mean concentration eq 2 ii intersample mean concentration using mean flow eq 3 and iii linear interpolation of the concentration eq 4 considering the low correlation between nutrient concentration and streamflow r2 0 3 regression methods were not applied quilbé et al 2006 i the intersample mean concentration method m1 employs averaged concentration values to evaluate unsampled days and daily measured streamflow eq 2 2 n r e m 1 j 1 n c j c j 1 2 q j where cj is the jth sample concentration qj is the jth flow and n is the concentration measurement i the intersample mean concentration using the mean flow method m2 adopts the average daily concentration on non sampled days which is estimated by the average of the concentrations from the last to the next sample date the flow is supposed to be the average flow up to the next sampled concentration value eq 3 3 n r e m 2 j 1 n c j c j 1 2 q j 1 where q j 1 is the average flow to the end of the j 1 period i iii the linear interpolation concentration method m3 is based on the assumption that the concentration on non sampled days is a linear interpolation between the sampled concentrations fortnightly or monthly eq 4 4 n r e m 3 j 1 n c j c j 1 2 q j where q j is the intersample mean flow evaluated over the period between j and j 1 for each month which is the time step of the computation loads differ from one method to another and consequently different values for the annual load are expected it is well known that such estimations of load are affected by an uncertainty due to the different sources such as the estimation method used defined as knowledge uncertainty the variability of the measurements stochastic uncertainty and unrepresentative measurements or sampling measurement uncertainty etchells et al 2005 de girolamo et al 2017b 2018 d ambrosio et al 2019 in the present work since no information was available about the data variability and any errors in the measurements the corresponding uncertainties were ignored and so the quantified knowledge uncertainty is likely to be more conservative etchells et al 2005 the mean value of the three estimations was assumed to be a measure of the monthly load and the knowledge uncertainty was expressed as the coefficient of variation the mean minimum and maximum monthly values between nre m1 nre m2 and nre m3 were retained for assessing the annual mean nre mean minimum nre min and maximum nre max nre respectively for details see supplementary table s2 2 2 3 export coefficient model module 3 the fractions of tn from diffuse sources dss that reach the surface water and groundwater were estimated through the leaching αl k and runoff αr k export coefficients and the tn inputs the export coefficients were preventively estimated at the basin scale using the franke et al 2013 procedure and then calibrated using the nre d ambrosio et al 2019 the franke et al 2013 procedure is based on the assumption that αl k and αr k depend on both environmental factors and agricultural practices table 1 in this study slope was also considered to be an environmental factor influencing both leaching and runoff four slope classes fig 3 were defined from the slope map which was obtained from the digital elevation model dtm provided by the puglia region www sit puglia it a score s and a weight w were assigned to each influencing factor the score which depends on the characteristics of the area under consideration ranged from 0 very low to 1 very high meanwhile the weight which measures the importance of every influencing factor related to runoff and leaching ranged from 0 not related to 15 very related the watershed was preliminarily divided into land use systems luss defined as the areas characterised by a unique land use soil type slope and precipitation to this end the soil types were reclassified on the basis of the hydrologic group rating criteria provided by the united states department of agriculture s soil conservation service usda scs 1985 five hydrological soil groups c sandy clay loam d clay bt sandy on fractured limestone ct sandy clay loam on fractured limestone and dt clay on fractured limestone were identified as well as 14 land use classes and four slope classes fig 3 in the analysis 10 precipitation gauges were considered and the thiessen method was applied to spatialise the rainfall which produced 10 rainfall zones considering the four layers land use soil slope and rainfall in the gis environment 1405 luss were identified the leaching αl k and runoff αr k fractions were calculated for each lus using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 α l k α m i n k s k w k k w k α m a x α m i n where αmin and αmax are the minimum and maximum leaching and runoff export coefficients assumed here to be 0 01 and 0 25 respectively franke et al 2013 for both eqs 5 and 6 s k is the score and w k is the weight for the leaching of the k lus 6 α r k α m i n k s k w k k w k α m a x α m i n where s k is the score and w k is the weight for the runoff of the k lus for details see supplementary tables s3 and s4 the tn in the runoff at the watershed outlet r kg yr 1 and the tn in the soil and leaching at the basin scale l kg yr 1 were assessed using eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 r k 1 n 1405 α r k i k a k 8 l k 1 n 1405 α l k i k a k where n is the number of identified luss ik kg ha 1 yr 1 is the sum of the inputs from the dss nsf naf nbf and nad as indicated in section 2 2 1 to the k lus and ak ha is the surface of the k lus the values obtained with eqs 7 and 8 must equalise the tn runoff rm and tn leaching lm estimated through the δn and the tn riverine export respectively following eqs 9 and 10 9 r m n r e n p s n n a t 10 l m δ n r m where nps kg yr 1 is the tn from the wwtps estimated using official data and water quality measurements d ambrosio et al 2019 for details see supplementary table s5 nnat kg yr 1 is the tn load naturally present in the surface waters that was calculated by multiplying the measured streamflow at sections a and b by the natural tn concentration which was assumed to equal 0 375 mg l 1 franke et al 2013 for details see supplementary table s6 an optimisation procedure was applied to obtain the calibrated values of αr k and αl k mcfarland and hauck 2001 d ambrosio et al 2018a for this an optimisation model in excel was used to define the objective function and the equality constraint equality between eqs 7 and 9 and between eqs 8 and 10 respectively the solver which works by computing the formulae in the objective and constraint cells adjusts the values in the cells to satisfy the constraint the procedure was replicate by using nre mean nre min and nre max in eqs 9 and 10 for details see supplementary table s7 3 results 3 1 total nitrogen soil system budget the δn was assessed on a yearly time scale at the basin level area 35 849 ha and also with reference to the productive land only area 19 608 ha the results are summarised in table 2 the sum of the tn input from dss σ input at the basin level was quantified as 2359 0 t yr 1 which divided by the basin area gave a specific tn of approximately 66 kg ha 1yr 1 the main sources of tn were nsf 1740 9 t yr 1 and naf 251 5 t yr 1 while nbf 169 5 t yr 1 and nad 197 2 t yr 1 represent lower contributions as expected the σ input of the tn from dss from productive land showed a higher contribution per unit area 115 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 with 76 8 of the input due to nsf the sum of the tn output σ output at the basin scale was assessed to be 1104 2 t yr 1 specific value 30 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 the main contribution derived from ncu the surplus δn calculated as the difference between the σ input and the σ output was 1254 8 t yr 1 corresponding to 35 0 kg ha 1 yr 1 at the basin scale and to 59 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 considering the productive land only a value for tn fertiliser use efficiency ncu divided by nsf equal to 44 was estimated meanwhile for the whole basin the ratio between σ output and σ input was 47 tables 3 and 4 report the tn inputs aggregated per crop family and the tn production data per animal type respectively the supplementary table s1 includes the data for each specific crop and the tn budget calculations 3 2 total nitrogen riverine export the riverine export nre was estimated at the outlet as the sum of the contributions measured in the stream sections a 34 2 km2 and b 316 4 km2 fig 1 table 5 shows the monthly values of riverine export as the results of the three load estimation methods nre m1 nre m2 nre m3 and the knowledge uncertainty the average annual contribution per unit area of the nre computed at the basin scale was 2 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 and for the productive land only 5 2 kg ha 1 yr 1 the annual nre in stream section a ranged between 28 160 3 kg yr 1 and 30 724 9 kg yr 1 meanwhile the annual nre in stream section b ranged between 69 695 6 kg yr 1 and 7615 2 kg yr 1 the specific load nre kg ha 1 yr 1 estimated for the subbasins upstream of stream sections a and b were 8 2 8 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 2 2 2 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively this discrepancy is mainly due to the soil texture indeed thin soils with high infiltration rates on fractured limestone constituted about 3 and 49 in subbasins a and b respectively the annual tn load delivered to the mar piccolo was estimated to be in the range 97 856 0 nre min 107 040 1 nre max kg yr 1 these results confirm the study performed at the regional scale by malagó et al 2019a uncertainty associated with the monthly tn riverine load ranged from 0 2 in august to 20 5 in december the highest values of uncertainty were recorded in june and december when the nre estimated using method m3 was reasonably lower than determined using the other methods m1 and m2 indeed in december and june the transition between the dry or low flow and flowing phases and the flash floods which generally occur then may have had a significant influence on the averaging method results the tn from nps was 75 152 6 kg yr 1 calculated as the sum of the tn loads discharged into the stream network from the wwtps of s giorgio ionico 23 711 7 kg yr 1 monteiasi 45 851 9 kg yr 1 and montemesola 5589 1 kg yr 1 at the basin scale the ratio between the inputs from pss and dss was about 3 although this percentage is very low the contribution of pss to the surface waters in terms of annual tn load at the outlet was estimated at about 73 of the total load this is because the treated sewage from wwtps is dumped directly into the stream and the streamflow is generally low the nnat due to the natural background concentration of tn was 355 7 kg yr 1 obtained by summing the contributions from gauges a and b 127 7 kg yr 1 and 228 0 kg yr 1 respectively 3 3 export coefficient model total nitrogen in runoff and leaching the calibrated αl k ranged from 0 153 to 0 975 while αr k varied from 0 005 to 0 025 using the nre mean in eq 9 for details see supplementary table s7 the results of the calibration are summarised per plant group αl c and αr c in table 6 where for the sake of comparison we also report the export coefficients calculated by applying the modified franke et al 2013 procedure the uncertainty due to the variability of the nre in eq 9 associated with the estimated values of αl c and αr c ranged between 20 and 47 and from 34 to 49 respectively the calibrated values of αr k were lower than those obtained using the franke et al 2013 procedure while an opposite behaviour was found for αl k these results demonstrate that the calibration with local data and field measurements is fundamental for an accurate estimation of tn in leaching and runoff in addition these results indicate that in the canale d aiedda the leaching fraction is the main component of tn transport fig 4 shows the variability of αl k and αr k associated with each land use class the αl k values are higher than the values estimated for αr k and the variability of αl k from 0 15 to 0 94 for the majority of the luss is greater than that estimated for αr k 0 01 to 0 03 different land uses showed a similar variability especially for αl k i e durum wheat and mixed forest this result is not surprising as αl k and αr k depend on environmental factors and management practices that can be similar among luss 3 4 total nitrogen load apportionment within the basin the spatial distribution in the basin of the annual tn load per unit area kg yr 1 ha 1 in the leaching fig 5 a and runoff fig 5b was estimated for each lus by multiplying the ik by αl k and αr k respectively the specific tn load in the leaching ranged from 0 84 to 111 71 kg yr 1 ha 1 with a prevalent class of 20 45 kg yr 1 ha 1 these results confirm those of previous studies e g de vries et al 2011 the tn in the leaching had values much higher than the specific tn load in the runoff from 0 02 kg yr 1 ha 1 to 2 51 kg yr 1 ha 1 confirming that the groundwater is the principal receptor of the tn surplus in the canale d aiedda basin as expected the agricultural areas were characterised by the highest values of tn load both in leaching and runoff while the natural areas showed the lowest values in the study area soil type and rainfall amount were the main environmental factors controlling the export of tn from the land both via runoff and leaching while the slope factor exerted a minor influence this result is due to the fact that a large part of the basin falls in two slope classes prevalently 0 3 and 3 10 the areas contributing most of the tn in the leaching tn 70 kg ha 1 yr 1 were characterised by thin soils with high infiltration rates on fractured limestone bt ct figs 3 and 5a in these source areas the prevailing land use is vineyard and to a lesser extent orchard and olive cultivations the tn in the leaching from 40 to 70 kg ha 1 yr 1 was found in the luss characterised by vineyards and cereal production that experienced high amounts of rainfall the areas contributing most of the tn in the runoff tn 1 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 were characterised by soils with very low infiltration rates d and by vineyards as the predominant land use figs 3 and 5b olive cultivation in high rainfall zones is the predominant crop producing the tn load in runoff that ranges from 1 to 1 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 4 discussion the nat model quantifies the pressures caused by ps and ds on water bodies and identifies the areas contributing most of the tn in the basin via load apportionment the model can be considered to be an alternative approach to complex models de girolamo et al 2019 because it is designed to be applied in cases of limited resources i e economic time and data by staff without advanced skills in ecohydrological modelling it requires data that is generally available and measurements of streamflow and tn concentrations in a limited number of stream sections indeed data availability is a relevant issue that often imposes several restrictions on ecohydrological model application d ambrosio et al 2017 de girolamo et al 2017c ricci et al 2018 in the canale d aiedda basin the δn computed for the productive land showed a tn surplus 60 kg ha 1 yr 1 that was close to the average value estimated for eu countries 55 kg ha 1 yr 1 leip et al 2011 as for the majority of european catchments the surplus was mostly generated by synthetic fertilisation and animal farming which are the most significant nutrient inputs european environmental agency 2005 the tn budget varies considerably among the basins depending on the type of agriculture pärn et al 2012 in areas under intensive agriculture the surplus tn can be very high hatfield and follett 2008 leip et al 2011 in their study conducted in the 27 eu member states reported low values of tn surplus in countries specialising in extensive crop production such as bulgaria 23 kg ha 1 yr 1 and very high values 300 kg ha 1 yr 1 for countries with a high animal density such as the netherlands and malta in italy the balance expressed as kg of tn per ha of total agricultural land was estimated as 39 kg ha 1 yr 1 over the period 2002 2004 oecd 2008 however local studies have reported a very high tn surplus 180 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the po plain oglio basin 3800 km2 bartoli et al 2012 contrary to the result derived from the eastern po river valley valle volta 19 4 km2 by ventura et al 2008 who reported a negative tn balance 7 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 environmental factors and agricultural practices as well as the methodological approach used for the tn budget computation may have had a significant influence on the results de vries et al 2011 in addition the uncertainty associated with the input output data and the methodology can be considerable guo et al 2002 de girolamo et al 2019 the annual tn load delivered to the mar piccolo by the canale d aiedda stream falls within the range estimated by malagó et al 2019a in a regional scale study the average contribution per unit area of the nre 5 22 kg ha 1 yr 1 computed for the productive land was lower than that estimated from basins in southern italy de girolamo et al 2012 and spain romero et al 2016 this result is due to the fact that in the canale d aiedda basin the groundwater is the major receptor of the tn from dss the tn input from pss was only 3 of that coming from dss but constitutes a relevant pressure on the surface waters indeed high levels of n compounds have been found in the surface waters d ambrosio et al 2019 especially during the dry season when the dilution effect is very low or absent because of the intermittent character of the stream the export coefficient model has been widely used to estimate the nutrient load from dss exported from a basin ding et al 2010 generally export coefficients are determined by monitoring the nutrient exports from small basins with a predominant land use or from field plots reckhow et al 1980 however such export coefficients do not represent the average conditions within the basin mcfarland and hauck 2001 in well monitored basins multiple regression techniques can be used to improve the estimation of export coefficients shrestha et al 2008 in ungauged basins the coefficients are derived from the literature or are estimated from environmental characteristics franke et al 2013 but in these cases a large uncertainty may affect the results oenema et al 2003 in this work we used environmental factors to provide a preliminary estimation of the export coefficients that were then calibrated through streamflow and water quality measurements at two gauging stations covering almost the entire drainage area of the basin d ambrosio et al 2019 however the number and location of the monitoring sections is a relevant issue that has to be accurately defined especially in large basins as well as the frequency of the samplings the results show that the tn load was overestimated in runoff and underestimated in leaching when setting the export coefficients based only on environmental factors a different behaviour was found in the celone basin characterised by low permeability d ambrosio et al 2018a b where the tn in the runoff was underestimated using the franke et al 2013 procedure tn transport processes are strongly associated with soil infiltration rate wetness and water residence time hence we can argue that in basins characterised by very low or very high infiltration rates the procedure based on environmental factors alone should be applied with caution this is the case for the canale d aiedda where soil infiltration rate is the predominant environmental factor we can also deduce that the weight assignment is a key issue in this approach and even if as in this case the assigned weight to soil factor relevant to leaching was higher than that for runoff a calibration procedure for improving the export coefficient estimation is still needed furthermore it is important to highlight that this study refers to a single year august 2017 july 2018 because the water quality data were only available for this period thus longer time series would be more appropriate for representing average conditions and interannual variability 5 conclusions in this study a nat was developed and proposed as an alternative approach to more complex models aimed at quantifying the pressures on water bodies from pss and dss and identifying critical source areas through tn load apportionment the model s effectiveness was tested in the canale d aiedda a basin characterised by limited data availability and representative of the rural areas of the mediterranean region the main findings of this study include the model requires limited experience with spatial data processing and data that are generally available even if for large basins it might be necessary to integrate water quality data the results of the tn budget estimation based on one year of observations showed a surplus mainly due to fertiliser the tn surplus estimated for productive land was close to the average value estimated for the eu countries groundwater is the major receptor of the tn from dss tn inputs from pss are low compared with those from dss but these inputs could constitute relevant pressures for surface waters especially during the dry season when the dilution effect is absent or low due to the intermittent character of the canale d aiedda a calibration procedure to improve estimation of the tn export coefficients is needed because setting export coefficients based only on environmental factors resulted in an overestimation of the tn loads in runoff and an underestimation in leaching in the canale d aiedda basin the outputs of the model are designed to support long term river basin management and more sustainable land planning but it is important to underline that especially for large basins the results are affected by uncertainties and limitations that reflect the accuracy of the data more accurate results could be obtained by including additional gauging stations for streamflow and tn concentration measurements and for designing a groundwater quality monitoring network furthermore the estimation of tn retention in the fluvial system could be added to the modeling framework as currently the model does not include biogeochemical cycling

10843,in this work a new nitrogen load apportionment tool was developed to quantify the anthropogenic pressures from point sources and diffuse sources dss on the water in a basin and to identify the areas contributing most of the total nitrogen tn the model which is an alternative approach to complex conceptual models was tested in the canale d aiedda basin se italy it integrates the tn soil system budget ssb tn riverine export nre and tn export coefficient modelling the results of the ssb showed a tn surplus for productive land 60 kg ha 1 yr 1 major tn inputs were derived from fertilisers 89 kg ha 1 yr 1 77 of the total input and animal manure 13 kg ha 1 yr 1 11 of the total input crop uptake was the main output 39 kg ha 1 yr 1 70 of the total output nre was estimated through the measurement of streamflow and tn concentrations in two stream sections the average nre per unit area of productive land was 5 22 kg ha 1 yr 1 groundwater was the major receptor of the tn from dss the tn runoff export coefficients estimated on the basis of environmental factors and calibrated with riverine load measurements were lower than the tn leaching fractions the results show that setting export coefficients based only on environmental factors without any calibration leads to an overestimation of tn load in runoff and to an underestimation of tn load in leaching keywords

al 2019a in 2008 the organization for economic co operation and development oecd reported how the problem of nutrient input output imbalance had become common in all industrialised countries oecd 2008 several studies have been conducted on the balance export and consequent alterations in the natural cycle of n bouwman et al 2005 bouraoui et al 2010 grizzetti et al 2011 balestrini et al 2013 tzoraki et al 2014 mockler et al 2017 pinardi et al 2018 viaroli et al 2018 soana et al 2019 such studies have increased the awareness that environmental policies are fundamental to managing the nutrient cycle in this context the european water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec and the nitrates directive directive 91 676 eec 1991 stand as the most significant european legislation the main objective of the wfd is the achievement of a good ecological status in all water bodies across europe meanwhile the nitrates directive requires the member states of the european union eu to control and reduce the water contamination by nitrates from agricultural sources that are polluting surface water and groundwater by promoting sustainable farming practices the implementation of both eu directives requires quantification of the anthropogenic pressures the estimation of nutrient riverine export and identification of the critical source areas malagó et al 2019b these tasks are difficult to manage especially in large areas where the heterogeneity of the environment and nutrient sources i e hot spots sinks is added to the complexity of hydrological and physical processes de girolamo et al 2017a in recent years several methodologies and tools have been developed to perform these tasks these methods include either simplified approaches such as statistical methods grizzetti et al 2005 export coefficient models centered on export coefficients or unit loads drewry et al 2006 and more complex approaches such as ecohydrological models schoumans et al 2009 lam et al 2010 sharifi et al 2019 or bayesian networks ticehurst et al 2007 nash et al 2010 lu et al 2013 the most suitable spatial unit for estimating diffuse pollution and developing nutrient balance is the basin scale barceló and sabater 2010 bartoli et al 2012 lassaletta et al 2012 castaldelli et al 2013 even if the variability of the environmental features entails a great uncertainty in the nutrient input and output estimations especially in data limited regions oenema et al 2003 de girolamo et al 2019 currently studies focusing on the total n tn budget in mediterranean basins are still scarce romero et al 2016 in these basins characterised by fragmented land use different management practices and high variability in climate as well as hydrological processes and environmental features the nutrient budget calculation is more difficult than in basins where the agronomic practices and environmental features are uniform de girolamo et al 2017a indeed the nutrient load that leaves the basin and reaches the river is the result of a complex interaction between the crop production system types and amounts of fertiliser and timing of their application and environmental factors slope soil properties hydrology and climate the overall objective of this paper was to develop a nitrogen load apportionment tool nat for basin scale application the specific objectives were the following i to estimate the annual tn budget at the basin scale ii to assess the tn riverine export through measurements of flow and nutrient concentrations iii to estimate the tn load in leaching and runoff by combining environmental features and monitoring data and iv to calculate the tn load apportionment and to identify the areas contributing most of the tn in the basin the proposed model constitutes an alternative approach to complex conceptual models for estimating nutrient load apportionment which generally require time and experienced staff in addition to specific knowledge of the processes acting in the basin the novel approach can be useful to support effective water management and long term sustainable land use planning in data limited areas characterised by intermittent river networks such as those that are typical of the mediterranean region the model was tested in the canale d aiedda basin se italy where the tn inputs and outputs were calculated using multiple data sources combined with field measurements it can be easily exported to other basins since it requires only a spreadsheet program gis software and data that are generally available 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the canale d aiedda stream basin area about 360 km2 is located in the apulia region se italy fig 1 and flows into the mar piccolo the basin area and its surroundings are subject to a considerable concentration of industries and mussel aquaculture in addition to agricultural activities due to the extent of the environmental impact in terms of health and ecological risk the area is included in the list of contaminated sites of national interest sito di interesse nazionale sin with the sin mare sea sin listed separately from the sin terra land sin the basin is characterised by a mean elevation of 168 m a s l ranging from 0 m to 517 m with morphologically depressed zones that are subject to flooding during particularly intense rainfall events i e the salina grande an area of about 10 km2 along the northern and eastern borders of the canale d aiedda basin the main lithological unit is fractured limestone the central part is characterised by clayey silty sandy and arenitic units and the north eastern part by terraced marine deposits www geositipuglia eu in the basin extensive agriculture is the predominant anthropogenic activity vineyards olive groves almond orange vegetables and arable crops are the main products breeding activity is limited three urban wastewater treatment plants discharge effluent into the stream system the main stream flows through the la vela wetland 1 16 km2 which is included in the site of community importance mar piccolo it9130004 that offers shelter and food to resident and migratory birds the climate is typically mediterranean with wet winters and warm dry summers the mean monthly temperatures range between 9 4 c in january and 27 5 c in august 1991 2012 a significant difference is recorded in the rainfall between the mountainous 855 9 mm and plains 576 2 mm areas from july to november rainfall is mostly concentrated in a few events of short duration and high intensity the stream system shows an intermittent character d ambrosio et al 2019 2 2 nitrogen load apportionment tool the nat is composed of three modules fig 2 module 1 the tn soil system budget ssb provides the tn surplus or deficit at the basin scale module 2 tn riverine export quantifies the tn riverine export at the outlet using measures of streamflow and tn concentrations module 3 the export coefficient model determines the tn load in the leaching and runoff integrating modules 1 and 2 the final result of the integration of the three modules is the estimation of tn load apportionment and the identification of the areas contributing most of the tn load to the surface waters and groundwater in the basin module 1 requires crop production data crop types and relative areas fertiliser types crop yields livestock data animal types numbers of animals and atmospheric deposition module 2 requires daily streamflow and tn concentration data for estimating riverine load module 3 requires spatial data land use soil rainfall distribution slope layers a geodatabase was implemented that includes distributed and point data d ambrosio et al 2019 the land cover map for the basin corine land cover level iv http www pcn minambiente it was reclassified according to field surveys data on local agricultural practices and animal farming i e fertiliser amount number and species of animals were collected from different sources local dealers the literature and integrated with official data such as that from the census of agriculture by the istituto nazionale di statistica istat 2010 and interviews with farmers since surface water and groundwater quality data were not available for the canale d aiedda basin a monitoring plan was defined on the basis of a limited economic budget the surface water was sampled over a period of 12 months from august 2017 to july 2018 in two stream sections near the outlet of the stream a and b fig 1 continuous measurements of streamflow were recorded and discrete samples were taken at a fortnightly or monthly frequency the concentrations of tn nitrate n no3 nitrite n no2 and ammonia n nh4 were determined d ambrosio et al 2019 to evaluate the pollution contribution from point sources pss such as urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharging into the stream system the tn concentrations were measured at the outlets of the wwtps fig 1 because official data were limited 2 2 1 total nitrogen soil system budget module 1 the tn balance δn was computed through the ssb on a yearly basis august 2017 july 2018 estimating the tn amount respectively entering and leaving the canale d aiedda basin according to the equation 1 nsf naf nbf nad ncu nv nd δn where nsf is the tn input from fertilisers naf is the tn input from animal farming nbf is the tn input from biological fixation nad is the tn input from atmospheric deposition ncu is the tn crop uptake nv is ammonia nh3 volatilisation from urea and ammonium nitrate and nd is denitrification in the soil a spreadsheet containing the formulae for the computation of each term in eq 1 was used for details see supplementary table s1 the naf was considered to be the supply of manure to herbage pasture fallow land bushes and shrubs based on livestock data istat 2010 the naf was calculated by multiplying the live weight each animal species by the animal specific tn excretion rates perelli and pimpini 2003 ministry of agriculture and forestry 2006 a reduction equal to 32 5 and 10 of the tn was applied in order to consider the denitrification and volatilisation losses due to the storage and handling of the manure soana et al 2011 castaldelli et al 2013 the nsf was estimated for each crop from official data istat 2010 which were available only at the province level since the canale d aiedda basin lies within two provinces and the average amount of fertiliser used at the province level was lower than that based on the farmers interviews an adjustment was performed the nbf the sum of the contributions of each n fixing crop species was obtained by multiplying the rate of tn biological fixation by the surface area of each crop e g broad beans vetch and legumes castaldelli et al 2013 de girolamo et al 2017a the nad was assumed to be equal to 5 5 kg ha 1 across the entire basin following the procedure of de girolamo et al 2017a based on that of the conecofor network marchetto et al 2014 in the n cycle ncu nv and nd represent the main outputs the nv was estimated as 16 and 6 of the tn from urea and ammonium nitrate respectively soana et al 2011 castaldelli et al 2013 the tn removed with the harvest was evaluated for the main cultivations by multiplying the specific yield by the crop uptake coefficient grignani et al 2003 lastly the nd was assumed to equal 10 of the tn supplied to the farmed land soana et al 2011 castaldelli et al 2013 while the denitrification from non productive lands was considered to be negligible smil 1999 2 2 2 total nitrogen riverine export module 2 the riverine export nre the tn that reaches a stream was determined in river sections a and b fig 1 via three methods i intersample mean concentration eq 2 ii intersample mean concentration using mean flow eq 3 and iii linear interpolation of the concentration eq 4 considering the low correlation between nutrient concentration and streamflow r2 0 3 regression methods were not applied quilbé et al 2006 i the intersample mean concentration method m1 employs averaged concentration values to evaluate unsampled days and daily measured streamflow eq 2 2 n r e m 1 j 1 n c j c j 1 2 q j where cj is the jth sample concentration qj is the jth flow and n is the concentration measurement i the intersample mean concentration using the mean flow method m2 adopts the average daily concentration on non sampled days which is estimated by the average of the concentrations from the last to the next sample date the flow is supposed to be the average flow up to the next sampled concentration value eq 3 3 n r e m 2 j 1 n c j c j 1 2 q j 1 where q j 1 is the average flow to the end of the j 1 period i iii the linear interpolation concentration method m3 is based on the assumption that the concentration on non sampled days is a linear interpolation between the sampled concentrations fortnightly or monthly eq 4 4 n r e m 3 j 1 n c j c j 1 2 q j where q j is the intersample mean flow evaluated over the period between j and j 1 for each month which is the time step of the computation loads differ from one method to another and consequently different values for the annual load are expected it is well known that such estimations of load are affected by an uncertainty due to the different sources such as the estimation method used defined as knowledge uncertainty the variability of the measurements stochastic uncertainty and unrepresentative measurements or sampling measurement uncertainty etchells et al 2005 de girolamo et al 2017b 2018 d ambrosio et al 2019 in the present work since no information was available about the data variability and any errors in the measurements the corresponding uncertainties were ignored and so the quantified knowledge uncertainty is likely to be more conservative etchells et al 2005 the mean value of the three estimations was assumed to be a measure of the monthly load and the knowledge uncertainty was expressed as the coefficient of variation the mean minimum and maximum monthly values between nre m1 nre m2 and nre m3 were retained for assessing the annual mean nre mean minimum nre min and maximum nre max nre respectively for details see supplementary table s2 2 2 3 export coefficient model module 3 the fractions of tn from diffuse sources dss that reach the surface water and groundwater were estimated through the leaching αl k and runoff αr k export coefficients and the tn inputs the export coefficients were preventively estimated at the basin scale using the franke et al 2013 procedure and then calibrated using the nre d ambrosio et al 2019 the franke et al 2013 procedure is based on the assumption that αl k and αr k depend on both environmental factors and agricultural practices table 1 in this study slope was also considered to be an environmental factor influencing both leaching and runoff four slope classes fig 3 were defined from the slope map which was obtained from the digital elevation model dtm provided by the puglia region www sit puglia it a score s and a weight w were assigned to each influencing factor the score which depends on the characteristics of the area under consideration ranged from 0 very low to 1 very high meanwhile the weight which measures the importance of every influencing factor related to runoff and leaching ranged from 0 not related to 15 very related the watershed was preliminarily divided into land use systems luss defined as the areas characterised by a unique land use soil type slope and precipitation to this end the soil types were reclassified on the basis of the hydrologic group rating criteria provided by the united states department of agriculture s soil conservation service usda scs 1985 five hydrological soil groups c sandy clay loam d clay bt sandy on fractured limestone ct sandy clay loam on fractured limestone and dt clay on fractured limestone were identified as well as 14 land use classes and four slope classes fig 3 in the analysis 10 precipitation gauges were considered and the thiessen method was applied to spatialise the rainfall which produced 10 rainfall zones considering the four layers land use soil slope and rainfall in the gis environment 1405 luss were identified the leaching αl k and runoff αr k fractions were calculated for each lus using eqs 5 and 6 respectively 5 α l k α m i n k s k w k k w k α m a x α m i n where αmin and αmax are the minimum and maximum leaching and runoff export coefficients assumed here to be 0 01 and 0 25 respectively franke et al 2013 for both eqs 5 and 6 s k is the score and w k is the weight for the leaching of the k lus 6 α r k α m i n k s k w k k w k α m a x α m i n where s k is the score and w k is the weight for the runoff of the k lus for details see supplementary tables s3 and s4 the tn in the runoff at the watershed outlet r kg yr 1 and the tn in the soil and leaching at the basin scale l kg yr 1 were assessed using eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 r k 1 n 1405 α r k i k a k 8 l k 1 n 1405 α l k i k a k where n is the number of identified luss ik kg ha 1 yr 1 is the sum of the inputs from the dss nsf naf nbf and nad as indicated in section 2 2 1 to the k lus and ak ha is the surface of the k lus the values obtained with eqs 7 and 8 must equalise the tn runoff rm and tn leaching lm estimated through the δn and the tn riverine export respectively following eqs 9 and 10 9 r m n r e n p s n n a t 10 l m δ n r m where nps kg yr 1 is the tn from the wwtps estimated using official data and water quality measurements d ambrosio et al 2019 for details see supplementary table s5 nnat kg yr 1 is the tn load naturally present in the surface waters that was calculated by multiplying the measured streamflow at sections a and b by the natural tn concentration which was assumed to equal 0 375 mg l 1 franke et al 2013 for details see supplementary table s6 an optimisation procedure was applied to obtain the calibrated values of αr k and αl k mcfarland and hauck 2001 d ambrosio et al 2018a for this an optimisation model in excel was used to define the objective function and the equality constraint equality between eqs 7 and 9 and between eqs 8 and 10 respectively the solver which works by computing the formulae in the objective and constraint cells adjusts the values in the cells to satisfy the constraint the procedure was replicate by using nre mean nre min and nre max in eqs 9 and 10 for details see supplementary table s7 3 results 3 1 total nitrogen soil system budget the δn was assessed on a yearly time scale at the basin level area 35 849 ha and also with reference to the productive land only area 19 608 ha the results are summarised in table 2 the sum of the tn input from dss σ input at the basin level was quantified as 2359 0 t yr 1 which divided by the basin area gave a specific tn of approximately 66 kg ha 1yr 1 the main sources of tn were nsf 1740 9 t yr 1 and naf 251 5 t yr 1 while nbf 169 5 t yr 1 and nad 197 2 t yr 1 represent lower contributions as expected the σ input of the tn from dss from productive land showed a higher contribution per unit area 115 7 kg ha 1 yr 1 with 76 8 of the input due to nsf the sum of the tn output σ output at the basin scale was assessed to be 1104 2 t yr 1 specific value 30 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 the main contribution derived from ncu the surplus δn calculated as the difference between the σ input and the σ output was 1254 8 t yr 1 corresponding to 35 0 kg ha 1 yr 1 at the basin scale and to 59 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 considering the productive land only a value for tn fertiliser use efficiency ncu divided by nsf equal to 44 was estimated meanwhile for the whole basin the ratio between σ output and σ input was 47 tables 3 and 4 report the tn inputs aggregated per crop family and the tn production data per animal type respectively the supplementary table s1 includes the data for each specific crop and the tn budget calculations 3 2 total nitrogen riverine export the riverine export nre was estimated at the outlet as the sum of the contributions measured in the stream sections a 34 2 km2 and b 316 4 km2 fig 1 table 5 shows the monthly values of riverine export as the results of the three load estimation methods nre m1 nre m2 nre m3 and the knowledge uncertainty the average annual contribution per unit area of the nre computed at the basin scale was 2 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 and for the productive land only 5 2 kg ha 1 yr 1 the annual nre in stream section a ranged between 28 160 3 kg yr 1 and 30 724 9 kg yr 1 meanwhile the annual nre in stream section b ranged between 69 695 6 kg yr 1 and 7615 2 kg yr 1 the specific load nre kg ha 1 yr 1 estimated for the subbasins upstream of stream sections a and b were 8 2 8 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 2 2 2 4 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively this discrepancy is mainly due to the soil texture indeed thin soils with high infiltration rates on fractured limestone constituted about 3 and 49 in subbasins a and b respectively the annual tn load delivered to the mar piccolo was estimated to be in the range 97 856 0 nre min 107 040 1 nre max kg yr 1 these results confirm the study performed at the regional scale by malagó et al 2019a uncertainty associated with the monthly tn riverine load ranged from 0 2 in august to 20 5 in december the highest values of uncertainty were recorded in june and december when the nre estimated using method m3 was reasonably lower than determined using the other methods m1 and m2 indeed in december and june the transition between the dry or low flow and flowing phases and the flash floods which generally occur then may have had a significant influence on the averaging method results the tn from nps was 75 152 6 kg yr 1 calculated as the sum of the tn loads discharged into the stream network from the wwtps of s giorgio ionico 23 711 7 kg yr 1 monteiasi 45 851 9 kg yr 1 and montemesola 5589 1 kg yr 1 at the basin scale the ratio between the inputs from pss and dss was about 3 although this percentage is very low the contribution of pss to the surface waters in terms of annual tn load at the outlet was estimated at about 73 of the total load this is because the treated sewage from wwtps is dumped directly into the stream and the streamflow is generally low the nnat due to the natural background concentration of tn was 355 7 kg yr 1 obtained by summing the contributions from gauges a and b 127 7 kg yr 1 and 228 0 kg yr 1 respectively 3 3 export coefficient model total nitrogen in runoff and leaching the calibrated αl k ranged from 0 153 to 0 975 while αr k varied from 0 005 to 0 025 using the nre mean in eq 9 for details see supplementary table s7 the results of the calibration are summarised per plant group αl c and αr c in table 6 where for the sake of comparison we also report the export coefficients calculated by applying the modified franke et al 2013 procedure the uncertainty due to the variability of the nre in eq 9 associated with the estimated values of αl c and αr c ranged between 20 and 47 and from 34 to 49 respectively the calibrated values of αr k were lower than those obtained using the franke et al 2013 procedure while an opposite behaviour was found for αl k these results demonstrate that the calibration with local data and field measurements is fundamental for an accurate estimation of tn in leaching and runoff in addition these results indicate that in the canale d aiedda the leaching fraction is the main component of tn transport fig 4 shows the variability of αl k and αr k associated with each land use class the αl k values are higher than the values estimated for αr k and the variability of αl k from 0 15 to 0 94 for the majority of the luss is greater than that estimated for αr k 0 01 to 0 03 different land uses showed a similar variability especially for αl k i e durum wheat and mixed forest this result is not surprising as αl k and αr k depend on environmental factors and management practices that can be similar among luss 3 4 total nitrogen load apportionment within the basin the spatial distribution in the basin of the annual tn load per unit area kg yr 1 ha 1 in the leaching fig 5 a and runoff fig 5b was estimated for each lus by multiplying the ik by αl k and αr k respectively the specific tn load in the leaching ranged from 0 84 to 111 71 kg yr 1 ha 1 with a prevalent class of 20 45 kg yr 1 ha 1 these results confirm those of previous studies e g de vries et al 2011 the tn in the leaching had values much higher than the specific tn load in the runoff from 0 02 kg yr 1 ha 1 to 2 51 kg yr 1 ha 1 confirming that the groundwater is the principal receptor of the tn surplus in the canale d aiedda basin as expected the agricultural areas were characterised by the highest values of tn load both in leaching and runoff while the natural areas showed the lowest values in the study area soil type and rainfall amount were the main environmental factors controlling the export of tn from the land both via runoff and leaching while the slope factor exerted a minor influence this result is due to the fact that a large part of the basin falls in two slope classes prevalently 0 3 and 3 10 the areas contributing most of the tn in the leaching tn 70 kg ha 1 yr 1 were characterised by thin soils with high infiltration rates on fractured limestone bt ct figs 3 and 5a in these source areas the prevailing land use is vineyard and to a lesser extent orchard and olive cultivations the tn in the leaching from 40 to 70 kg ha 1 yr 1 was found in the luss characterised by vineyards and cereal production that experienced high amounts of rainfall the areas contributing most of the tn in the runoff tn 1 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 were characterised by soils with very low infiltration rates d and by vineyards as the predominant land use figs 3 and 5b olive cultivation in high rainfall zones is the predominant crop producing the tn load in runoff that ranges from 1 to 1 5 kg ha 1 yr 1 4 discussion the nat model quantifies the pressures caused by ps and ds on water bodies and identifies the areas contributing most of the tn in the basin via load apportionment the model can be considered to be an alternative approach to complex models de girolamo et al 2019 because it is designed to be applied in cases of limited resources i e economic time and data by staff without advanced skills in ecohydrological modelling it requires data that is generally available and measurements of streamflow and tn concentrations in a limited number of stream sections indeed data availability is a relevant issue that often imposes several restrictions on ecohydrological model application d ambrosio et al 2017 de girolamo et al 2017c ricci et al 2018 in the canale d aiedda basin the δn computed for the productive land showed a tn surplus 60 kg ha 1 yr 1 that was close to the average value estimated for eu countries 55 kg ha 1 yr 1 leip et al 2011 as for the majority of european catchments the surplus was mostly generated by synthetic fertilisation and animal farming which are the most significant nutrient inputs european environmental agency 2005 the tn budget varies considerably among the basins depending on the type of agriculture pärn et al 2012 in areas under intensive agriculture the surplus tn can be very high hatfield and follett 2008 leip et al 2011 in their study conducted in the 27 eu member states reported low values of tn surplus in countries specialising in extensive crop production such as bulgaria 23 kg ha 1 yr 1 and very high values 300 kg ha 1 yr 1 for countries with a high animal density such as the netherlands and malta in italy the balance expressed as kg of tn per ha of total agricultural land was estimated as 39 kg ha 1 yr 1 over the period 2002 2004 oecd 2008 however local studies have reported a very high tn surplus 180 kg ha 1 yr 1 in the po plain oglio basin 3800 km2 bartoli et al 2012 contrary to the result derived from the eastern po river valley valle volta 19 4 km2 by ventura et al 2008 who reported a negative tn balance 7 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 environmental factors and agricultural practices as well as the methodological approach used for the tn budget computation may have had a significant influence on the results de vries et al 2011 in addition the uncertainty associated with the input output data and the methodology can be considerable guo et al 2002 de girolamo et al 2019 the annual tn load delivered to the mar piccolo by the canale d aiedda stream falls within the range estimated by malagó et al 2019a in a regional scale study the average contribution per unit area of the nre 5 22 kg ha 1 yr 1 computed for the productive land was lower than that estimated from basins in southern italy de girolamo et al 2012 and spain romero et al 2016 this result is due to the fact that in the canale d aiedda basin the groundwater is the major receptor of the tn from dss the tn input from pss was only 3 of that coming from dss but constitutes a relevant pressure on the surface waters indeed high levels of n compounds have been found in the surface waters d ambrosio et al 2019 especially during the dry season when the dilution effect is very low or absent because of the intermittent character of the stream the export coefficient model has been widely used to estimate the nutrient load from dss exported from a basin ding et al 2010 generally export coefficients are determined by monitoring the nutrient exports from small basins with a predominant land use or from field plots reckhow et al 1980 however such export coefficients do not represent the average conditions within the basin mcfarland and hauck 2001 in well monitored basins multiple regression techniques can be used to improve the estimation of export coefficients shrestha et al 2008 in ungauged basins the coefficients are derived from the literature or are estimated from environmental characteristics franke et al 2013 but in these cases a large uncertainty may affect the results oenema et al 2003 in this work we used environmental factors to provide a preliminary estimation of the export coefficients that were then calibrated through streamflow and water quality measurements at two gauging stations covering almost the entire drainage area of the basin d ambrosio et al 2019 however the number and location of the monitoring sections is a relevant issue that has to be accurately defined especially in large basins as well as the frequency of the samplings the results show that the tn load was overestimated in runoff and underestimated in leaching when setting the export coefficients based only on environmental factors a different behaviour was found in the celone basin characterised by low permeability d ambrosio et al 2018a b where the tn in the runoff was underestimated using the franke et al 2013 procedure tn transport processes are strongly associated with soil infiltration rate wetness and water residence time hence we can argue that in basins characterised by very low or very high infiltration rates the procedure based on environmental factors alone should be applied with caution this is the case for the canale d aiedda where soil infiltration rate is the predominant environmental factor we can also deduce that the weight assignment is a key issue in this approach and even if as in this case the assigned weight to soil factor relevant to leaching was higher than that for runoff a calibration procedure for improving the export coefficient estimation is still needed furthermore it is important to highlight that this study refers to a single year august 2017 july 2018 because the water quality data were only available for this period thus longer time series would be more appropriate for representing average conditions and interannual variability 5 conclusions in this study a nat was developed and proposed as an alternative approach to more complex models aimed at quantifying the pressures on water bodies from pss and dss and identifying critical source areas through tn load apportionment the model s effectiveness was tested in the canale d aiedda a basin characterised by limited data availability and representative of the rural areas of the mediterranean region the main findings of this study include the model requires limited experience with spatial data processing and data that are generally available even if for large basins it might be necessary to integrate water quality data the results of the tn budget estimation based on one year of observations showed a surplus mainly due to fertiliser the tn surplus estimated for productive land was close to the average value estimated for the eu countries groundwater is the major receptor of the tn from dss tn inputs from pss are low compared with those from dss but these inputs could constitute relevant pressures for surface waters especially during the dry season when the dilution effect is absent or low due to the intermittent character of the canale d aiedda a calibration procedure to improve estimation of the tn export coefficients is needed because setting export coefficients based only on environmental factors resulted in an overestimation of the tn loads in runoff and an underestimation in leaching in the canale d aiedda basin the outputs of the model are designed to support long term river basin management and more sustainable land planning but it is important to underline that especially for large basins the results are affected by uncertainties and limitations that reflect the accuracy of the data more accurate results could be obtained by including additional gauging stations for streamflow and tn concentration measurements and for designing a groundwater quality monitoring network furthermore the estimation of tn retention in the fluvial system could be added to the modeling framework as currently the model does not include biogeochemical cycling

10844,water use efficiency wue is an important eco physiological index that reflects the relationship between ecosystem water and carbon cycles investigating the ecosystem wue contributes to a better understanding of the water carbon coupling mechanism in ecosystems we explored the responses of the daily ecosystem wue wuee and canopy wue wuec to several influential factors the dominant biophysical factor and the dominant water carbon flux component of the difference between wuee and wuec based on continuous measurements collected via an eddy covariance system sap flow system and microlysimeters over two growing seasons from 2017 to 2018 in a sparse vineyard in northwestern china the results showed that the seasonal averages for wuee and wuec were 0 52 g c kg h2o 1 and 1 96 g c kg h2o 1 respectively wuee and wuec responded weakly to the air temperature ta and showed a negative linear correlation to the photosynthetic active radiation par and vapor pressure deficit vpd wuee decreased significantly with the rising soil water content swc while wuec showed a weak response both wuee and wuec exhibited positive linear relationships with the leaf area index lai the results from a structural equation model sem indicated that among the biophysical controllers swc and lai were the top two controlling factors on the difference between wuee and wuec and swc played a dominant role the difference between wuee and wuec increased with the rising swc and decreased with the rising lai among the flux components including soil evaporation e transpiration t net ecosystem productivity nep and ecosystem respiration reco e dominated the discrepancy between wuee and wuec due to the strong control of swc on e this study highlights the strong control by the swc in regulating the ecosystem wue under a sparse canopy in an arid area keywords water flux carbon flux soil evaporation transpiration ratio carbon use efficiency eddy covariance 1 introduction water and carbon flux are important properties of ecosystem processes and functions singh et al 2014 as the ratio of carbon assimilation to water consumption the water use efficiency wue an important eco physiological index reflects the relationship between terrestrial water and carbon cycles and connects ecological processes with hydrological processes moreover the water use efficiency describes the relative rates of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere and the evapotranspiration from the ecosystem to the atmosphere de wit 1958 baldocchi 1994 yu et al 2004 li et al 2015 and it has been widely used to evaluate water consumption by terrestrial carbon sink components tong et al 2014 the arid region of northwestern china receives abundant sunlight which makes it suitable for viticulture over the past decade vineyards have been planted on a large scale in this region however this area suffers from severe water shortages and its agricultural water use has not been particularly effective moreover a growing population greater demand for food and diminishing water resources all add to the importance of using water efficiently in arid and semiarid areas thus the development of sustainable agriculture in this region requires water saving management practices and improved water use efficiency kang et al 2004 2008 2016 the wue is usually expressed at the ecosystem and canopy levels the canopy wue wuec can be expressed as the ratio of gross primary productivity to transpiration gpp t and the ecosystem wue wuee can be expressed as the ratio of gross primary productivity or net ecosystem productivity to evapotranspiration gpp et or nep et zhao et al 2007 hu et al 2008 tong et al 2009 2014 zhu et al 2014 li et al 2015 tan et al 2015 xie et al 2016 liu et al 2017 quan et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in addition the wuee nep et could be decomposed as a product of the gpp t and t et and the nep gpp hence the transpiration ratio t et and carbon use efficiency nep gpp would determine the difference between wuee nep et and wuec hu et al 2008 quan et al 2018 however previous studies have mostly focused on the ecosystem wue and they have usually substituted wuee gpp et for wuec gpp t as a result of the relatively small proportion of soil evaporation e to et and thus et and t were close in ecosystems with dense canopies yang et al 2010 tan et al 2015 furthermore compared with ecosystems with dense canopies such as forests vineyards are characterized by their sparse canopies with bare soil accounting for a larger proportion of the surface area which creates a large discrepancy between et and t kool et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 thus it is necessary to differentiate among research concerning wuee and wuec in sparse vineyards from that performed on denser canopies previous studies have indicated that biotic and abiotic factors control the wuee and wuec through their effects on the water and carbon flux such as the air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd solar radiation rs soil water content swc leaf area index lai and carbon dioxide concentration zhao et al 2007 hu et al 2008 tong et al 2009 reichstein et al 2010 tong et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 li et al 2015 tan et al 2015 xie et al 2016 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however studies on the simultaneous response of the wuee and wuec to the above factors have been quite limited additionally with the ratios leading to the difference between the wuee and wuec the responses of t et and nep gpp to the influential factors codetermine that of the difference between wuee and wuec regarding the t et many studies have demonstrated that there is a strong positive correlation between t et and lai and various functional forms have been developed kato et al 2004 kang et al 2007 hu et al 2008 gong et al 2017 however because of the relatively large e et in the sparse vineyard further study is needed as to whether e greatly affects the relationship between t et and lai and thus the difference between wuee and wuec the nep gpp or carbon use efficiency is a common ecological indicator for evaluating the terrestrial carbon cycle and it represents the ability to transform carbon from the atmosphere into a potential carbon sink in ecosystems chen et al 2018 previous studies were primarily focused on forests and grasslands and long time scale studies have reported that nep gpp was controlled by the temperature precipitation nitrogen deposition stand age and drought delucia et al 2007 rambal et al 2014 chen et al 2018 liu et al 2019 however the regulation of the biophysical controls of the daily nep gpp and thus the difference between wuee and wuec in sparse vineyards is still poorly understood this study was conducted on measurements of water and carbon fluxes obtained via eddy covariance method during the 2017 2018 growing seasons in a sparse vineyard in arid northwestern china the primary objectives were as follows 1 to examine the seasonal dynamics in the difference between the daily wuee and wuec 2 to analyze the differential responses in the daily wuee and wuec to biotic and abiotic factors 3 to investigate the regulation of the controlling factors on daily t et as well as nep gpp and thus the difference between wuee and wuec and 4 to explore which flux component e t nep or ecosystem respiration reco and which biotic or abiotic factor dominated the difference between wuee and wuec

concentrated in the summer an annual average temperature of 8 c annual total sunshine of 2904 h and annual pan evaporation of 1926 mm this region suffers severe water shortages and the groundwater table is more than 25 m below the ground surface this experiment was performed at the experimental station of water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university in the shiyang river basin the area of the pinot noir vitis vinifera l cv pinot noir vineyard measures approximately 400 ha the vines were planted in 2014 and trained in a single cordon in north south rows the row spacing and plant spacing were 3 3 m and 0 5 m a vertical trellis system of three wires at 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 m high was used the soil texture is loamy clay with an average bulk density of 1 67 g cm 3 with a saturated soil water content of 0 38 cm3 cm 3 no cover crops were cultivated between the vines due to substantial surface area of exposed soil induced by wide space between the vines and thus a relatively low canopy cover the maximum canopy cover was 30 during the growing season the vineyard falls into the category of sparsely vegetated ecosystem kool et al 2014 the vineyard was drip irrigated from a line suspended 40 cm above the ground the discharge rate of the drip emitters was 3 l h 1 and the spacing between the emitters was 40 cm the growing season started from bud break in

from west to east the tops of the mls were deployed so that they were level with the soil surface and the mls were weighed daily at 19 00 local time by an electronic scale with a precision of 0 1 g the daily vineyard soil evaporation was derived from the average of the daily soil evaporation measured from the mls a sap flow system flow32 1 k dynamax usa was used to determine the vine transpiration t eight vines were randomly selected from within a 15 m radius circle centered on the ec system the sap flow was measured every 60 s and the 15 min average was recorded with a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific usa the sap flow l d 1 was scaled to the vine transpiration mm d 1 through the average ground area of each vine and the vineyard transpiration was obtained from the average transpiration of the monitored vines heilman et al 1994 the volumetric swc was monitored continuously at a 10 cm soil depth using ech2o soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc usa connected

between every two consecutive observations the meteorological parameters including the air temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation solar radiation and photosynthetic active radiation par were measured with a hobo automatic weather station onset computer corporation usa located near the vineyard at a height of 2 m at a distance of approximately 2 km from the vineyard the monthly averages of the primary meteorological parameters during the growing seasons are summarized in table 1 and fig 1 shows their seasonal variations the total precipitation was higher in 2018 than it was in 2017 and the precipitation events were concentrated in july and august for both years table 1 and fig 1d and e the seasonal average ta vpd and par were lower in 2018 than they were in 2017 while swc 10 cm was higher in 2018 than it was in 2017 due to greater irrigation and precipitation occurring in 2018 table 1 the climate in 2018 was wetter than it was in 2017 during the growing season 2 3 data processing and wue calculation raw ec data were processed using eddypro 4 2 1 li cor inc lincoln ne usa software in express mode the processed eddypro data were flagged with 0 highest quality 1

reco et e t and lai from 2017 to 2018 are shown in fig 2 the monthly averages of the parameters are shown in table 2 both the seasonal total and average carbon assimilation gpp nep were higher during the 2018 growing season than they were in 2017 primarily induced by higher photosynthetic capacity due to larger canopy in 2018 fig 2a b and e and table 2 the seasonal total gpp were 364 g c m 2 and 432 g c m 2 nep were 121 g c m 2 and 157 g c m 2 and reco were 243 g c m 2 and 275 g c m 2 for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons respectively the vineyard served as a carbon source during the early growing stage turned into a carbon sink starting from late may and was a net carbon sink during the entire growing season the seasonal total reco was higher in 2018 compared to that of 2017 possibly induced by higher plant respiration in 2018 which was reflected by the close relationship between reco and lai reco 0 72 lai 1 09 r2 0 51 p 0 001 the seasonal patterns in gpp nep and reco generally exhibited single peak curves which resembled those of the canopy development fig 2a d the seasonal total et were 339 mm and 370 mm e were 166 mm and 219 mm and t were 212 mm and 202 mm for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons respectively the seasonal total et was higher in 2018 than it was in 2017 when t were close for the two growing seasons while e was much higher in 2018 which was ascribed to the greater precipitation and irrigation in 2018 than in 2017 table 2 during the entire growing season the daily average et and t remained relatively lower during the early and late growing season and higher in the middle of the growing season the seasonal dynamics of daily e tracked closely with the variations in the surface swc 10 cm during late july of 2017 and late july and august of 2018 concentrated precipitation caused an abrupt increase in the swc and e consequently increased sharply figs 1d and 2e 3 2 daily wuee wuec wuee c t et and nep gpp the seasonal variations in the daily wuee wuec wuee c t et and nep gpp are shown in fig 3 the monthly averages of the parameters are shown in table 2 the seasonal average wuee were 0 49 g c kg h2o 1 and 0 55 g c kg h2o 1 and wuec were 1 74 g c kg h2o 1 and 2 19 g c kg h2o 1 for the two growing seasons respectively the seasonal variations in the daily wuee and wuec did not show any obvious and similar patterns relative to those of the gpp nep et or t figs 2 and 3a and b according to eq 6 the seasonal variation and magnitude in the difference between daily wuee and wuec were determined by both t et and nep gpp the daily wuee c the difference between the daily wuee and wuec were relatively higher smaller in the middle and lower larger during the early and late parts of the growing season fig 3c the seasonal average wuee c were 0 25 and 0 22 for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons suggesting a large difference between wuee and wuec in the sparse vineyard this finding was partly attributed to the low proportion of nep to gpp in addition t et was relatively smaller under sparse vegetation compared with that of the ecosystem with a dense canopy table 2 kool et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 the seasonal average t et were 0 61 and 0 56 for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons the seasonal t et pattern showed an obvious decline in late july and early august at approximately doy 220 for both years as a result of the concentrated precipitation that occurred during this period which increased the swc and thus e significantly over a short period of time figs 1d e and 2e moreover the remarkable decrease in t et during this period also led to a distinct decrease in wuee c which implied the strong action of the swc in regulating wuee c fig 3c and d seasonal variations in daily nep gpp presented one peak patterns similar to that of canopy growth which was primarily coregulated by nep and gpp and nep gpp varied mildly during the middle of the growing season fig 2d and 3e the seasonal averages for nep gpp were 0 36 and 0 38 for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons which meant that ecosystem respiration reco accounted for a larger proportion of gpp compared with nep our result fell within the range of nep gpp values in china s terrestrial ecosystems from 0 44 to 0 53 as reported by chen et al 2018 fig 4 shows that daily wuee and wuec were linearly correlated which was caused by the correlation between nep and gpp and between t and et notably when et was higher than nearly 5 kg h2o m 2 d 1 t started to fall which mostly occurred on the day after precipitation events when e increased significantly due to the sharp increase in swc under the effect of sufficient solar radiation and thus the proportion of t to et decreased fig 4b the strong positive linear correlation between nep and gpp reflected the stability of the carbon use efficiency which was primarily manifested during the middle of the growing season as shown in fig 3e and this correlation was also reported in other ecosystems fig 4c fernández martínez et al 2014 chen et al 2018 3 3 response of the daily wuee and wuec to the influential factors the relationships between the daily wuee nep et and ta vpd par swc 10 cm and lai during the growing seasons are shown in fig 5 similarly fig 6 exhibits the correlations between the daily wuec gpp t and the above influencing factors 3 3 1 response to the daily ta et and t nep and gpp increased linearly and significantly with the rising ta figs 5b1 and c1 and 6b1 and c1 yet neither wuee nor wuec was closely correlated with ta 3 3 2 response to the daily par and vpd both nep and gpp showed a weak response to the par and vpd fig 5b2 b3 and 6b2 b3 a similar result was observed in a nearby furrow irrigated vineyard by li et al 2015 et and t increased significantly with the rising par due to the greater available energy fig 5c2 and 6c2 the vpd had a positive linear effect on t and no significant effect on et which might have been caused by the weak correlation between e and the vpd fig 5c3 and 6c3 both wuee and wuec presented a negative linear correlation with the par and vpd fig 5a3 and 6a3 suggesting that these two climatic factors primarily influenced the water consumption progresses but insignificantly the carbon sequestration progresses 3 3 3 response to the daily swc nep gpp and t displayed a weak response to the swc while et increased significantly with the rising swc primarily due to the strong positive linear correlation between the swc and e under a sparse canopy figs 5d2 d3 6d2 d3 and 7 as a result wuee decreased significantly with the rising swc while wuec responded weakly fig 5d1 and 6d1 3 3 4 response to the daily lai as the lai increased gpp nep et and t increased significantly figs 5e2 e3 and 6e2 e3 due to the higher photosynthetic capacity of the vines and more water transpired in addition the increasing rate of carbon assimilation exceeded that of water consumption and thus both wuee and wuec exhibited significant positive linear correlations with the lai figs 5e1 and 6e1 indicating a relatively higher wue at both the ecosystem and canopy scales during the vigorous growth stage 3 4 regulation of daily t et and nep gpp on the daily wuee c according to eq 6 wuee c reflects the difference between wuee and wuec and it was influenced by both t et and nep gpp the ta vpd and par had weak control over t et as shown in fig 8 b1 b3 it is worth noting that among the five influential factors ta vpd par swc and lai t et was most highly correlated with the swc t et decreased significantly with the rising swc as a result of the strong positive response of e and the weak response of t to the swc figs 6c4 7 and fig 8b4 in addition the daily t et showed a downward parabolic relationship with the lai under a relatively small lai the t to et proportion increased with the rising lai and when the lai was greater than nearly 1 0 the high level of the swc and the resulting high e led to a declining t et with the rising lai as shown in fig 9 overall t et regulated the difference between wuee and wuec primarily through swc and lai the response of nep gpp to the ta par vpd swc and lai was similar to the nep and gpp responses to the above factors figs 5b1 b5 6b1 b5 and 8c1 c5 moreover as ta increased the increasing rate of nep was higher than that of gpp and hence the proportion of nep to gpp increased the par vpd and swc had weak control over nep gpp while nep gpp increased significantly with the rising lai due to the strong positive linear relationship between the carbon assimilation nep and gpp and the canopy growth lai figs 5b5 6b5 and 8c2 c5 notably the positive response of nep gpp to the lai also suggested that the augmented rate of nep was higher than that of gpp as the lai increased which could have been primarily attributable to the lower sensitivity of reco to the lai compared with that of nep compared with the abiotic factors the canopy growth lai explained more of the variation in the daily nep gpp in sparse vineyards which also implied that the regulation of nep gpp on the difference between wuee and wuec was realized through lai primarily as a result of the weak response of the daily nep gpp to the par and vpd and t et to the ta par and vpd the daily wuee c exhibited weak responses to the ta par and vpd fig 8a1 a3 among the five controlling factors the daily wuee c was most tightly correlated with the swc as the swc increased wuee c decreased significantly indicating a significantly larger difference between wuee and wuec as the swc increased figs 7 and 8a4 b4 the daily wuee c showed a downward parabolic relationship with the lai under a relatively small lai due to the positive response of nep gpp and t et to the lai wuee c increased with the rising lai and thus the discrepancy between wuee and the wuec decreased however when the lai was larger than nearly 1 0 the declining rate of t et exceeded the increasing rate of nep gpp and thus wuee c decreased with the rising lai suggesting a larger difference between wuee and wuec that was attributable to the strong control of the high swc furthermore it indicated that the swc exerted a considerable effect over the relationship between t et and the lai and thus wuee c at this stage fig 8a5 b5 c5 a regression and path analysis between wuee c and its component ratios nep gpp and t et as shown in fig 10 a and b and table 3 indicated that with the increase of t et and nep gpp wuee c increased significantly which suggested that enhancing the proportion of productive water consumption to et and of net carbon assimilation to gpp would lead to a smaller difference between wuee and wuec notably compared with nep gpp the determination coefficient and path coefficient between wuee c and t et were higher which indicated that compared with the carbon assimilation partitioning the evapotranspiration partitioning explained more of the variation in the difference between the wuee and wuec quan et al 2018 indicated that the discrepancy between wuec gpp t and wuee gpp et wuec wuee was reduced with the increasing t et under both ambient temperature and future climate warming in an alpine meadow which was similar to our result additionally fig 10 c and d and table 4 show that in comparison with t the determination coefficient and the standardized path coefficient between t et and e were much higher suggesting that e dominated t et due to the control of the surface swc which further confirmed the closer relationship between t et and swc compared with other biophysical controllers fig 8b1 b5 3 5 the dominant flux component and dominant influential factor of the difference between the daily wuee and wuec the difference between wuee and wuec was further investigated using the sem fig 11 the results showed that among the water carbon flux components e was the top controlling flux component of wuee c which was reflected by the high standardized path coefficient and was further confirmed by the absolute value of the standardized total effect obtained from the sem and followed by nep t and reco in descending order fig 11 table 5 moreover among the biotic and abiotic factors the swc and lai were the top two controlling factors with the most significant but opposite effects compared with the par vpd and ta with less or insignificant effects on wuee c and furthermore the total standardized effect of the swc was greater than that of the lai table 6 the negative effect of the swc on wuee c indicated a larger difference between wuee and wuec as the swc increased which coincided with the result in fig 8a4 by contrast the overall positive effect of the lai on wuee c represented a smaller difference between wuee and wuec with canopy growth as shown by the standardized path coefficients of the pathways in the sem and fig 7 the strong control of the swc on wuee c was exerted through its strong positive regulation on e 4 discussion 4 1 biophysical controls on the daily wuee and wuec 4 1 1 control of the daily ta in our study both wuee and wuec responded weakly to ta which was inconsistent with previous studies some studies reported the positive control of ta on the daily ecosystem wue which was primarily attributable to the positive regulation of ta on lai while others reported the opposite effect due to the faster increase of water consumption compared with the carbon assimilation with the rising ta zhu et al 2014 tan et al 2015 wang et al 2018 however in our study both wuee and wuec exhibited weak responses to ta in the view of the entire growing season probably because during different growing stages the relative increasing rate of nep to et and gpp to t were different with the rising ta which is similar to the result of xie et al 2016 in a temperate forest 4 1 2 control of the daily vpd and par the negative response of the ecosystem canopy wue to the vpd at short time scales half hourly and daily has been confirmed in various ecosystems zhao et al 2007 tong et al 2009 li et al 2015 tan et al 2015 similar results showing the negative effect of rs rn par on the daily ecosystem canopy wue have also been reported zhao et al 2007 li et al 2015 wang et al 2018 our study further confirmed the negative control of the par and vpd on the daily wuee and wuec in sparse vineyards especially in arid ecosystems with high evaporative demand 4 1 3 control of the daily swc compared with climatic and biotic factors previous studies regarding the control of the swc over the ecosystem canopy wue were limited and the results were inconsistent reichstein et al 2010 reported that the ecosystem wue decreased with a decline in the swc through drought due to the susceptibility of the canopy to drought in three evergreen mediterranean ecosystems in typical forest and grassland ecosystems in china zhu et al 2014 found a unimodal relationship between the daily ecosystem wue and the swc indicating that the ecosystem wue would decrease with the increasing swc while if the swc was too low to support vegetation the ecosystem wue would decrease additionally wang et al 2018 reported that the swc had an insignificant effect on the daily ecosystem wue while the ecosystem wue consistently showed a negative response to the swc during dry years and a positive response during wet years in a maize field in northeastern china however our results were distinctly different from the previous ones in the ecosystem under a sparse canopy in our study e increased significantly with the rising swc due to the larger proportion of bare soil surface area while nep gpp and t responded weakly thus wuee decreased significantly with the rising swc while wuec responded weakly which led to the differential response of wuee and wuec to the swc figs 5d1 c1 and 7 implying the high sensitivity of the daily wuee to the swc under sparse vegetation 4 1 4 control of the daily lai our results indicated that both daily wuee and wuec were positively and linearly correlated with the lai consistent with the results of previous studies hu et al 2008 tong et al 2009 li et al 2015 a strong positive linear relationship between the ecosystem wue and the lai at a monthly scale has also been observed xie et al 2016 lin et al 2018 4 2 surface swc dominated the difference between the daily wuee and wuec in our study wuee decreased significantly while wuec responded weakly with the rising swc figs 5a4 and 6a4 implying the underlying uncertainty in substituting wuee for wuec and that caution should be taken when upscaling wue from small to large scales niu et al 2011 huang et al 2015 quan et al 2018 in addition among the five biophysical controllers the daily wuee c was most closely correlated with the swc which was primarily induced by the strong negative response of t et to the swc compared with that of the nep gpp fig 8a4 b4 and c4 moreover sem results further indicated that e was the top controlling flux component of wuee c which was realized through the strong positive regulation of surface swc on e fig 10 all these above indicated that surface swc dominated the difference between the daily wuee and wuec in the sparse vineyard overall the surface swc regulated the difference between wuee and wuec through its strong positive control over e and thus a negative control over t et figs 7 and 8a4 and b4 notably our results showed that the daily t et exhibited a downward parabolic relationship with the lai which was largely inconsistent with previous studies many previous studies have shown a strong positive relationship between t et and lai and various functional types were developed kato et al 2004 kang et al 2007 hu et al 2008 gong et al 2017 however our study suggested that in the ecosystem with a sparse canopy a high swc and thus a high e would reduce t et and furthermore the control of the swc exceeded that of the lai over t et fig 9 in addition the strong correlation between t et and the swc in our study indicated that it might be possible to estimate t et simply using the swc in ecosystems with sparse canopies fig 8b4 the results of this study were inconsistent with those of the previous one in part in four grasslands in china hu et al 2008 indicated that as the ratio connecting wuee gpp et and wuec gpp t t et had a strong positive linear relationship with the lai implying that increasing the lai would lead to a smaller difference between wuee and wuec and moreover lai might be the primary factor that influence the discrepancy between the two wues tong et al 2009 reported that wuee nep et was close to wuec pn t pn net photosynthesis under the large lai but much lower than wuec under a small lai in an irrigated cropland in the north china plain which was similar to our result when the lai generally ranged from 0 to 1 0 however in the sparse vineyard in our study the surface swc had the largest and most significant influence on the difference between wuee and wuec generally the increase in the swc enlarged the difference while increasing the lai reduced the difference between wuee and wuec significantly and the overall control of the swc was more than that of the lai implying the strong control of the swc in regulating the difference between wuee and wuec under sparse vegetation furthermore our study took a step forward by quantifying the relative contributions of the biophysical factors and the water carbon flux components on the discrepancy between wuee and wuec and in demonstrating their regulatory pathways these findings have important implications for future agricultural water management and contribute to improving water use efficiency in ecosystems under sparse vegetation in arid areas 5 conclusions based on the continuous measurements taken via eddy covariance system sap flow system and microlysimeters in a sparse vineyard in northwestern china for two growing seasons from 2017 to 2018 we analyzed the responses of the daily ecosystem water use efficiency wuee nep et and canopy wue wuec gpp t to the biotic and abiotic factors and the regulation of t et and nep gpp on the difference between wuee and wuec we also addressed the dominant flux component and the dominant biophysical factor of the discrepancy between the two wues the results showed that the increasing swc enlarged the difference while the increasing lai reduced the difference between the wuee and wuec significantly in general and the swc played the dominant role among the flux components e t nep and reco the e dominated the difference between the wues at the two scales overall the surface soil water content regulated the difference between wuee and wuec through its strong positive control over e and thus a negative control over t et our study confirmed and highlighted the strong control of the swc in regulating the difference between wuee and the wuec under sparse vegetation and it provided new evidence for understanding the water and carbon relationships in ecosystems under sparse canopies in arid areas a limitation of our study lies in the technical discrepancy between eddy covariance and sapflow measurements and this problem could be solved to some extent if we conduct a calibration of the sapflow sensors probably using weighing lysimeters in future work our study has several important implications for future research concerning wue and agricultural water management which indicated that caution should be taken when upscaling wue from small to large scales and ecosystem wue could be improved by reducing non productive water

10844,water use efficiency wue is an important eco physiological index that reflects the relationship between ecosystem water and carbon cycles investigating the ecosystem wue contributes to a better understanding of the water carbon coupling mechanism in ecosystems we explored the responses of the daily ecosystem wue wuee and canopy wue wuec to several influential factors the dominant biophysical factor and the dominant water carbon flux component of the difference between wuee and wuec based on continuous measurements collected via an eddy covariance system sap flow system and microlysimeters over two growing seasons from 2017 to 2018 in a sparse vineyard in northwestern china the results showed that the seasonal averages for wuee and wuec were 0 52 g c kg h2o 1 and 1 96 g c kg h2o 1 respectively wuee and wuec responded weakly to the air temperature ta and showed a negative linear correlation to the photosynthetic active radiation par and vapor pressure deficit vpd wuee decreased significantly with the rising soil water content swc while wuec showed a weak response both wuee and wuec exhibited positive linear relationships with the leaf area index lai the results from a structural equation model sem indicated that among the biophysical controllers swc and lai were the top two controlling factors on the difference between wuee and wuec and swc played a dominant role the difference between wuee and wuec increased with the rising swc and decreased with the rising lai among the flux components including soil evaporation e transpiration t net ecosystem productivity nep and ecosystem respiration reco e dominated the discrepancy between wuee and wuec due to the strong control of swc on e this study highlights the strong control by the swc in regulating the ecosystem wue under a sparse canopy in an arid area keywords water flux carbon flux soil evaporation transpiration ratio carbon use efficiency eddy covariance 1 introduction water and carbon flux are important properties of ecosystem processes and functions singh et al 2014 as the ratio of carbon assimilation to water consumption the water use efficiency wue an important eco physiological index reflects the relationship between terrestrial water and carbon cycles and connects ecological processes with hydrological processes moreover the water use efficiency describes the relative rates of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere and the evapotranspiration from the ecosystem to the atmosphere de wit 1958 baldocchi 1994 yu et al 2004 li et al 2015 and it has been widely used to evaluate water consumption by terrestrial carbon sink components tong et al 2014 the arid region of northwestern china receives abundant sunlight which makes it suitable for viticulture over the past decade vineyards have been planted on a large scale in this region however this area suffers from severe water shortages and its agricultural water use has not been particularly effective moreover a growing population greater demand for food and diminishing water resources all add to the importance of using water efficiently in arid and semiarid areas thus the development of sustainable agriculture in this region requires water saving management practices and improved water use efficiency kang et al 2004 2008 2016 the wue is usually expressed at the ecosystem and canopy levels the canopy wue wuec can be expressed as the ratio of gross primary productivity to transpiration gpp t and the ecosystem wue wuee can be expressed as the ratio of gross primary productivity or net ecosystem productivity to evapotranspiration gpp et or nep et zhao et al 2007 hu et al 2008 tong et al 2009 2014 zhu et al 2014 li et al 2015 tan et al 2015 xie et al 2016 liu et al 2017 quan et al 2018 wang et al 2018 in addition the wuee nep et could be decomposed as a product of the gpp t and t et and the nep gpp hence the transpiration ratio t et and carbon use efficiency nep gpp would determine the difference between wuee nep et and wuec hu et al 2008 quan et al 2018 however previous studies have mostly focused on the ecosystem wue and they have usually substituted wuee gpp et for wuec gpp t as a result of the relatively small proportion of soil evaporation e to et and thus et and t were close in ecosystems with dense canopies yang et al 2010 tan et al 2015 furthermore compared with ecosystems with dense canopies such as forests vineyards are characterized by their sparse canopies with bare soil accounting for a larger proportion of the surface area which creates a large discrepancy between et and t kool et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 thus it is necessary to differentiate among research concerning wuee and wuec in sparse vineyards from that performed on denser canopies previous studies have indicated that biotic and abiotic factors control the wuee and wuec through their effects on the water and carbon flux such as the air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd solar radiation rs soil water content swc leaf area index lai and carbon dioxide concentration zhao et al 2007 hu et al 2008 tong et al 2009 reichstein et al 2010 tong et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 li et al 2015 tan et al 2015 xie et al 2016 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however studies on the simultaneous response of the wuee and wuec to the above factors have been quite limited additionally with the ratios leading to the difference between the wuee and wuec the responses of t et and nep gpp to the influential factors codetermine that of the difference between wuee and wuec regarding the t et many studies have demonstrated that there is a strong positive correlation between t et and lai and various functional forms have been developed kato et al 2004 kang et al 2007 hu et al 2008 gong et al 2017 however because of the relatively large e et in the sparse vineyard further study is needed as to whether e greatly affects the relationship between t et and lai and thus the difference between wuee and wuec the nep gpp or carbon use efficiency is a common ecological indicator for evaluating the terrestrial carbon cycle and it represents the ability to transform carbon from the atmosphere into a potential carbon sink in ecosystems chen et al 2018 previous studies were primarily focused on forests and grasslands and long time scale studies have reported that nep gpp was controlled by the temperature precipitation nitrogen deposition stand age and drought delucia et al 2007 rambal et al 2014 chen et al 2018 liu et al 2019 however the regulation of the biophysical controls of the daily nep gpp and thus the difference between wuee and wuec in sparse vineyards is still poorly understood this study was conducted on measurements of water and carbon fluxes obtained via eddy covariance method during the 2017 2018 growing seasons in a sparse vineyard in arid northwestern china the primary objectives were as follows 1 to examine the seasonal dynamics in the difference between the daily wuee and wuec 2 to analyze the differential responses in the daily wuee and wuec to biotic and abiotic factors 3 to investigate the regulation of the controlling factors on daily t et as well as nep gpp and thus the difference between wuee and wuec and 4 to explore which flux component e t nep or ecosystem respiration reco and which biotic or abiotic factor dominated the difference between wuee and wuec 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is in a temperate zone in an arid region of northwestern china 37 51 n 102 53 e elevation 1585 m a s l with a mean annual precipitation of 164 mm concentrated in the summer an annual average temperature of 8 c annual total sunshine of 2904 h and annual pan evaporation of 1926 mm this region suffers severe water shortages and the groundwater table is more than 25 m below the ground surface this experiment was performed at the experimental station of water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university in the shiyang river basin the area of the pinot noir vitis vinifera l cv pinot noir vineyard measures approximately 400 ha the vines were planted in 2014 and trained in a single cordon in north south rows the row spacing and plant spacing were 3 3 m and 0 5 m a vertical trellis system of three wires at 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 m high was used the soil texture is loamy clay with an average bulk density of 1 67 g cm 3 with a saturated soil water content of 0 38 cm3 cm 3 no cover crops were cultivated between the vines due to substantial surface area of exposed soil induced by wide space between the vines and thus a relatively low canopy cover the maximum canopy cover was 30 during the growing season the vineyard falls into the category of sparsely vegetated ecosystem kool et al 2014 the vineyard was drip irrigated from a line suspended 40 cm above the ground the discharge rate of the drip emitters was 3 l h 1 and the spacing between the emitters was 40 cm the growing season started from bud break in

from west to east the tops of the mls were deployed so that they were level with the soil surface and the mls were weighed daily at 19 00 local time by an electronic scale with a precision of 0 1 g the daily vineyard soil evaporation was derived from the average of the daily soil evaporation measured from the mls a sap flow system flow32 1 k dynamax usa was used to determine the vine transpiration t eight vines were randomly selected from within a 15 m radius circle centered on the ec system the sap flow was measured every 60 s and the 15 min average was recorded with a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific usa the sap flow l d 1 was scaled to the vine transpiration mm d 1 through the average ground area of each vine and the vineyard transpiration was obtained from the average transpiration of the monitored vines heilman et al 1994 the volumetric swc was monitored continuously at a 10 cm soil depth using ech2o soil moisture sensors decagon devices inc usa connected

between every two consecutive observations the meteorological parameters including the air temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation solar radiation and photosynthetic active radiation par were measured with a hobo automatic weather station onset computer corporation usa located near the vineyard at a height of 2 m at a distance of approximately 2 km from the vineyard the monthly averages of the primary meteorological parameters during the growing seasons are summarized in table 1 and fig 1 shows their seasonal variations the total precipitation was higher in 2018 than it was in 2017 and the precipitation events were concentrated in july and august for both years table 1 and fig 1d and e the seasonal average ta vpd and par were lower in 2018 than they were in 2017 while swc 10 cm was higher in 2018 than it was in 2017 due to greater irrigation and precipitation occurring in 2018 table 1 the climate in 2018 was wetter than it was in 2017 during the growing season 2 3 data processing and wue calculation raw ec data were processed using eddypro 4 2 1 li cor inc lincoln ne usa software in express mode the processed eddypro data were flagged with 0 highest quality 1

400 w m 2 and 100 600 w m 2 respectively the 30 min data gaps in the latent and sensible heat fluxes caused by instrument problems power failure and data correction were filled short gaps 2 h were filled using linear interpolation while longer gaps 2 h were filled using multiple linear regressions between the flux data and the primary controlling factors namely the net radiation rn lai and swc falge et al 2001b the bowen ratio forced closure method was used to force a closure in the measured energy budget component for the daytime ec data the daytime and nighttime were identified through t

nighttime ec data which assumed that the h was accurately measured and the residual le was calculated via the energy balance equation le rn g h twine et al 2000 many studies have demonstrated the value of this method for data correction li et al 2008 ding et al 2010 zhao et al 2018 the energy balance closure ebr is commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of ec measurements using a linear regression between the turbulent fluxes h le and available energy rn g twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 a linear regression using half hourly data that were filtered and corrected via eddypro without gap filling yielded slopes of 0 84 and 0 85 for the 2017 and 2018 regression equations and the corresponding determination coefficients r2 were 0 90 and 0 92 p 0 001 the values were within the common range of results from previous studies wilson et al 2002 ortega farias et al 2007 in accordance with papale et al 2006 the 30 min net ecosystem exchange nee after eddypro correction was

respectively et was calculated from le le λet where λ is the latent heat of vaporization the daily nep and et were calculated as the sums of the 30 min values respectively as follows 5 w u e e n e p e

the responses of wuee wuec and the difference between them to biotic abiotic factors two tailed significance tests were used structural equation model sem is a multivariate statistical tool and a combination of path analysis factor analysis and maximum likelihood estimation grace 2006 the structural equation model sem was further applied to examine the pathways that may explain the difference between wuee and wuec the significance test of the standardized total effect was derived from the output of the sem model using a bootstrap method bollen and stine 1990 statistical analysis was

reco et e t and lai from 2017 to 2018 are shown in fig 2 the monthly averages of the parameters are shown in table 2 both the seasonal total and average carbon assimilation gpp nep were higher during the 2018 growing season than they were in 2017 primarily induced by higher photosynthetic capacity due to larger canopy in 2018 fig 2a b and e and table 2 the seasonal total gpp were 364 g c m 2 and 432 g c m 2 nep were 121 g c m 2 and 157 g c m 2 and reco were 243 g c m 2 and 275 g c m 2 for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons respectively the vineyard served as a carbon source during the early growing stage turned into a carbon sink starting from late may and was a net carbon sink during the entire growing season the seasonal total reco was higher in 2018 compared to that of 2017 possibly induced by higher plant respiration in 2018 which was reflected by the close relationship between reco and lai reco 0 72 lai 1 09 r2 0 51 p 0 001 the seasonal patterns in gpp nep and reco generally exhibited single peak curves which resembled those of the canopy development fig 2a d the seasonal total et were 339 mm and 370 mm e were 166 mm and 219 mm and t were 212 mm and 202 mm for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons respectively the seasonal total et was higher in 2018 than it was in 2017 when t were close for the two growing seasons while e was much higher in 2018 which was ascribed to the greater precipitation and irrigation in 2018 than in 2017 table 2 during the entire growing season the daily average et and t remained relatively lower during the early and late growing season and higher in the middle of the growing season the seasonal dynamics of daily e tracked closely with the variations in the surface swc 10 cm during late july of 2017 and late july and august of 2018 concentrated precipitation caused an abrupt increase in the swc and e consequently increased sharply figs 1d and 2e 3 2 daily wuee wuec wuee c t et and nep gpp the seasonal variations in the daily wuee wuec wuee c t et and nep gpp are shown in fig 3 the monthly averages of the parameters are shown in table 2 the seasonal average wuee were 0 49 g c kg h2o 1 and 0 55 g c kg h2o 1 and wuec were 1 74 g c kg h2o 1 and 2 19 g c kg h2o 1 for the two growing seasons respectively the seasonal variations in the daily wuee and wuec did not show any obvious and similar patterns relative to those of the gpp nep et or t figs 2 and 3a and b according to eq 6 the seasonal variation and magnitude in the difference between daily wuee and wuec were determined by both t et and nep gpp the daily wuee c the difference between the daily wuee and wuec were relatively higher smaller in the middle and lower larger during the early and late parts of the growing season fig 3c the seasonal average wuee c were 0 25 and 0 22 for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons suggesting a large difference between wuee and wuec in the sparse vineyard this finding was partly attributed to the low proportion of nep to gpp in addition t et was relatively smaller under sparse vegetation compared with that of the ecosystem with a dense canopy table 2 kool et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 the seasonal average t et were 0 61 and 0 56 for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons the seasonal t et pattern showed an obvious decline in late july and early august at approximately doy 220 for both years as a result of the concentrated precipitation that occurred during this period which increased the swc and thus e significantly over a short period of time figs 1d e and 2e moreover the remarkable decrease in t et during this period also led to a distinct decrease in wuee c which implied the strong action of the swc in regulating wuee c fig 3c and d seasonal variations in daily nep gpp presented one peak patterns similar to that of canopy growth which was primarily coregulated by nep and gpp and nep gpp varied mildly during the middle of the growing season fig 2d and 3e the seasonal averages for nep gpp were 0 36 and 0 38 for the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons which meant that ecosystem respiration reco accounted for a larger proportion of gpp compared with nep our result fell within the range of nep gpp values in china s terrestrial ecosystems from 0 44 to 0 53 as reported by chen et al 2018 fig 4 shows that daily wuee and wuec were linearly correlated which was caused by the correlation between nep and gpp and between t and et notably when et was higher than nearly 5 kg h2o m 2 d 1 t started to fall which mostly occurred on the day after precipitation events when e increased significantly due to the sharp increase in swc under the effect of sufficient solar radiation and thus the proportion of t to et decreased fig 4b the strong positive linear correlation between nep and gpp reflected the stability of the carbon use efficiency which was primarily manifested during the middle of the growing season as shown in fig 3e and this correlation was also reported in other ecosystems fig 4c fernández martínez et al 2014 chen et al 2018 3 3 response of the daily wuee and wuec to the influential factors the relationships between the daily wuee nep et and ta vpd par swc 10 cm and lai during the growing seasons are shown in fig 5 similarly fig 6 exhibits the correlations between the daily wuec gpp t and the above influencing factors 3 3 1 response to the daily ta et and t nep and gpp increased linearly and significantly with the rising ta figs 5b1 and c1 and 6b1 and c1 yet neither wuee nor wuec was closely correlated with ta 3 3 2 response to the daily par and vpd both nep and gpp showed a weak response to the par and vpd fig 5b2 b3 and 6b2 b3 a similar result was observed in a nearby furrow irrigated vineyard by li et al 2015 et and t increased significantly with the rising par due to the greater available energy fig 5c2 and 6c2 the vpd had a positive linear effect on t and no significant effect on et which might have been caused by the weak correlation between e and the vpd fig 5c3 and 6c3 both wuee and wuec presented a negative linear correlation with the par and vpd fig 5a3 and 6a3 suggesting that these two climatic factors primarily influenced the water consumption progresses but insignificantly the carbon sequestration progresses 3 3 3 response to the daily swc nep gpp and t displayed a weak response to the swc while et increased significantly with the rising swc primarily due to the strong positive linear correlation between the swc and e under a sparse canopy figs 5d2 d3 6d2 d3 and 7 as a result wuee decreased significantly with the rising swc while wuec responded weakly fig 5d1 and 6d1 3 3 4 response to the daily lai as the lai increased gpp nep et and t increased significantly figs 5e2 e3 and 6e2 e3 due to the higher photosynthetic capacity of the vines and more water transpired in addition the increasing rate of carbon assimilation exceeded that of water consumption and thus both wuee and wuec exhibited significant positive linear correlations with the lai figs 5e1 and 6e1 indicating a relatively higher wue at both the ecosystem and canopy scales during the vigorous growth stage 3 4 regulation of daily t et and nep gpp on the daily wuee c according to eq 6 wuee c reflects the difference between wuee and wuec and it was influenced by both t et and nep gpp the ta vpd and par had weak control over t et as shown in fig 8 b1 b3 it is worth noting that among the five influential factors ta vpd par swc and lai t et was most highly correlated with the swc t et decreased significantly with the rising swc as a result of the strong positive response of e and the weak response of t to the swc figs 6c4 7 and fig 8b4 in addition the daily t et showed a downward parabolic relationship with the lai under a relatively small lai the t to et proportion increased with the rising lai and when the lai was greater than nearly 1 0 the high level of the swc and the resulting high e led to a declining t et with the rising lai as shown in fig 9 overall t et regulated the difference between wuee and wuec primarily through swc and lai the response of nep gpp to the ta par vpd swc and lai was similar to the nep and gpp responses to the above factors figs 5b1 b5 6b1 b5 and 8c1 c5 moreover as ta increased the increasing rate of nep was higher than that of gpp and hence the proportion of nep to gpp increased the par vpd and swc had weak control over nep gpp while nep gpp increased significantly with the rising lai due to the strong positive linear relationship between the carbon assimilation nep and gpp and the canopy growth lai figs 5b5 6b5 and 8c2 c5 notably the positive response of nep gpp to the lai also suggested that the augmented rate of nep was higher than that of gpp as the lai increased which could have been primarily attributable to the lower sensitivity of reco to the lai compared with that of nep compared with the abiotic factors the canopy growth lai explained more of the variation in the daily nep gpp in sparse vineyards which also implied that the regulation of nep gpp on the difference between wuee and wuec was realized through lai primarily as a result of the weak response of the daily nep gpp to the par and vpd and t et to the ta par and vpd the daily wuee c exhibited weak responses to the ta par and vpd fig 8a1 a3 among the five controlling factors the daily wuee c was most tightly correlated with the swc as the swc increased wuee c decreased significantly indicating a significantly larger difference between wuee and wuec as the swc increased figs 7 and 8a4 b4 the daily wuee c showed a downward parabolic relationship with the lai under a relatively small lai due to the positive response of nep gpp and t et to the lai wuee c increased with the rising lai and thus the discrepancy between wuee and the wuec decreased however when the lai was larger than nearly 1 0 the declining rate of t et exceeded the increasing rate of nep gpp and thus wuee c decreased with the rising lai suggesting a larger difference between wuee and wuec that was attributable to the strong control of the high swc furthermore it indicated that the swc exerted a considerable effect over the relationship between t et and the lai and thus wuee c at this stage fig 8a5 b5 c5 a regression and path analysis between wuee c and its component ratios nep gpp and t et as shown in fig 10 a and b and table 3 indicated that with the increase of t et and nep gpp wuee c increased significantly which suggested that enhancing the proportion of productive water consumption to et and of net carbon assimilation to gpp would lead to a smaller difference between wuee and wuec notably compared with nep gpp the determination coefficient and path coefficient between wuee c and t et were higher which indicated that compared with the carbon assimilation partitioning the evapotranspiration partitioning explained more of the variation in the difference between the wuee and wuec quan et al 2018 indicated that the discrepancy between wuec gpp t and wuee gpp et wuec wuee was reduced with the increasing t et under both ambient temperature and future climate warming in an alpine meadow which was similar to our result additionally fig 10 c and d and table 4 show that in comparison with t the determination coefficient and the standardized path coefficient between t et and e were much higher suggesting that e dominated t et due to the control of the surface swc which further confirmed the closer relationship between t et and swc compared with other biophysical controllers fig 8b1 b5 3 5 the dominant flux component and dominant influential factor of the difference between the daily wuee and wuec the difference between wuee and wuec was further investigated using the sem fig 11 the results showed that among the water carbon flux components e was the top controlling flux component of wuee c which was reflected by the high standardized path coefficient and was further confirmed by the absolute value of the standardized total effect obtained from the sem and followed by nep t and reco in descending order fig 11 table 5 moreover among the biotic and abiotic factors the swc and lai were the top two controlling factors with the most significant but opposite effects compared with the par vpd and ta with less or insignificant effects on wuee c and furthermore the total standardized effect of the swc was greater than that of the lai table 6 the negative effect of the swc on wuee c indicated a larger difference between wuee and wuec as the swc increased which coincided with the result in fig 8a4 by contrast the overall positive effect of the lai on wuee c represented a smaller difference between wuee and wuec with canopy growth as shown by the standardized path coefficients of the pathways in the sem and fig 7 the strong control of the swc on wuee c was exerted through its strong positive regulation on e 4 discussion 4 1 biophysical controls on the daily wuee and wuec 4 1 1 control of the daily ta in our study both wuee and wuec responded weakly to ta which was inconsistent with previous studies some studies reported the positive control of ta on the daily ecosystem wue which was primarily attributable to the positive regulation of ta on lai while others reported the opposite effect due to the faster increase of water consumption compared with the carbon assimilation with the rising ta zhu et al 2014 tan et al 2015 wang et al 2018 however in our study both wuee and wuec exhibited weak responses to ta in the view of the entire growing season probably because during different growing stages the relative increasing rate of nep to et and gpp to t were different with the rising ta which is similar to the result of xie et al 2016 in a temperate forest 4 1 2 control of the daily vpd and par the negative response of the ecosystem canopy wue to the vpd at short time scales half hourly and daily has been confirmed in various ecosystems zhao et al 2007 tong et al 2009 li et al 2015 tan et al 2015 similar results showing the negative effect of rs rn par on the daily ecosystem canopy wue have also been reported zhao et al 2007 li et al 2015 wang et al 2018 our study further confirmed the negative control of the par and vpd on the daily wuee and wuec in sparse vineyards especially in arid ecosystems with high evaporative demand 4 1 3 control of the daily swc compared with climatic and biotic factors previous studies regarding the control of the swc over the ecosystem canopy wue were limited and the results were inconsistent reichstein et al 2010 reported that the ecosystem wue decreased with a decline in the swc through drought due to the susceptibility of the canopy to drought in three evergreen mediterranean ecosystems in typical forest and grassland ecosystems in china zhu et al 2014 found a unimodal relationship between the daily ecosystem wue and the swc indicating that the ecosystem wue would decrease with the increasing swc while if the swc was too low to support vegetation the ecosystem wue would decrease additionally wang et al 2018 reported that the swc had an insignificant effect on the daily ecosystem wue while the ecosystem wue consistently showed a negative response to the swc during dry years and a positive response during wet years in a maize field in northeastern china however our results were distinctly different from the previous ones in the ecosystem under a sparse canopy in our study e increased significantly with the rising swc due to the larger proportion of bare soil surface area while nep gpp and t responded weakly thus wuee decreased significantly with the rising swc while wuec responded weakly which led to the differential response of wuee and wuec to the swc figs 5d1 c1 and 7 implying the high sensitivity of the daily wuee to the swc under sparse vegetation 4 1 4 control of the daily lai our results indicated that both daily wuee and wuec were positively and linearly correlated with the lai consistent with the results of previous studies hu et al 2008 tong et al 2009 li et al 2015 a strong positive linear relationship between the ecosystem wue and the lai at a monthly scale has also been observed xie et al 2016 lin et al 2018 4 2 surface swc dominated the difference between the daily wuee and wuec in our study wuee decreased significantly while wuec responded weakly with the rising swc figs 5a4 and 6a4 implying the underlying uncertainty in substituting wuee for wuec and that caution should be taken when upscaling wue from small to large scales niu et al 2011 huang et al 2015 quan et al 2018 in addition among the five biophysical controllers the daily wuee c was most closely correlated with the swc which was primarily induced by the strong negative response of t et to the swc compared with that of the nep gpp fig 8a4 b4 and c4 moreover sem results further indicated that e was the top controlling flux component of wuee c which was realized through the strong positive regulation of surface swc on e fig 10 all these above indicated that surface swc dominated the difference between the daily wuee and wuec in the sparse vineyard overall the surface swc regulated the difference between wuee and wuec through its strong positive control over e and thus a negative control over t et figs 7 and 8a4 and b4 notably our results showed that the daily t et exhibited a downward parabolic relationship with the lai which was largely inconsistent with previous studies many previous studies have shown a strong positive relationship between t et and lai and various functional types were developed kato et al 2004 kang et al 2007 hu et al 2008 gong et al 2017 however our study suggested that in the ecosystem with a sparse canopy a high swc and thus a high e would reduce t et and furthermore the control of the swc exceeded that of the lai over t et fig 9 in addition the strong correlation between t et and the swc in our study indicated that it might be possible to estimate t et simply using the swc in ecosystems with sparse canopies fig 8b4 the results of this study were inconsistent with those of the previous one in part in four grasslands in china hu et al 2008 indicated that as the ratio connecting wuee gpp et and wuec gpp t t et had a strong positive linear relationship with the lai implying that increasing the lai would lead to a smaller difference between wuee and wuec and moreover lai might be the primary factor that influence the discrepancy between the two wues tong et al 2009 reported that wuee nep et was close to wuec pn t pn net photosynthesis under the large lai but much lower than wuec under a small lai in an irrigated cropland in the north china plain which was similar to our result when the lai generally ranged from 0 to 1 0 however in the sparse vineyard in our study the surface swc had the largest and most significant influence on the difference between wuee and wuec generally the increase in the swc enlarged the difference while increasing the lai reduced the difference between wuee and wuec significantly and the overall control of the swc was more than that of the lai implying the strong control of the swc in regulating the difference between wuee and wuec under sparse vegetation furthermore our study took a step forward by quantifying the relative contributions of the biophysical factors and the water carbon flux components on the discrepancy between wuee and wuec and in demonstrating their regulatory pathways these findings have important implications for future agricultural water management and contribute to improving water use efficiency in ecosystems under sparse vegetation in arid areas 5 conclusions based on the continuous measurements taken via eddy covariance system sap flow system and microlysimeters in a sparse vineyard in northwestern china for two growing seasons from 2017 to 2018 we analyzed the responses of the daily ecosystem water use efficiency wuee nep et and canopy wue wuec gpp t to the biotic and abiotic factors and the regulation of t et and nep gpp on the difference between wuee and wuec we also addressed the dominant flux component and the dominant biophysical factor of the discrepancy between the two wues the results showed that the increasing swc enlarged the difference while the increasing lai reduced the difference between the wuee and wuec significantly in general and the swc played the dominant role among the flux components e t nep and reco the e dominated the difference between the wues at the two scales overall the surface soil water content regulated the difference between wuee and wuec through its strong positive control over e and thus a negative control over t et our study confirmed and highlighted the strong control of the swc in regulating the difference between wuee and the wuec under sparse vegetation and it provided new evidence for understanding the water and carbon relationships in ecosystems under sparse canopies in arid areas a limitation of our study lies in the technical discrepancy between eddy covariance and sapflow measurements and this problem could be solved to some extent if we conduct a calibration of the sapflow sensors probably using weighing lysimeters in future work our study has several important implications for future research concerning wue and agricultural water management which indicated that caution should be taken when upscaling wue from small to large scales and ecosystem wue could be improved by reducing non productive water
