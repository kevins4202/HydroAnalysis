neuron of each layer i data normalization it is a critical step in the preprocessing level as the machine learning algorithms majorly show improved performance when they deal with features that lie on the same scales one way of doing this is by normalization this method works by the rescaling of the features to a range of 0 1 which is a particular case of min max scaling in order to normalize the data we applied the min max scaling method to each parameter we checked if the data collected has some missing values which may occur due to improper collection of data blank values or nan or measurements not applicable min max normalization is given by equation 3 3 x n x r x m i n x m a x x m i n where x n normalized value x r raw value x m i n minimum observed values of x x m a x maximum

errors which can affect the model s performance and results to overcome the restrictions artificial intelligence ai based technique is used in this study as an alternative to traditional models for prediction to improve accuracy performance and cost effective results the superposition models based on grover s algorithm are more efficient in predicting all patterns in the counts of e coli in groundwater with higher efficiency and low error the model created is fed with around 1302 inputs this data is obtained through laboratory testing previous studied shown that the predictive models are based on published research reports and testing data so it is difficult to check the accuracy of the model in this paper we create our dataset by using water samples collected from eight districts of the state of rajasthan under the bits uva university of virginia groundwater contamination project a superposition based learning algorithm sla is proposed to observe the patterns of ann based sensitivity analysis for automating the process of prediction of e coli bacteria in groundwater the majority of the existing techniques are limited to most of the substantial features of water to limit of ph temperature turbidity conductivity and colour of the water however few significant physico chemical parameters are not considered which have direct effects on the growth of e coli bacteria this paper studied the effects of various physico chemical parameters of water quality on e coli growth and correlation is observed between e coli and water quality parameters the concept of presenting an input pattern for all feasible neural network architectures is unrealistic in the classical neural networks for this concept to be implemented classically one would need to create multiple neural networks one for each configuration and architecture to obtain all the inputs and simulate the related outputs in parallel after computing the efficiency of each pattern for each configuration of the neural network one can check the configuration of a trained neural network with the best performance the concept of sla describing a possible configuration of weights in superposition for any architecture using sla we can obtain all possible configurations of the neural network in superposition for the specified architectures the critical property of grover s algorithms discussed in this paper is also the ability to obtain all correlations from the training set in superposition for future modifications we will create a hybrid model of ann with fuzzy set theory or genetic algorithms ga to get better accuracies we aim to take the ai enhanced model further to be able to provide a fully automated e coli classification system another possible future work is to develop a probabilistic sla model where we only need to run the neural network twice one forward and one backward by modifying the grover s algorithm declaration of competing interest the

errors which can affect the model s performance and results to overcome the restrictions artificial intelligence ai based technique is used in this study as an alternative to traditional models for prediction to improve accuracy performance and cost effective results the superposition models based on grover s algorithm are more efficient in predicting all patterns in the counts of e coli in groundwater with higher efficiency and low error the model created is fed with around 1302 inputs this data is obtained through laboratory testing previous studied shown that the predictive models are based on published research reports and testing data so it is difficult to check the accuracy of the model in this paper we create our dataset by using water samples collected from eight districts of the state of rajasthan under the bits uva university of virginia groundwater contamination project a superposition based learning algorithm sla is proposed to observe the patterns of ann based sensitivity analysis for automating the process of prediction of e coli bacteria in groundwater the majority of the existing techniques are limited to most of the substantial features of water to limit of ph temperature turbidity conductivity and colour of the water however few significant physico chemical parameters are not considered which have direct effects on the growth of e coli bacteria this paper studied the effects of various physico chemical parameters of water quality on e coli growth and correlation is observed between e coli and water quality parameters the concept of presenting an input pattern for all feasible neural network architectures is unrealistic in the classical neural networks for this concept to be implemented classically one would need to create multiple neural networks one for each configuration and architecture to obtain all the inputs and simulate the related outputs in parallel after computing the efficiency of each pattern for each configuration of the neural network one can check the configuration of a trained neural network with the best performance the concept of sla describing a possible configuration of weights in superposition for any architecture using sla we can obtain all possible configurations of the neural network in superposition for the specified architectures the critical property of grover s algorithms discussed in this paper is also the ability to obtain all correlations from the training set in superposition for future modifications we will create a hybrid model of ann with fuzzy set theory or genetic algorithms ga to get better accuracies we aim to take the ai enhanced model further to be able to provide a fully automated e coli classification system another possible future work is to develop a probabilistic sla model where we only need to run the neural network twice one forward and one backward by modifying the grover s algorithm declaration of competing interest the

detailed studies on the process and contamination the minor ions metals and isotopes are adopted analytical results will lead to the understanding of the relative amount of the determined chemical constituents hence to determine the groundwater facies geochemical nature its utility thermodynamic states state of contamination identification of geochemical process etc different methods or softwares were used the advent of these softwares had helped in the groundwater geochemical investigations the softwares were basically windows or dos based and they fall in three of the following categories 1 thermodynamic and equilibrium states wateq2 wateq3 wateq4f netpath phreeqc solminq eqnr3 mineql solveq and chiller watspec aqion salt norm geochemist workbench etc truesdell and jones

tool etc rockware 2010 2011 de filippis et al 2017 maidment 2002 zhou and li 2006 the software s for determining the thermodynamic status of groundwater are mostly developed to understand the state of saturation for a given groundwater composition referring to certain minerals in data base this is mainly dependent on the temperature of observations number of parameters supplied as input and the mineral data base considered by the software ball et al 1979 ball et al 1981 ball and nordstrom 1991 parkhurst 1995 parkhurst and appelo 1999 plummer et al 1991 1994 schecher and mcavoy 1994 reed 1982 reed and spicer 1998 spycher and reed 1992 wigley 1977 gwb bethke 1996 2002 provides the activity temperature diagrams and calculates the thermodynamic equilibrium states in hypothetical and real world conditions the software has the capability to develop models for understating the reactions along the groundwater pathways these will help to predict the nature of reactions at definite temperature pressure conditions limited applications of ionic strength and the silicate stability diagrams were studied by prasanna et al 2011 and chidambaram et al 2012 in conjunction with the geochemical softwares to correlate the state of stability the softwares used for geochemical studies and classification purposes allows to categorise groundwater based on the major ion constituents and their association these include the categorization for drinking domestic and irrigation purpose further they also help in determining the geochemical process by comparing them to standard plots these parameters are basically studied to classify and ascertain the utility for various applications irrespective of the rock type keesari et al 2016 singaraja et al 2014 geographical locations prasanna et al 2011 pradeep et al 2016 and depth of aquifers chidambaram et al 2005 2009 these classifications techniques were adopted few softwares are copyrighted and marketed by companies others are developed by the institutions and used non commercially like hych balasubramanian et al 1991 watclast chidambaram et al 2003 individual geochemical characters of the samples without plots were inferred by hych and was adopted for studying the classification of water balaguru and senthil kumar 2013 venkatasubramani and meenambal 2007 the watclast software was adopted by several workers to geochemically classify the groundwater for various utility purpose and to ascertain the major geochemical process by adopting the plots and classified outputs prasanna et al 2009 2010 singaraja et al 2014 2013a b c chidambaram et al 2011a b a recent updated version of the hych software with more output parameters and scatter diagrams were incorporated in watchit balasubramanian and nagaraju 2019 the third category softwares are utilized to study the spatial changes of the calculated geochemical parameters also with respect to time kałka et al 2016 rossetto et al 2018 they were also adopted to infer the relationship of the parameters with respect to spatial features like geology water level geomorphology drainage etc majority of the softwares were copyrighted and marketed by companies apart from these few statistical softwares are also used for data reduction and to determine the origin and interrelationship between ions each software is unique in its application as it depends on the utility though certain softwares are dos based the results are at par with the windows based softwares except for the diagrammatic representations softwares of category 1 and 3 are unique and more specific but the softwares of category 2 try to incorporate few components of category 1 and 3 this is mainly to help the user to attain maximum possible solutions in one platform these softwares don t plot gibbs boomerang diagram gibbs 1970 which helps in determining the major geochemical process doneens permeability index doneen 1948 johnson 1975 etc the current software application has attempted to fill this gap and falls in the second category the current software also tries to reflect the thermodynamic status of the sample with respect to silicate stability and geochemical classification of samples 2 data requirements and input the software was coded in c and compiled in visual c a library file bgi 2010 was used to match the code with the recent windows operating system a separate input file is created by arranging the input parameters in definite order and saved as text file the steps involved in creation of the input file are described in appendix i chidam has one executable file the data will be fed as a separate file txt and the text output will be saved as a separate output file txt three different output files can be created according to the option selected the figures obtained are copied as screen capture and saved in paint as bmp jpeg png files 2 1 data entry the data entry can be made in ms excel and saved as a tab limited text file which will serve as an input file the code requires measured analytical values of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl no3 so4 2 h4sio4 po4 3 f tds ec ph and temperature in definite order as mentioned below ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 f no3 si tds ec ph and temperature all values should be entered in mgl 1 ec in microsiemen cm ph and temperature oc as read the entry can be made for 100 samples with all these parameters in excel and saved with a specific file name in txt format sample input file appendix ii by default the number of sample array is fixed as 100 the values of those ions which were not analysed and those below the detection limit should be given zero the text output is saved in a separate file it s prompted initially during the execution of the program the pictures or plots can be copied to paintbrush application and saved easily 2 2 processing the data is read and executed by chidam exe file appendix iii name of the input file should be provided with extension the file is read only if it exists in the same directory of the executable file the program provides an option for studying the stability of silicate minerals the classification of groundwater and the corrosion indices as 1 2 and 3 respectively sample output files appendices iv v and vi the option 4 is used to quit the application the third option for the indices includes the comparison with the who standards and summarizes the minimum maximum and average of the input values these three options were programmed with switch cases flowchart i e fig 1 the stepwise execution of the program is provided as appendix i 2 3 limitation of the software the calculation of ionic strength is based on the extended debye huckel equation and it is found to be promising for the values with ionic strength 10 1 m 12 000 μscm the applicable range falls from fresh to brackish water category the software runs only if all the required values are provided and the missing values should be given 0 which will be reflected in the subsequent calculations the software is dos based and the permits legend for one set of samples i e one season only to a maximum of 100 there not temperature corrections adopted in the thermodynamic calculations 2 4 sampling and analysis the groundwater samples used for the case study were collected from 15 borewells after well purging the samples were initially observed for ec ph and tds in the field and subsequently transported to the lab filtered and stored for analysis at 4 c the ca2 mg2 hco3 and cl were determined by the titrimetric techniques na and k by flame photometer so4 2 no3 and h4sio4 by using spectrophotometeric techniques the analytical methods adopted were based on apha 2012 and the analytical error was observed to be less than 10 3 silicate stability the stability plots can be selected by choosing option 1 the mgl 1 values are converted to mole values these values are taken for calculation of the ionic strength of each sample appendix iv the weathering of dominant silicate minerals like feldspars are presented in the software and the stability plot is made by adopting raymahasay 1986 the ionic strength of the samples was calculated by adopting the following formula 1 i 1 2 m i z i 2 m represents the mole concentration of ion and z represents the charge the samples with higher ionic strength are considered to have more dissolved ions the ionic strength of the samples considered shows a range from 0 0058 to 0 026 m and all the samples are expected to from montmorllionite due to the weathering appendix iv ionic strength is also calculated from the electrical conductivity of the solution if the analytical values are not available lind 1970 the ratio of hco3 to sio2 depends on the rate and weathering and the relative concentration in the source mineral garrels 1967 approximated the ratios and determined the source mineral albite weathering has a ratio 0 5 labradorite 1 5 biotite and anorthite 3 0 3 5 and augite 6 the ratio helps in determining the plagioclase weathering and that of pyriboles fig 2 but for the samples considered they fall above plot purview indicating higher values of hco3 than the dissolved silica which is more common in carbonate terrain 3 1 activity co efficient the activity coefficient γi was calculated by using the values of the constants at 25 c a b and ao considering the debye huckel equation debye and hückel 1923 2 log γ i a z i 2 i 1 b a 0 i this equation considers the temperature governed constants a and b for each ion the parameter ao depends on the size and charge of the ion generally the size of the ions are proportionate to the values the stability plots are created based on garrels and christ 1965 raymahasay 1986 and allan freeze and cherry 1979 the activity coefficient is calculated for the samples considered and it is calculated for the ions appendix iv later the ratios of log k to h na to h ca 2 to h and mg 2 to h were plotted against log h4sio4 3 2 ionic activity the product of mole values and activity co efficient of the specific ion provides the activity and its it obtained by the following formula 3 a i γ i x m in dilute solutions the γi is weak and is considered to be 1 in such cases activity of the mole concentration of the ion represent the activity the activity of each ion considered is thus obtained and the program facilitates the calculation for ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 f no3 and si appendix iv the silicate stability plots were developed for potash sodium calcium and magnesium by plotting log k h na h ca 2 h and mg 2 h against log h4sio4 respectively the plot show that the sample fall in definite fields or along the boundaries of fields thus depending upon the position of the samples thermodynamic states of water in the plots are interpretted the stability diagrams are plotted with the log activity of major ions to ph in vertical axis and log concentration of silica in horizontal axis the silica concentration increases to the right as the values read from 5 to 1 weathering initially tends the water to be stable with gibbsite and subsequently with the increase of silica and the ion concentrations it becomes stable with other fields a detailed discussion on the nature of reactions are discussed in chidambaram et al 2011a b pertaining to clay minerals stability the geochemical reactions were explained in the article with respect to reactions and state of stability as inferred by garrels and christ 1965 the thermodynamic plots are to be interpreted based on incongruent dissolution of minerals initially the composition is stable with gibbsite al oh 3 and subsequently by the addition of silica to the solution it become stable with kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 with further increase in silica and addition of k into the solution it becomes stable with illite k0 65 al2 si3 35al0 65 o10 oh 2 muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 or potash feldspar k al si3o8 the samples considered shows stability with respect to kaolinite with few representations near the stability fields of muscovite and k feldspar field fig 3 the samples along the boundary indicate higher activity of potash with respect to ph increase of more cations like na k mg2 or ca2 with silica in solution will result in stability of the composition with respect to montmorillonite m x nh2o al2 y mgx si4o10 oh 2 where m na k mg2 or ca2 the removal of few cations by ion exchange process and addition of alumina and silica will result in the stability of the composition with respect to chlorite mg al fe 12 si al 8 o20 oh 4 h2o these processes are summarized in the diagrams for easy interpretation of the composition stability the groundwater samples depicted in the plot reflect compositional stability with kaolinite in na ca and mg silicate stability plots figs 4 6 most of the softwares derive the saturation states of the alumino silicates only when the composition of al is supplied as an input but the stability states with respect to silicate minerals can be derived from diagram just by the values of major ions and silica reactions involved during the change of stability field in sodium silicate system are 4 naalsi3o8 8h2o na al oh 3 oh 3h4sio4 5 6 na

the water classification can be made for the samples if case 2 is opted fig 1 the data are read and the values are converted to epm meql 1 values the error percentage is calculated for each sample along with the ec tds ratio which is grouped based on the following intervals 0 60 0 60 0 80 and 0 80 appendix v the electrical conductivity values were classified based on wilcox 1955 this categorization helps to ascertain the utility of water table 1 the application initially calculates with mgl 1values in the samples the hardness is calculated by using the formula 15 total hardness ca2 x 2 497 mg2 x 4 115 values in mgl 1 the calculated hardness of water is grouped for the utility purpose based on the following categories proposed sawyer and mccarty 1978 table 2 they studied samples range from 120 to 737 mg l representing slightly hard to very hard category appendix v corrosivity ratio is determined by three major anions cl so4 2 and hco3 ryznar 1944 16 c i c l 35 5 s o 4 96 2 h c o 3 100 values in mgl 1 it ranges from 0 22 to 3 2 in the samples considered appendix v the samples with corrosivity index value 1 is considered to be unsafe for domestic utility and transport along the long distance pipelines raghunath 1982 had presented few methods of classification of groundwater which includes ratios of ions like nitrate to total dissolved solids sodium to sum of alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 sodium to chloride nitrate to chloride sodium to calcium chloride to bicarbonate chloride to sulfate calcium to magnesium sum of alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 to bicarbonate alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 to total cations and alkali elements na k to total cations the mgl 1 values will be used in gibbs plots for finding out major process governing the water chemistry of the samples the gibbs plot 1970 was considered initially for the surface water studies and later it was used by different researchers to study the groundwater the plot basically tries to determine three major sources like influence of rain water interaction of water with the host matrix and the process of evaporation in this regard two plots fig 7 were considered one with respect to cation na k na k ca2 and other with respect to anion cl cl hco3 both plots were drafted against the vertical log axis with tds value mgl 1 samples with lesser tds value indicate influence of rainfall and the higher values indicate the dominance of evaporation the rock water dominant samples fall in between these two categories represented by all the samples considered for study subsequently the mgl 1 was converted into epm data using respective conversion factor initially the data is used for determining the cation and anion balance by adopting the relation 17 error ʃ cations ʃ anions ʃ cation ʃ anion x 100 the error percentage is acceptable based on the total concentration of anions table 3 chlor alkaline index cai was determined by scholler 1965 two different indices were formulated considering different anions and cations 18 cai i cl na k cl values in epm 19 cai ii cl na k so4 2 hco3 co3 2 no3 values in epm they were also considered as base exchange indices by certain researchers kumar et al 2009 thilagavathi et al 2012 the mg along with ca in rock are exchanged for na and k in groundwater if both the indices are positive in general the exchange of ca mg from rock matrix to na k in groundwater is more significant than the reverse chidambaram 2000 co3 2 was considered in this equation 19 by scholler since most of analysed groundwater samples have lesser value of this ion it is generally combined with bicarbonate for interpretation purpose hence this combination of both carbonate and bicarbonates are considered in this application scholler 1967 determined the water type depending upon the dominance of anions and classified them into four different types table 4 samples considered for study reflect type 1 hco3 so4 2 the carbonate concentration was compared with the total alkaline earth constituents ca2 mg2 in water richards 1954 and referred as residual sodium carbonate r s c the surplus carbonates will try to combine with na and k and form precipitates which may affect the permeability of the soil 20 rsc hco3 co3 2 mg2 ca2 values in epm the values are grouped into different categories depending on the ranges table 5 the values of the samples ranged from 6 3 to 2 05 reflecting good to medium permissible category nch non carbonate hardness was calculated based on the raghunath 1987 considering the epm values of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and hco3 as follows 21 nch ca2 mg2 co3 2 hco3 the samples considered for the study exhibited values between 0 and 556 reflecting good to high noncarbonate hardness appendix v kellys ratio k r is determined to know the suitableness for irrigation utility by calculating the excess values in epm of na over alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 kelley 1946 22 k r na ca2 mg2 if the values obtained from the calculation are greater than 1 they are considered unsafe for agriculture purpose and those below 1 are safe both the categories are observed in the samples with values ranging from 0 35 to 1 74 potential salinity is calculated with the epm values of cl and so4 2 palacios and aceves 1970 classified table 6 and calculated as follows 23 potential salinity cl 0 5 x so4 2 this index is generally used to determine the agricultural suitability of water and the samples considered for study range between 34 and 86 reflecting low to high potential salinity magnesium hazard was initially derived by szabolcs and darab 1964 and later classified and used predominantly by lloyd and heathcoat 1985 it is determined by using the epm values of alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 this is mainly a comparison between the alkali earth elements and to determine the relative proportion between them 24 magnesium hazard mg2 x100 ca2 mg2 if the values of magnesium hazard is 50 it s safe and can be used for irrigation if the relative concentration of mg is greater than 50 to the sum of the alkali earth elements then its unsafe for agricultural purpose the samples represented in the study range from 3 41 to 38 4 falling in safe category soluble sodium percentage ssp is the relative concentration of na that could dissolve in the solution with respect to other major cations in water todd 1980 and its considered significant for irrigation purpose values in epm 25 ssp na x 100 ca2 mg2 na the value derived is classified based on the application for irrigation purpose and it falls in the different categories table 7 strongly sodic category to very strongly sodic category are noticed in the samples considered for study with values ranging from 25 to 63 4 which indicates that the groundwater has to be used with caution for irrigation purpose the percentage of sodium na content dissolved in water is compared to other major cations as it generally govern the applicability for irrigation purpose 26 na na k ca2 mg2 na k x 100 values in epm there are two classification based on na in water by eaton 1950 and wilcox 1955 the earlier classification by eaton considers the value 50 as safe and above is considered as unsafe for irrigation purpose and later wilcox 1955 classified into 5 categories table 8 the classification will help to determine the utility of water with respect to irrigation purpose the values of the samples vary from 27 5 to 63 6 representing unsafe to safe category of eaton classification and from good to doubtful category of wilcox classification sodium adsorption ratio s a r is the prime factor adopted to explore the water quality of for irrigation it is basically dependent on the major cations ions like sodic content in comparison to definite values of alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 27 s a r n a c a m g 2 values in epm the obtained measure is classified as into different categories for irrigation purpose table 9 all the samples of the study fall in excellent category with values ranging from 0 96 to 4 6 united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 considered sar values along with the electrical conductivity values to derive a plot for understating the utility for irrigation purpose the ussl plot was designated with different codes based on the conductivity and sar values as c and s respectively fig 8 c1s1 indicates that the water has lower values of the parameters and is excellent for the irrigation purpose similarly c4s4 indicates higher value of both the parameters and the water should be used with caution for irrigation the samples of the study were observed in c2 low c3 medium and s1 low category reflecting its suitability for agricultural purpose the application tries to plot the values of both sar vertical axis and the conductivity values in μs cm the maximum value of ec considered in the plot is 3000 μs cm and an sar value of 30 the program also summarizes the number of samples falling beyond the plot region permeability index p i is calculated to ascertain the utility for irrigation purpose doneen 1948 the parameter basically tries to understand the salt forming capacity of the water and its influence on the sodicity of the soil which may reduce the soil permeability values in epm 28 p i n a h c o 3 c a m g n a 100 doneen has also devised a diagram to ascertain the suitability for irrigation considering permeability index and tds value in epm doneen 1964 the application plots the samples in the diagram the maximum value of tds considered is 30 and that of pi is 120 the horizontal axis is in reverse order and the maximum value of pi coincides with the zero of tds the diagram is categorized with respect to three different classes as i ii and iii fig 9 the class i considers permeability value 75 class ii ranges between 25 and 75 and class iii 25 the higher values of pi indicate the relative excess value of na and hco3 with respect to major cations reflecting the tendency to affect the soil the groundwater samples considered for study fall in class ii and class i similarly higher values of tds reflect the higher concentration of ions in water which may affect the growth of plants chloride values in groundwater are classified based on their concentrations stuyfzand 1989 in a hierarchy at four different stages the first level of classification is based on the chloride concentration followed by alkalinity water type and then by classes the study by stuyfzand 1989 determined 8 11 27 and 3 categories respectively of water based on his classification the first level of classification by stuyfzand categorizes samples in 8 different classes table 10 and it is adopted in the software the samples considered for study range from fresh to brackish category the tds value is a governing factor for several utility purpose and it determines the nature of the sample the drinking domestic and agriculture utility of water depends on this parameter the tds classification is carried out for irrigation purpose crop sensitivity and it s based on ussl 1954 five different categories were recognised based on the range of tds table 11 it reveals that the samples considered for study range from 500 to 1500 mg l the groundwater is classified based on the predominance of the cation and anion they generally indicate the nature of the geochemical process undergone and the throw a light on the type of water 29 hco3 hco3 ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 x100 30 cl so4 2 cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 x100 31 na k na k ca mg na k cl so4 2 hco3 x100 32 ca2 mg2 ca2 mg2 ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 x100 there are basically eight types of facies four with respect to cation facies and four considering the predominance of anion facies table 12 most of the samples examined show calcium sodium cation facies and chloride sulfate bicarbonate anion facies the hardness of groundwater is classified into permanent and temporary designated as a and b table 13 depending on the dominance of cations and anions there are three different classes in both permanent and temporary hardness most of the samples examined in this study fall in a1 and b2 category the modified piper diagram by johnson 1975 is also plotted by the software to find out the geochemical nature of the samples the plot is based on the percentage of cations and that of anions fig 10 this plot is divided into 15 different portions depending on the dominance of the ions the plot also helps us to find the nature of predominant geochemical process the samples of the present study falls predominantly in field 13 static and disco ordinated regimes followed by 2 and 1 four other bivariate plots like ca2 mg2 vs tz ca2 mg2 vs hco3 na k vs tz and na vs cl were also be plotted to have an insight about their association fig 11 the numbers of samples which are not falling inside the standard plot purview are also indicated by the software these plots facilitate to find out the predominant geochemical processes 5 corrosion indices and comparison with who standard if option 3 is selected it leads to the calculation of minimum maximum and average of the entered values appendix vi all the values are considered in mgl 1 in this option subsequently it compares the parameter values with the who drinking water standard and indicates the number of samples greater than the prescribed limit of drinking water among the ions considered for the present samples na no3 so4 2 and f are below the permissible limit who 2011 later it calculates the langelier saturation index puckorius scaling index ryznar stability index aggressive index and larson skoid index for each sample based on the calculations the samples will be grouped into different categories according to the standard ranges and the number of samples representing each category will be displayed the langelier index lsi generally expresses the state of equilibrium with respect to calcite langelier 1936 and is given by 33 lsi ph phs where lsi is in standard ph units ph is the measured ph phs is the estimated ph at calcite saturation the value of phs is estimated using alkalinity temperature hardness and tds values langelier 1946 as follows 33 1 phs 9 3 a b c d where a to d can be calculated from 33 1 1 a log10 tds 1 10 33 1 2 b 13 12 log t 273 34 55 33 1 3 c log ca2 0 4 33 1 4 d log alk where tds is total dissolved solids in units of mgl 1 t is temperature in c ca is the concentration of calcium in mgl 1 caco3 alk is the alkalinity in mg l 1 caco3 the values thus calculated are classified with respect to definite ranges table 14 the samples examined for the current study represent the undersaturation and two samples with scaling potential appendix vi ryznar stability index rsi determines the tendency of water to precipitate calcium carbonate ryznar 1944 and is calculated as 34 rsi 2 phs ph phs lsi the obtained value is classified based on the ranges table 15 all the samples represent the undersaturation category puckorius scaling index psi is developed to consider the buffering effect of water puckorius and brooke 1991 which helps in formation of maximum precipitation and attain equilibrium psi considers ph at equilibrium than the actual ph 35 psi 2 phs ph 35 1 pheq 1 465 log alkalinity 4 54 the obtained value is classified into three categories table 16 and the samples represent high corrosion potential the larson skold index lski generally adopted to define the corrosive capacity of water with respect to steel larson and skold 1958 the following equation is used to calculate the lski 36 l s k i c l s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 similar to the psi the calculated values of lsk is also categorized table 17 into three different categories and the samples reflect high scaling potential aggressive index ai is adopted for asbestos pipes when the temperature of water passing through them varies between 4 and 27 c 40 80 f it can be calculated fazlzadeh davil et al 2009 as 37 ai ph log ca 2 hco 3 the obtained value is classified into three categories table 18 and the samples of the present study are moderatly corrosive appendix vi the indices of corrosion are generally considered significant when the application of water is expected to vary with temperature a sample output file for the input data is provided in the appendices and the output contains three files appendix iv v vi with information on classification thermodynamics and corrosiveness of water 6 conclusion there was a huge cumbersome process in calculating the values of the water quality parameters and for thermodynamic calculation plotting them in standard diagrams this application takes care of the grouping of the samples according to the standard values designated for each parameter the time consumed for the plotting and interpretation of the data has been reduced by the advent of this application the gibbs boomerang diagram doneens permeability plot and the silicate stability plots along with these essential classifications have not been customized by any of the available software it forms a component of this developed software further different corrosion indices were are also taken care of by this application sill this software does not plot the seasonal data set and is limited to 100 samples incorporation of the saturation states of minerals correlation and factor analysis of the samples will make the software complete and holistic for all hydrogeochemical studies considering the available options in the software it can be concluded that this facilitates all these basic needs of a

11956,the chief constituents in water samples are obtained by the geochemical analysis the results are then studied for various utility purposes such as domestic drinking and agriculture the results are also studied for understanding the thermodynamic states to determine geochemistry and the nature of the reactions there are several software s available for this purpose but still they do not include all the required parameters for the classification purpose or all the popular diagrams basically required for the study in this context a software was coded in c and compiled in visual c for the basic interpretation of the geochemical data considering the utility thermodynamic nature and classification of water the input data includes ca mg na k cl hco3 so4 f no3 si tds ec ph and temperature the output of the software presents the parameters like i b e index to base exchange schollers water type r s c residual sodium carbonate s a r sodium adsorption ratio n c h non carbonate hardness p i permeability index k r kellys ratio p s potential salinity m h magnesium hazard s s p soluble sodium percentage and na sodium percentage the software also calculates the scholler classification corrositvity ratio chloride classification cation anion facies and handas classification for each sample the corrosive nature of the water sample is also determined by the software by calculating puckorius scaling index ryznar stability index larson skold index langelier saturation index and aggressive index for each sample activity coefficient ionic activity and silicate stability diagrams were designed in the output later the total number samples were grouped based on the standard classification adopted for each calculated parameter standard diagrams like ussl johnsons plot gibbs doneens other thermodynamic plots for na k mg for silicate system also form the output of the software the output are saved in different files as opted during the execution of the program graphical abstract image 1 keywords software hydrogeochemical interpretations water classification geochemical plots corrosion index 1 introduction interpretation of the geochemical data forms the baseline for the management of water resources water classification adopted for utility purpose is mainly governed by the major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 along with few minor ions but for the detailed studies on the process and contamination the minor ions metals and isotopes are adopted analytical results will lead to the understanding of the relative amount of the determined chemical constituents hence to determine the groundwater facies geochemical nature its utility thermodynamic states state of contamination identification of geochemical process etc different methods or softwares were used the advent of these softwares had helped in the groundwater geochemical investigations the softwares were basically windows or dos based and they fall in three of the following categories 1 thermodynamic and equilibrium states wateq2 wateq3 wateq4f netpath phreeqc solminq eqnr3 mineql solveq and chiller watspec aqion salt norm geochemist workbench etc truesdell and jones 1974 ball and nordstrom 1991 parkhurst et al 1980 parkhurst et al 1982 bodine and jones 1986 charlton et al 1997 kharaka and barnes 1973 wolery 1992 2 geochemcial classification and process

tool etc rockware 2010 2011 de filippis et al 2017 maidment 2002 zhou and li 2006 the software s for determining the thermodynamic status of groundwater are mostly developed to understand the state of saturation for a given groundwater composition referring to certain minerals in data base this is mainly dependent on the temperature of observations number of parameters supplied as input and the mineral data base considered by the software ball et al 1979 ball et al 1981 ball and nordstrom 1991 parkhurst 1995 parkhurst and appelo 1999 plummer et al 1991 1994 schecher and mcavoy 1994 reed 1982 reed and spicer 1998 spycher and reed 1992 wigley 1977 gwb bethke 1996 2002 provides the activity temperature diagrams and calculates the thermodynamic equilibrium states in hypothetical and real world conditions the software has the capability to develop models for understating the reactions along the groundwater pathways these will help to predict the nature of reactions at definite temperature pressure conditions limited applications of ionic strength and the silicate stability diagrams were studied by prasanna et al 2011 and chidambaram et al 2012 in conjunction with the geochemical softwares to correlate the state of stability the softwares used for geochemical studies and classification purposes allows to categorise groundwater based on the major ion constituents and their association these include the categorization for drinking domestic and irrigation purpose further they also help in determining the geochemical process by comparing them to standard plots these parameters are basically studied to classify and ascertain the utility for various applications irrespective of the rock type keesari et al 2016 singaraja et al 2014 geographical locations prasanna et al 2011 pradeep et al 2016 and depth of aquifers chidambaram et al 2005 2009 these classifications techniques were adopted few softwares are copyrighted and marketed by companies others are developed by the institutions and used non commercially like hych balasubramanian et al 1991 watclast chidambaram et al 2003 individual geochemical characters of the samples without plots were inferred by hych and was adopted for studying the classification of water balaguru and senthil kumar 2013 venkatasubramani and meenambal 2007 the watclast software was adopted by several workers to geochemically classify the groundwater for various utility purpose and to ascertain the major geochemical process by adopting the plots and classified outputs prasanna et al 2009 2010 singaraja et al 2014 2013a b c chidambaram et al 2011a b a recent updated version of the hych software with more output parameters and scatter diagrams were incorporated in watchit balasubramanian and nagaraju 2019 the third category softwares are utilized to study the spatial changes of the calculated geochemical parameters also with respect to time kałka et al 2016 rossetto et al 2018 they were also adopted to infer the relationship of the parameters with respect to spatial features like geology water level geomorphology drainage etc majority of the softwares were copyrighted and marketed by companies apart from these few statistical softwares are also used for data reduction and to determine the origin and interrelationship between ions each software is unique in its application as it depends on the utility though certain softwares are dos based the results are at par with the windows based softwares except for the diagrammatic representations softwares of category 1 and 3 are unique and more specific but the softwares of category 2 try to incorporate few components of category 1 and 3 this is mainly to help the user to attain maximum possible solutions in one platform these softwares don t plot gibbs boomerang diagram gibbs 1970 which helps in determining the major geochemical process doneens permeability index doneen 1948 johnson 1975 etc the current software application has attempted to fill this gap and falls in the second category the current software also tries to reflect the thermodynamic status of the sample with respect to silicate stability and geochemical classification of samples 2 data requirements and input the software was coded in c and compiled in visual c a library file bgi 2010 was used to match the code with the recent windows operating system a separate input file is created by arranging the input parameters in definite order and saved as text file the steps involved in creation of the input file are described in appendix i chidam has one executable file the data will be fed as a separate file txt and the text output will be saved as a separate output file txt three different output files can be created according to the option selected the figures obtained are copied as screen capture and saved in paint as bmp jpeg png files 2 1 data entry the data entry can be made in ms excel and saved as a tab limited text file which will serve as an input file the code requires measured analytical values of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl no3 so4 2 h4sio4 po4 3 f tds ec ph and temperature in definite order as mentioned below ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 f no3 si tds ec ph and temperature all values should be entered in mgl 1 ec in microsiemen cm ph and temperature oc as read the entry can be made for 100 samples with all these parameters in excel and saved with a specific file name in txt format sample input file appendix ii by default the number of sample array is fixed as 100 the values of those ions which were not analysed and those below the detection limit should be given zero the text output is saved in a separate file it s prompted initially during the execution of the program the pictures or plots can be copied to paintbrush application and saved easily 2 2 processing the data is read and executed by chidam exe file appendix iii name of the input file should be provided with extension the file is read only if it exists in the same directory of the executable file the program provides an option for studying the stability of silicate minerals the classification of groundwater and the corrosion indices as 1 2 and 3 respectively sample output files appendices iv v and vi the option 4 is used to quit the application the third option for the indices includes the comparison with the who standards and summarizes the minimum maximum and average of the input values these three options were programmed with switch cases flowchart i e fig 1 the stepwise execution of the program is provided as appendix i 2 3 limitation of the software the calculation of ionic strength is based on the extended debye huckel equation and it is found to be promising for the values with ionic strength 10 1 m 12 000 μscm the applicable range falls from fresh to brackish water category the software runs only if all the required values are provided and the missing values should be given 0 which will be reflected in the subsequent calculations the software is dos based and the permits legend for one set of samples i e one season only to a maximum of 100 there not temperature corrections adopted in the thermodynamic calculations 2 4 sampling and analysis the groundwater samples used for the case study were collected from 15 borewells after well purging the samples were initially observed for ec ph and tds in the field and subsequently transported to the lab filtered and stored for analysis at 4 c the ca2 mg2 hco3 and cl were determined by the titrimetric techniques na and k by flame photometer so4 2 no3 and h4sio4 by using spectrophotometeric techniques the analytical methods adopted were based on apha 2012 and the analytical error was observed to be less than 10 3 silicate stability the stability plots can be selected by choosing option 1 the mgl 1 values are converted to mole values these values are taken for calculation of the ionic strength of each sample appendix iv the weathering of dominant silicate minerals like feldspars are presented in the software and the stability plot is made by adopting raymahasay 1986 the ionic strength of the samples was calculated by adopting the following formula 1 i 1 2 m i z i 2 m represents the mole concentration of ion and z represents the charge the samples with higher ionic strength are considered to have more dissolved ions the ionic strength of the samples considered shows a range from 0 0058 to 0 026 m and all the samples are expected to from montmorllionite due to the weathering appendix iv ionic strength is also calculated from the electrical conductivity of the solution if the analytical values are not available lind 1970 the ratio of hco3 to sio2 depends on the rate and weathering and the relative concentration in the source mineral garrels 1967 approximated the ratios and determined the source mineral albite weathering has a ratio 0 5 labradorite 1 5 biotite and anorthite 3 0 3 5 and augite 6 the ratio helps in determining the plagioclase weathering and that of pyriboles fig 2 but for the samples considered they fall above plot purview indicating higher values of hco3 than the dissolved silica which is more common in carbonate terrain 3 1 activity co efficient the activity coefficient γi was calculated by using the values of the constants at 25 c a b and ao considering the debye huckel equation debye and hückel 1923 2 log γ i a z i 2 i 1 b a 0 i this equation considers the temperature governed constants a and b for each ion the parameter ao depends on the size and charge of the ion generally the size of the ions are proportionate to the values the stability plots are created based on garrels and christ 1965 raymahasay 1986 and allan freeze and cherry 1979 the activity coefficient is calculated for the samples considered and it is calculated for the ions appendix iv later the ratios of log k to h na to h ca 2 to h and mg 2 to h were plotted against log h4sio4 3 2 ionic activity the product of mole values and activity co efficient of the specific ion provides the activity and its it obtained by the following formula 3 a i γ i x m in dilute solutions the γi is weak and is considered to be 1 in such cases activity of the mole concentration of the ion represent the activity the activity of each ion considered is thus obtained and the program facilitates the calculation for ca2 mg2 na k cl hco3 so4 2 f no3 and si appendix iv the silicate stability plots were developed for potash sodium calcium and magnesium by plotting log k h na h ca 2 h and mg 2 h against log h4sio4 respectively the plot show that the sample fall in definite fields or along the boundaries of fields thus depending upon the position of the samples thermodynamic states of water in the plots are interpretted the stability diagrams are plotted with the log activity of major ions to ph in vertical axis and log concentration of silica in horizontal axis the silica concentration increases to the right as the values read from 5 to 1 weathering initially tends the water to be stable with gibbsite and subsequently with the increase of silica and the ion concentrations it becomes stable with other fields a detailed discussion on the nature of reactions are discussed in chidambaram et al 2011a b pertaining to clay minerals stability the geochemical reactions were explained in the article with respect to reactions and state of stability as inferred by garrels and christ 1965 the thermodynamic plots are to be interpreted based on incongruent dissolution of minerals initially the composition is stable with gibbsite al oh 3 and subsequently by the addition of silica to the solution it become stable with kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 with further increase in silica and addition of k into the solution it becomes stable with illite k0 65 al2 si3 35al0 65 o10 oh 2 muscovite kal2 alsi3o10 oh 2 or potash feldspar k al si3o8 the samples considered shows stability with respect to kaolinite with few representations near the stability fields of muscovite and k feldspar field fig 3 the samples along the boundary indicate higher activity of potash with respect to ph increase of more cations like na k mg2 or ca2 with silica in solution will result in stability of the composition with respect to montmorillonite m x nh2o al2 y mgx si4o10 oh 2 where m na k mg2 or ca2 the removal of few cations by ion exchange process and addition of alumina and silica will result in the stability of the composition with respect to chlorite mg al fe 12 si al 8 o20 oh 4 h2o these processes are summarized in the diagrams for easy interpretation of the composition stability the groundwater samples depicted in the plot reflect compositional stability with kaolinite in na ca and mg silicate stability plots figs 4 6 most of the softwares derive the saturation states of the alumino silicates only when the composition of al is supplied as an input but the stability states with respect to silicate minerals can be derived from diagram just by the values of major ions and silica reactions involved during the change of stability field in sodium silicate system are 4 naalsi3o8 8h2o na al oh 3 oh 3h4sio4 5 6 na

the water classification can be made for the samples if case 2 is opted fig 1 the data are read and the values are converted to epm meql 1 values the error percentage is calculated for each sample along with the ec tds ratio which is grouped based on the following intervals 0 60 0 60 0 80 and 0 80 appendix v the electrical conductivity values were classified based on wilcox 1955 this categorization helps to ascertain the utility of water table 1 the application initially calculates with mgl 1values in the samples the hardness is calculated by using the formula 15 total hardness ca2 x 2 497 mg2 x 4 115 values in mgl 1 the calculated hardness of water is grouped for the utility purpose based on the following categories proposed sawyer and mccarty 1978 table 2 they studied samples range from 120 to 737 mg l representing slightly hard to very hard category appendix v corrosivity ratio is determined by three major anions cl so4 2 and hco3 ryznar 1944 16 c i c l 35 5 s o 4 96 2 h c o 3 100 values in mgl 1 it ranges from 0 22 to 3 2 in the samples considered appendix v the samples with corrosivity index value 1 is considered to be unsafe for domestic utility and transport along the long distance pipelines raghunath 1982 had presented few methods of classification of groundwater which includes ratios of ions like nitrate to total dissolved solids sodium to sum of alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 sodium to chloride nitrate to chloride sodium to calcium chloride to bicarbonate chloride to sulfate calcium to magnesium sum of alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 to bicarbonate alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 to total cations and alkali elements na k to total cations the mgl 1 values will be used in gibbs plots for finding out major process governing the water chemistry of the samples the gibbs plot 1970 was considered initially for the surface water studies and later it was used by different researchers to study the groundwater the plot basically tries to determine three major sources like influence of rain water interaction of water with the host matrix and the process of evaporation in this regard two plots fig 7 were considered one with respect to cation na k na k ca2 and other with respect to anion cl cl hco3 both plots were drafted against the vertical log axis with tds value mgl 1 samples with lesser tds value indicate influence of rainfall and the higher values indicate the dominance of evaporation the rock water dominant samples fall in between these two categories represented by all the samples considered for study subsequently the mgl 1 was converted into epm data using respective conversion factor initially the data is used for determining the cation and anion balance by adopting the relation 17 error ʃ cations ʃ anions ʃ cation ʃ anion x 100 the error percentage is acceptable based on the total concentration of anions table 3 chlor alkaline index cai was determined by scholler 1965 two different indices were formulated considering different anions and cations 18 cai i cl na k cl values in epm 19 cai ii cl na k so4 2 hco3 co3 2 no3 values in epm they were also considered as base exchange indices by certain researchers kumar et al 2009 thilagavathi et al 2012 the mg along with ca in rock are exchanged for na and k in groundwater if both the indices are positive in general the exchange of ca mg from rock matrix to na k in groundwater is more significant than the reverse chidambaram 2000 co3 2 was considered in this equation 19 by scholler since most of analysed groundwater samples have lesser value of this ion it is generally combined with bicarbonate for interpretation purpose hence this combination of both carbonate and bicarbonates are considered in this application scholler 1967 determined the water type depending upon the dominance of anions and classified them into four different types table 4 samples considered for study reflect type 1 hco3 so4 2 the carbonate concentration was compared with the total alkaline earth constituents ca2 mg2 in water richards 1954 and referred as residual sodium carbonate r s c the surplus carbonates will try to combine with na and k and form precipitates which may affect the permeability of the soil 20 rsc hco3 co3 2 mg2 ca2 values in epm the values are grouped into different categories depending on the ranges table 5 the values of the samples ranged from 6 3 to 2 05 reflecting good to medium permissible category nch non carbonate hardness was calculated based on the raghunath 1987 considering the epm values of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and hco3 as follows 21 nch ca2 mg2 co3 2 hco3 the samples considered for the study exhibited values between 0 and 556 reflecting good to high noncarbonate hardness appendix v kellys ratio k r is determined to know the suitableness for irrigation utility by calculating the excess values in epm of na over alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 kelley 1946 22 k r na ca2 mg2 if the values obtained from the calculation are greater than 1 they are considered unsafe for agriculture purpose and those below 1 are safe both the categories are observed in the samples with values ranging from 0 35 to 1 74 potential salinity is calculated with the epm values of cl and so4 2 palacios and aceves 1970 classified table 6 and calculated as follows 23 potential salinity cl 0 5 x so4 2 this index is generally used to determine the agricultural suitability of water and the samples considered for study range between 34 and 86 reflecting low to high potential salinity magnesium hazard was initially derived by szabolcs and darab 1964 and later classified and used predominantly by lloyd and heathcoat 1985 it is determined by using the epm values of alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 this is mainly a comparison between the alkali earth elements and to determine the relative proportion between them 24 magnesium hazard mg2 x100 ca2 mg2 if the values of magnesium hazard is 50 it s safe and can be used for irrigation if the relative concentration of mg is greater than 50 to the sum of the alkali earth elements then its unsafe for agricultural purpose the samples represented in the study range from 3 41 to 38 4 falling in safe category soluble sodium percentage ssp is the relative concentration of na that could dissolve in the solution with respect to other major cations in water todd 1980 and its considered significant for irrigation purpose values in epm 25 ssp na x 100 ca2 mg2 na the value derived is classified based on the application for irrigation purpose and it falls in the different categories table 7 strongly sodic category to very strongly sodic category are noticed in the samples considered for study with values ranging from 25 to 63 4 which indicates that the groundwater has to be used with caution for irrigation purpose the percentage of sodium na content dissolved in water is compared to other major cations as it generally govern the applicability for irrigation purpose 26 na na k ca2 mg2 na k x 100 values in epm there are two classification based on na in water by eaton 1950 and wilcox 1955 the earlier classification by eaton considers the value 50 as safe and above is considered as unsafe for irrigation purpose and later wilcox 1955 classified into 5 categories table 8 the classification will help to determine the utility of water with respect to irrigation purpose the values of the samples vary from 27 5 to 63 6 representing unsafe to safe category of eaton classification and from good to doubtful category of wilcox classification sodium adsorption ratio s a r is the prime factor adopted to explore the water quality of for irrigation it is basically dependent on the major cations ions like sodic content in comparison to definite values of alkali earth elements ca2 mg2 27 s a r n a c a m g 2 values in epm the obtained measure is classified as into different categories for irrigation purpose table 9 all the samples of the study fall in excellent category with values ranging from 0 96 to 4 6 united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 considered sar values along with the electrical conductivity values to derive a plot for understating the utility for irrigation purpose the ussl plot was designated with different codes based on the conductivity and sar values as c and s respectively fig 8 c1s1 indicates that the water has lower values of the parameters and is excellent for the irrigation purpose similarly c4s4 indicates higher value of both the parameters and the water should be used with caution for irrigation the samples of the study were observed in c2 low c3 medium and s1 low category reflecting its suitability for agricultural purpose the application tries to plot the values of both sar vertical axis and the conductivity values in μs cm the maximum value of ec considered in the plot is 3000 μs cm and an sar value of 30 the program also summarizes the number of samples falling beyond the plot region permeability index p i is calculated to ascertain the utility for irrigation purpose doneen 1948 the parameter basically tries to understand the salt forming capacity of the water and its influence on the sodicity of the soil which may reduce the soil permeability values in epm 28 p i n a h c o 3 c a m g n a 100 doneen has also devised a diagram to ascertain the suitability for irrigation considering permeability index and tds value in epm doneen 1964 the application plots the samples in the diagram the maximum value of tds considered is 30 and that of pi is 120 the horizontal axis is in reverse order and the maximum value of pi coincides with the zero of tds the diagram is categorized with respect to three different classes as i ii and iii fig 9 the class i considers permeability value 75 class ii ranges between 25 and 75 and class iii 25 the higher values of pi indicate the relative excess value of na and hco3 with respect to major cations reflecting the tendency to affect the soil the groundwater samples considered for study fall in class ii and class i similarly higher values of tds reflect the higher concentration of ions in water which may affect the growth of plants chloride values in groundwater are classified based on their concentrations stuyfzand 1989 in a hierarchy at four different stages the first level of classification is based on the chloride concentration followed by alkalinity water type and then by classes the study by stuyfzand 1989 determined 8 11 27 and 3 categories respectively of water based on his classification the first level of classification by stuyfzand categorizes samples in 8 different classes table 10 and it is adopted in the software the samples considered for study range from fresh to brackish category the tds value is a governing factor for several utility purpose and it determines the nature of the sample the drinking domestic and agriculture utility of water depends on this parameter the tds classification is carried out for irrigation purpose crop sensitivity and it s based on ussl 1954 five different categories were recognised based on the range of tds table 11 it reveals that the samples considered for study range from 500 to 1500 mg l the groundwater is classified based on the predominance of the cation and anion they generally indicate the nature of the geochemical process undergone and the throw a light on the type of water 29 hco3 hco3 ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 x100 30 cl so4 2 cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 x100 31 na k na k ca mg na k cl so4 2 hco3 x100 32 ca2 mg2 ca2 mg2 ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 hco3 x100 there are basically eight types of facies four with respect to cation facies and four considering the predominance of anion facies table 12 most of the samples examined show calcium sodium cation facies and chloride sulfate bicarbonate anion facies the hardness of groundwater is classified into permanent and temporary designated as a and b table 13 depending on the dominance of cations and anions there are three different classes in both permanent and temporary hardness most of the samples examined in this study fall in a1 and b2 category the modified piper diagram by johnson 1975 is also plotted by the software to find out the geochemical nature of the samples the plot is based on the percentage of cations and that of anions fig 10 this plot is divided into 15 different portions depending on the dominance of the ions the plot also helps us to find the nature of predominant geochemical process the samples of the present study falls predominantly in field 13 static and disco ordinated regimes followed by 2 and 1 four other bivariate plots like ca2 mg2 vs tz ca2 mg2 vs hco3 na k vs tz and na vs cl were also be plotted to have an insight about their association fig 11 the numbers of samples which are not falling inside the standard plot purview are also indicated by the software these plots facilitate to find out the predominant geochemical processes 5 corrosion indices and comparison with who standard if option 3 is selected it leads to the calculation of minimum maximum and average of the entered values appendix vi all the values are considered in mgl 1 in this option subsequently it compares the parameter values with the who drinking water standard and indicates the number of samples greater than the prescribed limit of drinking water among the ions considered for the present samples na no3 so4 2 and f are below the permissible limit who 2011 later it calculates the langelier saturation index puckorius scaling index ryznar stability index aggressive index and larson skoid index for each sample based on the calculations the samples will be grouped into different categories according to the standard ranges and the number of samples representing each category will be displayed the langelier index lsi generally expresses the state of equilibrium with respect to calcite langelier 1936 and is given by 33 lsi ph phs where lsi is in standard ph units ph is the measured ph phs is the estimated ph at calcite saturation the value of phs is estimated using alkalinity temperature hardness and tds values langelier 1946 as follows 33 1 phs 9 3 a b c d where a to d can be calculated from 33 1 1 a log10 tds 1 10 33 1 2 b 13 12 log t 273 34 55 33 1 3 c log ca2 0 4 33 1 4 d log alk where tds is total dissolved solids in units of mgl 1 t is temperature in c ca is the concentration of calcium in mgl 1 caco3 alk is the alkalinity in mg l 1 caco3 the values thus calculated are classified with respect to definite ranges table 14 the samples examined for the current study represent the undersaturation and two samples with scaling potential appendix vi ryznar stability index rsi determines the tendency of water to precipitate calcium carbonate ryznar 1944 and is calculated as 34 rsi 2 phs ph phs lsi the obtained value is classified based on the ranges table 15 all the samples represent the undersaturation category puckorius scaling index psi is developed to consider the buffering effect of water puckorius and brooke 1991 which helps in formation of maximum precipitation and attain equilibrium psi considers ph at equilibrium than the actual ph 35 psi 2 phs ph 35 1 pheq 1 465 log alkalinity 4 54 the obtained value is classified into three categories table 16 and the samples represent high corrosion potential the larson skold index lski generally adopted to define the corrosive capacity of water with respect to steel larson and skold 1958 the following equation is used to calculate the lski 36 l s k i c l s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 similar to the psi the calculated values of lsk is also categorized table 17 into three different categories and the samples reflect high scaling potential aggressive index ai is adopted for asbestos pipes when the temperature of water passing through them varies between 4 and 27 c 40 80 f it can be calculated fazlzadeh davil et al 2009 as 37 ai ph log ca 2 hco 3 the obtained value is classified into three categories table 18 and the samples of the present study are moderatly corrosive appendix vi the indices of corrosion are generally considered significant when the application of water is expected to vary with temperature a sample output file for the input data is provided in the appendices and the output contains three files appendix iv v vi with information on classification thermodynamics and corrosiveness of water 6 conclusion there was a huge cumbersome process in calculating the values of the water quality parameters and for thermodynamic calculation plotting them in standard diagrams this application takes care of the grouping of the samples according to the standard values designated for each parameter the time consumed for the plotting and interpretation of the data has been reduced by the advent of this application the gibbs boomerang diagram doneens permeability plot and the silicate stability plots along with these essential classifications have not been customized by any of the available software it forms a component of this developed software further different corrosion indices were are also taken care of by this application sill this software does not plot the seasonal data set and is limited to 100 samples incorporation of the saturation states of minerals correlation and factor analysis of the samples will make the software complete and holistic for all hydrogeochemical studies considering the available options in the software it can be concluded that this facilitates all these basic needs of a

11957,the intensification of industrial activities significantly increases the distribution of toxic substances and other non biodegradable pollutants from industrial wastewater to the environment among these contaminants persistent organic pollutants pops are considered harmful to humans wildlife and plants in order to find a solution that can improve the water quality and protect the environment interest in wastewater treatment has intensified over the last decades separation techniques i e adsorption process coagulation and electrocoagulation have proven to be more effective in removing target pollutants and largely comply with discharge legislation each of these methods has its own specific merits difficulties and parameters that affect the removal efficiency in this document these methods have been reviewed on the basis of recently published relevant literature batch and continuous modes of adsorption and electrocoagulation have been discussed for the adsorption process this review elucidated the adsorption isotherms kinetic models breakthrough curve modeling thermodynamic studies and the regeneration of the support used either in batch and continuous reactors likewise the state of the art of electrocoagulation was clarified highlighting the benefit of the electrocoagulation adsorption hybrid process to enhance the removal efficiency of organic pollutants from wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords persistent organic pollutants pops wastewater treatment elimination adsorption coagulation electrocoagulation 1 introduction the scarcity of water potential and their pollution are considered as an irrefutable global problem and a great challenge to be taken up jain et al 2020 in general water contamination is linked to a large amount of wastewater discharged into the environment from various sources in addition due to the variety of pollution sources households hospitals industries veterinary services agriculture and their various applied processes the composition and characterization of effluents are totally different and very complex darban et al 2020 lambropoulou and nollet 2014 among the compounds that may exist in wastewaters the so called persistent organic pollutants pops are difficult to be removed in accordance with the convention of stockholm bilcke 2002 these pollutants are organic compounds natural or anthropogenic remaining intact for long periods of time and they resist photolytic chemical and biological degradation el shahawi et al 2010 according to the stockholm convention they constitute a variety of compounds which besides their great persistence in the environment are characterized by semi volatility hydrophobicity bioaccumulation and toxicity betianu and gavrilescu 2006 they are classified under various carbon based categories such as solvents pesticides dyestuffs and industrial chemical by products of various elemental compositions for example polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons perfluorinated compounds dioxins dioxanes and other emerging pollutants betianu and gavrilescu 2006 el shahawi et al 2010 trojanowicz 2020 therefore it is necessary to protect the aqueous systems humans fauna and flora from these pollutants and their impact atrous et al 2019 wastewater regeneration is one of the best choices to reduce their impact various methods are used to treat the wastewater in order to reduce the amount of contaminants nataraj et al 2009 over the last decades conventional wastewater processes such as membrane filtration adsorption coagulation flocculation and electrocoagulation ec have been intensively developed to overcome insufficiently effective for many organic pollutants recently many research papers revealed their simplicity their low cost and their potential efficiency for the removal of different pollutants afanga et al 2020 kim et al 2010 sakhi et al 2020 wang et al 2011 yu et al 2010 furthermore their combination may be an alternative to enhance the quality of treated effluents abdessemed et al 2000 naddeo et al 2020 zazou et al 2019 zielińska et al 2020 among these processes adsorption and electrocoagulation processes are extensively used for the treatment of several types of pollutants electrocoagulation ec an emerging technology combines the advantages and functions of conventional coagulation flocculation and adsorption kuokkanen et al 2013 these processes have the potential to remove various types of aqueous pollutants including organic and inorganic contaminants from different types of wastewater darban et al 2020 because of its advantages ec has generated interest in the treatment of effluents containing pops esfandyari et al 2020 the main aim of this research paper is to provide an overview on the previously mentioned processes i e adsorption and electrocoagulation their potential and effectiveness were indicated for the treatment of organic pollutants in water purification and wastewater treatment based on recent publications in this field 2 adsorption the adsorption process is a surficial phenomenon in which a soluble chemical adsorbate is removed from a fluid by contact with a solid surface adsorbent ali et al 2012 this approach has high potential to remove persistent organic and inorganic compounds sponza et al 2015 it is often used in industry for product separation and waste treatment ali et al 2012 adsorption phenomena can be classified as a physical or chemical adsorption process physical adsorption involves low forces van der waals interaction and it is thus reversible it occurs at low temperatures very similar to a condensation process and is exothermic with a heat of adsorption similar to the latent heat of condensation cooney 1998 it is considered a complex phenomenon that can be affected by various factors including surface area pore structure adsorbent surface chemistry the nature of the adsorbate the presence of competing adsorbates and the ph of the solution cooney 1998 however chemical adsorption chemisorption occurs at high temperatures with high activation energy involving strong bonds and is not reversible the heat of adsorption is generally high in chemisorption because it is generated during a chemical reaction cooney 1998 recently among the removal methods the adsorption process has shown an increase of interest fig 1 due to many advantages such as its potential efficiency low energy expenditure high preference at the molecular level easy manipulation and ability to separate various chemical compounds maingi et al 2017 a large surface area is a required as well as an essential characteristic of an effective adsorbent therefore materials with a vast number of tiny pores in the interior of the granular material are recommended howe et al 2012 activated carbon ac is the most popular adsorbent used for the removal of a variety of pollutants and it can be used either in granular or powdered form commonly ac can be prepared from natural carbonaceous materials such as coal peat and coconut enhancing the possibility of recycling or valorizing different biomaterials and waste products to be used in the water treatment field ali et al 2012 however many drawbacks limit the use of activated carbon such as its higher cost and the difficulty of its regeneration sponza et al 2015 different studies reported the use of many materials as efficient and sheep adsorbents eco friendly renewable and require less processing time they may include adsorbents such as fruit waste kadhom et al 2020 coconut shell zhao et al 2018 nutshells lima et al 2019 bark and other tannin rich materials ighalo and adeniyi 2020 sawdust hameed et al 2007 rice husk lv et al 2020 fertilizer wastes chen et al 2019 egg shells abdel khalek et al 2017 fish scales marrakchi et al 2017 chitosan lipatova et al 2018 seaweed and algae ahmed et al 2019 nautiyal et al 2016 moreover many adsorbents issued from soil such as fly ash dash et al 2018 peat moss hemmati et al 2016 red mud thakare et al 2020 zeolites brião et al 2018 clays sponza et al 2015 titchou et al 2020b sediment and soil qu et al 2008 tao and tang 2004 reveled a higher removal efficiency toward different pollutants otherwise synthetic adsorbents obtained from industrial wastes such as scrap tyres can help for wastewater remediation li et al 2010 the adsorption process has shown a higher application and efficiency in the elimination of different organic pollutants in different water bodies these organic pollutants may be dyes atrous et al 2019 pesticides mojiri et al 2020 hydrocarbons bläker et al 2020 phenols dehmani et al 2020 biphenyls wang et al 2019 detergents thirupathi et al 2007 oils and greases dumore and mukhopadhyay 2012 and pharmaceuticals luján facundo et al 2019 etc as long as adsorption is a surface phenomenon yielding to increase the concentration of a particular component at the interface between two phases it may be a result of different interactions electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding surface precipitation π π interaction n π interaction cation exchange hydrophobic interaction covalent and electrostatic interactions etc gupta et al 2013 mojiri et al 2020 salleh et al 2011 tran et al 2017 therefore for better interpreting and understanding the mechanism of the adsorption several techniques can be used to characterize an adsorbent table 1 2 1 adsorption mode the adsorption process is commonly performed in batch reactors to study the removal of a wide range of pollutants however the scaling up of continuous flow systems is contributing to the development of large scale adsorption in technical systems among several types of reactors a stirred tank and fluidized bed column could be used to perform the continuous flow treatment however dynamic adsorption using a fixed bed column fig 2 presents the best option as it is capable of treating large volumes of pollutant solutions and reaches high removal efficiency thanks to several advantages like simplicity and easy scaling up at laboratory scale rosales et al 2017 the fixed bed column can also be used to study the mobility in natural soil and the retention potential of different pollutants such as phenolic acids and humic substances ait akbour et al 2013 ouachtak et al 2018 practically fluid flow rate bed height inlet concentration ahmed and hameed 2018 permeation particle size porosity convection diffusion chemical reactions involved in adsorption and column regeneration should be taken into consideration esfandian et al 2017 rosales et al 2017 the exit concentration versus time or effluent volume is called a breakthrough curve and is used to study the dynamic adsorption the breakthrough curve corresponds to the evolution of the concentration at the outlet of a fixed bed fed continuously by a solution of concentration c0 it can be presented in the normalized pore volume and concentration i e c c0 f v vp fig 3 where c and c0 are the outlet and inlet pollutant concentrations and v and vp are the collected sample volume of the effluent and pore volume respectively ait akbour et al 2013 as reported by patel 2019 when the solution is introduced through the column inlet in the first step of dynamic adsorption the upper layers of the fresh adsorbent adsorb adsorbate quickly and efficiently therefore the primary adsorption zone is located near the top of the column where the adsorbate concentration c and the ratio c c0 are almost zero subsequently the upper layer of the adsorbent is progressively saturated by the injection of the adsorbate into the column which becomes progressively less efficient the movement of this zone rises mainly as the initial concentration increases compared to the linear velocity of the influent water after some time cs the column becomes completely saturated and consequently no adsorption occurs this point is characterized by exhaustion point where a ratio of c c0 equal to 1 the breakthrough curve explains the dynamics of a continuous adsorption system a typical one includes the mass transfer zone mtz where adsorption occurs generally the breakthrough occurs at contact time tb where c c0 0 05 tan and hameed 2017 furthermore the behavior of the breakthrough curve bc is linked to the adsorption isotherm shape and is influenced by the diffusional stages within the fixed bed babakhani et al 2017 the nature of the wastewater to be treated has a direct influence on the shape of the breaking curve therefore when only adsorbable pollutants are present the adsorption occurs quickly and the bc will become steep however in the case of a mixture of components having different adsorption capabilities the breakthrough becomes flatter and the sorption zone looks deeper vinodhini and das 2010 moreover from the breakthrough curve several parameters can be calculated aksu and gönen 2004 ghosh et al 2014 the volume of the treated effluent is named veff which can be determined by eq 1 1 v e f f q t t o t a l where q and ttotal are the volumetric flow rate ml min 1 and total flow time min the total adsorbed quantity qtotal mg in the column for a given inlet concentration and flow rate is calculated from eq 2 2 q t o t a l q a 1000 q 1000 t 0 t t t o t a l c a d d t where q is and volumetric flow rate ml min 1 a is the area of the adsorption zone obtained by integrating the adsorbed concentration cad mg l 1 versus t min and ttotal is the total flow time min total amount of pollutants sent to the column mtotal is expressed by eq 3 3 m total c 0 qt total 1000 where c0 is the inlet concentration mg l 1 q is and volumetric flow rate ml min 1 and ttotal is the total flow time min the total removal percent of contaminants for a flow volume presents the ratio of the total adsorbed amount of contaminant qtotal to the total amount of pollutants sent to the column mtotal this parameter describes the column performance and it is given by eq 4 4 total removal q total m total 100 the equilibrium uptake qeq or the maximum capacity of the column presents the total amount of adsorbate sorbed qtotal per gram of sorbent x at the end of the total flow time its expression is given by eq 5 5 q eq q total x the unadsorbed pollutant concentration at equilibrium in the column ceq mg l 1 can be defined by eq 6 6 c eq m total q total v eff 1000 where mtotal is the total amount of pollutants sent to the column qtotal is the total amount of adsorbate sorbed and veff is the volume of the treated effluent the value of the adsorption capacity at the breakthrough point qb mg g 1 can be calculated by eq 7 7 q b 0 v b c 0 c mdv where c0 and c are the concentrations mg l 1 in the input and effluent solution respectively m is the mass g of the solid packed in the fixed bed and vb is the effluent volume l at the breakthrough point similarly the values of the adsorption capacity at the exhaustion point qe mg g 1 of the fixed bed can also be calculated by eq 8 8 q e 0 v e c 0 c mdv where c0 and c are the concentrations mg l 1 in the input and effluent solution respectively m is the mass g of the solid packed in the fixed bed and ve is the volume l of water passed up to the point of bed exhaustion compared to the batch system in continuous mode the flow rate determines the sufficient value of contact between the adsorbent and the adsorbate and the bed high influences the adsorption uptake ahmed and hameed 2018 the increase of the bed height provides enough time for the solute to adsorb into the sorbent mass and thus it stays longer in the column and treats more volume of wastewater ahmed and hameed 2018 esfandian et al 2017 from this point of view several research papers have studied the performance of the continuous adsorption mode for the removal of target contaminants to provide a real insight into the applicability of this technology kim et al 2010 investigated the batch and continuous adsorption of trimethoprim onto granular activated carbon and powdered activated carbon obtaining removals above 90 similarly jain et al 2020 performed the adsorption of acid blue 25 using the residue of waste tea in a continuous and batch reactor the maximum adsorption uptakes were 127 1 mg g 1 318 k ph 1 0 waste tea residue 3 5 g l 1 t 210 min and 50 8 mg g 1 packing heights 4 5 cm flow rate 7 ml min 1 c0 200 mg l 1 ph 1 0 using batch and continuous reactor respectively 2 2 parameters influencing batch adsorption 2 2 1 adsorbent nature considering the origin of adsorbents organic ones can be prepared from materials that have higher carbon content such as fruit waste rice husks bark algae peat moss hair keratin organic industrial products including petroleum and fertilizer products ali et al 2012 while inorganic adsorbents are obtained from soil clays mud zeolites ores metal oxides and hydroxides and are highly applied because of their abundance and low cost ali et al 2012 kadhom et al 2020 2 2 2 adsorbent dosage the amount of adsorbent used g l 1 is usually a parameter that must be optimized since it influences the volume of available binding sites and the adsorbent surface area brião et al 2018 this has a direct effect on the adsorption uptake of qt mg g 1 eq 9 and equilibrium time abdel khalek et al 2017 9 q t m g g 1 c 0 c e v m where c0 mg l 1 and ce mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the pollutant respectively v is the volume of the batch solution l and m is the amount of the adsorbent g used in the experiments it had been reported that using an adsorbent dosage up to the optimal value can reduce the adsorption capacity due to the existence of unsaturated active sites hemmati et al 2016 nsami and mbadcam ndi nsami and ketcha mbadcam 2013 used activated carbon prepared from cola nut shells by zncl2 to study the effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of 100 ppm of methylene blue mb they observed that the uptake of the dye decreases while increasing the adsorbent dose varying the adsorbent dosage from 0 1 to 0 5 g for 30 ml of mb the maximum adsorbed quantity qe 87 4 mg g 1 was reached by 0 1 g activated carbon prepared from agricultural waste they attributed this result to the overlapping or accumulation of adsorption sites while increasing of the amount in grams of the adsorbent similarly in the case of moroccan pozzolana titchou et al 2020b evaluated the effect of adsorbent concentration on the elimination of 30 mg l 1 of mb at ph 5 9 for 1 h and using different doses of pozzolana between 0 4 and 3 g l 1 they observed an increase of the adsorbed amount qt from 21 to 28 mg g 1 and the adsorption efficiency color removal from 39 7 to 78 9 when the adsorbent dosage increased from 0 4 to 0 8 g l 1 they also reported that beyond 0 8 g l 1 the discoloration remains constant approximately 99 and the dye removal decreases from 28 to 9 9 mg g 1 due to the limited adsorption caused by the lack of the pollutant while increasing the concentration of adsorbent 2 2 3 solution ph the solution ph plays a role in the entire adsorption phenomena and especially on the adsorption capacity the ph has a significant effect on the existing form of pollutants in the case of charged species the surface chemical properties of the support and the affinity of the adsorbate molecules to the adsorbent depending on the state of both materials ahmed et al 2019 li et al 2010 lv et al 2020 generally the solution ph influences the adsorption mechanism therefore it is considered worthwhile and crucial to determine the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent the point of zero charge phpzc ph where the solid particle possesses globally net zero charge is determined by measuring the equilibrium ph phf versus the initial ph phi of solutions containing the sorbent the phpzc of the sorbent is the ph where phf is not affected by the reaction time phpzc phi phf tan et al 2008 titchou et al 2020b the electrical state of an adsorbent may be identified by either the point of zero charge pzc or the isoelectric point iep iep happens when the electro kinetic potential zeta potential at the interface is null value of iep represents the external surface charge of colloidal particles in the solution whereas the pzc depends on the net total surface charge of the support external and internal tran et al 2017 consequently the phpzc can help in the identification of the nature of charges on the surface of the adsorbent ahmed et al 2019 in the case of dye molecules if ph phpzc cationic dye adsorption is favorable whereas if ph phpzc anionic dye adsorption occurs dash et al 2018 likewise abdel khalek et al 2017 concluded that the adsorption of congo red cr and methylene blue mb onto eggshells is highly dependent on the solution ph they observed that the adsorbed amount increased slightly from 16 8 to 19 9 mg g 1 for mb and jumped quickly for cr from 9 5 to 18 7 mg g 1 when the ph went from the more alkaline region to the more acidic region as was mentioned in section 2 the adsorption of organic pollutants can result in different mechanisms it s mainly resulted from electrostatic hydrogen bonding and van der waals interaction for charged species meanwhile it is essentially governed by hydrophobic interactions ᴨ ᴨ n ᴨ etc in the case of uncharged molecules due to their ph independency for example aromatics adsorption is mainly attributed to their hydrophobicity and their potential to accept or donate electrons these characters influence their electron density creating partial charges which result in the interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent these phenomena were reported by liu and wang while studying the adsorption of nitrobenzene on modified activated carbon liu and wang 2011 2 2 4 contact time the adsorption process comprises two phases a primary rapid phase and a second slow phase where the contact time influences the adsorbed amount of pollutants abdel khalek et al 2017 practically the adsorption improves with time until equilibrium is attained this behavior is attributed almost to the adsorption of contaminates on the adsorbate active sites however with the progresses of time the active sites get occupied due to competitive adsorption of sorbate molecules abdel khalek et al 2017 hemmati et al 2016 marrakchi et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to determine the equilibrium time which can take few minutes or hours or maybe days depending on the material porosity to describe the real kinetic order followed by the system tran et al 2017 for instance dash et al 2018 used a modified coal fly ash with sulfonic acid as a potential adsorbent to investigate the effect of contact time on the adsorption of malachite green mg and rhodamine 6g r6g dyes from aqueous solution they indicated that the initial dye adsorption rate increased sharply with time and the maximum percentage of adsorption 98 7 occurred within 50 min for r6g and within 40 min for mg 99 2 after that time it reached equilibrium nsami and mbadcam ndi nsami and ketcha mbadcam 2013 performed the adsorption of mb on activated carbon obtained from cola nut shells they reported that the elimination rate was slow up to 50 min and then it increased quickly and progressively decreased to attain the equilibrium state within 3 h beyond this time the removal rate was constant 2 2 5 pollutant concentration experimentally the effect of the initial amount of pollutants can be evaluated by performing different trials in which a series of adsorbate solutions at different initial concentrations are mixed with a fixed dose of adsorbent at fixed time intervals and stirred until equilibrium salleh et al 2011 as presented in equation 9 the adsorption amount depends on the concentration of contaminants for a fixed adsorbent dosage and depending on the density of the active sites an increase of pollutant concentration leads to saturate the adsorbent active sites and decrease the adsorption efficiency salleh et al 2011 yagub et al 2014 as reported by djafer et al 2014 while studying the effect of bimacid dye concentration on its elimination from aqueous solution by adsorption on bentonite pozzolana and biosorption on fixed anaerobic sulfate reducer cells for 8 h of contact time 0 1 g l 1 of the adsorbent at ph 2 0 the removal efficiency decreased with increasing red bimacid dye initial concentration for both processes the removal efficiency values decrease from 90 to 78 for immobilized anaerobic sulfate reducer cells 60 51 for pozzolana and 55 43 for bentonite due the low availability of active sites on the surface of the support to fix more adsorbate similarly yagub et al 2012 investigated the effect of initial concentration of mb on its adsorption by pine leaves they found that increasing the initial concentration of mb from 10 to 90 mg l 1 the adsorption capacity increased from 32 to 123 mg g 1 after 240 min the dye removal decreased from 97 to 41 while increasing the concentration from 10 to 90 mg l 1 however higher pollutant concentration may increase the adsorption capacity due to the enhancement of the driving forces that overcome the mass transfer resistance of pollutants between the liquid and solid phase hemmati et al 2016 qu et al 2008 yagub et al 2014 the same trend was reported by dogan et al doğan et al 2009 they observed that the adsorption capacity of hazelnut shell increases with the increase of the initial concentration of methylene blue they attributed this result to the high driving force of mass transfer and the attractive forces between the dye molecule and the adsorbent such as van der waals force and electrostatic attraction the fast diffusion onto the external surface was followed by fast pore diffusion into the intraparticle matrix which contains the chromophore groups such as alcoholic carbonylic and phenolic occurring in the adsorption to attain rapid equilibrium doğan et al 2009 2 2 6 temperature the temperature is a crucial parameter it effects on the mobility of particles their diffusion and the viscosity of the treated solution its influence on the adsorption process can be carried out by preparing the adsorbent adsorbate solutions with different initial pollutant concentrations solutions are then stirred until the equilibrium time is achieved at different fixed temperature values depending on the behavior of the adsorption capacity qt by raising the temperature the adsorption is considered endothermic if qt increases with the increase of temperature otherwise it is considered exothermic salleh et al 2011 yagub et al 2014 marrakchi et al 2017 used carbonized fish labeo rohita scales cfs for the adsorption of reactive orange 16 dye ro16 using a batch reactor to investigate the effect of temperature 30 50 c on the adsorption efficiency they observed an increase in the adsorption capacity while increasing the temperature where the prepared cfs exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 105 8 107 2 and 114 2 mg g 1 at 30 c 40 c and 50 c respectively similarly dehmani et al 2020 performed the adsorption of phenol on moroccan clay they reported that the adsorption quantities of phenol on the activated clay were 5 8 6 2 and 6 8 mg g 1 at 30 c 40 c and 50 c respectively the maximum adsorption capacities were 1 4 2 1 and 2 7 mg g 1 for the raw clay at the same temperatures affirming that the adsorption was endothermic therefore abdel khalek et al 2017 reported that using an initial dye concentration of 200 mg l 1 at the initial ph solution of 5 2 and 7 1 for methylene blue mb and congo red cr respectively the amount of adsorbed of mb and cr onto eggshell decreased gradually with the increase of temperature they attributed this behavior to the increase of the mobility of dye ions and their escape from the solid phase eggshell to the liquid phase 2 3 parameters influencing continuous adsorption the trend of the breakthrough curve depends on the equilibrium and the adsorption kinetic the hydrodynamic parameters of the reactor and the parameters developed in the case of batch reactors in this section the effect of the inlet concentration flow rate and the bed high on the breakthrough and exhaustion points were evaluated 2 3 1 effect of the inlet concentration the inlet concentration is a limiting factor and the main process variable since a given mass of adsorbent can only adsorb a fixed amount of pollutants afroze et al 2016 the increase of the inlet concentration results in the quickly attaining of the equilibrium conditions where the breakthrough and exhaustion time will occur earlier saravanan et al 2018 in this case the breakthrough curves are shifted towards the origin due to the earlier saturation of the fixed bed this behavior is attributed to the enhancement of the driving force for mass transfer across the liquid film along with the acceleration of the adsorption rate darweesh and ahmed 2017 however as reported by sotelo et al 2012 a decrease in the inlet concentration leads to an increase in the breakthrough time where the binding sites became more slowly saturated in the system besides that it gives a lower slope of the curve which indicates a slower mass transport due to a decreased diffusion coefficient or decreased mass transfer coefficient similar observations were reported elsewhere ait akbour et al 2013 hethnawi et al 2017 2020 2 3 2 effect of the flow rate the flow rate directly influences the contact time between the adsorbate and adsorbent by increasing the flow rate the equilibrium time to reach saturation is reduced considerably and the breakthrough points occur faster however a decrease in the flow rate leads to an increase in the saturation breakthrough time patel 2019 herein pollutants will have more contact time with the adsorbent which results in higher removal from the solution due to the higher diffusion into the pores of the adsorbent biswas et al 2020 afroze et al 2016 reported that the breakthrough curve became steeper as the flow rate was increased resulting in lower break point time and adsorbed dye concentration afroze et al 2016 this result happens when the residence time tr of the contaminant in the column is not enough to reach adsorption equilibrium at a higher flow rate consequently the pollutant leaves the column before equilibrium occurs causing a reduction in removal efficiency ghorai and pant 2005 however garcía mateos et al 2015 mentioned that the change of the flow rate has a negligible impact on the breakthrough curve shape confirming the absence of external mass transfer control they observed this result while evaluating the effect of the debit variation on the breakthrough curve shape under 25 c for 5 mg l 1 of paracetamol at the column inlet and 200 mg of activated carbon 2 3 3 effect of bed height the bed height is an important parameter in the design of any packed bed fluidized bed or semifluidized bed adsorption reactor because it is proportional to the amount of the adsorbent in the column biswas et al 2020 nazari et al 2016 by increasing the height of the bed breakthrough curves can be achieved more quickly saravanan et al 2018 nazari et al 2016 observed that both the exhaustion time and the effluent volume veff increase with increasing the bed height moreover they reported that a higher bed contains more adsorbent therefore the total surface area will increase however in their case a relatively low bed height was beneficial to antibiotics adsorption because of the nonaccessibility of all adsorbent surfaces at higher bed values similarly dawood et al 2019 observed that the breakthrough time tb total treated methylene blue mb dye volume and the removal of mb increased with the increase of the bed height they indicated that a higher breakthrough time indicates a better intraparticle diffusion phenomenon and thus higher adsorption capacity likewise sotelo et al 2013 reported that increasing the bed height leads to an enhance in the breakthrough time tb for the bed depths of 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 cm the tb values were 233 7 315 7 and 453 8 h respectively 2 4 breakthrough curve modeling according to the literature different models were used to describe the breakthrough curve and the adsorption kinetic five models namely adams bohart eq 11 thomas eq 12 yoon nelson eq 13 bed depth service time bdst eq 14 and clark model eq 15 are the most used in the dynamic adsorption system their description is presented in table 2 to confirm which model is the best the analysis of the error is necessary the correlation coefficient r2 adjusted coefficient of determination adjusted r2 and the residual sum of squares rss eq 10 can be used for the validation of these models nazari et al 2016 the mathematical formula of rss is 10 rss i 1 n y i f x i 2 where yi is the ith value of the variable to be predicted xi is the ith value of the explanatory variable and f xi is the predicted value of yi 2 5 adsorption kinetic in short besides the adsorption ability of an adsorbent a fast adsorption rate is required for a better choice of material to be used as an adsorbent the kinetic study is an important means to study the dynamics of the adsorption by determining the rate constant of the process salleh et al 2011 the main models used in the literature are the pseudo first order kinetic eq 16 the pseudo second order kinetic eq 17 the elovich model eq 18 and the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model eq 19 table 2 2 6 adsorption isotherms to describe the adsorption mechanism at a constant temperature and ph isotherms are used to explain the phenomenon controlling the retention or release or mobility of a substance from aquatic environments to a solid phase it may explain how the adsorbent will interact with the adsorbate and give an idea of adsorption capacity referring to their graphical representation corda and kini 2018 foo and hameed 2010 yagub et al 2014 according to the literature different models are used and a distinction can be made between two and three parameter isotherms depending on the studied parameters any of them could be chosen for the best fitting of the adsorption data foo and hameed 2010 langmuir eq 20 freundlich eq 21 temkin eq 22 and dubinin radushkevich eq 23 are the most used models and they are known as two parameter isotherms table 2 2 7 thermodynamic studies of adsorption from the thermodynamic viewpoint the adsorption can be evaluated by the standard values of gibbs free energy δg0 kj mol 1 eq 24 enthalpy δh0 kj mol 1 and entropy δs0 j mol 1 k 1 eq 25 changes to evaluate the spontaneity of the sorption process abdel khalek et al 2017 brião et al 2018 24 ln ρ k c δ s r δ h rt 25 δg rtln ρ k c where t is the temperature in degree k r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 kc is the equilibrium constant l g 1 and ρ is the solution density g l 1 the values of δh δg and δs are determined by the correlation of ln kc versus 1 t data using a linear regression analysis which should give a straight line with an acceptable coefficient of determination the spontaneity of the process can be verified by δg values the negative δg values indicate that the adsorption is spontaneous and favorable from the δh value it can be verified that the adsorption onto the adsorbent is an endothermic process if the δh value is positive while a negative value indicates an exothermic adsorption process abdel khalek et al 2017 brião et al 2018 marrakchi et al 2017 on the other hand the negative values of entropy change δs suggest the decrease in randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption meanwhile the positive value reveals the affinity between the adsorbate molecules and the adsorbent with the increase in the degree of freedom abdel khalek et al 2017 marrakchi et al 2017 2 8 adsorbent and column regeneration an effective adsorbent has higher adsorption efficiency as well as regeneration capacity regeneration study is useful for the investigation of the recovery of pollutants and adsorbent suitability dash et al 2018 therefore the regeneration of support used either in batch or in dynamic adsorption is necessary to reduce the cost effectiveness of the process hence regeneration and desorption experiments are used to find the optimal desorption for an eluent peng et al 2018 lipatova et al 2018 studied the removal of anionic dyes from water by adsorption on chitosan nanoparticles fixed on the fibrous carrier cpf these authors reported that the saturated cpf could be effectively regenerated by simple alkaline washing рн 10 through repeated recycle tests sorption desorption they indicated that the stable sorption and recycling performance of the cpf can be obtained even after five cycles similarly lima et al 2019 performed the regeneration of activated carbons derived from brazilian nutshells for the elimination of acetaminophen from aqueous solutions and hospital effluents they regenerated the support up to 74 with a mixture of 0 1m naoh 20 etoh solution therefore they concluded that the adsorbent could be recycled up to four cycles to ensure long term use of the adsorbent for this purpose sotelo et al 2013 studied the desorption of flumequine from the saturated column by etoh water 50 50 v v desorption experiments were carried out for column bed lengths of 4 0 and 6 0 cm a volumetric flow rate of 2 0 ml min 1 and an initial flumequine dose of 1 0 mg l 1 the results revealed that the elution efficiency achieved is very low 24 5 for a column bed length of 4 0 cm and 38 2 for 6 0 cm they attributed this behavior to the uncompleted reversible adsorption of pharmaceutical products likewise yan et al 2016 regenerated more than 87 of a fixed bed column containing rice husk ash after mb adsorption using ethanol for three cycles they maintained the flow rate of the eluting process at 2 min l 1 until the outlet of the column became colorless table 3 shows some examples of batch and fixed bed adsorption applications 3 coagulation the principal property of fine particles in water is the charge of their surface which is ph dependent and contributes to relative stability forcing them to remain in suspension to prevent their aggregation for long periods the surface charge can be attributed to different phenomena such as 1 isomorphous replacement of metal atoms in the crystal material crystal imperfections 2 structural imperfections that occur while the formation of the crystal 3 adsorption of specific ions 4 the ionization of inorganic surface functional groups howe et al 2012 and 5 the crystal ions pair distribution and or the adsorption of macro ions thomas et al 2002 these phenomena provide positive or negative charges on colloidal particle surfaces depending on the ph and the adsorbent iso electrical point iep the stabilization of these particles is achieved in aqueous media through the balance between repulsive forces and van der waals attraction as explained by derjaguin landua verwey overbeek dlvo theory park and seo 2011 furthermore this theory can also predict the coagulation floculation of the system and the destabilization of colloidal particles in aqueous media park and seo 2011 the term coagulation flocculation refers to all physicochemical processes by which colloidal particles or fine suspended solids are transformed by chemical flocculants into more visible and separable species flocs carmen and daniel 2012 howe et al 2012 concerning the coagulation process it aims to destabilize colloidal particles and convert them into aggregates by the compression of the electrical double layer this minimizes the strength of the pollutant repulsion which is quantified by the zeta potential value tahreen et al 2020 the destabilization of colloidal particles by coagulants is achieved through several mechanisms including charge neutralization double layer compression adsorption interparticles bridging and enmeshment chen et al 2020 tahreen et al 2020 the formed flocs are then removed by decantation and filtration and then evacuated padmaja et al 2020 the main coagulants used to destabilize suspended particles and produce flocs are aluminum sulfate alum al2 so4 3 18h2o sodium aluminate naalo2 ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o and ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 9h2o comninellis and chen 2010 pereira and alves 2012 the hydroxylation of these compounds forms insoluble precipitates that destabilize the particles by their adsorption and neutralization of their charge thus reduction of the repulsive forces howe et al 2012 chemical coagulation cc is often applied for the treatment of textile industry wastewater to remove color and reduce chemical oxygen demand cod prior to biological processes as a primary treatment process papic et al 2000 generally alum is most satisfactory for the discoloration of textile effluents containing vat and sulfur dyes however inorganic coagulants such as alum are totally ineffective for reactive azo acid and basic dyes mansour et al 2011 the process is limited by the extensive addition of chemicals and the large quantities of sludge formed at the end of treatment their reuse remains the only way out but it requires additional investment to regenerate them and to treat them for recovery sqalli houssini et al 2020 the process is highly sensitive to ph changes and effective coagulation is achieved at ph 6 0 7 0 therefore during the coagulation process the hydrolysis of the metal salts will decrease the ph values which need to be adjusted to modulate the effluent ph comninellis and chen 2010 in recent years electrocoagulation ec has attracted extensive attention and research as an alternative to the chemical coagulation method padmaja et al 2020 performed a benchmark study on the efficiency of cc and ec processes for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents the results showed that cc decreased considerably the percentage of suspended solids cod and chlorides but the elimination of the total dissolved solids tds were only 14 1 using alum and 26 3 with fecl3 whereas ec process reduced cod and tds to a greater extent 92 3 and 91 5 proving more efficiency with fe al assembly using a lowest current of 0 04 a at a time interval of 15 min this study affirmed also that the consumption of coagulants is less in ec compared to cc rendering it a cost effective technology similarly chen et al 2020 compared ec anode electrocoagulation aec and cc process through the quantification of the contribution of each process on emulsified oil elimination from polymer flooding sewage they concluded that under all conditions studied the ec performance outperforms aec and far beyond cc 3 1 electrocoagulation principle and mechanism over the last few decades the ec process has proven to be a leading technique for wastewater treatment it is an emerging method that combines the benefits and functions of conventional coagulation flotation adsorption precipitation discharge and electrochemical reactions including cathodic reduction and anodic oxidation fig 4 kuokkanen et al 2013 shadmehr et al 2019 song et al 2017 this technology is known for a lot of advantages such as being attractive for its versatility ease of control safety selectivity and being able for automation thakur et al 2009 the coagulation and precipitation of contaminants in the form of sludge is the result of three possible mechanisms electrocoagulation ec electroflotation ef and electrooxidation eo fig 5 sahu et al 2014 zaied et al 2020 ec involves the in situ generation of coagulants by the application of direct current voltage to oxidize a sacrificial anode such as fe secula et al 2011 al liu and wu 2019 hybrid al fe electrodes chen 2004 mild steel manilal et al 2020 and stainless steel ss titchou et al 2020a and the production of hydrogen gas chen 2004 titchou et al 2020a yuksel et al 2013 the electro oxidation of the anodes produces metal ions that act as destabilizing agents to help the charged particles bind together forcing them to coagulate and be removed from wastewater alizadeh et al 2015 sahu et al 2014 neutralization of the electric charge is achieved by reducing the interparticle electrostatic repulsion to the point where the van der waals attraction predominates to form a mass or floc comninellis and chen 2010 sahu et al 2014 the electrolysis of water in the ec process produces oxygen and h2 bulbs at the anode and the cathode respectively which enhances the flotation and the formation of flocs chen 2004 reported that the use of stable and active electrodes for oxygen evolution would boost the electroflotation technology and enhance the removal efficiency of colloidal particles oil and grease as well as organic pollutants the process follows three successive steps i production of coagulants from the electrolytic oxidation of a sacrificial anode ii destabilization of organics and particulate suspension and formation of flocs and iii aggregation of destabilized particulates and sludge formation titchou et al 2020a this process occurred as follows 26 at the anode m mn ne 27 2h2o 4h o2 4e 28 at the cathode nh 2 o ne n 2 h 2 n oh 29 mn ne m 30 in the bulk of solution mn noh m oh n where m and n are the anode material and the number of electrons involved in the reaction respectively ghernaout 2013 kim et al 2002 after the formation of insoluble polymeric metal hydroxides four mechanisms of destabilization could occur it may be realized by surface complexation when the pollutant acts as a ligand to link the polymers formed ye et al 2019 the electrostatic attraction where contaminants neutralize the surface charge on the m oh n compress the diffuse double layer due to the increase of concentration metal ions in the solution the precipitation chemical attachment to colloidal materials and the chain oxidation reaction in the presence of nacl that may enhance the formation of the mono and polynuclear hydroxide form of the metal bassyouni et al 2017 shadmehr et al 2019 the effectiveness of the process depends on many operating conditions such as the arrangement of electrodes the electrode form the nature of power supply the solution ph the conductivity of the solution the distance between electrodes the agitation speed the current density the initial pollutant concentration the electrolysis time the retention time the temperature the presence of nacl and the passivation of the electrode chen 2004 khandegar and saroha 2013 moussa et al 2017 3 2 factors influencing electrocoagulation 3 2 1 electrocoagulation design electrocoagulation has been used for the removal of different pollutants using both batch and continuous reactors continuous flow mode ec reactors have many forms like turbulent flow reactor airlift reactor and modified flow song et al 2017 ec cells may contain either one or multiple anode cathode pairs which may be connected in monopolar or bipolar mode in a well defined shape and size capacity container reactor khandegar and saroha 2013 kuokkanen et al 2013 generally stirring is necessary to keep the liquid and slurry uniform in the reactor ec reactor contains plate electrodes placed in a parallel arrangement where water flows through the space between the electrodes in a vertical or horizontal direction sahu et al 2014 the geometry of the ec reactor influences not only the cost effectiveness and easy operation but also the efficiency of the ec process kobya et al 2020 a simple form of an ec reactor may be constituted with one anode and one cathode connected to an external power source mollah et al 2001 the application of ec process in the industrial scale up requires a workable rate of metal dissolution and a large surface area of electrodes mollah et al 2001 fig 6 shows three possible electrode connections in an ec reactor monopolar parallel mp p monopolar serial mp s and bipolar serial bp s they consist of two metal electrodes placed between two parallel plates and a direct current power source chen 2004 kobya et al 2020 mollah et al 2001 zaied et al 2020 in the monopolar systems all anodes are connected to each other and similarly all cathodes are also connected to each other and their two faces are active with the same polarity sahu et al 2014 in mp p a particular sacrificial anode is linked to another anode directly similar arrangements for cathodes also exist it is a simple arrangement of an ec cell with a couple of anodes and a couple of cathodes in a parallel arrangement kobya et al 2020 mollah et al 2001 zaied et al 2020 in the monopolar serial arrangement the individual anode cathode pair is connected internally and they are not linked to the outer electrodes zaied et al 2020 the arrangement of monopolar electrodes in a series of cells is electrically equivalent to one cell with multiple electrodes and interconnections mollah et al 2001 kobya et al 2020 reported that the most efficient connection to achieve higher efficiency with lower operational cost and energy consumption is mp s mode using an iron electrode they referenced on the improvement of chemical co precipitation and the decrease of anodic potential in the bipolar system electrodes are polarized where the side of the electrode facing the anode is negatively polarized and vice versa on the other side facing the cathode sahu et al 2014 concerning bp s between the inner electrodes there is no electrical connection where only the outer electrodes are linked to the power supply kobya et al 2011 in this case the sacrificial electrodes are placed between two parallel electrodes without any electrical connection mollah et al 2001 the bp s mode is characterized by a simple connection that requires low maintenance however in ec reactors this arrangement is flawed by the current loss kobya et al 2020 series cell arrangements have higher resistance and they require a higher potential difference for a given current to flow similarly through all connected electrodes however in an individual cell with parallel arrangement the electric current is divided between all electrodes kobya et al 2011 mollah et al 2001 several researches reported the treatment of different pollutants using these connections such as the treatment of laundry wastewater wang et al 2009 can manufacturing wastewater kobya and demirbas 2015 and discoloration of dye aqueous solutions daneshvar et al 2004 sqalli houssini et al sqalli houssini et al 2020 studied the possibility of using combined aluminum and iron electrodes as sacrificial anodes in bipolar mode to treat mixed reactive and dispersed dyes more than 95 of color removal was achieved with energy consumption lower than 10 kwh kg 1 under optimal conditions for 40 mg l 1 at 60 min of processing time they reported that the amount of iron or aluminum released through the solution was under the value fixed by the legislation similarly nasrullah et al 2018 investigated the removal of suspended solids ss biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod from a solution containing palm oil mill by ec process they evaluated the impact of various types of electrode design in a vertical or horizontal orientation monopolar series mp s monopolar parallel mp p and bipolar bp arrangements using aluminum iron and steel wool the results indicated that the highest removal efficiencies of 66 70 and 74 for ss bod and cod respectively were obtained by using vertical orientation mp s arrangement and steel wool equipment moreover the economic study revealed that the mp s arrangement had an expensive operating cost than bp and mp p while the arrangement of electrodes in vertical position not only helps in gaining efficiency but also it is economical the orientation of the electrodes in ec cells influences the performance of the process it is a significant parameter that determines coagulant release and bubble dispersion it influences the mixing conditions mass transfer process and the elimination pathway of contaminants jiang et al 2019 fig 7 shows three different orientations of the electrodes which are vertical electrode orientation horizontal electrode orientation with anode at the bottom and horizontal electrode orientation with anode at top many studies have used vertical electrodes in electrocoagulation treatment aswathy et al 2016 bayar et al 2011 titchou et al 2020a while some researchers studied the assessment between horizontal and vertical electrode orientation fadali et al 2016 khalaf et al 2016 nasrullah et al 2018 meanwhile some of them reported the use of electrodes with different tilt angles bassala et al 2017 huang et al 2009 jiang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 3 2 2 effect of electrode material the nature of the electrode material influences the efficiency of the ec process generally the majority of researchers have studied ec using iron electrodes or aluminum electrodes as the sacrificial anode sahu et al 2014 the use of these conventional materials is related to the coagulation properties of multivalent ions besides these materials titanium and zinc electrodes showed efficient results in ec cells safwat 2020 to valorize metallurgical wastes as alternative materials oliveira et al 2020 used electrodes issued from the compression of a metallurgical deposit in the ec reactor for the removal of indigo carmine dye electrodes of bronze aluminum steel and metal waste were also tested from these results they observed that these electrodes had similar electrochemical efficiency as commercial electrodes moreover the use of metallic debris makes their application in ec technology with lower cost and high efficiency and their replacement can solve the electrode passivation similarly amri et al 2020 compared a commercial aluminum electrode for use in the remediation of wastewater by ec process with a waste aluminum can electrode for discoloration of acid red 18 dye as a pollutant they demonstrated that waste aluminum cans performed better than commercial aluminum electrodes with a removal efficiency of 100 in 25 min of reaction time 3 2 3 electrode distance electrode distance is a parameter that can affect the water motion turbulence mass transfer size of ec reactor and energy consumption song et al 2017 however the potential developed between electrodes is a valuable property that affects the electrode kinetic parameters of the electrochemical system titchou et al 2020a generally the solution resistance and power consumption decrease as the interelectrode distance is reduced while the larger electrode distance decreases the mass transfer and the movement of species leading to decline the reaction rate however as indicated by song et al 2017 the decrease of electrode spacing under the optimum value reduces the efficiency due to the low mass transfer in ec process causing a raise of electrolyte resistance bouguerra et al 2015 mentioned that inter electrode distance effects on the amount of electrical energy consumed by the system to generate an electric field and induce the motion of ions they indicated that a distance between 0 5 and 3 0 cm are generally used in the ec processes this distance gap is favorable for the reduction of energy consumption and reaction time ensuring adequate interelectrode mass transfer bouguerra et al 2015 3 2 4 effect of current density current density is a critical parameter which affects the reaction time and actively induces the dominant mode of contaminants removal zaied et al 2020 it is a parameter that can be controlled directly and it determines the amount of the coagulant dissolved in the solution the size of the flocs formed and the hydrogen bubble production rate titchou et al 2020a the increase of current density enhances the dissolution of the sacrificial electrode the generation of h2 bulbs and the flotation of the formed sludge anantha singh and ramesh 2013 chen 2004 nasrullah et al 2018 the metal dissolution can be evaluated according to the faraday law nasrullah et al 2018 eq 31 31 m i t m z f where m is the mass of anode dissolved g i is the current a t is the electrolysis time s m is the molecular weight g mol 1 f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol 1 and z is the number of electrons involved in the reaction for the removal of coragen pesticide ramya et al 2019 reported the influence of the current density on cod chloride and bromide removal during the electrocoagulation of coragen using iron electrodes the results showed that when the current density was increased from 2 5 to 7 5 ma cm 2 it resulted in the enhancement of the oxidation rate after 60 min of electrolysis the cod chloride and bromide removal percentage got increased to 79 78 and 77 respectively when the current density was maintained at 7 5 ma cm 2 secula et al 2011 pointed out that doubling the value of current density from 5 5 to 10 9 a m 2 increases the discoloration rate from 49 2 to 98 9 after 3 h of ec furthermore applying a current density of 54 6 a m 2 leads to a discoloration rate of 99 9 after 60 min it is also clear that the operation cost of ec process is the result of electrical energy consumption which is associated with current density and operating time song et al 2017 the energy consumption is given in equation 32 jiang et al 2019 32 e u i t v where u is the stabilized voltage v i is the applied current a t is the electrified time h and v is the volume of sewage treated m3 to highlight the direct relationship between current density and energy consumption kilany et al 2020 tested the variation of energy consumption while increasing the current density they reported that energy consumption increases from 0 06 to 4 5 kwh kg 1 and from 0 04 to 6 2 kwh kg 1 when the current density increased from 0 1 to 1 5 ma cm 2 for the removal of oil and cu2 respectively 3 2 5 effect of ph the ph of the treated solution plays a role in influencing the overall performance of ec process it affects the nature and efficiency of the involved electrochemical and chemical reactions in the cell the state of other species in the solution and the solubility of the products formed mouedhen et al 2009 sahu et al 2014 moreover the ph effects the conductivity the dissolution of the electrodes the zeta potential of colloids and the hydroxide speciation sahu et al 2014 the production of coagulating ions and the surface charge of the particles are controlled by ph variation and its evolution during ec process dura and breslin 2019 the elimination mechanism of suspended organics from the effluent depends on the modification of electrostatic charges on colloidal particles these modifications affect their destabilization and adsorption on hydroxide particles drogui et al 2008 dura and breslin 2019 liu et al 2017 depending on the ph values the removal of pollutants took different stages for a ph range of 4 0 5 5 where the charge neutralization of particles usually happens wang et al 2011 then the production of oh increases the ph value leading to form monomeric species and polymeric hydroxyl metallic complexes consequently the coagulation of pollutants occurs followed by their removal due to the adsorption phenomenon on metal hydroxyl flocs kobya et al 2020 3 2 6 effect of supporting electrolyte and conductivity it has been reported that higher conductivity is favorable to reducing ohmic drop cell voltage and energy consumption conductivity affects the dissolution rate of metals and the surface phenomena that occur between polluting species and metal hydroxides izquierdo et al 2010 therefore the efficiency of the process is related to the concentration and the nature of the electrolyte salt dura and breslin 2019 izquierdo et al 2010 song et al 2017 titchou et al 2020a izquierdo et al 2010 studied the effect of the nature of electrolyte salt on the remediation of soluble oils by ec process considering chloride sulfate and nitrate anions with sodium potassium or ammonium cations using al or fe electrodes as they reported aluminum electrodes can be dissolved under high current efficiency in all cases whereas the dissolution of iron is a little efficient with nitrate salts and potassium sulfate moreover besides the enhancement of the efficiency of the process the presence of supporting electrolytes such as nacl can contribute to water disinfection moussa et al 2017 similarly yildiz et al yıldız et al 2008 studied the effects of nacl na2so4 and nano3 concentrations on the batch removal of water with a high amount of natural organic matter nom they concluded that the addition of electrolyte salts has a twofold advantage firstly increasing the ionic strength of the solution causes compression of the double layer secondly it decreases the ohmic resistance of the medium leading to more current flow through the cell under the same applied potential for example at ph 5 0 and for 100 mg l 1 of nom the charge loadings were within the range of 2 1 3 7 f m 3 for na2so4 and nacl respectively moreover at the same operating conditions for 9 min electrolysis the specific energy consumptions were ranged from 4 8 to 9 7 kwh m 3 and the removal efficiency values were between 96 8 and 99 6 for na2so4 and nacl respectively 3 2 7 effect of reaction time electrolysis time can also affect the treatment efficiency of ec process esfandian et al 2017 it influences the production rate of coagulant oh h2 bubbles and the cost effectiveness of the process eq 32 jiang et al 2019 raising the conductivity causes higher current passing through the cell and increases the removal rate hence the reaction time required for the desired removal efficiency is getting shorter jiang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 yıldız et al 2008 this trend was observed in many research papers for instance ramya et al 2019 investigated the effect of electrolysis time on cod chloride and bromide mineralization different electrolysis times up to 150 min were tested under nacl concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 applied current density of 2 5 ma cm 2 at neutral ph ph 7 0 the results showed that the mineralization efficiency of cod chloride and bromide increased in the first 60 min reaching over 58 42 and 59 respectively then it enhanced and achieved 60 60 and 65 respectively at 150 min of electrolysis in the same context ahmadzadeh and dolatabadi 2018 evaluated the effect of reaction time tr on the remediation of pharmaceutical wastewater containing metronidazole mnz increasing the tr from 2 to 20 min enhanced the removal efficiency from 28 2 to 72 7 the best removal efficiency was observed at 17 min using a current density of 4 5 ma cm 2 neutral ph inter electrode gap of 3 cm and an initial mnz dose of 30 mg l 1 3 2 8 effect of temperature likewise the temperature can influence the efficiency of the ec process the increase of temperature may enhance the anode dissolution favoring the formation of dense flocs that could adhere to the electrode surface preventing the dosage of metallic cations thus it may increase the probability of collisions between the colloids formed which form large aggregates and reduce the surface area available for adsorption as a result the amount of sludge formed increases donneys victoria et al 2019 as observed by gonçalves et al 2019 when the temperature changed from 20 to 40 c during the pretreatment of a saline concentrated effluent the retention time increased from 60 to 120 min and the total sludge generated ranged from 2 6 g l 1 to 6 5 g l 1 both at ph 7 0 3 3 advantages and limitations of ec electrocoagulation has many advantages compared to chemical coagulation ec system requires no addition of chemicals and needs minimal startup time the process can be started by turning on the switch and it provides better removal capabilities for the same species than chemical coagulation moreover the sludge is lesser and more readily filterable and can be utilized as a soil additive lowering the sludge disposal cost khandegar and saroha 2013 generally ec is characterized by the presence of electro flotation kuokkanen et al 2013 and the greater functional ph range 4 0 9 0 and ph neutralization effect comninellis and chen 2010 the sludge formation in the electrocoagulation process is related to faraday s law generally higher current density increases both the dissolution of anode and sludge production titchou et al 2020a the amount of sludge generated during ec treatment was reviewed in the literature to be lower than that of chemical coagulation this sludge is characterized by a better quality such as lower water content much larger and more stable flocs with better stability kuokkanen et al 2013 shadmehr et al 2019 the properties of sludge generated are of great importance because sludge treatment and disposal add additional costs to the cost of water and wastewater treatment when the sludge contains chemicals sahu et al 2014 however ec process has some limitations such as i the need for periodic replacement of the sacrificial anodes resulted from the oxidation or passivation of the electrodes ii the requirements of minimum solution conductivity depend on the reactor design iii the formation of toxic chlorinated organic compounds in the case of effluents containing chlorides iv cathode passivation resulted from the deposition of resistant compounds on the cathode which limit the flow of electric current this interference can be overcome by the change of polarity and periodical cleaning of the electrodes khandegar and saroha 2013 in addition to that and in some areas where electricity is not abundant the high cost of electricity can increase the operational cost of ec khandegar and saroha 2013 moussa et al 2017 ec reactors can be coupled with low cost renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic cells to provide power to electrodes as reported by others hussin et al 2019 pirkarami et al 2013 tones et al 2020 valero et al 2008 sometimes it is necessary to combine ec with other processes i e hybrid processes to insure efficient treatment of wastewater the ec technology can be designed in water treatment systems to include membrane separation reverse osmosis electro filtration sludge dewatering thermo oxidation and other conventional technologies to enhance the recovery of fine particles and metal ions from wastewater mollah et al 2001 3 4 application of electrocoagulation ec process has been experienced for the treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals tannery and textile industry wastewater food industry wastewater paper industry wastewater refinery wastewater and produced water moussa et al 2017 a research in science direct showed abundant investigations on the ec process used for organic remediation generating interest in wastewater treatment as shown below in fig 8 3 4 1 treatment of industrial effluents by ec process ec process is widely applied for the treatment of different industrial effluents containing pops kim et al 2020 investigated the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in water during electrocoagulation using an iron electrode the results revealed that increasing the current density from 2 4 to 80 0 ma cm 2 led to a significant increase in the removal efficiency of pfoa from 10 0 to 100 0 within 6 h moreover under experimental conditions of pfoa 0 24 μm a current density of 40 ma cm 2 stirring speed of 200 rpm and nacl initial concentration of 35 mm 65 of fluorine recovery as fluoride ions and organic fluorine in shorter chain by products perfluoropentanoic acid perfluorohexanoic acid and perfluoroheptanoic acid was achieved with 60 of toc removal after 6h of electrolysis likewise the remediation of perfluoroalkyl substances in landfill leachates by electrocoagulation using aluminum electrodes was studied by zhang et al 2014 the removal efficiencies of perfluorohexanoic acid perfluoroheptanoic acid perfluorooctanoate acid perfluorononanoic acid and perfluorodecanoic acid after 45 min were 65 1 58 5 75 2 33 8 and 10 respectively using plate distance of 1 cm a current density of 35 ma cm 2 and plate amounts of four pairs however perfluoroundecanoic acid and perfluorododecanoic acid concentrations increased by about 20 2 and 18 6 after the ec treatment process yang et al 2016 used the ec process to investigate the removal performance of aqueous perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas with relatively high concentration as simulating wastewater from the organic fluorine industry comparing iron and aluminum electrodes the effective removal of perfluorooctane sulfonate peos and perfluorooctanoic acid was obtained by fe anode at the optimal operating parameters of 0 25 mm of pfos 25 0 ma cm 2 of current density 180 rpm of stirring speed and 2 g l 1 nacl as supporting electrolyte more than 99 of pfos removal was achieved after 50 min electrolysis similarly the efficiency of ec process for the removal of pfaas was reported elsewhere bao et al 2020 yang et al 2016 the treatment of trichloroethylene tce by ec process using iron anode and copper foam cathode was optimized by mao et al 2012 they reported that the optimal conditions to achieve the highest removal efficiency are 9 525 mm thick copper foam electrode 40 ma current and 0 042 m na2so4 under these conditions the final elimination efficiency of tce can reach up to 98 and the corresponding energy consumption is 6 49 kwh kg 1 they affirmed the efficiency of this system for the remediation of groundwater or wastewater contaminated by chlorinated organic compounds moreover the influence of the presence of humic acid and strong oxidants such as chromate selenate and nitrate on the removal of tce was evaluated by fallahpour et al 2017 in limestone block column experiments using iron anode and copper cathode the influence of these substances on the tce removal followed the order humic acid chromate selenate and nitrate dichromate and selenate were reduced to insoluble ions forming precipitates that covered the anode surface the results revealed that this system could remove these contaminants as a mixture while the remediation rate of tce is significantly low around 40 compared to the control experiment only tce table 4 presents other examples of the treatment of these effluents using the ec process 3 4 2 domestic wastewater treatment bracher et al 2020 optimized an electrocoagulation flotation technique for wastewater treatment they reported that the turbidity and color removal reached were higher than 98 and 92 respectively moreover the residual turbidity was lower than 6 ntu and the final ph was 8 0 under the electrolysis time initial ph electric current agitation and inter electrodes gap which were about 25 min 6 1 7 a 262 5 rpm and 1 cm respectively omwene and kobya 2018 studied the phosphorus elimination from domestic wastewater using aluminum al and iron fe anodes in a batch reactor they obtained less than 0 01 mg l 1 of residual phosphorus under optimal conditions using an initial concentration of ci 52 mg l 1 po4 p operational conditions were set at phi 4 0 j 20 a m 2 for 100 min q 954 c for fe electrode and phi 4 0 j 20 a m 2 at 50 min q 372 c for al electrode they also concluded that al electrode provided higher phosphorous elimination with a shorter electrolysis time and smaller metal to phosphorous ratio compared to fe anodes rodrigo et al 2010 removed phosphorus ions and cod from domestic wastewater using a conductive diamond electrode with an energy consumption lesser than 4 5 kw h m 3 during treatment yildiz and oran 2019 designed a monopolar ec reactor using an iron electrode for the treatment of samples received from an urban wastewater treatment plant they aimed to reduce the sludge production and improve the sludge stabilization degree concluding from the findings that ec technique can be an effective means for sludge disintegration elazzouzi et al 2019 studied the remediation of wastewater by a batch electrocoagulation flotation ecf technique using iron fe and aluminum al plates with monopolar configuration cod removal achieved was 84 and 80 using al and fe electrodes respectively similarly yilmaz et al 2018 investigated the use of an electrocoagulation system for urban wastewater treatment using aluminum and stainless steel electrodes they reported that the cod removal efficiency obtained was about 90 under optimum experimental conditions which are 10 a current intensity 100 ml min 1 circulation rate constant ph 7 0 and no supporting electrolyte experiments 4 combined electrocoagulation adsorption process the use of the ec process alone for the treatment of highly polluted wastewaters may be limited by different problems such as cost effectiveness and electrode passivation however the presence of a post or pretreatment process in the ec presents a solution for these limitations al qodah et al 2020 recently hybrid electrocoagulation with one or more treatment processes such as adsorption chemical coagulation magnetic field reverse osmosis and membrane filtration has been applied to improve the removal of colloidal and non biodegradable pollutants al qodah et al 2020 in this section several applications of the ec adsorption hybrid process for the removal of different types of organic pollutants were reviewed javed et al 2019 studied the treatment of reactive red 241 dye by ec biosorption coupled process they reported that the hybrid process had efficient performance and resulted in the complete discoloration with lower energy requirement and operational cost under optimal conditions of 21 7 ma cm 2 current density ph 7 0 bio sorbent dosage of 8 g l 1 and dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 they achieved 99 6 of color removal after 20 min with a specific electrical energy consumption of 1 7 kwh kg 1 dye and operational cost of 0 3 kg 1 dye bellebia et al 2009 performed the elimination of brilliant blue levafix e bra reactive dye from solutions by ec using al electrodes followed by adsorption on the granular activated carbon gac they showed that for the electrocoagulation process the maximum abatement of 200 mg l 1 of the dye was obtained for a loading charge of 7 5 f m 3 thereafter the residual reactive dye concentration was completely removed with 700 mg l 1 gac castañeda díaz et al 2017 studied the elimination of the anionic dye remazol yellow ry and the cationic dye malachite green mg from aqueous solutions by ec technique followed by adsorption process in column systems they performed and compared the performances of both batch and continuous electrocoagulation reactors from the experiments they concluded that the electrocoagulation adsorption hybrid process was more efficient for dye elimination than ec alone moreover using carbonaceous materials obtained from industrial sewage sludge and commercial activated carbons the removal efficiencies of ry and mg were between 96 and 98 wang et al 2017 coupled ec and peanut shell ps adsorption for the removal of malachite green mg under optimal conditions i e a current density of 2 ma cm 2 a ps dosage of 5 g l 1 an initial mg concentration of 50 mg l 1 and an initial ph around neutral the optimal removal efficiency of mg was found to be 98 in 5 min which was 23 higher than that in the ec process in 60 min furthermore they observed that the energy consumption and the unit material energy consumption were 94 lower in the coupling process than that in the traditional ec process bener et al 2020 applied the ec adsorption hybrid process for the treatment of real textile wastewater for ec method and under optimal conditions i e electrode type al current density 25 ma cm 2 and initial ph value ph 5 0 nearly 35 total organic carbon toc 18 6 chemical oxygen demand cod 90 turbidity and 50 color removal efficiencies were achieved however for ec coupled with adsorption on the walnut shell and corncob agricultural wastes the removal efficiency of the toc was found to be nearly 75 the cod was found to be 27 and the color turbidity and total dissolved solids achieved the standards for irrigation water rubí juárez et al 2017 studied the removal of oily matter from car wash wastewater using ec process followed by adsorption on gac when aluminum copper and zinc electrodes were used cod removal was 78 76 and 71 respectively while the turbidity attained was 92 90 and 78 respectively the electrocoagulation followed by adsorption on gac at concentrations of 7 5 15 and 22 5 g l 1 allowed cod removal of 86 91 and 94 and turbidity of 96 97 and 98 using al electrodes bellebia et al 2012 investigated cod abatement and turbidity of cardboard paper mill wastewater using al and fe electrodes followed by adsorption of treated effluent on gac they compared the performance of the ec adsorption hybrid process using gac and that of ec technique alone they reported that using ec alone the maximum removal efficiencies of turbidity and cod under optimal conditions i e ph 5 3 for the al electrode and ph 7 2 for the fe electrode a current density of 4 4 ma cm 2 and operating time of 10 min were 99 9 and 75 4 for the al electrode and 99 9 and 78 8 for the fe electrode respectively however for the hybrid process under a ph of 3 2 at 300 rpm with a contact time of 120 min for the al electrode and 180 min for the fe electrode the maximum removal efficiencies of cod were 99 and 93 4 respectively they proved from these results the effectiveness of the ec adsorption process for the highly concentrated organic pollutants present in paper mill effluents pizutti et al 2019 proposed the application of electrocoagulation followed by adsorption for the post treatment of ascending anaerobic sludge blanket digestion wastewater effluent initially they optimized the ec process using the response surface methodology the results revealed that the optimal conditions of 29 4 a m 2 of current density and ph 6 0 cod removal and energy consumption reached were about 44 6 and 31 1 kwh per kg of cod respectively the ec effluent was then treated by adsorption on a fixed bed column of activated carbon as they indicated the conjugated system provided the complete removal of cod bod and thermotolerant coliforms besides the elimination of 96 5 and 97 5 of turbidity and phosphorus respectively 5 valorization of adsorption and electrocoagulation wastes although adsorption and electrocoagulation are considered powerful techniques to treat wastewater containing organic pollutants their wastes are a challenging task to tackle the regeneration of the support in the adsorption process concentrates the adsorbate in a more concentrated volume of water which promotes the reuse of the adsorbent however in some cases the regeneration of the support might not be necessary when using an abundant and natural adsorbent similarly for the ec process the sludge formed is concentrated in terms of pollutants traditionally the management of organic wastes has been handled by landfilling recovery recycling incineration or combustion in cement plants plasma gasification composting energy recovery and avoidance or waste minimization arfala et al 2018 raksasat et al 2020 recently the valorization of solid wastes is considered a sustainable solution to get rid of them in this context raksasat et al 2020 reviewed the use of insect larvae for the valorization of organic wastes into biomass which is considered as a protein and lipid feedstock for poultry feed and biodiesel production sometimes the sludge can be used as an amendment of agricultural soils considering their nutriment composition or in cement plant afanga et al 2020 titchou et al 2020b they may help to improve soil quality reduction of uptake of heavy metals and nourish the soil like in the case of the biochar adsorbent obtained from the sewage sludge as reported by singh et al 2020 similarly different research papers deal with sludge and waste for instance recently by zhu et al 2019 studied the valorization of manganese rich sludge obtained from groundwater treatment to prepare a magnetic adsorbent for cu ii adsorption likewise the application of the anaerobic digestion process to olive mill wastewater and the sludge formed during their treatment by adsorption and electrocoagulation was studied by mikdame et al 2019 the results showed higher efficiency and cost effective for methane production while eliminating waste with adverse effects on the environment and producing energy 6 water and wastewater legislation water sanitation and hygiene are basic for health and environmental protection for sustainable development standards for water quality defined by the world organizations world health organization who and the environmental protection agency epa and the regulations of each country are guarantees of safe and rational use of water bodies drinking water wastewater discharge and traited wastewater reuse the potential use of water and its destination depends on its quality criteria two types of environmental qualities have been defined for the protection of human health and the living environment for drinking water the standards are stricter since its salubrity is a fundamental human right on the other hand depending on the treated wastewater quality and its compliance with defined standards its reuse destination may vary for instance the quality recommended for irrigation is higher than that of direct discharge into the environment the aforementioned standards have been established based on the organoleptic physico chemical and biological parameters besides undesirables and toxic substances these characteristics include odor color temperature conductivity ph biological oxygen demand bdo chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do total dissolved solids total suspended solids fecal and total coliforms fecal streptococcus heavy metals pesticides phenols detergents ammonium nitrates and phosphorous etc johnstone 2003 soudi 2013 strauss 2007 world health organization 2006 generally efficient treatment is one that respects the guidelines of water quality adsorption and electrocoagulation processes are reported to respond to the environment safety criteria madhavan and antony 2021 removed 99 of cod and 98 of oil grease o g using the ec process they affirmed that these obtained values were meeting us discharge standards 42 mg l 1of o g for the present case they used an initial concentration of 360 mg l 1 of oil cod of 1280 mg l 1 90 cod removal is equivalent to removing 88 o g so it is possible to attain a discharge concentration of less than 42 mg l 1 of o g similarly a summary of different studies dealing with the treatment of various effluents by the ec process was reported by syam babu et al syam babu et al 2020 although adsorption is not a standalone process its application to real textile wastewater using pozzolana was investigated in our previous work attaining the standard moroccan limit values smlv except for conductivity besides the total elimination of the color and mineral elements nitrates nitrites phosphates adsorption decreased the cod value from 603 mg l 1 to 31 mg l 1 cod smlv 500 mg l 1 titchou et al 2020b however in another work the elimination of eriochrome black t using aluminum oxide particles only achieved 71 of the percentage removal from an initial dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 el gaayda et al 2020 similarly using 130 mg l 1 of congo red gr and methyl orange mo the polyelectrolyte poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride modified montmorillonite clay removed 90 7 and 69 2 of cr and mo respectively ait akbour et al 2020 these findings revealed the need for a hybrid process to comply with the standard discharge limits the quality of water can be further enhanced by the combination of adsorption and electrocoagulation or even with an advanced oxidation process 7 conclusion this review illustrates a critical study of the most widely used techniques to get rid of pops from effluents adsorption coagulation and electrocoagulation ec have been discussed based on recent research papers these processes were selected for being the most used ones to clarify their state of the art and highlight the effect of different parameters on their efficiency among them ec showed effective elimination of various contaminants with a wide range of concentrations from water moreover ec is considered a cost effective process that offers many benefits and gives the possibility of its automation and its combination with other processes such as adsorption therefore it is primordial to integrate it into water and wastewater treatment plants authors contributions all authors proposed

11957,the intensification of industrial activities significantly increases the distribution of toxic substances and other non biodegradable pollutants from industrial wastewater to the environment among these contaminants persistent organic pollutants pops are considered harmful to humans wildlife and plants in order to find a solution that can improve the water quality and protect the environment interest in wastewater treatment has intensified over the last decades separation techniques i e adsorption process coagulation and electrocoagulation have proven to be more effective in removing target pollutants and largely comply with discharge legislation each of these methods has its own specific merits difficulties and parameters that affect the removal efficiency in this document these methods have been reviewed on the basis of recently published relevant literature batch and continuous modes of adsorption and electrocoagulation have been discussed for the adsorption process this review elucidated the adsorption isotherms kinetic models breakthrough curve modeling thermodynamic studies and the regeneration of the support used either in batch and continuous reactors likewise the state of the art of electrocoagulation was clarified highlighting the benefit of the electrocoagulation adsorption hybrid process to enhance the removal efficiency of organic pollutants from wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords persistent organic pollutants pops wastewater treatment elimination adsorption coagulation electrocoagulation 1 introduction the scarcity of water potential and their pollution are considered as an irrefutable global problem and a great challenge to be taken up jain et al 2020 in general water contamination is linked to a large amount of wastewater discharged into the environment from various sources in addition due to the variety of pollution sources households hospitals industries veterinary services agriculture and their various applied processes the composition and characterization of effluents are totally different and very complex darban et al 2020 lambropoulou and nollet 2014 among the compounds that may exist in wastewaters the so called persistent organic pollutants pops are difficult to be removed in accordance with the convention of stockholm bilcke 2002 these pollutants are organic compounds natural or anthropogenic remaining intact for long periods of time and they resist photolytic chemical and biological degradation el shahawi et al 2010 according to the stockholm convention they constitute a variety of compounds which besides their great persistence in the environment are characterized by semi volatility hydrophobicity bioaccumulation and toxicity betianu and gavrilescu 2006 they are classified under various carbon based categories such as solvents pesticides dyestuffs and industrial chemical by products of various elemental compositions for example polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons perfluorinated compounds dioxins dioxanes and other emerging pollutants betianu and gavrilescu 2006 el shahawi et al 2010 trojanowicz 2020 therefore it is necessary to protect the aqueous systems humans fauna and flora from these pollutants and their impact atrous et al 2019 wastewater regeneration is one of the best choices to reduce their impact various methods are used to treat the wastewater in order to reduce the amount of contaminants nataraj et al 2009 over the last decades conventional wastewater processes such as membrane filtration adsorption coagulation flocculation and electrocoagulation ec have been intensively developed to overcome insufficiently effective for many organic pollutants recently many research papers revealed their simplicity their low cost and their potential efficiency for the removal of different pollutants afanga et al 2020 kim et al 2010 sakhi et al 2020 wang et al 2011 yu et al 2010 furthermore their combination may be an alternative to enhance the quality of treated effluents abdessemed et al 2000 naddeo et al 2020 zazou et al 2019 zielińska et al 2020 among these processes adsorption and electrocoagulation processes are extensively used for the treatment of several types of pollutants electrocoagulation ec an emerging technology combines the advantages and functions of conventional coagulation flocculation and adsorption kuokkanen et al 2013 these processes have the potential to remove various types of aqueous pollutants including organic and inorganic contaminants from different types of wastewater darban et al 2020 because of its advantages ec has generated interest in the treatment of effluents containing pops esfandyari et al 2020 the main aim of this research paper is to provide an overview on the previously mentioned processes i e adsorption and electrocoagulation their potential and effectiveness were indicated for the treatment of organic pollutants in water purification and wastewater treatment based on recent publications in this field 2 adsorption the adsorption process is a surficial phenomenon in which a soluble chemical adsorbate is removed from a fluid by contact with a solid surface adsorbent ali et al 2012 this approach has high potential to remove persistent organic and inorganic compounds sponza et al 2015 it is often used in industry for product separation and waste treatment ali et al 2012 adsorption phenomena can be classified as a physical or chemical adsorption process physical adsorption involves low forces van der waals interaction and it is thus reversible it occurs at low temperatures very similar to a condensation process and is exothermic with a heat of adsorption similar to the latent heat of condensation cooney 1998 it is considered a complex phenomenon that can be affected by various factors including surface area pore structure adsorbent surface chemistry the nature of the adsorbate the presence of competing adsorbates and the ph of the solution cooney 1998 however chemical adsorption chemisorption occurs at high temperatures with high activation energy involving strong bonds and is not reversible the heat of adsorption is generally high in chemisorption because it is generated during a chemical reaction cooney 1998 recently among the removal methods the adsorption process has shown an increase of interest fig 1 due to many advantages such as its potential efficiency low energy expenditure high preference at the molecular level easy manipulation and ability to separate various chemical compounds maingi et al 2017 a large surface area is a required as well as an essential characteristic of an effective adsorbent therefore materials with a vast number of tiny pores in the interior of the granular material are recommended howe et al 2012 activated carbon ac is the most popular adsorbent used for the removal of a variety of pollutants and it can be used either in granular or powdered form commonly ac can be prepared from natural carbonaceous materials such as coal peat and coconut enhancing the possibility of recycling or valorizing different biomaterials and waste products to be used in the water treatment field ali et al 2012 however many drawbacks limit the use of activated carbon such as its higher cost and the difficulty of its regeneration sponza et al 2015 different studies reported the use of many materials as efficient and sheep adsorbents eco friendly renewable and require less processing time they may include adsorbents such as fruit waste kadhom et al 2020 coconut shell zhao et al 2018 nutshells lima et al 2019 bark and other tannin rich materials ighalo and adeniyi 2020 sawdust hameed et al 2007 rice husk lv et al 2020 fertilizer wastes chen et al 2019 egg shells abdel khalek et al 2017 fish scales marrakchi et al 2017 chitosan lipatova et al 2018 seaweed and algae ahmed et al 2019 nautiyal et al 2016 moreover many adsorbents issued from soil such as fly ash dash et al 2018 peat moss hemmati et al 2016 red mud thakare et al 2020 zeolites brião et al 2018 clays sponza et al 2015 titchou et al 2020b sediment and soil qu et al 2008 tao and tang 2004 reveled a higher removal efficiency toward different pollutants otherwise synthetic adsorbents obtained from industrial wastes such as scrap tyres can help for wastewater remediation li et al 2010 the adsorption process has shown a higher application and efficiency in the elimination of different organic pollutants in different water bodies these organic pollutants may be dyes atrous et al 2019 pesticides mojiri et al 2020 hydrocarbons bläker et al 2020 phenols dehmani et al 2020 biphenyls wang et al 2019 detergents thirupathi et al 2007 oils and greases dumore and mukhopadhyay 2012 and pharmaceuticals luján facundo et al 2019 etc as long as adsorption is a surface phenomenon yielding to increase the concentration of a particular component at the interface between two phases it may be a result of different interactions electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding surface precipitation π π interaction n π interaction cation exchange hydrophobic interaction covalent and electrostatic interactions etc gupta et al 2013 mojiri et al 2020 salleh et al 2011 tran et al 2017 therefore for better interpreting and understanding the mechanism of the adsorption several techniques can be used to characterize an adsorbent table 1 2 1 adsorption mode the adsorption process is commonly performed in batch reactors to study the removal of a wide range of pollutants however the scaling up of continuous flow systems is contributing to the development of large scale adsorption in technical systems among several types of reactors a stirred tank and fluidized bed column could be used to perform the continuous flow treatment however dynamic adsorption using a fixed bed column fig 2 presents the best option as it is capable of treating large volumes of pollutant solutions and reaches high removal efficiency thanks to several advantages like simplicity and easy scaling up at laboratory scale rosales et al 2017 the fixed bed column can also be used to study the mobility in natural soil and the retention potential of different pollutants such as phenolic acids and humic substances ait akbour et al 2013 ouachtak et al 2018 practically fluid flow rate bed height inlet concentration ahmed and hameed 2018 permeation particle size porosity convection diffusion chemical reactions involved in adsorption and column regeneration should be taken into consideration esfandian et al 2017 rosales et al 2017 the exit concentration versus time or effluent volume is called a breakthrough curve and is used to study the dynamic adsorption the breakthrough curve corresponds to the evolution of the concentration at the outlet of a fixed bed fed continuously by a solution of concentration c0 it can be presented in the normalized pore volume and concentration i e c c0 f v vp fig 3 where c and c0 are the outlet and inlet pollutant concentrations and v and vp are the collected sample volume of the effluent and pore volume respectively ait akbour et al 2013 as reported by patel 2019 when the solution is introduced through the column inlet in the first step of dynamic adsorption the upper layers of the fresh adsorbent adsorb adsorbate quickly and efficiently therefore the primary adsorption zone is located near the top of the column where the adsorbate concentration c and the ratio c c0 are almost zero subsequently the upper layer of the adsorbent is progressively saturated by the injection of the adsorbate into the column which becomes progressively less efficient the movement of this zone rises mainly as the initial concentration increases compared to the linear velocity of the influent water after some time cs the column becomes completely saturated and consequently no adsorption occurs this point is characterized by exhaustion point where a ratio of c c0 equal to 1 the breakthrough curve explains the dynamics of a continuous adsorption system a typical one includes the mass transfer zone mtz where adsorption occurs generally the breakthrough occurs at contact time tb where c c0 0 05 tan and hameed 2017 furthermore the behavior of the breakthrough curve bc is linked to the adsorption isotherm shape and is influenced by the diffusional stages within the fixed bed babakhani et al 2017 the nature of the wastewater to be treated has a direct influence on the shape of the breaking curve therefore when only adsorbable pollutants are present the adsorption occurs quickly and the bc will become steep however in the case of a mixture of components having different adsorption capabilities the breakthrough becomes flatter and the sorption zone looks deeper vinodhini and das 2010 moreover from the breakthrough curve several parameters can be calculated aksu and gönen 2004 ghosh et al 2014 the volume of the treated effluent is named veff which can be determined by eq 1 1 v e f f q t t o t a l where q and ttotal are the volumetric flow rate ml min 1 and total flow time min the total adsorbed quantity qtotal mg in the column for a given inlet concentration and flow rate is calculated from eq 2 2 q t o t a l q a 1000 q 1000 t 0 t t t o t a l c a d d t where q is and volumetric flow rate ml min 1 a is the area of the adsorption zone obtained by integrating the adsorbed concentration cad mg l 1 versus t min and ttotal is the total flow time min total amount of pollutants sent to the column mtotal is expressed by eq 3 3 m total c 0 qt total 1000 where c0 is the inlet concentration mg l 1 q is and volumetric flow rate ml min 1 and ttotal is the total flow time min the total removal percent of contaminants for a flow volume presents the ratio of the total adsorbed amount of contaminant qtotal to the total amount of pollutants sent to the column mtotal this parameter describes the column performance and it is given by eq 4 4 total removal q total m total 100 the equilibrium uptake qeq or the maximum capacity of the column presents the total amount of adsorbate sorbed qtotal per gram of sorbent x at the end of the total flow time its expression is given by eq 5 5 q eq q total x the unadsorbed pollutant concentration at equilibrium in the column ceq mg l 1 can be defined by eq 6 6 c eq m total q total v eff 1000 where mtotal is the total amount of pollutants sent to the column qtotal is the total amount of adsorbate sorbed and veff is the volume of the treated effluent the value of the adsorption capacity at the breakthrough point qb mg g 1 can be calculated by eq 7 7 q b 0 v b c 0 c mdv where c0 and c are the concentrations mg l 1 in the input and effluent solution respectively m is the mass g of the solid packed in the fixed bed and vb is the effluent volume l at the breakthrough point similarly the values of the adsorption capacity at the exhaustion point qe mg g 1 of the fixed bed can also be calculated by eq 8 8 q e 0 v e c 0 c mdv where c0 and c are the concentrations mg l 1 in the input and effluent solution respectively m is the mass g of the solid packed in the fixed bed and ve is the volume l of water passed up to the point of bed exhaustion compared to the batch system in continuous mode the flow rate determines the sufficient value of contact between the adsorbent and the adsorbate and the bed high influences the adsorption uptake ahmed and hameed 2018 the increase of the bed height provides enough time for the solute to adsorb into the sorbent mass and thus it stays longer in the column and treats more volume of wastewater ahmed and hameed 2018 esfandian et al 2017 from this point of view several research papers have studied the performance of the continuous adsorption mode for the removal of target contaminants to provide a real insight into the applicability of this technology kim et al 2010 investigated the batch and continuous adsorption of trimethoprim onto granular activated carbon and powdered activated carbon obtaining removals above 90 similarly jain et al 2020 performed the adsorption of acid blue 25 using the residue of waste tea in a continuous and batch reactor the maximum adsorption uptakes were 127 1 mg g 1 318 k ph 1 0 waste tea residue 3 5 g l 1 t 210 min and 50 8 mg g 1 packing heights 4 5 cm flow rate 7 ml min 1 c0 200 mg l 1 ph 1 0 using batch and continuous reactor respectively 2 2 parameters influencing batch adsorption 2 2 1 adsorbent nature considering the origin of adsorbents organic ones can be prepared from materials that have higher carbon content such as fruit waste rice husks bark algae peat moss hair keratin organic industrial products including petroleum and fertilizer products ali et al 2012 while inorganic adsorbents are obtained from soil clays mud zeolites ores metal oxides and hydroxides and are highly applied because of their abundance and low cost ali et al 2012 kadhom et al 2020 2 2 2 adsorbent dosage the amount of adsorbent used g l 1 is usually a parameter that must be optimized since it influences the volume of available binding sites and the adsorbent surface area brião et al 2018 this has a direct effect on the adsorption uptake of qt mg g 1 eq 9 and equilibrium time abdel khalek et al 2017 9 q t m g g 1 c 0 c e v m where c0 mg l 1 and ce mg l 1 are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of the pollutant respectively v is the volume of the batch solution l and m is the amount of the adsorbent g used in the experiments it had been reported that using an adsorbent dosage up to the optimal value can reduce the adsorption capacity due to the existence of unsaturated active sites hemmati et al 2016 nsami and mbadcam ndi nsami and ketcha mbadcam 2013 used activated carbon prepared from cola nut shells by zncl2 to study the effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption of 100 ppm of methylene blue mb they observed that the uptake of the dye decreases while increasing the adsorbent dose varying the adsorbent dosage from 0 1 to 0 5 g for 30 ml of mb the maximum adsorbed quantity qe 87 4 mg g 1 was reached by 0 1 g activated carbon prepared from agricultural waste they attributed this result to the overlapping or accumulation of adsorption sites while increasing of the amount in grams of the adsorbent similarly in the case of moroccan pozzolana titchou et al 2020b evaluated the effect of adsorbent concentration on the elimination of 30 mg l 1 of mb at ph 5 9 for 1 h and using different doses of pozzolana between 0 4 and 3 g l 1 they observed an increase of the adsorbed amount qt from 21 to 28 mg g 1 and the adsorption efficiency color removal from 39 7 to 78 9 when the adsorbent dosage increased from 0 4 to 0 8 g l 1 they also reported that beyond 0 8 g l 1 the discoloration remains constant approximately 99 and the dye removal decreases from 28 to 9 9 mg g 1 due to the limited adsorption caused by the lack of the pollutant while increasing the concentration of adsorbent 2 2 3 solution ph the solution ph plays a role in the entire adsorption phenomena and especially on the adsorption capacity the ph has a significant effect on the existing form of pollutants in the case of charged species the surface chemical properties of the support and the affinity of the adsorbate molecules to the adsorbent depending on the state of both materials ahmed et al 2019 li et al 2010 lv et al 2020 generally the solution ph influences the adsorption mechanism therefore it is considered worthwhile and crucial to determine the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent the point of zero charge phpzc ph where the solid particle possesses globally net zero charge is determined by measuring the equilibrium ph phf versus the initial ph phi of solutions containing the sorbent the phpzc of the sorbent is the ph where phf is not affected by the reaction time phpzc phi phf tan et al 2008 titchou et al 2020b the electrical state of an adsorbent may be identified by either the point of zero charge pzc or the isoelectric point iep iep happens when the electro kinetic potential zeta potential at the interface is null value of iep represents the external surface charge of colloidal particles in the solution whereas the pzc depends on the net total surface charge of the support external and internal tran et al 2017 consequently the phpzc can help in the identification of the nature of charges on the surface of the adsorbent ahmed et al 2019 in the case of dye molecules if ph phpzc cationic dye adsorption is favorable whereas if ph phpzc anionic dye adsorption occurs dash et al 2018 likewise abdel khalek et al 2017 concluded that the adsorption of congo red cr and methylene blue mb onto eggshells is highly dependent on the solution ph they observed that the adsorbed amount increased slightly from 16 8 to 19 9 mg g 1 for mb and jumped quickly for cr from 9 5 to 18 7 mg g 1 when the ph went from the more alkaline region to the more acidic region as was mentioned in section 2 the adsorption of organic pollutants can result in different mechanisms it s mainly resulted from electrostatic hydrogen bonding and van der waals interaction for charged species meanwhile it is essentially governed by hydrophobic interactions ᴨ ᴨ n ᴨ etc in the case of uncharged molecules due to their ph independency for example aromatics adsorption is mainly attributed to their hydrophobicity and their potential to accept or donate electrons these characters influence their electron density creating partial charges which result in the interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent these phenomena were reported by liu and wang while studying the adsorption of nitrobenzene on modified activated carbon liu and wang 2011 2 2 4 contact time the adsorption process comprises two phases a primary rapid phase and a second slow phase where the contact time influences the adsorbed amount of pollutants abdel khalek et al 2017 practically the adsorption improves with time until equilibrium is attained this behavior is attributed almost to the adsorption of contaminates on the adsorbate active sites however with the progresses of time the active sites get occupied due to competitive adsorption of sorbate molecules abdel khalek et al 2017 hemmati et al 2016 marrakchi et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to determine the equilibrium time which can take few minutes or hours or maybe days depending on the material porosity to describe the real kinetic order followed by the system tran et al 2017 for instance dash et al 2018 used a modified coal fly ash with sulfonic acid as a potential adsorbent to investigate the effect of contact time on the adsorption of malachite green mg and rhodamine 6g r6g dyes from aqueous solution they indicated that the initial dye adsorption rate increased sharply with time and the maximum percentage of adsorption 98 7 occurred within 50 min for r6g and within 40 min for mg 99 2 after that time it reached equilibrium nsami and mbadcam ndi nsami and ketcha mbadcam 2013 performed the adsorption of mb on activated carbon obtained from cola nut shells they reported that the elimination rate was slow up to 50 min and then it increased quickly and progressively decreased to attain the equilibrium state within 3 h beyond this time the removal rate was constant 2 2 5 pollutant concentration experimentally the effect of the initial amount of pollutants can be evaluated by performing different trials in which a series of adsorbate solutions at different initial concentrations are mixed with a fixed dose of adsorbent at fixed time intervals and stirred until equilibrium salleh et al 2011 as presented in equation 9 the adsorption amount depends on the concentration of contaminants for a fixed adsorbent dosage and depending on the density of the active sites an increase of pollutant concentration leads to saturate the adsorbent active sites and decrease the adsorption efficiency salleh et al 2011 yagub et al 2014 as reported by djafer et al 2014 while studying the effect of bimacid dye concentration on its elimination from aqueous solution by adsorption on bentonite pozzolana and biosorption on fixed anaerobic sulfate reducer cells for 8 h of contact time 0 1 g l 1 of the adsorbent at ph 2 0 the removal efficiency decreased with increasing red bimacid dye initial concentration for both processes the removal efficiency values decrease from 90 to 78 for immobilized anaerobic sulfate reducer cells 60 51 for pozzolana and 55 43 for bentonite due the low availability of active sites on the surface of the support to fix more adsorbate similarly yagub et al 2012 investigated the effect of initial concentration of mb on its adsorption by pine leaves they found that increasing the initial concentration of mb from 10 to 90 mg l 1 the adsorption capacity increased from 32 to 123 mg g 1 after 240 min the dye removal decreased from 97 to 41 while increasing the concentration from 10 to 90 mg l 1 however higher pollutant concentration may increase the adsorption capacity due to the enhancement of the driving forces that overcome the mass transfer resistance of pollutants between the liquid and solid phase hemmati et al 2016 qu et al 2008 yagub et al 2014 the same trend was reported by dogan et al doğan et al 2009 they observed that the adsorption capacity of hazelnut shell increases with the increase of the initial concentration of methylene blue they attributed this result to the high driving force of mass transfer and the attractive forces between the dye molecule and the adsorbent such as van der waals force and electrostatic attraction the fast diffusion onto the external surface was followed by fast pore diffusion into the intraparticle matrix which contains the chromophore groups such as alcoholic carbonylic and phenolic occurring in the adsorption to attain rapid equilibrium doğan et al 2009 2 2 6 temperature the temperature is a crucial parameter it effects on the mobility of particles their diffusion and the viscosity of the treated solution its influence on the adsorption process can be carried out by preparing the adsorbent adsorbate solutions with different initial pollutant concentrations solutions are then stirred until the equilibrium time is achieved at different fixed temperature values depending on the behavior of the adsorption capacity qt by raising the temperature the adsorption is considered endothermic if qt increases with the increase of temperature otherwise it is considered exothermic salleh et al 2011 yagub et al 2014 marrakchi et al 2017 used carbonized fish labeo rohita scales cfs for the adsorption of reactive orange 16 dye ro16 using a batch reactor to investigate the effect of temperature 30 50 c on the adsorption efficiency they observed an increase in the adsorption capacity while increasing the temperature where the prepared cfs exhibited maximum adsorption capacities of 105 8 107 2 and 114 2 mg g 1 at 30 c 40 c and 50 c respectively similarly dehmani et al 2020 performed the adsorption of phenol on moroccan clay they reported that the adsorption quantities of phenol on the activated clay were 5 8 6 2 and 6 8 mg g 1 at 30 c 40 c and 50 c respectively the maximum adsorption capacities were 1 4 2 1 and 2 7 mg g 1 for the raw clay at the same temperatures affirming that the adsorption was endothermic therefore abdel khalek et al 2017 reported that using an initial dye concentration of 200 mg l 1 at the initial ph solution of 5 2 and 7 1 for methylene blue mb and congo red cr respectively the amount of adsorbed of mb and cr onto eggshell decreased gradually with the increase of temperature they attributed this behavior to the increase of the mobility of dye ions and their escape from the solid phase eggshell to the liquid phase 2 3 parameters influencing continuous adsorption the trend of the breakthrough curve depends on the equilibrium and the adsorption kinetic the hydrodynamic parameters of the reactor and the parameters developed in the case of batch reactors in this section the effect of the inlet concentration flow rate and the bed high on the breakthrough and exhaustion points were evaluated 2 3 1 effect of the inlet concentration the inlet concentration is a limiting factor and the main process variable since a given mass of adsorbent can only adsorb a fixed amount of pollutants afroze et al 2016 the increase of the inlet concentration results in the quickly attaining of the equilibrium conditions where the breakthrough and exhaustion time will occur earlier saravanan et al 2018 in this case the breakthrough curves are shifted towards the origin due to the earlier saturation of the fixed bed this behavior is attributed to the enhancement of the driving force for mass transfer across the liquid film along with the acceleration of the adsorption rate darweesh and ahmed 2017 however as reported by sotelo et al 2012 a decrease in the inlet concentration leads to an increase in the breakthrough time where the binding sites became more slowly saturated in the system besides that it gives a lower slope of the curve which indicates a slower mass transport due to a decreased diffusion coefficient or decreased mass transfer coefficient similar observations were reported elsewhere ait akbour et al 2013 hethnawi et al 2017 2020 2 3 2 effect of the flow rate the flow rate directly influences the contact time between the adsorbate and adsorbent by increasing the flow rate the equilibrium time to reach saturation is reduced considerably and the breakthrough points occur faster however a decrease in the flow rate leads to an increase in the saturation breakthrough time patel 2019 herein pollutants will have more contact time with the adsorbent which results in higher removal from the solution due to the higher diffusion into the pores of the adsorbent biswas et al 2020 afroze et al 2016 reported that the breakthrough curve became steeper as the flow rate was increased resulting in lower break point time and adsorbed dye concentration afroze et al 2016 this result happens when the residence time tr of the contaminant in the column is not enough to reach adsorption equilibrium at a higher flow rate consequently the pollutant leaves the column before equilibrium occurs causing a reduction in removal efficiency ghorai and pant 2005 however garcía mateos et al 2015 mentioned that the change of the flow rate has a negligible impact on the breakthrough curve shape confirming the absence of external mass transfer control they observed this result while evaluating the effect of the debit variation on the breakthrough curve shape under 25 c for 5 mg l 1 of paracetamol at the column inlet and 200 mg of activated carbon 2 3 3 effect of bed height the bed height is an important parameter in the design of any packed bed fluidized bed or semifluidized bed adsorption reactor because it is proportional to the amount of the adsorbent in the column biswas et al 2020 nazari et al 2016 by increasing the height of the bed breakthrough curves can be achieved more quickly saravanan et al 2018 nazari et al 2016 observed that both the exhaustion time and the effluent volume veff increase with increasing the bed height moreover they reported that a higher bed contains more adsorbent therefore the total surface area will increase however in their case a relatively low bed height was beneficial to antibiotics adsorption because of the nonaccessibility of all adsorbent surfaces at higher bed values similarly dawood et al 2019 observed that the breakthrough time tb total treated methylene blue mb dye volume and the removal of mb increased with the increase of the bed height they indicated that a higher breakthrough time indicates a better intraparticle diffusion phenomenon and thus higher adsorption capacity likewise sotelo et al 2013 reported that increasing the bed height leads to an enhance in the breakthrough time tb for the bed depths of 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 cm the tb values were 233 7 315 7 and 453 8 h respectively 2 4 breakthrough curve modeling according to the literature different models were used to describe the breakthrough curve and the adsorption kinetic five models namely adams bohart eq 11 thomas eq 12 yoon nelson eq 13 bed depth service time bdst eq 14 and clark model eq 15 are the most used in the dynamic adsorption system their description is presented in table 2 to confirm which model is the best the analysis of the error is necessary the correlation coefficient r2 adjusted coefficient of determination adjusted r2 and the residual sum of squares rss eq 10 can be used for the validation of these models nazari et al 2016 the mathematical formula of rss is 10 rss i 1 n y i f x i 2 where yi is the ith value of the variable to be predicted xi is the ith value of the explanatory variable and f xi is the predicted value of yi 2 5 adsorption kinetic in short besides the adsorption ability of an adsorbent a fast adsorption rate is required for a better choice of material to be used as an adsorbent the kinetic study is an important means to study the dynamics of the adsorption by determining the rate constant of the process salleh et al 2011 the main models used in the literature are the pseudo first order kinetic eq 16 the pseudo second order kinetic eq 17 the elovich model eq 18 and the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model eq 19 table 2 2 6 adsorption isotherms to describe the adsorption mechanism at a constant temperature and ph isotherms are used to explain the phenomenon controlling the retention or release or mobility of a substance from aquatic environments to a solid phase it may explain how the adsorbent will interact with the adsorbate and give an idea of adsorption capacity referring to their graphical representation corda and kini 2018 foo and hameed 2010 yagub et al 2014 according to the literature different models are used and a distinction can be made between two and three parameter isotherms depending on the studied parameters any of them could be chosen for the best fitting of the adsorption data foo and hameed 2010 langmuir eq 20 freundlich eq 21 temkin eq 22 and dubinin radushkevich eq 23 are the most used models and they are known as two parameter isotherms table 2 2 7 thermodynamic studies of adsorption from the thermodynamic viewpoint the adsorption can be evaluated by the standard values of gibbs free energy δg0 kj mol 1 eq 24 enthalpy δh0 kj mol 1 and entropy δs0 j mol 1 k 1 eq 25 changes to evaluate the spontaneity of the sorption process abdel khalek et al 2017 brião et al 2018 24 ln ρ k c δ s r δ h rt 25 δg rtln ρ k c where t is the temperature in degree k r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 kc is the equilibrium constant l g 1 and ρ is the solution density g l 1 the values of δh δg and δs are determined by the correlation of ln kc versus 1 t data using a linear regression analysis which should give a straight line with an acceptable coefficient of determination the spontaneity of the process can be verified by δg values the negative δg values indicate that the adsorption is spontaneous and favorable from the δh value it can be verified that the adsorption onto the adsorbent is an endothermic process if the δh value is positive while a negative value indicates an exothermic adsorption process abdel khalek et al 2017 brião et al 2018 marrakchi et al 2017 on the other hand the negative values of entropy change δs suggest the decrease in randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption meanwhile the positive value reveals the affinity between the adsorbate molecules and the adsorbent with the increase in the degree of freedom abdel khalek et al 2017 marrakchi et al 2017 2 8 adsorbent and column regeneration an effective adsorbent has higher adsorption efficiency as well as regeneration capacity regeneration study is useful for the investigation of the recovery of pollutants and adsorbent suitability dash et al 2018 therefore the regeneration of support used either in batch or in dynamic adsorption is necessary to reduce the cost effectiveness of the process hence regeneration and desorption experiments are used to find the optimal desorption for an eluent peng et al 2018 lipatova et al 2018 studied the removal of anionic dyes from water by adsorption on chitosan nanoparticles fixed on the fibrous carrier cpf these authors reported that the saturated cpf could be effectively regenerated by simple alkaline washing рн 10 through repeated recycle tests sorption desorption they indicated that the stable sorption and recycling performance of the cpf can be obtained even after five cycles similarly lima et al 2019 performed the regeneration of activated carbons derived from brazilian nutshells for the elimination of acetaminophen from aqueous solutions and hospital effluents they regenerated the support up to 74 with a mixture of 0 1m naoh 20 etoh solution therefore they concluded that the adsorbent could be recycled up to four cycles to ensure long term use of the adsorbent for this purpose sotelo et al 2013 studied the desorption of flumequine from the saturated column by etoh water 50 50 v v desorption experiments were carried out for column bed lengths of 4 0 and 6 0 cm a volumetric flow rate of 2 0 ml min 1 and an initial flumequine dose of 1 0 mg l 1 the results revealed that the elution efficiency achieved is very low 24 5 for a column bed length of 4 0 cm and 38 2 for 6 0 cm they attributed this behavior to the uncompleted reversible adsorption of pharmaceutical products likewise yan et al 2016 regenerated more than 87 of a fixed bed column containing rice husk ash after mb adsorption using ethanol for three cycles they maintained the flow rate of the eluting process at 2 min l 1 until the outlet of the column became colorless table 3 shows some examples of batch and fixed bed adsorption applications 3 coagulation the principal property of fine particles in water is the charge of their surface which is ph dependent and contributes to relative stability forcing them to remain in suspension to prevent their aggregation for long periods the surface charge can be attributed to different phenomena such as 1 isomorphous replacement of metal atoms in the crystal material crystal imperfections 2 structural imperfections that occur while the formation of the crystal 3 adsorption of specific ions 4 the ionization of inorganic surface functional groups howe et al 2012 and 5 the crystal ions pair distribution and or the adsorption of macro ions thomas et al 2002 these phenomena provide positive or negative charges on colloidal particle surfaces depending on the ph and the adsorbent iso electrical point iep the stabilization of these particles is achieved in aqueous media through the balance between repulsive forces and van der waals attraction as explained by derjaguin landua verwey overbeek dlvo theory park and seo 2011 furthermore this theory can also predict the coagulation floculation of the system and the destabilization of colloidal particles in aqueous media park and seo 2011 the term coagulation flocculation refers to all physicochemical processes by which colloidal particles or fine suspended solids are transformed by chemical flocculants into more visible and separable species flocs carmen and daniel 2012 howe et al 2012 concerning the coagulation process it aims to destabilize colloidal particles and convert them into aggregates by the compression of the electrical double layer this minimizes the strength of the pollutant repulsion which is quantified by the zeta potential value tahreen et al 2020 the destabilization of colloidal particles by coagulants is achieved through several mechanisms including charge neutralization double layer compression adsorption interparticles bridging and enmeshment chen et al 2020 tahreen et al 2020 the formed flocs are then removed by decantation and filtration and then evacuated padmaja et al 2020 the main coagulants used to destabilize suspended particles and produce flocs are aluminum sulfate alum al2 so4 3 18h2o sodium aluminate naalo2 ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o and ferric sulfate fe2 so4 3 9h2o comninellis and chen 2010 pereira and alves 2012 the hydroxylation of these compounds forms insoluble precipitates that destabilize the particles by their adsorption and neutralization of their charge thus reduction of the repulsive forces howe et al 2012 chemical coagulation cc is often applied for the treatment of textile industry wastewater to remove color and reduce chemical oxygen demand cod prior to biological processes as a primary treatment process papic et al 2000 generally alum is most satisfactory for the discoloration of textile effluents containing vat and sulfur dyes however inorganic coagulants such as alum are totally ineffective for reactive azo acid and basic dyes mansour et al 2011 the process is limited by the extensive addition of chemicals and the large quantities of sludge formed at the end of treatment their reuse remains the only way out but it requires additional investment to regenerate them and to treat them for recovery sqalli houssini et al 2020 the process is highly sensitive to ph changes and effective coagulation is achieved at ph 6 0 7 0 therefore during the coagulation process the hydrolysis of the metal salts will decrease the ph values which need to be adjusted to modulate the effluent ph comninellis and chen 2010 in recent years electrocoagulation ec has attracted extensive attention and research as an alternative to the chemical coagulation method padmaja et al 2020 performed a benchmark study on the efficiency of cc and ec processes for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluents the results showed that cc decreased considerably the percentage of suspended solids cod and chlorides but the elimination of the total dissolved solids tds were only 14 1 using alum and 26 3 with fecl3 whereas ec process reduced cod and tds to a greater extent 92 3 and 91 5 proving more efficiency with fe al assembly using a lowest current of 0 04 a at a time interval of 15 min this study affirmed also that the consumption of coagulants is less in ec compared to cc rendering it a cost effective technology similarly chen et al 2020 compared ec anode electrocoagulation aec and cc process through the quantification of the contribution of each process on emulsified oil elimination from polymer flooding sewage they concluded that under all conditions studied the ec performance outperforms aec and far beyond cc 3 1 electrocoagulation principle and mechanism over the last few decades the ec process has proven to be a leading technique for wastewater treatment it is an emerging method that combines the benefits and functions of conventional coagulation flotation adsorption precipitation discharge and electrochemical reactions including cathodic reduction and anodic oxidation fig 4 kuokkanen et al 2013 shadmehr et al 2019 song et al 2017 this technology is known for a lot of advantages such as being attractive for its versatility ease of control safety selectivity and being able for automation thakur et al 2009 the coagulation and precipitation of contaminants in the form of sludge is the result of three possible mechanisms electrocoagulation ec electroflotation ef and electrooxidation eo fig 5 sahu et al 2014 zaied et al 2020 ec involves the in situ generation of coagulants by the application of direct current voltage to oxidize a sacrificial anode such as fe secula et al 2011 al liu and wu 2019 hybrid al fe electrodes chen 2004 mild steel manilal et al 2020 and stainless steel ss titchou et al 2020a and the production of hydrogen gas chen 2004 titchou et al 2020a yuksel et al 2013 the electro oxidation of the anodes produces metal ions that act as destabilizing agents to help the charged particles bind together forcing them to coagulate and be removed from wastewater alizadeh et al 2015 sahu et al 2014 neutralization of the electric charge is achieved by reducing the interparticle electrostatic repulsion to the point where the van der waals attraction predominates to form a mass or floc comninellis and chen 2010 sahu et al 2014 the electrolysis of water in the ec process produces oxygen and h2 bulbs at the anode and the cathode respectively which enhances the flotation and the formation of flocs chen 2004 reported that the use of stable and active electrodes for oxygen evolution would boost the electroflotation technology and enhance the removal efficiency of colloidal particles oil and grease as well as organic pollutants the process follows three successive steps i production of coagulants from the electrolytic oxidation of a sacrificial anode ii destabilization of organics and particulate suspension and formation of flocs and iii aggregation of destabilized particulates and sludge formation titchou et al 2020a this process occurred as follows 26 at the anode m mn ne 27 2h2o 4h o2 4e 28 at the cathode nh 2 o ne n 2 h 2 n oh 29 mn ne m 30 in the bulk of solution mn noh m oh n where m and n are the anode material and the number of electrons involved in the reaction respectively ghernaout 2013 kim et al 2002 after the formation of insoluble polymeric metal hydroxides four mechanisms of destabilization could occur it may be realized by surface complexation when the pollutant acts as a ligand to link the polymers formed ye et al 2019 the electrostatic attraction where contaminants neutralize the surface charge on the m oh n compress the diffuse double layer due to the increase of concentration metal ions in the solution the precipitation chemical attachment to colloidal materials and the chain oxidation reaction in the presence of nacl that may enhance the formation of the mono and polynuclear hydroxide form of the metal bassyouni et al 2017 shadmehr et al 2019 the effectiveness of the process depends on many operating conditions such as the arrangement of electrodes the electrode form the nature of power supply the solution ph the conductivity of the solution the distance between electrodes the agitation speed the current density the initial pollutant concentration the electrolysis time the retention time the temperature the presence of nacl and the passivation of the electrode chen 2004 khandegar and saroha 2013 moussa et al 2017 3 2 factors influencing electrocoagulation 3 2 1 electrocoagulation design electrocoagulation has been used for the removal of different pollutants using both batch and continuous reactors continuous flow mode ec reactors have many forms like turbulent flow reactor airlift reactor and modified flow song et al 2017 ec cells may contain either one or multiple anode cathode pairs which may be connected in monopolar or bipolar mode in a well defined shape and size capacity container reactor khandegar and saroha 2013 kuokkanen et al 2013 generally stirring is necessary to keep the liquid and slurry uniform in the reactor ec reactor contains plate electrodes placed in a parallel arrangement where water flows through the space between the electrodes in a vertical or horizontal direction sahu et al 2014 the geometry of the ec reactor influences not only the cost effectiveness and easy operation but also the efficiency of the ec process kobya et al 2020 a simple form of an ec reactor may be constituted with one anode and one cathode connected to an external power source mollah et al 2001 the application of ec process in the industrial scale up requires a workable rate of metal dissolution and a large surface area of electrodes mollah et al 2001 fig 6 shows three possible electrode connections in an ec reactor monopolar parallel mp p monopolar serial mp s and bipolar serial bp s they consist of two metal electrodes placed between two parallel plates and a direct current power source chen 2004 kobya et al 2020 mollah et al 2001 zaied et al 2020 in the monopolar systems all anodes are connected to each other and similarly all cathodes are also connected to each other and their two faces are active with the same polarity sahu et al 2014 in mp p a particular sacrificial anode is linked to another anode directly similar arrangements for cathodes also exist it is a simple arrangement of an ec cell with a couple of anodes and a couple of cathodes in a parallel arrangement kobya et al 2020 mollah et al 2001 zaied et al 2020 in the monopolar serial arrangement the individual anode cathode pair is connected internally and they are not linked to the outer electrodes zaied et al 2020 the arrangement of monopolar electrodes in a series of cells is electrically equivalent to one cell with multiple electrodes and interconnections mollah et al 2001 kobya et al 2020 reported that the most efficient connection to achieve higher efficiency with lower operational cost and energy consumption is mp s mode using an iron electrode they referenced on the improvement of chemical co precipitation and the decrease of anodic potential in the bipolar system electrodes are polarized where the side of the electrode facing the anode is negatively polarized and vice versa on the other side facing the cathode sahu et al 2014 concerning bp s between the inner electrodes there is no electrical connection where only the outer electrodes are linked to the power supply kobya et al 2011 in this case the sacrificial electrodes are placed between two parallel electrodes without any electrical connection mollah et al 2001 the bp s mode is characterized by a simple connection that requires low maintenance however in ec reactors this arrangement is flawed by the current loss kobya et al 2020 series cell arrangements have higher resistance and they require a higher potential difference for a given current to flow similarly through all connected electrodes however in an individual cell with parallel arrangement the electric current is divided between all electrodes kobya et al 2011 mollah et al 2001 several researches reported the treatment of different pollutants using these connections such as the treatment of laundry wastewater wang et al 2009 can manufacturing wastewater kobya and demirbas 2015 and discoloration of dye aqueous solutions daneshvar et al 2004 sqalli houssini et al sqalli houssini et al 2020 studied the possibility of using combined aluminum and iron electrodes as sacrificial anodes in bipolar mode to treat mixed reactive and dispersed dyes more than 95 of color removal was achieved with energy consumption lower than 10 kwh kg 1 under optimal conditions for 40 mg l 1 at 60 min of processing time they reported that the amount of iron or aluminum released through the solution was under the value fixed by the legislation similarly nasrullah et al 2018 investigated the removal of suspended solids ss biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod from a solution containing palm oil mill by ec process they evaluated the impact of various types of electrode design in a vertical or horizontal orientation monopolar series mp s monopolar parallel mp p and bipolar bp arrangements using aluminum iron and steel wool the results indicated that the highest removal efficiencies of 66 70 and 74 for ss bod and cod respectively were obtained by using vertical orientation mp s arrangement and steel wool equipment moreover the economic study revealed that the mp s arrangement had an expensive operating cost than bp and mp p while the arrangement of electrodes in vertical position not only helps in gaining efficiency but also it is economical the orientation of the electrodes in ec cells influences the performance of the process it is a significant parameter that determines coagulant release and bubble dispersion it influences the mixing conditions mass transfer process and the elimination pathway of contaminants jiang et al 2019 fig 7 shows three different orientations of the electrodes which are vertical electrode orientation horizontal electrode orientation with anode at the bottom and horizontal electrode orientation with anode at top many studies have used vertical electrodes in electrocoagulation treatment aswathy et al 2016 bayar et al 2011 titchou et al 2020a while some researchers studied the assessment between horizontal and vertical electrode orientation fadali et al 2016 khalaf et al 2016 nasrullah et al 2018 meanwhile some of them reported the use of electrodes with different tilt angles bassala et al 2017 huang et al 2009 jiang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 3 2 2 effect of electrode material the nature of the electrode material influences the efficiency of the ec process generally the majority of researchers have studied ec using iron electrodes or aluminum electrodes as the sacrificial anode sahu et al 2014 the use of these conventional materials is related to the coagulation properties of multivalent ions besides these materials titanium and zinc electrodes showed efficient results in ec cells safwat 2020 to valorize metallurgical wastes as alternative materials oliveira et al 2020 used electrodes issued from the compression of a metallurgical deposit in the ec reactor for the removal of indigo carmine dye electrodes of bronze aluminum steel and metal waste were also tested from these results they observed that these electrodes had similar electrochemical efficiency as commercial electrodes moreover the use of metallic debris makes their application in ec technology with lower cost and high efficiency and their replacement can solve the electrode passivation similarly amri et al 2020 compared a commercial aluminum electrode for use in the remediation of wastewater by ec process with a waste aluminum can electrode for discoloration of acid red 18 dye as a pollutant they demonstrated that waste aluminum cans performed better than commercial aluminum electrodes with a removal efficiency of 100 in 25 min of reaction time 3 2 3 electrode distance electrode distance is a parameter that can affect the water motion turbulence mass transfer size of ec reactor and energy consumption song et al 2017 however the potential developed between electrodes is a valuable property that affects the electrode kinetic parameters of the electrochemical system titchou et al 2020a generally the solution resistance and power consumption decrease as the interelectrode distance is reduced while the larger electrode distance decreases the mass transfer and the movement of species leading to decline the reaction rate however as indicated by song et al 2017 the decrease of electrode spacing under the optimum value reduces the efficiency due to the low mass transfer in ec process causing a raise of electrolyte resistance bouguerra et al 2015 mentioned that inter electrode distance effects on the amount of electrical energy consumed by the system to generate an electric field and induce the motion of ions they indicated that a distance between 0 5 and 3 0 cm are generally used in the ec processes this distance gap is favorable for the reduction of energy consumption and reaction time ensuring adequate interelectrode mass transfer bouguerra et al 2015 3 2 4 effect of current density current density is a critical parameter which affects the reaction time and actively induces the dominant mode of contaminants removal zaied et al 2020 it is a parameter that can be controlled directly and it determines the amount of the coagulant dissolved in the solution the size of the flocs formed and the hydrogen bubble production rate titchou et al 2020a the increase of current density enhances the dissolution of the sacrificial electrode the generation of h2 bulbs and the flotation of the formed sludge anantha singh and ramesh 2013 chen 2004 nasrullah et al 2018 the metal dissolution can be evaluated according to the faraday law nasrullah et al 2018 eq 31 31 m i t m z f where m is the mass of anode dissolved g i is the current a t is the electrolysis time s m is the molecular weight g mol 1 f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol 1 and z is the number of electrons involved in the reaction for the removal of coragen pesticide ramya et al 2019 reported the influence of the current density on cod chloride and bromide removal during the electrocoagulation of coragen using iron electrodes the results showed that when the current density was increased from 2 5 to 7 5 ma cm 2 it resulted in the enhancement of the oxidation rate after 60 min of electrolysis the cod chloride and bromide removal percentage got increased to 79 78 and 77 respectively when the current density was maintained at 7 5 ma cm 2 secula et al 2011 pointed out that doubling the value of current density from 5 5 to 10 9 a m 2 increases the discoloration rate from 49 2 to 98 9 after 3 h of ec furthermore applying a current density of 54 6 a m 2 leads to a discoloration rate of 99 9 after 60 min it is also clear that the operation cost of ec process is the result of electrical energy consumption which is associated with current density and operating time song et al 2017 the energy consumption is given in equation 32 jiang et al 2019 32 e u i t v where u is the stabilized voltage v i is the applied current a t is the electrified time h and v is the volume of sewage treated m3 to highlight the direct relationship between current density and energy consumption kilany et al 2020 tested the variation of energy consumption while increasing the current density they reported that energy consumption increases from 0 06 to 4 5 kwh kg 1 and from 0 04 to 6 2 kwh kg 1 when the current density increased from 0 1 to 1 5 ma cm 2 for the removal of oil and cu2 respectively 3 2 5 effect of ph the ph of the treated solution plays a role in influencing the overall performance of ec process it affects the nature and efficiency of the involved electrochemical and chemical reactions in the cell the state of other species in the solution and the solubility of the products formed mouedhen et al 2009 sahu et al 2014 moreover the ph effects the conductivity the dissolution of the electrodes the zeta potential of colloids and the hydroxide speciation sahu et al 2014 the production of coagulating ions and the surface charge of the particles are controlled by ph variation and its evolution during ec process dura and breslin 2019 the elimination mechanism of suspended organics from the effluent depends on the modification of electrostatic charges on colloidal particles these modifications affect their destabilization and adsorption on hydroxide particles drogui et al 2008 dura and breslin 2019 liu et al 2017 depending on the ph values the removal of pollutants took different stages for a ph range of 4 0 5 5 where the charge neutralization of particles usually happens wang et al 2011 then the production of oh increases the ph value leading to form monomeric species and polymeric hydroxyl metallic complexes consequently the coagulation of pollutants occurs followed by their removal due to the adsorption phenomenon on metal hydroxyl flocs kobya et al 2020 3 2 6 effect of supporting electrolyte and conductivity it has been reported that higher conductivity is favorable to reducing ohmic drop cell voltage and energy consumption conductivity affects the dissolution rate of metals and the surface phenomena that occur between polluting species and metal hydroxides izquierdo et al 2010 therefore the efficiency of the process is related to the concentration and the nature of the electrolyte salt dura and breslin 2019 izquierdo et al 2010 song et al 2017 titchou et al 2020a izquierdo et al 2010 studied the effect of the nature of electrolyte salt on the remediation of soluble oils by ec process considering chloride sulfate and nitrate anions with sodium potassium or ammonium cations using al or fe electrodes as they reported aluminum electrodes can be dissolved under high current efficiency in all cases whereas the dissolution of iron is a little efficient with nitrate salts and potassium sulfate moreover besides the enhancement of the efficiency of the process the presence of supporting electrolytes such as nacl can contribute to water disinfection moussa et al 2017 similarly yildiz et al yıldız et al 2008 studied the effects of nacl na2so4 and nano3 concentrations on the batch removal of water with a high amount of natural organic matter nom they concluded that the addition of electrolyte salts has a twofold advantage firstly increasing the ionic strength of the solution causes compression of the double layer secondly it decreases the ohmic resistance of the medium leading to more current flow through the cell under the same applied potential for example at ph 5 0 and for 100 mg l 1 of nom the charge loadings were within the range of 2 1 3 7 f m 3 for na2so4 and nacl respectively moreover at the same operating conditions for 9 min electrolysis the specific energy consumptions were ranged from 4 8 to 9 7 kwh m 3 and the removal efficiency values were between 96 8 and 99 6 for na2so4 and nacl respectively 3 2 7 effect of reaction time electrolysis time can also affect the treatment efficiency of ec process esfandian et al 2017 it influences the production rate of coagulant oh h2 bubbles and the cost effectiveness of the process eq 32 jiang et al 2019 raising the conductivity causes higher current passing through the cell and increases the removal rate hence the reaction time required for the desired removal efficiency is getting shorter jiang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 yıldız et al 2008 this trend was observed in many research papers for instance ramya et al 2019 investigated the effect of electrolysis time on cod chloride and bromide mineralization different electrolysis times up to 150 min were tested under nacl concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 applied current density of 2 5 ma cm 2 at neutral ph ph 7 0 the results showed that the mineralization efficiency of cod chloride and bromide increased in the first 60 min reaching over 58 42 and 59 respectively then it enhanced and achieved 60 60 and 65 respectively at 150 min of electrolysis in the same context ahmadzadeh and dolatabadi 2018 evaluated the effect of reaction time tr on the remediation of pharmaceutical wastewater containing metronidazole mnz increasing the tr from 2 to 20 min enhanced the removal efficiency from 28 2 to 72 7 the best removal efficiency was observed at 17 min using a current density of 4 5 ma cm 2 neutral ph inter electrode gap of 3 cm and an initial mnz dose of 30 mg l 1 3 2 8 effect of temperature likewise the temperature can influence the efficiency of the ec process the increase of temperature may enhance the anode dissolution favoring the formation of dense flocs that could adhere to the electrode surface preventing the dosage of metallic cations thus it may increase the probability of collisions between the colloids formed which form large aggregates and reduce the surface area available for adsorption as a result the amount of sludge formed increases donneys victoria et al 2019 as observed by gonçalves et al 2019 when the temperature changed from 20 to 40 c during the pretreatment of a saline concentrated effluent the retention time increased from 60 to 120 min and the total sludge generated ranged from 2 6 g l 1 to 6 5 g l 1 both at ph 7 0 3 3 advantages and limitations of ec electrocoagulation has many advantages compared to chemical coagulation ec system requires no addition of chemicals and needs minimal startup time the process can be started by turning on the switch and it provides better removal capabilities for the same species than chemical coagulation moreover the sludge is lesser and more readily filterable and can be utilized as a soil additive lowering the sludge disposal cost khandegar and saroha 2013 generally ec is characterized by the presence of electro flotation kuokkanen et al 2013 and the greater functional ph range 4 0 9 0 and ph neutralization effect comninellis and chen 2010 the sludge formation in the electrocoagulation process is related to faraday s law generally higher current density increases both the dissolution of anode and sludge production titchou et al 2020a the amount of sludge generated during ec treatment was reviewed in the literature to be lower than that of chemical coagulation this sludge is characterized by a better quality such as lower water content much larger and more stable flocs with better stability kuokkanen et al 2013 shadmehr et al 2019 the properties of sludge generated are of great importance because sludge treatment and disposal add additional costs to the cost of water and wastewater treatment when the sludge contains chemicals sahu et al 2014 however ec process has some limitations such as i the need for periodic replacement of the sacrificial anodes resulted from the oxidation or passivation of the electrodes ii the requirements of minimum solution conductivity depend on the reactor design iii the formation of toxic chlorinated organic compounds in the case of effluents containing chlorides iv cathode passivation resulted from the deposition of resistant compounds on the cathode which limit the flow of electric current this interference can be overcome by the change of polarity and periodical cleaning of the electrodes khandegar and saroha 2013 in addition to that and in some areas where electricity is not abundant the high cost of electricity can increase the operational cost of ec khandegar and saroha 2013 moussa et al 2017 ec reactors can be coupled with low cost renewable energy sources such as solar photovoltaic cells to provide power to electrodes as reported by others hussin et al 2019 pirkarami et al 2013 tones et al 2020 valero et al 2008 sometimes it is necessary to combine ec with other processes i e hybrid processes to insure efficient treatment of wastewater the ec technology can be designed in water treatment systems to include membrane separation reverse osmosis electro filtration sludge dewatering thermo oxidation and other conventional technologies to enhance the recovery of fine particles and metal ions from wastewater mollah et al 2001 3 4 application of electrocoagulation ec process has been experienced for the treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals tannery and textile industry wastewater food industry wastewater paper industry wastewater refinery wastewater and produced water moussa et al 2017 a research in science direct showed abundant investigations on the ec process used for organic remediation generating interest in wastewater treatment as shown below in fig 8 3 4 1 treatment of industrial effluents by ec process ec process is widely applied for the treatment of different industrial effluents containing pops kim et al 2020 investigated the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in water during electrocoagulation using an iron electrode the results revealed that increasing the current density from 2 4 to 80 0 ma cm 2 led to a significant increase in the removal efficiency of pfoa from 10 0 to 100 0 within 6 h moreover under experimental conditions of pfoa 0 24 μm a current density of 40 ma cm 2 stirring speed of 200 rpm and nacl initial concentration of 35 mm 65 of fluorine recovery as fluoride ions and organic fluorine in shorter chain by products perfluoropentanoic acid perfluorohexanoic acid and perfluoroheptanoic acid was achieved with 60 of toc removal after 6h of electrolysis likewise the remediation of perfluoroalkyl substances in landfill leachates by electrocoagulation using aluminum electrodes was studied by zhang et al 2014 the removal efficiencies of perfluorohexanoic acid perfluoroheptanoic acid perfluorooctanoate acid perfluorononanoic acid and perfluorodecanoic acid after 45 min were 65 1 58 5 75 2 33 8 and 10 respectively using plate distance of 1 cm a current density of 35 ma cm 2 and plate amounts of four pairs however perfluoroundecanoic acid and perfluorododecanoic acid concentrations increased by about 20 2 and 18 6 after the ec treatment process yang et al 2016 used the ec process to investigate the removal performance of aqueous perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas with relatively high concentration as simulating wastewater from the organic fluorine industry comparing iron and aluminum electrodes the effective removal of perfluorooctane sulfonate peos and perfluorooctanoic acid was obtained by fe anode at the optimal operating parameters of 0 25 mm of pfos 25 0 ma cm 2 of current density 180 rpm of stirring speed and 2 g l 1 nacl as supporting electrolyte more than 99 of pfos removal was achieved after 50 min electrolysis similarly the efficiency of ec process for the removal of pfaas was reported elsewhere bao et al 2020 yang et al 2016 the treatment of trichloroethylene tce by ec process using iron anode and copper foam cathode was optimized by mao et al 2012 they reported that the optimal conditions to achieve the highest removal efficiency are 9 525 mm thick copper foam electrode 40 ma current and 0 042 m na2so4 under these conditions the final elimination efficiency of tce can reach up to 98 and the corresponding energy consumption is 6 49 kwh kg 1 they affirmed the efficiency of this system for the remediation of groundwater or wastewater contaminated by chlorinated organic compounds moreover the influence of the presence of humic acid and strong oxidants such as chromate selenate and nitrate on the removal of tce was evaluated by fallahpour et al 2017 in limestone block column experiments using iron anode and copper cathode the influence of these substances on the tce removal followed the order humic acid chromate selenate and nitrate dichromate and selenate were reduced to insoluble ions forming precipitates that covered the anode surface the results revealed that this system could remove these contaminants as a mixture while the remediation rate of tce is significantly low around 40 compared to the control experiment only tce table 4 presents other examples of the treatment of these effluents using the ec process 3 4 2 domestic wastewater treatment bracher et al 2020 optimized an electrocoagulation flotation technique for wastewater treatment they reported that the turbidity and color removal reached were higher than 98 and 92 respectively moreover the residual turbidity was lower than 6 ntu and the final ph was 8 0 under the electrolysis time initial ph electric current agitation and inter electrodes gap which were about 25 min 6 1 7 a 262 5 rpm and 1 cm respectively omwene and kobya 2018 studied the phosphorus elimination from domestic wastewater using aluminum al and iron fe anodes in a batch reactor they obtained less than 0 01 mg l 1 of residual phosphorus under optimal conditions using an initial concentration of ci 52 mg l 1 po4 p operational conditions were set at phi 4 0 j 20 a m 2 for 100 min q 954 c for fe electrode and phi 4 0 j 20 a m 2 at 50 min q 372 c for al electrode they also concluded that al electrode provided higher phosphorous elimination with a shorter electrolysis time and smaller metal to phosphorous ratio compared to fe anodes rodrigo et al 2010 removed phosphorus ions and cod from domestic wastewater using a conductive diamond electrode with an energy consumption lesser than 4 5 kw h m 3 during treatment yildiz and oran 2019 designed a monopolar ec reactor using an iron electrode for the treatment of samples received from an urban wastewater treatment plant they aimed to reduce the sludge production and improve the sludge stabilization degree concluding from the findings that ec technique can be an effective means for sludge disintegration elazzouzi et al 2019 studied the remediation of wastewater by a batch electrocoagulation flotation ecf technique using iron fe and aluminum al plates with monopolar configuration cod removal achieved was 84 and 80 using al and fe electrodes respectively similarly yilmaz et al 2018 investigated the use of an electrocoagulation system for urban wastewater treatment using aluminum and stainless steel electrodes they reported that the cod removal efficiency obtained was about 90 under optimum experimental conditions which are 10 a current intensity 100 ml min 1 circulation rate constant ph 7 0 and no supporting electrolyte experiments 4 combined electrocoagulation adsorption process the use of the ec process alone for the treatment of highly polluted wastewaters may be limited by different problems such as cost effectiveness and electrode passivation however the presence of a post or pretreatment process in the ec presents a solution for these limitations al qodah et al 2020 recently hybrid electrocoagulation with one or more treatment processes such as adsorption chemical coagulation magnetic field reverse osmosis and membrane filtration has been applied to improve the removal of colloidal and non biodegradable pollutants al qodah et al 2020 in this section several applications of the ec adsorption hybrid process for the removal of different types of organic pollutants were reviewed javed et al 2019 studied the treatment of reactive red 241 dye by ec biosorption coupled process they reported that the hybrid process had efficient performance and resulted in the complete discoloration with lower energy requirement and operational cost under optimal conditions of 21 7 ma cm 2 current density ph 7 0 bio sorbent dosage of 8 g l 1 and dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 they achieved 99 6 of color removal after 20 min with a specific electrical energy consumption of 1 7 kwh kg 1 dye and operational cost of 0 3 kg 1 dye bellebia et al 2009 performed the elimination of brilliant blue levafix e bra reactive dye from solutions by ec using al electrodes followed by adsorption on the granular activated carbon gac they showed that for the electrocoagulation process the maximum abatement of 200 mg l 1 of the dye was obtained for a loading charge of 7 5 f m 3 thereafter the residual reactive dye concentration was completely removed with 700 mg l 1 gac castañeda díaz et al 2017 studied the elimination of the anionic dye remazol yellow ry and the cationic dye malachite green mg from aqueous solutions by ec technique followed by adsorption process in column systems they performed and compared the performances of both batch and continuous electrocoagulation reactors from the experiments they concluded that the electrocoagulation adsorption hybrid process was more efficient for dye elimination than ec alone moreover using carbonaceous materials obtained from industrial sewage sludge and commercial activated carbons the removal efficiencies of ry and mg were between 96 and 98 wang et al 2017 coupled ec and peanut shell ps adsorption for the removal of malachite green mg under optimal conditions i e a current density of 2 ma cm 2 a ps dosage of 5 g l 1 an initial mg concentration of 50 mg l 1 and an initial ph around neutral the optimal removal efficiency of mg was found to be 98 in 5 min which was 23 higher than that in the ec process in 60 min furthermore they observed that the energy consumption and the unit material energy consumption were 94 lower in the coupling process than that in the traditional ec process bener et al 2020 applied the ec adsorption hybrid process for the treatment of real textile wastewater for ec method and under optimal conditions i e electrode type al current density 25 ma cm 2 and initial ph value ph 5 0 nearly 35 total organic carbon toc 18 6 chemical oxygen demand cod 90 turbidity and 50 color removal efficiencies were achieved however for ec coupled with adsorption on the walnut shell and corncob agricultural wastes the removal efficiency of the toc was found to be nearly 75 the cod was found to be 27 and the color turbidity and total dissolved solids achieved the standards for irrigation water rubí juárez et al 2017 studied the removal of oily matter from car wash wastewater using ec process followed by adsorption on gac when aluminum copper and zinc electrodes were used cod removal was 78 76 and 71 respectively while the turbidity attained was 92 90 and 78 respectively the electrocoagulation followed by adsorption on gac at concentrations of 7 5 15 and 22 5 g l 1 allowed cod removal of 86 91 and 94 and turbidity of 96 97 and 98 using al electrodes bellebia et al 2012 investigated cod abatement and turbidity of cardboard paper mill wastewater using al and fe electrodes followed by adsorption of treated effluent on gac they compared the performance of the ec adsorption hybrid process using gac and that of ec technique alone they reported that using ec alone the maximum removal efficiencies of turbidity and cod under optimal conditions i e ph 5 3 for the al electrode and ph 7 2 for the fe electrode a current density of 4 4 ma cm 2 and operating time of 10 min were 99 9 and 75 4 for the al electrode and 99 9 and 78 8 for the fe electrode respectively however for the hybrid process under a ph of 3 2 at 300 rpm with a contact time of 120 min for the al electrode and 180 min for the fe electrode the maximum removal efficiencies of cod were 99 and 93 4 respectively they proved from these results the effectiveness of the ec adsorption process for the highly concentrated organic pollutants present in paper mill effluents pizutti et al 2019 proposed the application of electrocoagulation followed by adsorption for the post treatment of ascending anaerobic sludge blanket digestion wastewater effluent initially they optimized the ec process using the response surface methodology the results revealed that the optimal conditions of 29 4 a m 2 of current density and ph 6 0 cod removal and energy consumption reached were about 44 6 and 31 1 kwh per kg of cod respectively the ec effluent was then treated by adsorption on a fixed bed column of activated carbon as they indicated the conjugated system provided the complete removal of cod bod and thermotolerant coliforms besides the elimination of 96 5 and 97 5 of turbidity and phosphorus respectively 5 valorization of adsorption and electrocoagulation wastes although adsorption and electrocoagulation are considered powerful techniques to treat wastewater containing organic pollutants their wastes are a challenging task to tackle the regeneration of the support in the adsorption process concentrates the adsorbate in a more concentrated volume of water which promotes the reuse of the adsorbent however in some cases the regeneration of the support might not be necessary when using an abundant and natural adsorbent similarly for the ec process the sludge formed is concentrated in terms of pollutants traditionally the management of organic wastes has been handled by landfilling recovery recycling incineration or combustion in cement plants plasma gasification composting energy recovery and avoidance or waste minimization arfala et al 2018 raksasat et al 2020 recently the valorization of solid wastes is considered a sustainable solution to get rid of them in this context raksasat et al 2020 reviewed the use of insect larvae for the valorization of organic wastes into biomass which is considered as a protein and lipid feedstock for poultry feed and biodiesel production sometimes the sludge can be used as an amendment of agricultural soils considering their nutriment composition or in cement plant afanga et al 2020 titchou et al 2020b they may help to improve soil quality reduction of uptake of heavy metals and nourish the soil like in the case of the biochar adsorbent obtained from the sewage sludge as reported by singh et al 2020 similarly different research papers deal with sludge and waste for instance recently by zhu et al 2019 studied the valorization of manganese rich sludge obtained from groundwater treatment to prepare a magnetic adsorbent for cu ii adsorption likewise the application of the anaerobic digestion process to olive mill wastewater and the sludge formed during their treatment by adsorption and electrocoagulation was studied by mikdame et al 2019 the results showed higher efficiency and cost effective for methane production while eliminating waste with adverse effects on the environment and producing energy 6 water and wastewater legislation water sanitation and hygiene are basic for health and environmental protection for sustainable development standards for water quality defined by the world organizations world health organization who and the environmental protection agency epa and the regulations of each country are guarantees of safe and rational use of water bodies drinking water wastewater discharge and traited wastewater reuse the potential use of water and its destination depends on its quality criteria two types of environmental qualities have been defined for the protection of human health and the living environment for drinking water the standards are stricter since its salubrity is a fundamental human right on the other hand depending on the treated wastewater quality and its compliance with defined standards its reuse destination may vary for instance the quality recommended for irrigation is higher than that of direct discharge into the environment the aforementioned standards have been established based on the organoleptic physico chemical and biological parameters besides undesirables and toxic substances these characteristics include odor color temperature conductivity ph biological oxygen demand bdo chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do total dissolved solids total suspended solids fecal and total coliforms fecal streptococcus heavy metals pesticides phenols detergents ammonium nitrates and phosphorous etc johnstone 2003 soudi 2013 strauss 2007 world health organization 2006 generally efficient treatment is one that respects the guidelines of water quality adsorption and electrocoagulation processes are reported to respond to the environment safety criteria madhavan and antony 2021 removed 99 of cod and 98 of oil grease o g using the ec process they affirmed that these obtained values were meeting us discharge standards 42 mg l 1of o g for the present case they used an initial concentration of 360 mg l 1 of oil cod of 1280 mg l 1 90 cod removal is equivalent to removing 88 o g so it is possible to attain a discharge concentration of less than 42 mg l 1 of o g similarly a summary of different studies dealing with the treatment of various effluents by the ec process was reported by syam babu et al syam babu et al 2020 although adsorption is not a standalone process its application to real textile wastewater using pozzolana was investigated in our previous work attaining the standard moroccan limit values smlv except for conductivity besides the total elimination of the color and mineral elements nitrates nitrites phosphates adsorption decreased the cod value from 603 mg l 1 to 31 mg l 1 cod smlv 500 mg l 1 titchou et al 2020b however in another work the elimination of eriochrome black t using aluminum oxide particles only achieved 71 of the percentage removal from an initial dye concentration of 50 mg l 1 el gaayda et al 2020 similarly using 130 mg l 1 of congo red gr and methyl orange mo the polyelectrolyte poly diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride modified montmorillonite clay removed 90 7 and 69 2 of cr and mo respectively ait akbour et al 2020 these findings revealed the need for a hybrid process to comply with the standard discharge limits the quality of water can be further enhanced by the combination of adsorption and electrocoagulation or even with an advanced oxidation process 7 conclusion this review illustrates a critical study of the most widely used techniques to get rid of pops from effluents adsorption coagulation and electrocoagulation ec have been discussed based on recent research papers these processes were selected for being the most used ones to clarify their state of the art and highlight the effect of different parameters on their efficiency among them ec showed effective elimination of various contaminants with a wide range of concentrations from water moreover ec is considered a cost effective process that offers many benefits and gives the possibility of its automation and its combination with other processes such as adsorption therefore it is primordial to integrate it into water and wastewater treatment plants authors contributions all authors proposed

11958,the groundwater contamination with arsenic and fluoride has threatened the well being of a vast number of people worldwide countries of south east asia including bangladesh china and india are severely affected in india people residing in the middle and lower gangetic planes and some central and south india areas characterized by hard rock terrain are worse affected by arsenic and fluoride contamination these contaminants are introduced into groundwater through multiple sources including both natural and anthropogenic sources the last three decades have witnessed a vast amount of

population of more than 200 million from 25 countries is facing the problem of fluorosis a disease associated with the intake of fluoride contaminated groundwater khatri and tyagi 2015 although fluoride is present in food air and water yet the major route of exposure is through drinking water vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 fluoride is known to affect the bones teeth skeletal muscles and nervous system the most common symptoms of fluoride poisoning are salivation nausea diarrhea and abdominal pain chouhan and flora 2010 the high fluoride uptake has led to several socio economic

al 2008 electro coagulation process behbahani et al 2011 and adsorption process tembhurkar and dongre 2006 due to the seriousness of this problem these two contaminants need immediate attention to restrict their rising threat in the near future this review aims at assessing the overall scenario of occurrence and co occurrence mechanism and pathways of dissolution its health impacts and mitigation measures as well from the past studies and present scenarios the problem of groundwater as and f in groundwater can be checked by the better knowledge of the sources and contributing mechanisms this study would compile the past and present studies to find a solution to the growing menace of as and f contamination in groundwater 2 arsenic 2 1 occurrence arsenic as is the 33rd element in the periodic table the elemental arsenic concentration in the crust ranges from 1 5 to 2 ppm elemental arsenic appears as a grayish metallic solid it is mostly found in combination with oxygen sulfur and chlorine atsdr 2007 hence arsenic is more commonly found in groundwater originating from minerals like arsenopyrite feass realgar as2s2 orpiment as2s3 and iron pyrites fes2 nikolopoulos and panagiotaras 2015 arsenic is extensively used in electronics metallurgy medicine agriculture livestock feed etc groundwater mainly contains arsenic in the form of arsenite aso3 3 as iii and arsenate aso4 3 as v which can be interconverted through an oxidation reduction process maji et al 2011 as v dominates in the oxidative environment while as iii dominates in reducing the environment zhu et al 2019 the as iii toxicity is 100 times more than that of arsenate which is sparingly soluble in water and hence less bioavailable sarkar and paul 2016 in biological systems the dominant forms of organic arsenic include monomethyl arsonic acid mma ch3aso oh 2 arsenobetaine ab c5h11aso2 dimethyl arsinic acid dma ch3 2aso oh and arsenoribosides arsenic sugars as sug whose solubility is dependent on the ph and ionic environment mandal and suzuki 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 thus arsenic occurs in several forms that are influenced by factors like ph and redox potential of groundwater the degree of toxicity of an arsenic compound is a factor of its valence state physical properties solubility absorption and removal rate kumar et al 2010 the most widespread arsenic contamination is in the unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers or metasedimentary bedrocks of the wells as reported from different regions of the globe including china argentina mexico cambodia england vietnam and india indo gangetic plains suggesting a geogenic origin of as ayotte et al 2003 kim et al 2012 before the year 2000 arsenic contamination was mainly reported from groundwater of asian countries namely bangladesh india and china but with the progress of time the arsenic contamination status around the world changed significantly particularly in these asian countries from 2000 to 2005 arsenic related problems spread in new regions of china mongolia cambodia nepal myanmar korea pakistan afghanistan western iran and vietnam mukherjee et al 2006 arsenic enriched water arising from hydrothermal springs also impacts the downstream surface as well as groundwater mixing along with associated biogeochemical processes which are subsequently affected by the changes in temperature redox conditions ph and pressure such impacts can deteriorate these resources making them unfit for drinking or irrigation purposes without proper treatment maity et al 2017 in the case of geothermal water discharge dilution and adsorption on sediments of a stream rich in ferric hydroxides reduce the arsenic concentration but in arid environments the evaporation process may increase the geothermal as concentration despite the presence of attenuation phenomena ormachea muñoz et al 2015 maity et al 2017 studied the distribution cycling transport fate and impact of as in taiwan s hydrothermal systems it was discovered that most of the geothermal springs were enriched with a high concentration of as maity et al 2011a 2011b analyzed the as enrichment in groundwater samples in a comparative study of bangladesh india and taiwan to find that most of the samples contained as concentrations exceeding the who recommended limit liu et al 2009 conducted a study on taiwan s mud volcanoes to assess the enrichment of as in groundwater along with the water sediment interaction arsenic has a natural origin in the subsurface strata of volcanic formations sedimentary structures and geothermal systems with tectonic activity such as turkey bangladesh taiwan and india bundschuh et al 2013 liu et al 2013 arsenic contamination is recorded from over 70 countries around 0 15 billion people worldwide face the risk of severe arsenic poisoning among which 73 arsenic affected people inhabit the south and south eastern parts of asia and the majority of arsenic poisoning cases are reported

in india high arsenic content in groundwater is mostly reported in alluvial deposits in the plain with few exceptions in hard rock terrain the middle plains of ganga in bihar up and ganga meghna brahmaputra mgb plain are also the most prominent arsenic affected area chakraborti et al 2013 more than 60 80 of tube wells contain a high concentration of arsenic in the ganga meghna brahmaputra basin bhattacharya et al 2004 shah 2014 discussed the as scenario in the whole of india in india arsenicosis was first reported in west bengal palit et al 2019 published studies from 1984 to 2002 reports that more than 125 000 samples of groundwater have been analyzed from the lower gangetic plains of west bengal around 3000 villages were found with a concentration higher than 50 ppm and 6 million peoples face a higher risk of arsenic poisoning uppal et al 2019 recent studies suggest that 40 districts out of 75 have arsenic levels exceeding the recommended value in groundwater posing a threat of arsenic poisoning to 23 4 million peoples of this state bindal and singh 2019 around 3 lakh people in the gangetic west bengal region are affected by skin lesions due to as santra and samal 2013 various organizations including government non government organizations and educational institutions are working together to provide safe potable water to populations residing in areas of west bengal affected by arsenic bhardwaj et al 2019a 2019b a study from west bengal in 2007 suggests that as levels in the potable water was 330 μg l which further elevated to 1362 μg l in 2010 shewale et al 2017 rahman et al 2014 presented a detailed report resulting from a study period of 23 years from groundwater analysis of the nadia region of west bengal and observed that excessive as was the major cause of health issues among local people santra et al 2013 and guha mazumder et al 2003 also deemed the gangetic plains of west bengal as the worst affected region of the as contamination the villagers who were affected by arsenic used drinking water from hand pumps that drain groundwater from shallow aquifers and were approximately 20 30 m deep cgwb 2012 as concentration above who recommended limits 10 μg l were found in fourteen west bengal districts maity et al 2012 the major reason for as contamination in these areas is large scale human disturbances involving the withdrawal of groundwater for irrigation during the dry season maity et al 2011a 2011b the bengal basin is highly contaminated with arsenic due to the existence of a severe reducing condition caused by a sea level rise during the holocene epoch hoque et al 2011 high as concentration in west bengal is responsible for widespread mass poisoning for the past thirty years as has been observed from most of the groundwater samples of the gangetic plain kim et al 2011 guha mazumder and dasgupta 2011 also investigated the chronic nature of as toxicity in the regions of west bengal bengal delta plain sediments

50 μg l as indian standard while 48 of samples had arsenic levels above 10 μg l who limit acharyya 2005 and acharyya et al 2000 assessed the as issue in the bengal basin de et al 2007 and pal et al 2002 analyzed the sediments of west bengal to study the presence and geochemistry of as in the region madhavan and subramanian 2007 discovered the reason for arsenicism in the states of west bengal and rajasthan and concluded that alluvium deposits from the ganges were responsible for high as in west bengal on the other hand sulfide mining in areas of rajasthan was the main reason for the high as concentration in rajasthan mandal et al 1998 surveyed five as affected families of west bengal for two years to observe the influence of safe potable water and reported an improvement in their health status the use of arsenic contaminated groundwater by the west bengal delta plains population has been a significant health concern bhattacharya et al 1997a nag et al 1996 reported as the concentration from 0 5 to 135 9 μg l from burdwan west bengal the weathering from himalayan rivers and resultant sediment contribution deposition of organic matter and low hydraulic gradients further exacerbate the as release in these areas charlet and polya 2006 singh et al 2020 reported that the regions of golaghat jorhat and lakhimpur in assam had as content above 490 ppb against the who recommended limit of 10 ppb bhardwaj et al 2019a 2019b addressed the as menace in fluvial plains of the ganga brahmaputra barak belt while patel et al 2019 studied as mobilization in the assam region a recent study conducted in barak valley assam has also reported that people are consuming arsenic contaminated water with concentrations ranging a maximum of 350 ppb arsenic in groundwater the floodplain of brahmaputra and imphal river of assam and manipur respectively were analyzed for the factors influencing as mobility in groundwater by mahanta et al 2016 thambidurai et al 2013 studied the as status in groundwater of assam chakraborti et al 2013 examined the as problem and health issues in the ganga meghna brahmaputra plains chakraborti et al 2008 assessed four of the nine districts of manipur and reported that around 63 of samples had more than 10 μg l of as uttar pradesh is also facing the as menace and the worst affected districts lie in the northeastern region of this state in the floodplains of ganga ghaghara and rapti rivers bindal and singh 2019 several studies from gonda shah 2017 bahraich mehrotra et al 2016 balia chauhan 2015 lakhimpur kheri pathak 2013 ghazipur srivastava and sharma 2013 varanasi janardhana raju 2012 districts also reported high arsenic concentration exceeding a value of 50 ppb rajnandgaon districts of chhattisgarh bhojpur district of western bihar district ballia of uttar pradesh sahibganj of jharkhand reported the first instance of excessive arsenic in groundwater which attracted the interest of people around the world chakraborti et al 2016a 2016b 2016c madhukar et al 2016 analyzed the as sources and the subsequent health issues in detail further districts such as basti ambedkar nagar ghazipur bijnaor bareli faizabad chaudauli sant ravidas nagar gorakhpur meerut siddharth nagar shahjahanpur unnao sitapur and kanpur also have as level above ten ppb namrata et al 2015 unicef and uttar pradesh jal nigam shortlisted 31 districts with a concentration exceeding ten ppb and 18 districts where the concentration of arsenic was higher than 50 ppb namrata et al 2015 saxena et al 2014 analyzed the district ghazipur of uttar pradesh for as contamination and found a level of more than 250 ppb from the village of karkatpur kumar et al 2010 also assessed the as contamination in groundwaters of ghazipur in uttar pradesh mukherjee et al 2006 reported groundwater arsenic contamination for the very first time in the year 2003 by surveying the district of ballia followed by ghazipur and varanasi with an excessive amount of groundwater arsenic ahamed et al 2006 analyzed the severe contamination and the related health risks in uttar pradesh ganga plain chakraborti et al 2016a 2016b 2016c and saha 2009 discussed the as scenario in patna and the middle plains of ganga in bihar respectively other than west bengal delta plains and gangetic plains of bihar and up several relatively small and isolated geological belts also reported arsenic above the permissible value viz bihar mica belt gondwana coal belt in rajmahal basins pyrite containing shale from proterozoic vindhyan range the gold belt of son valley and himalayan belt of darjeeling region ghosh and singh 2009 apart from the direct water intake the exposure of as in humans through food crops is also quite common in as contaminated regions of the world plant uptake arsenic in the form of arsenate arsenite and methylated as farooq et al 2016 the exposure of as in plants also leads to hampered biological and physicochemical properties resulting in loss of yield shri et al 2019 the absorption by agricultural plants is influenced by the availability of as composition water requirements soil properties and the physiological properties bhattacharya et al 2013 the agricultural land irrigated with as contaminated water has led to its accumulation in the soil and crops threatening the health of human and soil ecosystems praveen et al 2019 as enters the food chain through uptake by plants depending on its phytoavailability the contamination of soil and water with as may in turn lead to the contamination of the food chain as the crops are grown and irrigated with contaminated soil and water allowing as to enter the food chain ahsan del valls 2011 cubadda et al 2010 studied the contamination of the food chain by arsenic species in wheat crops and concluded that sandy soils had the minimum concentration of as while alluvial and organic soils had maximum as enrichment however the phytotoxicity of as was shown in maximum amount by sandy soils because of low concentrations of oxides of fe and al and clay thereby reducing as adsorption mobilization and subsequently minimizing the phytoavailability in the aquatic environment as mainly exists in inorganic forms but it is transformed into organic forms by aquatic species phytoplanktons play a significant role in the biotransformation of as and in this process of transformation accumulates a significant amount of as in itself being a major source of food these contaminated phytoplanktons transfer as to higher trophic levels where the problem is aggravated due to the process of biomagnification thus contaminating the entire food chain azizur rahman et al 2012 arsenate is generally taken up by roots through phosphate carriers while a subclass of aquaporins is responsible for arsenite uptake aquaporin lsi1 mediates the transportation of as iii and silicic acid it forms casparian strips on the plasma membranes suriyagoda et al 2018 the methylated as forms are uptaken by nip and si transporters their distribution is regulated depending upon the mobility of as forms and accumulation is in decreasing order of roots stem leaves and seeds of fruits allevato et al 2019 chakraborty et al 2014 studied the accumulation of as in food crops of the bengal delta plain including the regions of india and bangladesh due to the severity of as toxicity in the region they suggested that the accumulation and successive biomagnification of as in food crops has led to several health effects among the people residing in the area samal et al 2011 studied as contamination in the food crops grown in the nadia district of west bengal and found that two crops boro and aman rice showed the maximum concentration of as ma et al 2008 studied the accumulation of as in rice and reported two types of transporters responsible for the uptake of arsenite in rice crops rahman et al 2008 studied the problem of as accumulation in bangladesh s food crops and found that rice being the staple food is responsible for the intake of 0 20 0 35 mg day of as among the inhabitants they cited the utility of as contaminated water for irrigation as the main reason for such accumulation in rice crops in their study on as availability in soil huang et al 2006 discovered that in paddy soils as concentration increased with increasing organic and free iron content and with decreasing silt and ph value the groundwater rice and wheat crops legumes and vegetables have been reported to contain excessive as concentration in the bengal basin samal et al 2013 2 2 arsenic as groundwater contaminant over 70 countries of the world have reported as concentrations varying widely from 0 5 to 5000 ppb in groundwater ravenscroft et al 2009 groundwater contamination occurs due to the excessive discharge of arsenic from both natural and human activities natural geogenic contamination occurs as a consequence of rock weathering forest fires volcanic activity and other processes taking place naturally in the soil groundwater and surface water ali et al 2019a 2019b it is also worth noticing that aquifers in sedimentary basins neighboring the mountain belt along with recent or ancient convergent plate boundaries are enriched with arsenic mukherjee et al 2019 the sedimentary rocks contain arsenic in high concentration and aids in its mobilization into porewater and rock drain effluent biswas et al 2017 the efficient mobilization via hydraulic fracturing and propagation of arsenic in groundwater are responsible for affecting the health of a large population geothermal activity reductive dissolution sulfide oxidation and alkali desorption are the primary four reported geochemical channels responsible for the natural contamination of arsenic in groundwater shankar et al 2014 as mobility also gets affected by volcanic eruptions natural weathering process geochemical reactions biological phenomena and other anthropogenic activities maity et al 2019 the observations from previous studies imply that as levels in groundwater is influenced by several complex conditions and biogeochemical phenomena kar et al 2010 held the hydrogeochemical conditions of the region responsible for the process of release of as fe oxides or hydroxides and organic matter affected by anaerobic bacteria also influence the as mobility in subsurface systems liu et al 2011 in the himalayas and other related mountain chains arsenic is found in relatively unweathered alluvial sediments from metamorphic and igneous rocks guillot et al 2015 anthropogenic sources including fertilizers arsenical pesticides disposal of industrial and animal waste and dust from fossil fuel combustion add to the contamination of groundwater with arsenic neumann et al 2010 fig 2 presents the possible mechanism of as dissolution in groundwater as well as its cycling 2 2 1 reductive dissolution of minerals containing iron in south asia and south east asia reductive dissolution is contemplated as the most critical geochemical process for arsenic dissolution in groundwater erbs et al 2010 minerals containing iron e g arsenopyrite also may contain arsenic iron hydroxide fe oh 3 is the most common colloidal phase controlling the adsorption of as iii in the sediment while the desorption of arsenic from fe oh 3 in the presence of sedimentary organic matter leads to an excessive concentration of mobile as iii it is known as a dissimilatory reduction of iron fendorf et al 2010 this process facilitates the organic matter like buried peat bed decomposition by microbes and releases arsenic resulting in the reduction of the ferric ion to a more soluble ferrous form high ph values stimulate desorption which gives rise to high arsenic levels in the groundwater guo et al 2014 the other characteristics like hco3 po4 and alkaline ph also aids the release of inorganic species of as from the aquifer butaciu et al 2017 accumulated sulfide like h2s in sediment can also reductively dissolve arsenic bearing fe iii oas oh 2 and liberate as iii arsenic in groundwater is also introduced by the oxidation of fe iii oxide containing arsenic and sulfide oxidation gets dissolved in groundwater sediments hudson edwards and santini 2013 2 2 2 oxidation of sulfide minerals geochemical processes like oxidation of sulfide containing minerals occur in countries like ghana thailand and the usa the sulfide mineral weathering can produce acid drainage that contains toxic inorganic pollutants at a high level blowes et al 2013 as containing sulfide mineral such as realgar as4s4 arsenopyrite feass orpiment as2s3 undergo oxidation thereby contaminating the groundwater with arsenic dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and ph value of groundwater are the factors that lead to fe ii being oxidized to fe iii and adsorption of arsenic on fe oh 3 islam et al 2013 fes2 2h2o 5o2 feso4 2h2so4 in the groundwater the major portion of fe iii exist in a colloidal or solid form at neutral ph releasing and transporting as in the groundwater feass is oxidized by fe iii 10 times faster than fes2 microorganism like thiobacillus ferrooxidans can catalyze this oxidation reaction by adhesion on the mineral surface which cause weak solubilization of as v as iii and fe ii this microorganism produces fe iii ion which can oxidize the sulfide ion muehe et al 2016 the release of arsenic from feass is an extremely ph dependent process that takes place in the 1 4 6 4 ph range nordstrom 2011 2 2 3 alkali desorption alkali desorption occurs in alluvium as well as bedrock aquifers of argentina the usa and china this reaction occurs in alkali oxic groundwater at the low iron condition aerobic and near neutral condition arsenic is very strongly adsorbed by oxide mineral as the ph increase above 8 5 arsenic gets desorbed from the oxide surface this process increases the arsenic in groundwater gonzalez rodriguez et al 2019 2 2 4 geothermal activity geothermal activity can also induce the arsenic release process in areas like yellowstone national park in the usa chile china and new zealand lord et al 2012 the source of heat for the thermal activity may be a magmatic activity metamorphism radioactive source and faulting arsenic cycling starts with the collision of tectonic plates of the earth s crust in the subduction zone and the formation of volcanic fluid or magma in the course of rising magma towards the surface they leach arsenic from the continental crust because of the very high geothermal gradient bundschuh and maity 2015 the fe oxyhydroxide reduction or oxidation of sulfide from alluvial sediments is responsible for arsenic dissolution in groundwater of india and bangladesh while as acquires mobility at high ph 8 9 5 due to desorption from metal oxyhydroxides leading to high as concentrations in groundwater of argentina bundschuh et al 2017 explained that the chilean and mexican groundwaters the appalachian highland of north eastern ohio the carson desert nevada the mountains of pacific in north western washington the interior plains of south dakota and arizona also undergo similar mechanisms resulting in high groundwater as concentration 2 2 5 microbial activity the mobilization of as is also influenced by metal reducing anaerobic bacteria to a significant extent islam et al 2013 the methanogens and other bacteria remain active in anoxic conditions of groundwater and aids in the release of as in several ways shewanella alga which is an iron reducing bacterium dissolves feooh facilitating the mobilization of as from ferric arsenate and sorption sites of sediment another microbe named mit 13 converts as v to relatively as iii enhancing the release of as in groundwater other organisms like geospirillum barnesii are capable of reducing both fe iii and as v thereby facilitating adsorption of as on iron oxides promoting as mobilization dowling et al 2002 2 2 6 role of organic matter the presence of organic matter also significantly influences the as mobility in the groundwater the organic matter dissolved in the groundwater acts as a source of carbon stimulating the reductive dissolution by microbes the major processes that help in as release involving organic matter include adsorption competition complexation and electron shuttling malik et al 2020 the organic matter acts as the main source of electron donor thereby controlling the reductive processes and hence mobilizing as in the groundwater organic matter is generally introduced mainly through agrochemicals such as pesticides insecticides herbicides that contribute towards the reductive environment of the groundwater system huq et al 2020 as adsorbed on feooh organic matter free as ferrous compounds arsenopyrite asfes o2 h2o as feooh h2o as adsorbed on feooh free as w ali et al 2019a 2019b 2 3 toxicity and health effect by arsenic 2 3 1 mechanism of toxicity the major exposure route of arsenic in the human body is water zhao and babatunde 2011 in humans after being absorbed in the body arsenic passes through the bloodstream and binds with the globin protein of hemoglobin it gets redistributed in organs like the liver kidney lung gastrointestinal tract khan and ho 2011 metabolism plays a significant part in arsenic toxicity in both animals and humans the mechanism relies on the arsenic species involved for instance as v can replace phosphate by ionic substitution process and affect the well being of organisms while as iii acts as an inhibitor for enzyme function by reacting with the sh group present in enzyme and protein that will lead to the low acetyl coenzyme a production and also reduces the gluconeogenesis and oxidation of fatty acid hughes et al 2011 it will result in gene amplification disruption of cellular respiration and disturbance in oxidative phosphorylation this will lead to excessive production of reactive species like peroxide hydroxyl radical reactive nitrogen species and peroxyl radicals which may cause genotoxicity signal transduction inhibition of dna repairs cell proliferation and inhibit the formation of antioxidants chouhan and flora 2010 kitchin and conolly 2010 wu et al 2016 arsenic can cause cancer due to genetic alterations hubaux et al 2013 2 3 2 health impacts the distribution of arsenic as in the environment and its toxicity is a severe problem that affects millions of humans worldwide bhattacharya et al 2007 arsenic is considered the king of poisons as it is referred to as carcinogen mutagen and teratogen sanjrani et al 2019 its ability to cause epidemic like health issues in a massive population makes it a significant concern in today s world a vast amount of literature regarding the health impacts of as contamination has been published by jain and ali 2000 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharyya et al 2003 duker et al 2005 jones 2007 chakraborti et al 2011a 2011b guha mazumder and dasgupta 2011 sun and quicksall 2016 nath 2018 uppal et al 2019 discussed the issues associated with as toxicity including skin cancer gangrene leucomelonisis hyperkeratosis skin lesions hyperpigmentation hepatomegaly arsenicosis carcinoma non pitting edema blackfoot and so on large populations across the globe are exposed to as toxicity through the consumption of as rich water and seafood it has also been noticed that consumption of as even at low levels increases the threat of contracting cancer kim et al 2011 ghosh and mukhopadhyay 2018 children face greater risk as they drink a larger amount of water per unit of body weight higher levels of arsenic upon exposure may cause diarrhea stomach pain vomiting and disrupted nerve function with the sensation of pins and needles in the feet and hands deformations in the skin including wart like growths on either palms or soles caussey and who 2005 the impact of arsenicosis over a large population in vast areas of china compelled the government to declare it as an endemic in the country sun 2004 arsenicosis related dermatosis is quite evident in the population of nepal exposed to groundwater contaminated with as shrestha et al 2003 maity et al 2012 analyzed two peri urban villages of west bengal to find the relation between as concentration and skin lesions to find a direct relation between high as concentration in the groundwater of the region and skin problems keratosis melanosis and chronic bronchitis chakraborti et al 2013 reported issues of skin lesions as neuropathy and reproductive disorders from floodplains of the ganga meghna brahmaputra region 825 of 3500 residents of rajapur village of west bengal were found to be suffering from skin lesions as a result of highly contaminated groundwater in the region rahman et al 2005a 2005b ravenscroft et al 2001 described the consequence of as poisoning as the worst poisoning of human history some studies also demonstrate that malnutrition may enhance the susceptibility for as toxicity for instance the citizens of chile and taiwan with low socio economic and poor nutritional conditions were exposed to the threat of arsenic induced diseases samal et al 2013 the past decades have witnessed an increase in the mortality related to bladder cancer due to exposure to as contaminated water in chile fernández et al 2012 several research works have been published in this regard taking into account various models and calculations of health risk indices hri hazard quotients hq chronic daily intake cdi average total dose atd and cancer risk cr singh and ghosh 2012 kumar et al 2016 a simplified bioaccessiblility extraction test sbet for estimating health risk assessment caused by arsenic was developed by das et al 2013 ahsan et al 2006 used a multidisciplinary approach called health effects of arsenic longitudinal study heals for assessing the impact of arsenic exposure on the health of people inhabiting the araihazar region of bangladesh similarly karimi et al 2018 investigated the health risk of as in potable water of baluchistan and sistan of iran applying indices of excess lifetime cancer risk elcr and hazard quotient hq while rasool et al 2015 used the usepa method for the risk assessment of as in water of gujrat in pakistan ehsan et al 2020 described the hi health indices and hq hazard quotient of as in potable water and suggested that if the value of both hq and hi is less than 1 then it is considered non carcinogenic while if the value is exceeding 1 then it may cause adverse carcinogenic effects they studied the shiekhupura region of punjab pakistan where both the hq and hi values exceeded the safe criteria for dermal exposure kumar et al 2016 assessed the health risk index hri of as and other elements by estimating the ratio between cdi chronic daily intake and rfdo reference oral dose in the bihar region via food and water consumption and found that the hri value exceeded the safe limit of 1 in potable water rice and vegetable samples threatening the population to as poisoning goswami et al 2020 assessed the cri cancer risk indices for the as exposure in the majuli region of assam where cri was 43 percent for more than 1 in 100 exposed people while 80 percent for more than 1 in 1000 exposed people thereby exceeding the safe limit of 1 in 1 000 000 zhang et al 2019 studied the carcinogenic risk in district jinghui of china using a model of daily dermal absorbed dose mg kg day in their study they found that children were more susceptible to as related health disorders with risk factor exceeding 3 5 times the acceptable limits which was mainly caused by oral exposure 2 4 removal techniques of arsenic from groundwater the severe and widespread groundwater arsenic contamination has subsequently led to increased awareness of the removal methods of these contaminants a huge number of removal techniques had been discovered through extensive studies which are discussed as follows 2 4 1 membrane technology the study by sen et al 2010 used a system of integrated membrane hybrid treatment to remove the arsenic from groundwater and observed that successful purification of arsenic contaminated groundwater could be done by composite flat sheet membranes composed of polyamide in a cross flow membrane module by pre oxidizing all as iii to as v figoli et al 2010 used two commercial nanofiltration membranes for remediating pentavalent arsenic on a laboratory scale from synthetic water sato et al 2002 used nanofiltration membranes to find that the removal efficiency of as v was 85 uddin et al 2007 suggested that arsenite oxidation to arsenate is essential for effective remediation of as by nanofiltration technique kabir and chowdhury 2017 proposed that 65 of as can be remediated by ultrafiltration using chitosan and dissolved organic matter but it failed to curtail as levels below 10 μg l 2 4 2 chemical precipitation and coagulation as removal from water using precipitation coprecipitation method with aluminum sulfate and coagulation and filtration method in usa and bangladesh were determined by bilicibaskan and pala 2010 and wickramasinghe et al 2004 respectively the study demonstrated that coagulation by ferric ions and subsequent filtration significantly reduces as levels in the studied water sample cui et al 2015 also studied the comparative behavior of mono and poly ferric sulfate and found that poly ferric sulfate was more efficient for removing arsenic than monoferric sulfate mohora et al 2014 used the continuous electrocoagulation flocculation ecf technique for the remediation of as from natural organic matter enriched groundwater they reported that the ecf reactor at the optimum operational conditions removed 93 of arsenic from groundwater yoshizuka et al 2010 used magnetite as an adsorption material for the as remediation from groundwater from conducted an analytical study of as in geothermal systems from selected sites in kyushu japan the highest adsorption of arsenic was obtained in the neutral ph region hering et al 1997 used alum ferric chloride for the remediation of as to find that as v removal was effective within the ph range of 8 while alum was not found effective in as iii removal 2 4 3 adsorption process maji et al 2008 proposed laterite soil as an effective adsorbent for groundwater arsenic removal maji et al 2011 reported that the adsorbent property of iron oxide coated natural rock iocnr was comparable with the commercially available adsorbent lewatit fo36 for the remediating arsenic from groundwater sample collected from the north eastern region of taiwan chowdhury et al 2011 reported that at a low ph range magnetite maghemite nanoparticles could adsorb as iii and as v camacho et al 2011 analyzed the impact of mno2 modification of clinoptilolite calcium zeolite adsorbents and suggested that it is more efficient in arsenic removal from relative to the unmodified zeolite glocheux et al 2013 reported 3 to 5 times higher adsorption capacity of acid treated laterite by product as compared to untreated laterite bhattacharyya et al 2003 also supported the usage of natural adsorbents like laterite in the mitigation of as menace a study by aredes et al 2012 on the remediation of arsenic from aqueous media by natural minerals of iron oxide demonstrated that iron rich laterite was quite useful for remediating arsenic followed by minerals like goethite magnetite and hematite hao et al 2018 also published a review on iron based adsorbents for remediation of as and found that overall it proved to be an effective adsorbent asere et al 2019 provided a detailed review on applying modified natural adsorbents for the effective remediation of the as from water samples 2 4 4 ion exchange process hybridized ix fibers with ferric oxide nanoparticles were used by greenleaf et al 2006 for arsenic remediation vagliasindi and benjamin 1998 investigated the removal of as by using strong resin anion exchange and observed that considerable changes in the as speciation occurred during the process aiding as remediation awual et al 2013 used anion exchange adsorbents with a weak base for the effective remediation of as v in another study bui et al 2019 used hybrid resin anion exchange with zirconium molybdate for the remediation of as v from water samples 2 4 5 biological treatment method kao et al 2013 reported the use of arsenite oxidizing bacterium for removing arsenic from groundwater the oxidation of as iii to as v by bacteria followed by trapping and removal of as v into bacterial biomass is a potentially effective and cost efficient technology for remediating as iii contaminated groundwater fazi et al 2016 published a review discussing the effectiveness of combined chemical and biological treatment methods for the remediation of as from natural systems samal et al 2004 applied microalgal strains for as removal to find that mixed culture was most efficient for removal with maximum removal during their exponential phase crognale et al 2017 also succeeded in the remediation of as by combining microorganisms with the biogeochemical processes associated with the cycling of as maity et al 2011a 2011b also used bacterial strains to study as removal and concluded that bacterial activity helps in mobilization of as in as iii which is more toxic for biotic life mukherjee et al 2014 isolated two strains of fungi to study their efficiency in as removal and discovered that 50 76 percent of as was potentially removed maity et al 2019 applied natural and synthesized magnetic material to remove as from contaminated water using humic acid and bacillus pasteurii maity et al 2020 assessed the various adsorption membrane filtration precipitation coagulation flocculation oxidation methods combining the physical chemical and biological aspects of as removal and suggested that eco friendly biological processes like the use of microbes and phytoremediation techniques can help in decontamination of soil and water a wide variety of prokaryotes such as pseudomonas agrobacterium and alcaligenes have also been used for detoxification of as these microbes facilitate oxidation of as iii to less toxic as v while the lithotrophs use as iii as an electron donor mazumder et al 2020 2 4 6 alternative water resource with low or no concentration of as the risk of as contamination to the population can be reduced by identification of low or no as contaminated aquifer this can be carried out by the use of color of the sediment as the tool for identification of as safe aquifer sasmit 2014 the color of sediment indicates the redox status and therefore also gives the idea of arsenic presence or absence in the groundwater the four color code of sediment is usually used varying from black white off white and red where black represents the highest risk of as contamination and red represent the lowest risk of as contamination in the aquifer sasmit 2014 3 fluoride 3 1 occurrence fluoride is a vital component in minerals like fluorspar mica rock phosphate apatite fluorite and cryolite topaz and others fluoride banerjee 2015 the fluorine minerals are most abundant in igneous rocks mineralized veins and sedimentary formations ali et al 2016 fluoride contaminated groundwater has come up as the main concern across the globe in the past years the intake of f through contaminated groundwater results in health issues like fluorosis dental and skeletal in humans as reported in various studies it is present in abundant quantity in the crust and is mobile at a higher temperature selinus et al 2013 fluoride belongs to the category of substance with significant positive and negative impacts by the presence of both lower 0 6 mg l as well as higher 1 2 mg l limits in potable water fluoride as low as 1 5 mg l induces mottled enamel or dental fluorosis and a high concentration of more than 3 0 mg l results in skeletal fluorosis dar et al 2011 in groundwater fluoride amounts from trace levels to over 25 mg l naturally the solubility of fluorite present in minerals influence the amount of fluoride in aquifers thereby enriching the groundwater with high fluoride content the groundwater with a high tds value contains sodium and chloride as major ions and elevated sodium content increases the ionic strength ultimately increasing the fluoride solubility parvaiz et al 2021 with the increasing industrialization water bodies with excessive concentrations of fluoride are arising as a major issue bibi et al 2017 according to world health organization 1984 estimate groundwater f concentration exceeding 1 5 mg l is affecting a population of 260 million across the globe banerjee 2015 studies suggest that permanent teeth caries are the most prevalent health outcome with 350 million adults and 486 million children suffering from the same world health organization 2002 fluoride is among such ions that cause health problems for people residing in over 25 nations the issue of groundwater contamination with fluoride has been studied by several researchers around the world kimambo et al 2019 the maximum number of people suffering from impacts of an excessive amount of fluoride in groundwater inhabit the tropical areas where the water intake per capita is relatively higher due to the natural climate in places such as ghana people consume more amount of water 3 4 l surpassing the who criteria of 2 l per adult day brindha and elango 2011 as per who 2010 estimates around 260 million people face the consequence of excessive fluoride levels 1 5 mg l globally the contamination of fluoride is quite pronounced in the continents of africa and asia with fluoride levels ranging between 20 and 79 2 ppm raj and shahi 2017 rasool et al 2017 the reason for the high fluoride level is mainly geogenic including contributions from fluoride containing rocks and the presence of apatite mineral countries like israel canada germany indonesia turkey iran ethiopia sri lanka china also reported excessive groundwater fluoride ali et al 2016 since 1935 the levels of fluoride ranging from 0 05 to 13 ppm has given rise to the problem of fluorosis in south africa ncube and schutte 2005 in the north central area of sri lanka chronic kidney diseases are prevalent due to the excessive fluoride present in drinking as well as irrigational water dharmaratne 2015 the citizens of ghana are also prone to fluorosis as people living in tropical countries like ghana consume more water because of the prevailing environment which ultimately results in more fluoride and fluorosis problem about 80 of the people living in the ethiopian rift valley consume a high concentration of fluoride rango et al 2010 a review on fluoride status of 29 main cities of pakistan was conducted and results indicated that 34 percent of the city samples had fluoride concentration with a mean value exceeding 1 5 mg l where quetta mailsi tehsil and lahore had the highest values of 24 48 23 60 and 5 5 mg l respectively rasool et al 2017 sivasankar et al 2016 studied the chemistry and mechanism of contamination of fluoride karimi et al 2018 discussed the fluoride contamination in the groundwater of iran khair et al 2014 analyzed the geochemistry of fluoride along with arsenic in china ijumulana et al 2020 applied spatial analysis together with gis to assess the fluoride scenario in tanzania while sawangjang et al 2019 selected thailand as a study area table 2 presents the distribution of fluoride fig 3 shows the fluoride affected areas of the world the excessive withdrawal of groundwater has led to an increase in the f content in india which results mainly from the primary rock weathering and leaching from fluoride containing minerals in soils usually related to low calcium concentration and excess bicarbonate ions ayoob and gupta 2006 groundwater contamination with fluoride is widely prevalent in india affecting the health of its citizens critically studies suggest that 14 of the total geogenic f is found in india indicating the geogenic origin of fluoride contamination in india mukherjee 2018 nineteen states and 184 districts of india have fluoride levels above the recommended value of 1 5 ppm as per the study of the central ground water board cgwb 2017 with 62 million individuals facing the threat of fluoride contamination in india a rise in the frequency of fluorosis has been reported mukherjee and singh 2018 singh et al 2018 presented a detailed review of the distribution and contamination of fluoride in plants soil and water in the indian context adimalla and qian 2019 studied the issue of fluoride contamination in the central region of telangana and reported high levels of fluoride 2 mg l about 57 percent of groundwater samples of the medak district of telangana were found to be unfit for drinking due to high fluoride contamination reaching up to 7 4 mg l narsimha and sudarshan 2018 aravinthasamy et al 2019 studied the f contamination in the shanmuganadhi river basin and reported that 23 of the samples of groundwater had f levels exceeding 1 5 mg l and was unfit for consumption sudarshan et al 2018 studied the contamination and geochemical behavior of f in groundwater of markapur region andhra pradesh high f contamination was reported from the groundwater of hyderabad and guntur districts situated in andhra pradesh because of granitic rock type alkaline environment and fluvial sediment deposits hallett et al 2015 rao et al 2014 studied the groundwater samples from andhra pradesh to find the levels of fluoride ranging from trace amounts to 9 75 mg l brindha et al 2011 reported high groundwater fluoride in district nalgonda in andhra pradesh because of the weathering of rock and evaporation of groundwater the source of fluoride was alluvial sand deposits of the geological past kumar and saxena 2011 another study from district krishnagiri of tamil nadu suggested that 58 of samples contained high fluoride levels manikandan et al 2014 singaraja et al 2014 also selected a district named thoothukudi of tamil nadu to assess the fluoride contamination and found levels as high as 3 3 mg l in the bijapur district 55 out of 65 samples showed fluoride concentration above the drinking water permissible limit ugran et al 2017 in the tumkur and kolar districts of karnataka 70 of samples analyzed were reported with high fluoride concentration mamatha and rao 2010 similarly fluoride contamination is prevalent in the lateritic region of india such as in alleppy town in kerala 50 of the sample reported were poor quality raj and shaji 2017 in kerala the fluoride concentration ranged from 0 06 to 4 33 mg l with the maximum concentration at village karegaon 4 33 mg l narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b kundu et al 2001 reported a high level of groundwater f in nayagarh district orissa because of fluoride enriched hot spring water the quality of groundwater is deteriorating in the industrial region of angul district orissa because of hydrogeochemical conditions reza and singh 2013 a high concentration of f is also reported in rohtas district bihar delhi mehsana district north gujrat bellary district karnataka palghat district kerala and granitic and amphibolite aquifers of chandidongri district madhya pradesh subba rao et al 2016 chakraborti et al 2016a 2016b 2016c studied the fluoride and arsenic endemic districts of india to understand the fate of the inhabitants residing in the affected region ali et al 2018 and gupta and misra 2018 discussed the fluoride problem in haryana along with its health implications the western part of haryana is detected by high fluoride along with the nitrate above the permissible limit which indicates the possibility of anthropogenic fluoride enrichment in groundwater ali et al 2018 the fluoride and nitrate problem in the south western region of punjab was analyzed by sharma et al 2016 to find that fluoride levels as high as 10 6 mg l have been discovered from bathinda and faridkot districts of punjab the groundwater of dongargaon in chhattisgarh was found unsuitable for drinking although it could be used for irrigational purposes due to high fluoride levels sahu et al 2017 samal et al 2015 assessed the spread of fluoride contamination in lateritic districts of purulia and bankura in west bengal samal et al 2015 studied the problem of fluoride contamination in water samples of the lateritic region of west bengal and also provided an insight into the process of bioaccumulation through successive fluoride accumulation in soil and food crops kundu and mandal 2009 analyzed the water samples of west bengal to assess the fluoride contamination to find 2 27 percent of samples exceeded the normal fluoride levels leading to fluorosis in the inhabitants of the study area the major cause of fluoride contamination was intensive agriculture in the area the high fluoride contamination in groundwaters of areas surrounding the dwarka river basin in west bengal has also been reported thapa et al 2017 only 17 of the total samples had fluoride within the who criteria of 1 0 1 5 mg l while 67 had a lower fluoride level p kumar et al 2017a 2017b and gupta et al 2005 assessed the fluoride enrichment scenario in gujarat singh and mukherjee 2015 analyzed the geochemistry of groundwater contaminated with fluoride in rajasthan hussain et al 2012a 2012b reported that 32 of people out of 44 sampling places in central rajasthan consuming 4 ppm fluoride every day nawa situated in the nagaur district of rajasthan was studied for fluoride contamination together with associated health implications where groundwater is used as the chief source of potable water the result showed that thirteen habitations 30 had fluoride levels exceeding 1 5 mg l hussain et al 2012a 2012b avishek et al 2010 analyzed 840 samples in garwa district jharkhand and found that 402 samples had fluoride levels above the permissible limit b nayak et al 2009a 2009b reported an excessive amount of fluoride in the behrait block of jharkhand in uttar pradesh state and central government and several researchers reported fluoride in groundwater and hence the occurrence of fluorosis a range of 0 32 3 5 ppm is also reported in the banda district singh 2016 which makes this area very prone to fluorosis groundwater analysis in the alluvial plain of ganga saidabad mathura district indicated that the dug well shallow aquifer had a higher concentration of fluoride than the bore well deep aquifer janardhana raju 2012 groundwater fluoride concentration above the permissible value was reported in the sonbhadra district by nandimandalam 2012 which was mainly originated from the apatite and biotite mica present in the aquifer material jha et al 2010 reported a maximum of 13 9 ppm of groundwater fluoride with a mean of 4 02 ppm in the unnao district causing severe fluorosis problems in 80 of villagers of the area gupta et al 1999 selected kheragarh tehsil of agra to analyze the groundwater quality and reported that 48 of 658 samples analyzed surpassed the permissible value of 1 5 ppm 3 2 fluoride as groundwater contaminant geogenic input is the prime source of fluoride in groundwater the chemical constitution of water rock water interaction evapotranspiration long residence time limits the fluoride solubility su et al 2013 fluoride geochemistry in groundwater is also limited by high sodium fluorite solubility alkaline ph and low concentration of calcium in rock nahco3 increases caf2 solubility caf2 2nahco3 caco3 2na 2f h2o co2 the relationship between fluoride calcium and bicarbonate is denoted by the equation given above edmunds and smedley 2013a water with a fluoride level of more than 5 ppm is considered as oversaturated concerning fluorite which in turn accelerates its solubility aluminum al and ph level also affect the f levels in groundwater as al forms strong complexes with fluoride at ph less than 5 f is completely complexed with al and forms alf2 complex as a result free fluoride concentration decreases in groundwater highly evolved magma forms fluoride mineral rich rock of plagioclase composition enriched with sodium than calcium it results in fluoride rich groundwater with high sodium soft water ozsvath 2009 in some cases it is seen that high nitrate concentration is directly associated with high f in the groundwater reddy et al 2010 both humid tropicals and arid regions are prone to high fluoride content owing to their respective leaching and prolonged water mineral interactions higher temperature also leads to high fluoride levels edmunds and smedley 2013 overall the physical chemical and geological environment of the aquifer temperature porosity depth of the aquifer the acidity of rocks and weathering intensity influence the fluoride concentration in groundwater several mechanisms aid the release of fluoride into groundwater such as the ph dependent dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals ionic concentrations aquifer recharge conditions residence and contact time fluoride is introduced in the soil as well as groundwater through the natural process of weathering of rocks and anthropogenic sources including phosphate fertilizers having fluoride as an impurity kanduti et al 2016 fig 4 presents the possible mechanism of fluoride dissolution and its cycling in groundwater 3 2 1 ph dependent dissolution of fluoride containing minerals the minerals like pegmatite granite and granite gneisses contain fluorite caf2 that is responsible for the addition of fluoride in groundwater fluoride in water may either exist independently or in complex forms consequently getting precipitated as fluorite the alkaline environment is highly suitable for fluoride dissolution as fluoride is readily adsorbed in acidic and desorbed in an alkaline environment raj and shaji 2017 3 2 2 aqueous ionic concentrations the groundwater ionic composition plays a vital role in fluoride solubility viz presence of high sodium bicarbonate concentration in groundwater would result in high fluoride dissociation malago 2017 fluoride behaves specifically towards the majority of anions and can easily be replaced under normal conditions of temperature and pressure fluoride f can replace hydroxide ion oh within the mineral structure due to having a similar ionic size and charge as seen in mica muscovite and biotite and clay minerals banerjee 2015 kmg3 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kmg3 alsi3o10 oh 2 2f biotite phlogopite kal3 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kmg3 alsi3o10 oh 2 2f muscovite phlogopite 3 3 contact time of rock water interactions the dissolution of minerals such as amphiboles muscovite and hornblende in the groundwater as a result of the longer residence time of the slow moving groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 arveti et al 2011 3 3 1 aquifer recharge atmospheric fluorides can easily reach the groundwater zone from the surface through aquifer recharge zones brindha et al 2011 3 3 2 fluoride mobilization via carbonate and bicarbonate groundwater contains carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 ions these anions control the mobility of fluoride hco3 shows a higher affinity towards ca and forms caco3 than f to form caf2 an excessive amount of hco3 dissolves more caf2 into groundwater it forms caco3 and releases fluoride in groundwater mukherjee and singh et al 2020 caf2 co3 2 caco3 2f caf2 2hco3 caco3 2f co2 h2o 3 4 toxicity and health effect by fluoride 3 4 1 mechanism of toxicity fluoride is extremely electronegative and hence aims to acquire a negative charge that further gets converted to fluoride ions in solutions an acidic environment like that of the stomach transforms fluoride into hydrogen fluoride hf consuming about 40 of ingested fluoride the tiny neutrally charged molecule of hf is can rapidly penetrate cell membranes enhancing the chances of intracellular intake barbier et al 2010 the other significant mechanism related to fluoride toxicity is oxidative stress the saturation of natural antioxidant defense mechanism by the excessive formation of reactive species of oxygen and nitrogen ros and rns is termed oxidative stress maritim et al 2003 f is believed to inhibit the activities of antioxidant enzymes like catalase superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase the cellular system is protected against lipid peroxidation and its toxic effects by an enzyme called reduced glutathione gsh in contrast tissues are protected from the extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals by catalase cat which is a heme protein that helps in hydrogen peroxide degradation oxidative stress resulting from fluoride toxicity cause reduced activity of these enzymes giri et al 2016 3 4 2 health impact and risk assessment fluoride consumption via groundwater is similar to a two edged knife due to the health effects caused by both high as well as low concentrations the low concentration of fluoride ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 ppm is necessary for the human system as it is useful in avoiding dental caries bone development mineralization and enamel development of teeth in contrast the intake of a high amount of fluoride can cause serious health concerns like fluorosis singh et al 2013 it forms a protective crystalline structure around the enamel fluorosis leads to dental caries enamel formation bone fragility bilateral lameness and stiffness edmunds and smedley 2013b fluoride replaces the hydroxyapatite also called crystalline calcium phosphate 87 which is the first compound found in tooth enamel it forms fluorapatite by displacing the hydroxide ion in hydroxyapatite chronic exposure makes the tooth hard and brittle this is called dental fluorosis viswanathan et al 2010 prolonged subjection to a high amount of fluoride 4 ppm can cause calcification in bones resulting in the formation of osteoporosis and osteosclerosis joshi et al 2011 barbier et al 2010 designated fluoride as the culprit for disturbed intracellular redox homeostasis oxidative stress apoptosis protein carbonyl content lipid peroxidation and modified expressions of genes of the stress response cell cell communications metabolic enzymes cell cycle and signal transduction minerals such as apatite topaz fluorite fluorspar mica get weathered through the natural process of adding fluoride to soils moreover several industries mainly glass and ceramic industries fertilizer steel aluminum zinc smelting industries also contribute towards fluoride contamination of soils this bioaccumulation leads to the contamination of the food chain in addition to the drinking water route causing a larger risk of fluorosis particularly to infants and children bhattacharya and samal 2018 in the jilin region of china widespread fluorosis was observed specifically in children and expecting mothers from drinking water contaminated with excessive fluoride 1 0 mg l zhang et al 2003 blinkhorn and mekertichian 2013 and o mullane et al 2016 presented a detailed discussion of fluoride and dental health badeenezhad et al 2020 observed that a low dosage of fluoride leads to the problem of dental fluorosis due to low fluoride levels in the groundwater of iran fordyce 2011 and 2018 also described the f impact on human health to find the rise in the cases of fluorosis patil et al 2018 also discussed the curse of fluorosis as skeletal non skeletal and dental fluorosis the walawe river basin in the southern region of sri lanka is also reported to be affected by dental fluorosis ali et al 2016 the value of 1 5 mg l world health organization 1984 was surpassed by 27 samples from singhpur and sagaragan villages of orissa with an average value of around 7 ppm giving rise to the cases of fluorosis in singhpur but not in sagaragan kundu et al 2001 the children of dharmanagar tripura are at high risk of dental fluorosis due to contaminated groundwater in the area bhattacharya et al 2020 the study from the southern regions of punjab also demonstrated similar results fluoride concentration ranging from 2 5 to 4 0 mg l in groundwater was found in about 50 of sampling locations with few sites exceeding 5 0 mg l villages of barnala were found to have the maximum health risk for both adults and children ahada and suthar 2019 the studies from the groundwater of siddipet area medak district of telangana reported fluoride concentration of 0 2 2 2 mg l with approximately 22 of the samples exceeding the recommended limit 1 5 mg l causing endemic dental fluorosis narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b dental and skeletal fluorosis is most prevalent in the villages such as madhuri rohiniyadamar neruiyadamar kunrwa and gobardaha of district sonbhadra in uttar pradesh in the fluoride contaminated villages health implications like the bending of the spinal column deformation of ligaments aging problem and mottling of teeth have threatened both the minor and adult population the other affected villages with high fluoride content 1 39 2 06 mg 1 include charakpatli lohrakholi and tumiya raju et al 2009 many health index models have been used for researchers for fluoride risk assessment as well amalraj and pius 2013 applied the community fluorosis index cfi for studying the effects of fluoride using dean s classification in tamil nadu of india karunanidhi et al 2019 also used the usepa method for the health risk analysis of f in the river basin of shanmuganadhi in south india alarcon herrera et al 2001 used the dean index di of fluorosis for the assessment of risk in the well water samples of the guadiana valley of mexico another popular index associated with fluorosis is the dmft decayed missing filled teeth index which is one of the important tools in the field of dental epidemiology several researchers have conducted an extensive study in this field correlating the excessive levels of fluoride with the dmft index including bischoff et al 1976 li et al 2019 evaluated the cancer risk for the f exposure through the consumption of drinking water in the northwestern part of china and suggested that children were at higher risk of f toxicity with a health risk value with an average of 1 51 while that of adults was within the acceptable range with an average of 0 42 bhattacharya et al 2017 assessed the hazard index hi for the children of west bengal and discovered that they were at high risk of dental fluorosis due to exposure to fluoride contaminated water soil and crops mohanta et al 2020 investigated the non cancer risk by applying the usepa method by using a fuzzy based index in gharwar village of dhanbad in india the fhi fuzzy hazard index revealed that 10 out of 20 samples were in the risk category for fluoride while the remaining ten samples were in the safe category adimalla 2019 also applied the usepa method for the non carcinogenic risk analysis for f and no3 2 in groundwater of southern india and observed that 67 65 of the total samples for men 79 41 for women and 82 35 for children exceeded the safe limit of 1 rashid et al 2020 discovered a community fluorosis index cfi for investing the health risk exposure in the dargai area of pakistan a value above 0 6 indicated community fluorosis the results suggested that all the endemic as well as control regions exceeded the safe limit of 0 6 chen et al 2017a 2017b calculated the risk values in the inhabitants of the dawukou region of china for the combined exposure of as and f in groundwater samples they used the triangular fuzzy numbers approach and discovered that while the risk values of f were mostly less than 1 risk values of as in all samples exceeded the safe limit das et al 2018 stated that the co occurrence of as f and u in the brahmaputra floodplain has a non significant risk of cancer on the population but children were exposed to greater threat followed by adult males and females rasool et al 2015 applied the usepa method and calculated the estimated daily intake edi and target hazard quotient thq for as and f co occurrence in pakistan and found that the values after analysis surpassed the safe limit 1 in the groundwater samples of the study area 3 5 fluoride contamination removal techniques there are multiple traditional removal techniques of fluoride from groundwater like coagulation reverse osmosis adsorption nano filtration ion exchange precipitation and electrochemical methods available from earlier studies maity et al 2018 among these the processes of membrane and ion exchange are not extremely popular because of their high establishment and cost waghmare and arfin 2015 each fluoride removal technique has its benefits and operational limitations as each technology has some limitations the site specific treatment process as per local requirements and prevailing conditions would be effective singh et al 2013 some of them are discussed below 3 5 1 coagulation and precipitation method yinfang 2011 treated wastewater containing 10 ppm of fluoride ion by coagulation and precipitation the effects of treatment conditions on the treatment of fluoride enriched wastewater were examined and the optimum treatment process was followed using aluminum sulfate as a coagulator the amount of f in wastewater decreased to below one ppm gong et al 2012 investigated the effect of complexation of aluminum fluoride on fluoride removal by coagulation of al salts through batch experiments it was demonstrated that a new al f oh coprecipitate was formed in the coagulation process that was effective in fluoride removal by co precipitation atasoy et al 2013 used raw modified bauxite for removing as and f from contaminated groundwater and observed that fluoride contamination 3 ppm could be reduced to the acceptable limit of 1 5 ppm by b mg 500 singh et al 2013 precipitated fluoride by the use of chlorine alkali aluminum chloride or aluminum sulfate or both and found that it was an effective fluoride remediation technique 3 5 2 membrane process tahaikt et al 2007 conducted fluoride removal on groundwater through the use of a nanofiltration plant containing two modules and observed that after double pass the fluoride in the product water was reduced to an acceptable value boubakri et al 2014 studied fluoride removal through direct contact membrane distillation dcmd by a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane pvdf from aqueous media and found that the dcmd process produced almost fluoride free water ghosh et al 2013 prepared ceramic membranes by uniaxial and paste methods and observed that the fluoride concentration depleted rapidly with time and after 35 min reached below the recommendable limit i e 1 mg l 3 5 3 ion exchange process alkan et al 2008 studied fluoride removal by the donnan dialysis method with plasma modified afx membranes anion exchange it was seen that fluoride removal was most efficient with afx plasma modified membrane allowing effective fluoride removal as compared to the pristine afx membrane samatya et al 2007 used la3 al3 and zro2 exchanged zeolite to assess the fluoride sorption properties of the sorbents the metal loaded zeolite had a fluoride removal efficiency of 94 from a solution containing 2 5 mg f l jamhour 2005 used an ion exchanger zirconium iv oxide ethanolamine zro ea for selective removal of fluoride ions to find that zro ea exchanger is an effective substance for a water treatment process that complies with the maximum contaminate concentration for fluoride ion in drinking water chakrabortty et al 2013 succeeded in removing 98 of fluoride using a cross flow polyamide nanofiltration membrane from groundwater the ph of the water was also reduced to a suitable level 3 5 4 electro coagulation ec process behbahani et al 2011 in their research applied response surface methodology and assessed the cost and effect of chief operational factors including current density initial fluoride level reaction time and initial ph for fluoride remediation by electrocoagulation the effect of initial ph on the suitability and cost of fluoride removal was negligible the decline in initial fluoride levels improved fluoride removal efficiency without any impact on operating costs mahvi et al 2012 assessed the remediation of fluoride from solutions through the electrocoagulation process applying fe and al electrodes and revealed that an electric potential of 40 v had the most significant remediation of fluoride thus the remediation of fluoride from water and wastewater can be carried out effectively and economically by the electrocoagulation process palahouane et al 2015 studied an electrocoagulation technique using sheets of aluminum as an electrode to remediate fluoride ions from wastewater the results suggest effective removal can be attained if the electrocoagulation is applied to wastewater post treatment 3 5 5 adsorption process tembhurkar and dongre 2006 estimated the potential of activated charcoal commercially available to remediate fluoride contaminated water undertook batch adsorption studies the result showed that the suitable sorbent dose was 2 0 g 100 ml while equilibrium was reached in 2 h and increased adsorption occurred at ph 2 and maximum fluoride removal at optimum conditions was 94 chen et al 2010 developed a new granular ceramic media for fluoride remediation it was seen that this media in the remediation process upheld the water quality without allowing the leaching of aluminum or ferric ions from the adsorbents therefore this new material proved to be promising for fluoride remediation from aqueous media islamuddin et al 2016 used coconut husk for the defluoridation of water and succeeded in removing 86 of fluoride chidambaram et al 2003 used natural substances such as charcoal serpentine red soil fly ash and brick for effective fluoride removal yadav et al 2013 used sawdust wheat straw and activated bagasse sugarcane carbon for remediating fluoride from artificial as well as natural groundwater samples they concluded that an acceptable amount of fluoride could be acquired in the neutral ph range with the help of these adsorbents which makes them suitable for utilization in drinking water treatment especially in rural areas where facilities are minimal ganvir and das 2011 used aluminum coated rice husk ash rha for remediating fluoride from groundwater and the result indicated the linear proportion of fluoride removal with the quantity of rha coated hence the coated rha can be effectively stepped up to a filtration unit device for practical use maity et al 2018 used bacterial surfactin mediated nano hydroxyapatite as an adsorbent for fluoride removal and concluded that this novel technique can be used for pollution control 4 co occurrence of arsenic and fluoride the existence of as and f in samples of groundwater suggests a common source or path of contamination for both the elements which can be supported by the reports of a positive correlation rasool et al 2015 the most common contributions of as and f are natural sources for instance arsenic mobilization involves changes in redox conditions in contrast reducing conditions are more favorable for the fe release which in turn contributes to the addition of arsenic in groundwater the geogenic release of fluoride as a contaminant is generally dependent on rock water interaction bibi et al 2017 however a high recharge discharge rate proves to be a hindrance to the proximity between the groundwater and the aquifer materials kumar et al 2016 water rock interaction is considered as the leading cause for as and f contamination which may further be accelerated because of geothermal and mining activities and by over exploitation of aquifers multi element enrichment of nutrients in groundwater systems is an emerging concern their cooccurrences can lead to an enhanced effect through various complex synergistic antagonistic interactions patel et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 reported that co occurrence of as f undergo several combined and complex interactions with the groundwater and can have severe health impacts as compared to their individual impacts laboratory experiments suggest fe hydroxides be the major source of as and f as it has a high affinity for f as well as as oxyanions bundschuh et al 2017 the deposition of newer sediments and the recharge conditions controlled by the river plays a significant role in governing the concentration of as and f das et al 2016 alarcón herrera et al 2013 suggested a direct proportion between a high concentration of as and f specifically in arid regions the separate toxic effects of both the contaminants have been studied intensively yet few studies focus on their co occurrences and simultaneous treatment options kumar et al 2020 elaborated the anthropogenic activities like irrigation return flow mining extraction recharge and agrochemicals as the major contributing source of as and f co occurrence kumar et al 2016 studied the occurrence of both as and f in diphu district of assam arsenic and fluoride presence in punjab pakistan by rasool et al 2015 while the semi arid zones of latin america were assessed for the combined occurrence of as and f by alarcón herrera et al 2013 reyes gómez et al 2013 studied the rocks sediments and groundwater for their geochemical properties of mexican aquifers to analyze as and f co occurrence and found them to be of geogenic origin kumar et al 2016 studied the combined occurrence of as and f in the brahmaputra floodplains of assam and found that the isolated aquifers characterized by low recharge rates could have high f levels and hence co occurrence is possible due to oxidizing conditions chen et al 2017a 2017b analyzed the provenance of as and f contaminants in groundwater of dawukou region northwest china where residents depend on groundwater as a drinking water source and the results suggested that the feebly alkaline conditions influenced their concentration in groundwater by the dissolution and precipitation of arsenate and fluorite ca the shallow groundwater had a relatively higher concentration of as and f chandrajith et al 2020 reported as f co occurrence in sri lanka and reported over 80 percent of the population use groundwater for drinking and suffered from fluorosis while arsenic was limited to sedimentary aquifers and was not a critical concern toolabi et al 2020 studied the groundwater of iran to find that both as and f exceeded their permissible limits 4 1 toxicity and health by arsenic fluoride co occurrence the impact of arsenic fluoride co exposure was studied extensively by researchers who suggested that dentine and dental tissues do not accumulate a significant amount of as and f however nervous damage including decreased learning ability and memory are also attributed to the coupled exposure to as and f mishra et al 2010 have reported the effect of combined arsenic fluoride exposure in the form of abnormal histology of cerebral hemisphere with arsenic exerting more pronounced effect than fluoride the individual impact of as and f are less predominant as compared to the genotoxic effects of their integrated exposure arsenic can aggravate the toxicity of fluoride through synergistic pathways rao and tiwari 2006 several studies conducted on experimental animals have also observed that combined as and f exposure damages the rat brain decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and increases lipid peroxidation birkner et al 2008 das et al 2018 studied the origin distribution and health implications of as f co occurrence together with uranium in the brahmaputra river flood plain aquifers and observed that children face a greater threat of associated diseases than adults due to their larger water intake to body weight ratio and underdeveloped physiology sariñana ruiz et al 2017 assessed environmental and health risk factors and observed that bioavailability of arsenic was predominant in the gastric phase while that of fluoride was prominent in the intestinal phase of arsenic and fluoride necessitating the urge for continuous ecology and human health monitoring in the endemic region of comarca lagunera of mexico bhattacharya et al 2020 reported a high risk of severe chronic toxicity as indicated by the high cumulative noncancerous lifetime hazard index value for as and f in the dharmanagar region tripura kumar et al 2020 reported that huge population from china india and pakistan suffer from as f co occurrence as the corrosive hydrofluoric acid weakens the bone while arsenic leads to arsenicosis maity et al 2021 studied the global impact of as f co occurrence and reported malignancies and fluorosis mainly in south asian countries 4 2 removal techniques of arsenic fluoride from groundwater researchers who studied the concurrent of arsenic and fluoride remediation include sandoval et al 2019 who used a flow reactor composed of aluminum for the electro coagulating f and as simultaneously from groundwater they observed that the concentrations of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater 5 5 mg l and arsenic 0 054 mg l depleted and met with the who standards post the process of electrocoagulation saikia et al 2017 attempted remediation of arsenic and fluoride using a surface methodology from an aqueous solution by activated biochar and found it to be a favorable cost effective and eco friendly adsorbent due to the multiple active adsorption sites and larger specific surface area qiao et al 2014 simultaneously removed arsenate and fluoride from water by using al fe hydroxides to find that arsenate adsorption on al fe hydroxides depended strongly on ph with increased adsorption at higher ph the concurrent removal of as v and f was also studied by jing et al 2012 who developed an adsorbent with oxides of ti and la on activated carbon tlac and found it to be more effective than commercial adsorbents thakur and mondal 2017 used electrocoagulation using the aluminum electrode for simultaneous remediation of as and f from samples along with the effects of run time current density the distance between electrodes initial ph and nacl levels on the percentage remediation and economic aspects the suitable experimental conditions in the result were found as initial ph 7 a current density of 10 a m2 and so on for removal of approximately 98 arsenic and 88 33 fluoride the treated water had arsenic and fluoride concentrations of 8 19 μg l and 1 4 mg l respectively costing about 0 357 usd m3 treated water deeming it to be an effective method for simultaneous as and f removal from water samples patel et al 2019 studied as f contamination in assam and discovered that fe hydroxides play an important role in adsorption of as and f from water hence can be used in remediation haldar et al 2020 used metal organic framework to trap arsenic and fluoride from water samples in order to purify the water from these contaminants 5 conclusion the deterioration of groundwater quality is a global issue arsenic and fluoride are two important contaminants of groundwater in varied regions of the world studies have reported that arsenic contamination has spread over 70 countries the major countries facing the issue of arsenic contamination are east asia and south east asia in india the worst affected regions include the gangetic plains of west bengal ganga plains of uttar pradesh as well as bihar the important mechanisms that release as in the groundwater are reductive dissolution of minerals containing iron oxidation of sulfide minerals alkali desorption geothermal activity and action of microbes and organic matter among this reductive dissolution of minerals containing iron is a dominant process for the indo gangetic belt consumption of water contaminated with arsenic may lead to multiple health disorders including cancer melanosis keratosis and arsenicosis the major arsenic removal techniques are the use of membrane technology ion exchange process chemical precipitation and coagulation adsorption and biological treatment methods the other important groundwater contaminant i e fluoride is mostly contributed through geogenic sources fluoride contamination has been reported from south korea pakistan afghanistan vietnam and malaysia in india 14 states have reported fluoride contamination these include uttar pradesh bihar andhra pradesh madhya pradesh rajasthan gujarat tamil nadu and punjab the major factors influencing the groundwater fluoride include dissolution of fluoride rich minerals the contribution from aquifer recharge and mobilization via carbonate and bicarbonate within the aquifer it can cause fluorosis leading to dental caries bone fragility and stiffness the major fluoride removal techniques are the use of membrane technology chemical precipitation and coagulation adsorption ion exchange process and electro coagulation process the combined occurrence of as and f discussed in distinguished studies may have a synergistic or antagonistic effect on health further studies are significant for the better knowledge of the mechanisms behind the co occurrence and the co removal of these two pollutants from the groundwater the over exploitation of groundwater without minding the recharging potential of aquifers can be one of the major factors behind the increase in the arsenic contamination zones this problem could only be resolved by an integrated effort of the people and the policy makers as well people need increased awareness about the hazards of such indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater and the policy makers should also make provision for strict rules and regulations to check the depletion of groundwater resources the proper mapping of contaminated wells is required to reduce the health implications related to the contamination of as and f the research on the development of economically viable remedial techniques for the arsenic and fluoride remediation from the groundwater should be promoted such technologies will encourage providing safe water to the population inhabiting arsenic and fluoride affected areas declaration of competing interest the authors

population of more than 200 million from 25 countries is facing the problem of fluorosis a disease associated with the intake of fluoride contaminated groundwater khatri and tyagi 2015 although fluoride is present in food air and water yet the major route of exposure is through drinking water vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 fluoride is known to affect the bones teeth skeletal muscles and nervous system the most common symptoms of fluoride poisoning are salivation nausea diarrhea and abdominal pain chouhan and flora 2010 the high fluoride uptake has led to several socio economic problems as well as a large number of boreholes have been abandoned due to groundwater contaminated with fluoride kimambo et al 2019 according to a study at least 25 countries worldwide face endemic

al 2008 electro coagulation process behbahani et al 2011 and adsorption process tembhurkar and dongre 2006 due to the seriousness of this problem these two contaminants need immediate attention to restrict their rising threat in the near future this review aims at assessing the overall scenario of occurrence and co occurrence mechanism and pathways of dissolution its health impacts and mitigation measures as well from the past studies and present scenarios the problem of groundwater as and f in groundwater can be checked by the better knowledge of the sources and contributing mechanisms this study would compile the past and present studies to find a solution to the growing menace of as and f contamination in groundwater 2 arsenic 2 1 occurrence arsenic as is the 33rd element in the periodic table the elemental arsenic concentration in the crust ranges from 1 5 to 2 ppm elemental arsenic appears as a grayish metallic solid it is mostly found in combination with oxygen sulfur and chlorine atsdr 2007 hence arsenic is more commonly found in groundwater originating from minerals like arsenopyrite feass realgar as2s2 orpiment as2s3 and iron pyrites fes2 nikolopoulos and panagiotaras 2015 arsenic is extensively used in electronics metallurgy medicine agriculture livestock feed etc groundwater mainly contains arsenic in the form of arsenite aso3 3 as iii and arsenate aso4 3 as v which can be interconverted through an oxidation reduction process maji et al 2011 as v dominates in the oxidative environment while as iii dominates in reducing the environment zhu et al 2019 the as iii toxicity is 100 times more than that of arsenate which is sparingly soluble in water and hence less bioavailable sarkar and paul 2016 in biological systems the dominant forms of organic arsenic include monomethyl arsonic acid mma ch3aso oh 2 arsenobetaine ab c5h11aso2 dimethyl arsinic acid dma ch3 2aso oh and arsenoribosides arsenic sugars as sug whose solubility is dependent on the ph and ionic environment mandal and suzuki 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 thus arsenic occurs in several forms that are influenced by factors like ph and redox potential of groundwater the degree of toxicity of an arsenic compound is a factor of its valence state physical properties solubility absorption and removal rate kumar et al 2010 the most widespread arsenic contamination is in the unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers or metasedimentary bedrocks of the wells as reported from different regions of the globe including china argentina mexico cambodia england vietnam and india indo gangetic plains suggesting a geogenic origin of as ayotte et al 2003 kim et al 2012 before the year 2000 arsenic contamination was mainly reported from groundwater of asian countries namely bangladesh india and china but with the progress of time the arsenic contamination status around the world changed significantly particularly in these asian countries from 2000 to 2005 arsenic related problems spread in new regions of china mongolia cambodia nepal myanmar korea pakistan afghanistan western iran and vietnam mukherjee et al 2006 arsenic enriched water arising from hydrothermal springs also impacts the downstream surface as well as groundwater mixing along with associated biogeochemical processes which are subsequently affected by the changes in temperature redox conditions ph and pressure such impacts can deteriorate these resources making them unfit for drinking or irrigation purposes without proper treatment maity et al 2017 in the case of geothermal water discharge dilution and adsorption on sediments of a stream rich in ferric hydroxides reduce the arsenic concentration but in arid environments the evaporation process may increase the geothermal as concentration despite the presence of attenuation phenomena ormachea muñoz et al 2015 maity et al 2017 studied the distribution cycling transport fate and impact of as in taiwan s hydrothermal systems it was discovered that most of the geothermal springs were enriched with a high concentration of as maity et al 2011a 2011b analyzed the as enrichment in groundwater samples in a comparative study of bangladesh india and taiwan to find that most of the samples contained as concentrations exceeding the who recommended limit liu et al 2009 conducted a study on taiwan s mud volcanoes to assess the enrichment of as in groundwater along with the water sediment interaction arsenic has a natural origin in the subsurface strata of volcanic formations sedimentary structures and geothermal systems with tectonic activity such as turkey bangladesh taiwan and india bundschuh et al 2013 liu et al 2013 arsenic contamination is recorded from over 70 countries around 0 15 billion people worldwide face the risk of severe arsenic poisoning among which 73 arsenic affected people inhabit the south and south eastern parts of asia and the majority of arsenic poisoning cases are reported from bangladesh chakraborti et al 2015 sikdar 2018 the past decades have witnessed some of the significant instances of groundwater arsenic contamination in mexico bangladesh xinjiang and inner mongolia in china argentina chile and taiwan sarkar and paul 2016 rahnamarad et al 2020a 2020b studied the problem of as contamination in iran the as status of cambodia was assessed by richards et al

in india high arsenic content in groundwater is mostly reported in alluvial deposits in the plain with few exceptions in hard rock terrain the middle plains of ganga in bihar up and ganga meghna brahmaputra mgb plain are also the most prominent arsenic affected area chakraborti et al 2013 more than 60 80 of tube wells contain a high concentration of arsenic in the ganga meghna brahmaputra basin bhattacharya et al 2004 shah 2014 discussed the as scenario in the whole of india in india arsenicosis was first reported in west bengal palit et al 2019 published studies from 1984 to 2002 reports that more than 125 000 samples of groundwater have been analyzed from the lower gangetic plains of west bengal around 3000 villages were found with a concentration higher than 50 ppm and 6 million peoples face a higher risk of arsenic poisoning uppal et al 2019 recent studies suggest that 40 districts out of 75 have arsenic levels exceeding the recommended value in groundwater posing a threat of arsenic poisoning to 23 4 million peoples of this state bindal and singh 2019 around 3 lakh people in the gangetic west bengal region are affected by skin lesions due to as santra and samal 2013 various organizations including government non government organizations and educational institutions are working together to provide safe potable water to populations residing in areas of west bengal affected by arsenic bhardwaj et al 2019a 2019b a study from west bengal in 2007 suggests that as levels in the potable water was 330 μg l which further elevated to 1362 μg l in 2010 shewale et al 2017 rahman et al 2014 presented a detailed report resulting from a study period of 23 years from groundwater analysis of the nadia region of west bengal and observed that excessive as was the major cause of health issues among local people santra et al 2013 and guha mazumder et al 2003 also deemed the gangetic plains of west bengal as the worst affected region of the as contamination the villagers who were affected by arsenic used drinking water from hand pumps that drain groundwater from shallow aquifers and were approximately 20 30 m deep cgwb 2012 as concentration above who recommended limits 10 μg l were found in fourteen west bengal districts maity et al 2012 the major reason for as contamination in these areas is large scale human disturbances involving the withdrawal of groundwater for irrigation during the dry season maity et al 2011a 2011b the bengal basin is highly contaminated with arsenic due to the existence of a severe reducing condition caused by a sea level rise during the holocene epoch hoque et al 2011 high as concentration in west bengal is responsible for widespread mass poisoning for the past thirty years as has been observed from most of the groundwater samples of the gangetic plain kim et al 2011 guha mazumder and dasgupta 2011 also investigated the chronic nature of as toxicity in the regions of west bengal bengal delta plain sediments

50 μg l as indian standard while 48 of samples had arsenic levels above 10 μg l who limit acharyya 2005 and acharyya et al 2000 assessed the as issue in the bengal basin de et al 2007 and pal et al 2002 analyzed the sediments of west bengal to study the presence and geochemistry of as in the region madhavan and subramanian 2007 discovered the reason for arsenicism in the states of west bengal and rajasthan and concluded that alluvium deposits from the ganges were responsible for high as in west bengal on the other hand sulfide mining in areas of rajasthan was the main reason for the high as concentration in rajasthan mandal et al 1998 surveyed five as affected families of west bengal for two years to observe the influence of safe potable water and reported an improvement in their health status the use of arsenic contaminated groundwater by the west bengal delta plains population has been a significant health concern bhattacharya et al 1997a nag et al 1996 reported as the concentration from 0 5 to 135 9 μg l from burdwan west bengal the weathering from himalayan rivers and resultant sediment contribution deposition of organic matter and low hydraulic gradients further exacerbate the as release in these areas charlet and polya 2006 singh et al 2020 reported that the regions of golaghat jorhat and lakhimpur in assam had as content above 490 ppb against the who recommended limit of 10 ppb bhardwaj et al 2019a 2019b addressed the as menace in fluvial plains of the ganga brahmaputra barak belt while patel et al 2019 studied as mobilization in the assam region a recent study conducted in barak valley assam has also reported that people are consuming arsenic contaminated water with concentrations ranging a maximum of 350 ppb arsenic in groundwater the floodplain of brahmaputra and imphal river of assam and manipur respectively were analyzed for the factors influencing as mobility in groundwater by mahanta et al 2016 thambidurai et al 2013 studied the as status in groundwater of assam chakraborti et al 2013 examined the as problem and health issues in the ganga meghna brahmaputra plains chakraborti et al 2008 assessed four of the nine districts of manipur and reported that around 63 of samples had more than 10 μg l of as uttar pradesh is also facing the as menace and the worst affected districts lie in the northeastern region of this state in the floodplains of ganga ghaghara and rapti rivers bindal and singh 2019 several studies from gonda shah 2017 bahraich mehrotra et al 2016 balia chauhan 2015 lakhimpur kheri pathak 2013 ghazipur srivastava and sharma 2013 varanasi janardhana raju 2012 districts also reported high arsenic concentration exceeding a value of 50 ppb rajnandgaon districts of chhattisgarh bhojpur district of western bihar district ballia of uttar pradesh sahibganj of jharkhand reported the first instance of excessive arsenic in groundwater which attracted the interest of people around the world chakraborti et al 2016a 2016b 2016c madhukar et al 2016 analyzed the as sources and the subsequent health issues in detail further districts such as basti ambedkar nagar ghazipur bijnaor bareli faizabad chaudauli sant ravidas nagar gorakhpur meerut siddharth nagar shahjahanpur unnao sitapur and kanpur also have as level above ten ppb namrata et al 2015 unicef and uttar pradesh jal nigam shortlisted 31 districts with a concentration exceeding ten ppb and 18 districts where the concentration of arsenic was higher than 50 ppb namrata et al 2015 saxena et al 2014 analyzed the district

uttar pradesh mukherjee et al 2006 reported groundwater arsenic contamination for the very first time in the year 2003 by surveying the district of ballia followed by ghazipur and varanasi with an excessive amount of groundwater arsenic ahamed et al 2006 analyzed the severe contamination and the related health risks in uttar pradesh ganga plain chakraborti et al 2016a 2016b 2016c and saha 2009 discussed the as scenario in patna and the middle plains of ganga in bihar respectively other than west bengal delta plains and gangetic plains of bihar and up several relatively small and isolated geological belts also reported arsenic above the permissible value viz bihar mica belt gondwana coal belt in rajmahal basins pyrite containing shale from proterozoic vindhyan range the gold belt of son valley and himalayan belt of darjeeling region ghosh and singh 2009 apart from the direct water intake the exposure of as in humans through food crops is also quite common in as contaminated regions of the world plant uptake arsenic in the form of arsenate arsenite and methylated as farooq et al 2016 the exposure of as in plants also leads to hampered biological and physicochemical properties resulting in loss of yield shri et al 2019 the absorption by agricultural plants is influenced by the availability of as composition water requirements soil properties and the physiological properties bhattacharya et al 2013 the agricultural land irrigated with as contaminated water has led to its accumulation in the soil and crops threatening the health of human and soil ecosystems praveen et al 2019 as enters the food chain through uptake by plants depending on its phytoavailability the contamination of soil and water with as may in turn lead to the contamination of the food chain as the crops are grown and irrigated with contaminated soil and water allowing as to enter the food chain ahsan del valls 2011 cubadda et al 2010 studied the contamination of the food chain by arsenic species in wheat crops and concluded that sandy soils had the minimum concentration of as while alluvial and organic soils had maximum as enrichment however the phytotoxicity of as was shown in maximum amount by sandy soils because of low concentrations of oxides of fe and al and clay thereby reducing as adsorption mobilization and subsequently minimizing the phytoavailability in the aquatic environment as mainly exists in inorganic forms but it is transformed into organic forms by aquatic species phytoplanktons play a significant role in the biotransformation of as and in this process of transformation accumulates a significant amount of as in itself being a major source of food these contaminated phytoplanktons transfer as to higher trophic levels where the problem is aggravated due to the process of biomagnification thus contaminating the entire food chain azizur rahman et al 2012 arsenate is generally taken up by roots through phosphate carriers while a subclass of aquaporins is responsible for arsenite uptake aquaporin lsi1 mediates the transportation of as iii and silicic acid it forms casparian strips on the plasma membranes suriyagoda et al 2018 the methylated as forms are uptaken by nip and si transporters their distribution is regulated depending upon the mobility of as forms and accumulation is in decreasing order of roots stem leaves and seeds of fruits allevato et al 2019 chakraborty et al 2014 studied the accumulation of as in food crops of the bengal delta plain including the regions of india and bangladesh due to the severity of as toxicity in the region they suggested that the accumulation and successive biomagnification of as in food crops has led to several health effects among the people residing in the area samal et al 2011 studied as contamination in the food crops grown in the nadia district of west bengal and found that two crops boro and aman rice showed the maximum concentration of as ma et al 2008 studied the accumulation of as in rice and reported two types of transporters responsible for the uptake of arsenite in rice crops rahman et al 2008 studied the problem of as accumulation in bangladesh s food crops and found that rice being the staple food is responsible for the intake of 0 20 0 35 mg day of as among the inhabitants they cited the utility of as contaminated water for irrigation as the main reason for such accumulation in rice crops in their study on as availability in soil huang et al 2006 discovered that in paddy soils as concentration increased with increasing organic and free iron content and with decreasing silt and ph value the groundwater rice and wheat crops legumes and vegetables have been reported to contain excessive as concentration in the bengal basin samal et al 2013 2 2 arsenic as groundwater contaminant over 70 countries of the world have reported as concentrations varying widely from 0 5 to 5000 ppb in groundwater ravenscroft et al 2009 groundwater contamination occurs due to the excessive discharge of arsenic from both natural and human activities natural geogenic contamination occurs as a consequence of rock weathering forest fires volcanic activity and other processes taking place naturally in the soil groundwater and surface water ali et al 2019a 2019b it is also worth noticing that aquifers in sedimentary basins neighboring the mountain belt along with recent or ancient convergent plate boundaries are enriched with arsenic mukherjee et al 2019 the sedimentary rocks contain arsenic in high concentration and aids in its mobilization into porewater and rock drain effluent biswas et al 2017 the efficient mobilization via hydraulic fracturing and propagation of arsenic in groundwater are responsible for affecting the health of a large population geothermal activity reductive dissolution sulfide oxidation and alkali desorption are the primary four reported geochemical channels responsible for the natural contamination of arsenic in groundwater shankar et al 2014 as mobility also gets affected by volcanic eruptions natural weathering process geochemical reactions biological phenomena and other anthropogenic activities maity et al 2019 the observations from previous studies imply that as levels in groundwater is influenced by several complex conditions and biogeochemical phenomena kar et al 2010 held the hydrogeochemical conditions of the region responsible for the process of release of as fe oxides or hydroxides and organic matter affected by anaerobic bacteria also influence the as mobility in subsurface systems liu et al 2011 in the himalayas and other related mountain chains arsenic is found in relatively unweathered alluvial sediments from metamorphic and igneous rocks guillot et al 2015 anthropogenic sources including fertilizers arsenical pesticides disposal of industrial and animal waste and dust from fossil fuel combustion add to the contamination of groundwater with arsenic neumann et al 2010 fig 2 presents the possible mechanism of as dissolution in groundwater as well as its cycling 2 2 1 reductive dissolution of minerals containing iron in south asia and south east asia reductive dissolution is contemplated as the most critical geochemical process for arsenic dissolution in groundwater erbs et al 2010 minerals containing iron e g arsenopyrite also may contain arsenic iron hydroxide fe oh 3 is the most common colloidal phase controlling the adsorption of as iii in the sediment while the desorption of arsenic from fe oh 3 in the presence of sedimentary organic matter leads to an excessive concentration of mobile as iii it is known as a dissimilatory reduction of iron fendorf et al 2010 this process facilitates the organic matter like buried peat bed decomposition by microbes and releases arsenic resulting in the reduction of the ferric ion to a more soluble ferrous form high ph values stimulate desorption which gives rise to high arsenic levels in the groundwater guo et al 2014 the other characteristics like hco3 po4 and alkaline ph also aids the release of inorganic species of as from the aquifer butaciu et al 2017 accumulated sulfide like h2s in sediment can also reductively dissolve arsenic bearing fe iii oas oh 2 and liberate as iii arsenic in groundwater is also introduced by the oxidation of fe iii oxide containing arsenic and sulfide oxidation gets dissolved in groundwater sediments hudson edwards and santini 2013 2 2 2 oxidation of sulfide minerals geochemical processes like oxidation of sulfide containing minerals occur in countries like ghana thailand and the usa the sulfide mineral weathering can produce acid drainage that contains toxic inorganic pollutants at a high level blowes et al 2013 as containing sulfide mineral such as realgar as4s4 arsenopyrite feass orpiment as2s3 undergo oxidation thereby contaminating the groundwater with arsenic dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and ph value of groundwater are the factors that lead to fe ii being oxidized to fe iii and adsorption of arsenic on fe oh 3 islam et al 2013 fes2 2h2o 5o2 feso4 2h2so4 in the groundwater the major portion of fe iii exist in a colloidal or solid form at neutral ph releasing and transporting as in the groundwater feass is oxidized by fe iii 10 times faster than fes2 microorganism like thiobacillus ferrooxidans can catalyze this oxidation reaction by adhesion on the mineral surface which cause weak solubilization of as v as iii and fe ii this microorganism produces fe iii ion which can oxidize the sulfide ion muehe et al 2016 the release of arsenic from feass is an extremely ph dependent process that takes place in the 1 4 6 4 ph range nordstrom 2011 2 2 3 alkali desorption alkali desorption occurs in alluvium as well as bedrock aquifers of argentina the usa and china this reaction occurs in alkali oxic groundwater at the low iron condition aerobic and near neutral condition arsenic is very strongly adsorbed by oxide mineral as the ph increase above 8 5 arsenic gets desorbed from the oxide surface this process increases the arsenic in groundwater gonzalez rodriguez et al 2019 2 2 4 geothermal activity geothermal activity can also induce the arsenic release process in areas like yellowstone national park in the usa chile china and new zealand lord et al 2012 the source of heat for the thermal activity may be a magmatic activity metamorphism radioactive source and faulting arsenic cycling starts with the collision of tectonic plates of the earth s crust in the subduction zone and the formation of volcanic fluid or magma in the course of rising magma towards the surface they leach arsenic from the continental crust because of the very high geothermal gradient bundschuh and maity 2015 the fe oxyhydroxide reduction or oxidation of sulfide from alluvial sediments is responsible for arsenic dissolution in groundwater of india and bangladesh while as acquires mobility at high ph 8 9 5 due to desorption from metal oxyhydroxides leading to high as concentrations in groundwater of argentina bundschuh et al 2017 explained that the chilean and mexican groundwaters the appalachian highland of north eastern ohio the carson desert nevada the mountains of pacific in north western washington the interior plains of south dakota and arizona also undergo similar mechanisms resulting in high groundwater as concentration 2 2 5 microbial activity the mobilization of as is also influenced by metal reducing anaerobic bacteria to a significant extent islam et al 2013 the methanogens and other bacteria remain active in anoxic conditions of groundwater and aids in the release of as in several ways shewanella alga which is an iron reducing bacterium dissolves feooh facilitating the mobilization of as from ferric arsenate and sorption sites of sediment another microbe named mit 13 converts as v to relatively as iii enhancing the release of as in groundwater other organisms like geospirillum barnesii are capable of reducing both fe iii and as v thereby facilitating adsorption of as on iron oxides promoting as mobilization dowling et al 2002 2 2 6 role of organic matter the presence of organic matter also significantly influences the as mobility in the groundwater the organic matter dissolved in the groundwater acts as a source of carbon stimulating the reductive dissolution by microbes the major processes that help in as release involving organic matter include adsorption competition complexation and electron shuttling malik et al 2020 the organic matter acts as the main source of electron donor thereby controlling the reductive processes and hence mobilizing as in the groundwater organic matter is generally introduced mainly through agrochemicals such as pesticides insecticides herbicides that contribute towards the reductive environment of the groundwater system huq et al 2020 as adsorbed on feooh organic matter free as ferrous compounds arsenopyrite asfes o2 h2o as feooh h2o as adsorbed on feooh free as w ali et al 2019a 2019b 2 3 toxicity and health effect by arsenic 2 3 1 mechanism of toxicity the major exposure route of arsenic in the human body is water zhao and babatunde 2011 in humans after being absorbed in the body arsenic passes through the bloodstream and binds with the globin protein of hemoglobin it gets redistributed in organs like the liver kidney lung gastrointestinal tract khan and ho 2011 metabolism plays a significant part in arsenic toxicity in both animals and humans the mechanism relies on the arsenic species involved for instance as v can replace phosphate by ionic substitution process and affect the well being of organisms while as iii acts as an inhibitor for enzyme function by reacting with the sh group present in enzyme and protein that will lead to the low acetyl coenzyme a production and also reduces the gluconeogenesis and oxidation of fatty acid hughes et al 2011 it will result in gene amplification disruption of cellular respiration and disturbance in oxidative phosphorylation this will lead to excessive production of reactive species like peroxide hydroxyl radical reactive nitrogen species and peroxyl radicals which may cause genotoxicity signal transduction inhibition of dna repairs cell proliferation and inhibit the formation of antioxidants chouhan and flora 2010 kitchin and conolly 2010 wu et al 2016 arsenic can cause cancer due to genetic alterations hubaux et al 2013 2 3 2 health impacts the distribution of arsenic as in the environment and its toxicity is a severe problem that affects millions of humans worldwide bhattacharya et al 2007 arsenic is considered the king of poisons as it is referred to as carcinogen mutagen and teratogen sanjrani et al 2019 its ability to cause epidemic like health issues in a massive population makes it a significant concern in today s world a vast amount of literature regarding the health impacts of as contamination has been published by jain and ali 2000 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharyya et al 2003 duker et al 2005 jones 2007 chakraborti et al 2011a 2011b guha mazumder and dasgupta 2011 sun and quicksall 2016 nath 2018 uppal et al 2019 discussed the issues associated with as toxicity including skin cancer gangrene leucomelonisis hyperkeratosis skin lesions hyperpigmentation hepatomegaly arsenicosis carcinoma non pitting edema blackfoot and so on large populations across the globe are exposed to as toxicity through the consumption of as rich water and seafood it has also been noticed that consumption of as even at low levels increases the threat of contracting cancer kim et al 2011 ghosh and mukhopadhyay 2018 children face greater risk as they drink a larger amount of water per unit of body weight higher levels of arsenic upon exposure may cause diarrhea stomach pain vomiting and disrupted nerve function with the sensation of pins and needles in the feet and hands deformations in the skin including wart like growths on either palms or soles caussey and who 2005 the impact of arsenicosis over a large population in vast areas of china compelled the government to declare it as an endemic in the country sun 2004 arsenicosis related dermatosis is quite evident in the population of nepal exposed to groundwater contaminated with as shrestha et al 2003 maity et al 2012 analyzed two peri urban villages of west bengal to find the relation between as concentration and skin lesions to find a direct relation between high as concentration in the groundwater of the region and skin problems keratosis melanosis and chronic bronchitis chakraborti et al 2013 reported issues of skin lesions as neuropathy and reproductive disorders from floodplains of the ganga meghna brahmaputra region 825 of 3500 residents of rajapur village of west bengal were found to be suffering from skin lesions as a result of highly contaminated groundwater in the region rahman et al 2005a 2005b ravenscroft et al 2001 described the consequence of as poisoning as the worst poisoning of human history some studies also demonstrate that malnutrition may enhance the susceptibility for as toxicity for instance the citizens of chile and taiwan with low socio economic and poor nutritional conditions were exposed to the threat of arsenic induced diseases samal et al 2013 the past decades have witnessed an increase in the mortality related to bladder cancer due to exposure to as contaminated water in chile fernández et al 2012 several research works have been published in this regard taking into account various models and calculations of health risk indices hri hazard quotients hq chronic daily intake cdi average total dose atd and cancer risk cr singh and ghosh 2012 kumar et al 2016 a simplified bioaccessiblility extraction test sbet for estimating health risk assessment caused by arsenic was developed by das et al 2013 ahsan et al 2006 used a multidisciplinary approach called health effects of arsenic longitudinal study heals for assessing the impact of arsenic exposure on the health of people inhabiting the araihazar region of bangladesh similarly karimi et al 2018 investigated the health risk of as in potable water of baluchistan and sistan of iran applying indices of excess lifetime cancer risk elcr and hazard quotient hq while rasool et al 2015 used the usepa method for the risk assessment of as in water of gujrat in pakistan ehsan et al 2020 described the hi health indices and hq hazard quotient of as in potable water and suggested that if the value of both hq and hi is less than 1 then it is considered non carcinogenic while if the value is exceeding 1 then it may cause adverse carcinogenic effects they studied the shiekhupura region of punjab pakistan where both the hq and hi values exceeded the safe criteria for dermal exposure kumar et al 2016 assessed the health risk index hri of as and other elements by estimating the ratio between cdi chronic daily intake and rfdo reference oral dose in the bihar region via food and water consumption and found that the hri value exceeded the safe limit of 1 in potable water rice and vegetable samples threatening the population to as poisoning goswami et al 2020 assessed the cri cancer risk indices for the as exposure in the majuli region of assam where cri was 43 percent for more than 1 in 100 exposed people while 80 percent for more than 1 in 1000 exposed people thereby exceeding the safe limit of 1 in 1 000 000 zhang et al 2019 studied the carcinogenic risk in district jinghui of china using a model of daily dermal absorbed dose mg kg day in their study they found that children were more susceptible to as related health disorders with risk factor exceeding 3 5 times the acceptable limits which was mainly caused by oral exposure 2 4 removal techniques of arsenic from groundwater the severe and widespread groundwater arsenic contamination has subsequently led to increased awareness of the removal methods of these contaminants a huge number of removal techniques had been discovered through extensive studies which are discussed as follows 2 4 1 membrane technology the study by sen et al 2010 used a system of integrated membrane hybrid treatment to remove the arsenic from groundwater and observed that successful purification of arsenic contaminated groundwater could be done by composite flat sheet membranes composed of polyamide in a cross flow membrane module by pre oxidizing all as iii to as v figoli et al 2010 used two commercial nanofiltration membranes for remediating pentavalent arsenic on a laboratory scale from synthetic water sato et al 2002 used nanofiltration membranes to find that the removal efficiency of as v was 85 uddin et al 2007 suggested that arsenite oxidation to arsenate is essential for effective remediation of as by nanofiltration technique kabir and chowdhury 2017 proposed that 65 of as can be remediated by ultrafiltration using chitosan and dissolved organic matter but it failed to curtail as levels below 10 μg l 2 4 2 chemical precipitation and coagulation as removal from water using precipitation coprecipitation method with aluminum sulfate and coagulation and filtration method in usa and bangladesh were determined by bilicibaskan and pala 2010 and wickramasinghe et al 2004 respectively the study demonstrated that coagulation by ferric ions and subsequent filtration significantly reduces as levels in the studied water sample cui et al 2015 also studied the comparative behavior of mono and poly ferric sulfate and found that poly ferric sulfate was more efficient for removing arsenic than monoferric sulfate mohora et al 2014 used the continuous electrocoagulation flocculation ecf technique for the remediation of as from natural organic matter enriched groundwater they reported that the ecf reactor at the optimum operational conditions removed 93 of arsenic from groundwater yoshizuka et al 2010 used magnetite as an adsorption material for the as remediation from groundwater from conducted an analytical study of as in geothermal systems from selected sites in kyushu japan the highest adsorption of arsenic was obtained in the neutral ph region hering et al 1997 used alum ferric chloride for the remediation of as to find that as v removal was effective within the ph range of 8 while alum was not found effective in as iii removal 2 4 3 adsorption process maji et al 2008 proposed laterite soil as an effective adsorbent for groundwater arsenic removal maji et al 2011 reported that the adsorbent property of iron oxide coated natural rock iocnr was comparable with the commercially available adsorbent lewatit fo36 for the remediating arsenic from groundwater sample collected from the north eastern region of taiwan chowdhury et al 2011 reported that at a low ph range magnetite maghemite nanoparticles could adsorb as iii and as v camacho et al 2011 analyzed the impact of mno2 modification of clinoptilolite calcium zeolite adsorbents and suggested that it is more efficient in arsenic removal from relative to the unmodified zeolite glocheux et al 2013 reported 3 to 5 times higher adsorption capacity of acid treated laterite by product as compared to untreated laterite bhattacharyya et al 2003 also supported the usage of natural adsorbents like laterite in the mitigation of as menace a study by aredes et al 2012 on the remediation of arsenic from aqueous media by natural minerals of iron oxide demonstrated that iron rich laterite was quite useful for remediating arsenic followed by minerals like goethite magnetite and hematite hao et al 2018 also published a review on iron based adsorbents for remediation of as and found that overall it proved to be an effective adsorbent asere et al 2019 provided a detailed review on applying modified natural adsorbents for the effective remediation of the as from water samples 2 4 4 ion exchange process hybridized ix fibers with ferric oxide nanoparticles were used by greenleaf et al 2006 for arsenic remediation vagliasindi and benjamin 1998 investigated the removal of as by using strong resin anion exchange and observed that considerable changes in the as speciation occurred during the process aiding as remediation awual et al 2013 used anion exchange adsorbents with a weak base for the effective remediation of as v in another study bui et al 2019 used hybrid resin anion exchange with zirconium molybdate for the remediation of as v from water samples 2 4 5 biological treatment method kao et al 2013 reported the use of arsenite oxidizing bacterium for removing arsenic from groundwater the oxidation of as iii to as v by bacteria followed by trapping and removal of as v into bacterial biomass is a potentially effective and cost efficient technology for remediating as iii contaminated groundwater fazi et al 2016 published a review discussing the effectiveness of combined chemical and biological treatment methods for the remediation of as from natural systems samal et al 2004 applied microalgal strains for as removal to find that mixed culture was most efficient for removal with maximum removal during their exponential phase crognale et al 2017 also succeeded in the remediation of as by combining microorganisms with the biogeochemical processes associated with the cycling of as maity et al 2011a 2011b also used bacterial strains to study as removal and concluded that bacterial activity helps in mobilization of as in as iii which is more toxic for biotic life mukherjee et al 2014 isolated two strains of fungi to study their efficiency in as removal and discovered that 50 76 percent of as was potentially removed maity et al 2019 applied natural and synthesized magnetic material to remove as from contaminated water using humic acid and bacillus pasteurii maity et al 2020 assessed the various adsorption membrane filtration precipitation coagulation flocculation oxidation methods combining the physical chemical and biological aspects of as removal and suggested that eco friendly biological processes like the use of microbes and phytoremediation techniques can help in decontamination of soil and water a wide variety of prokaryotes such as pseudomonas agrobacterium and alcaligenes have also been used for detoxification of as these microbes facilitate oxidation of as iii to less toxic as v while the lithotrophs use as iii as an electron donor mazumder et al 2020 2 4 6 alternative water resource with low or no concentration of as the risk of as contamination to the population can be reduced by identification of low or no as contaminated aquifer this can be carried out by the use of color of the sediment as the tool for identification of as safe aquifer sasmit 2014 the color of sediment indicates the redox status and therefore also gives the idea of arsenic presence or absence in the groundwater the four color code of sediment is usually used varying from black white off white and red where black represents the highest risk of as contamination and red represent the lowest risk of as contamination in the aquifer sasmit 2014 3 fluoride 3 1 occurrence fluoride is a vital component in minerals like fluorspar mica rock phosphate apatite fluorite and cryolite topaz and others fluoride banerjee 2015 the fluorine minerals are most abundant in igneous rocks mineralized veins and sedimentary formations ali et al 2016 fluoride contaminated groundwater has come up as the main concern across the globe in the past years the intake of f through contaminated groundwater results in health issues like fluorosis dental and skeletal in humans as reported in various studies it is present in abundant quantity in the crust and is mobile at a higher temperature selinus et al 2013 fluoride belongs to the category of substance with significant positive and negative impacts by the presence of both lower 0 6 mg l as well as higher 1 2 mg l limits in potable water fluoride as low as 1 5 mg l induces mottled enamel or dental fluorosis and a high concentration of more than 3 0 mg l results in skeletal fluorosis dar et al 2011 in groundwater fluoride amounts from trace levels to over 25 mg l naturally the solubility of fluorite present in minerals influence the amount of fluoride in aquifers thereby enriching the groundwater with high fluoride content the groundwater with a high tds value contains sodium and chloride as major ions and elevated sodium content increases the ionic strength ultimately increasing the fluoride solubility parvaiz et al 2021 with the increasing industrialization water bodies with excessive concentrations of fluoride are arising as a major issue bibi et al 2017 according to world health organization 1984 estimate groundwater f concentration exceeding 1 5 mg l is affecting a population of 260 million across the globe banerjee 2015 studies suggest that permanent teeth caries are the most prevalent health outcome with 350 million adults and 486 million children suffering from the same world health organization 2002 fluoride is among such ions that cause health problems for people residing in over 25 nations the issue of groundwater contamination with fluoride has been studied by several researchers around the world kimambo et al 2019 the maximum number of people suffering from impacts of an excessive amount of fluoride in groundwater inhabit the tropical areas where the water intake per capita is relatively higher due to the natural climate in places such as ghana people consume more amount of water 3 4 l surpassing the who criteria of 2 l per adult day brindha and elango 2011 as per who 2010 estimates around 260 million people face the consequence of excessive fluoride levels 1 5 mg l globally the contamination of fluoride is quite pronounced in the continents of africa and asia with fluoride levels ranging between 20 and 79 2 ppm raj and shahi 2017 rasool et al 2017 the reason for the high fluoride level is mainly geogenic including contributions from fluoride containing rocks and the presence of apatite mineral countries like israel canada germany indonesia turkey iran ethiopia sri lanka china also reported excessive groundwater fluoride ali et al 2016 since 1935 the levels of fluoride ranging from 0 05 to 13 ppm has given rise to the problem of fluorosis in south africa ncube and schutte 2005 in the north central area of sri lanka chronic kidney diseases are prevalent due to the excessive fluoride present in drinking as well as irrigational water dharmaratne 2015 the citizens of ghana are also prone to fluorosis as people living in tropical countries like ghana consume more water because of the prevailing environment which ultimately results in more fluoride and fluorosis problem about 80 of the people living in the ethiopian rift valley consume a high concentration of fluoride rango et al 2010 a review on fluoride status of 29 main cities of pakistan was conducted and results indicated that 34 percent of the city samples had fluoride concentration with a mean value exceeding 1 5 mg l where quetta mailsi tehsil and lahore had the highest values of 24 48 23 60 and 5 5 mg l respectively rasool et al 2017 sivasankar et al 2016 studied the chemistry and mechanism of contamination of fluoride karimi et al 2018 discussed the fluoride contamination in the groundwater of iran khair et al 2014 analyzed the geochemistry of fluoride along with arsenic in china ijumulana et al 2020 applied spatial analysis together with gis to assess the fluoride scenario in tanzania while sawangjang et al 2019 selected thailand as a study area table 2 presents the distribution of fluoride fig 3 shows the fluoride affected areas of the world the excessive withdrawal of groundwater has led to an increase in the f content in india which results mainly from the primary rock weathering and leaching from fluoride containing minerals in soils usually related to low calcium concentration and excess bicarbonate ions ayoob and gupta 2006 groundwater contamination with fluoride is widely prevalent in india affecting the health of its citizens critically studies suggest that 14 of the total geogenic f is found in india indicating the geogenic origin of fluoride contamination in india mukherjee 2018 nineteen states and 184 districts of india have fluoride levels above the recommended value of 1 5 ppm as per the study of the central ground water board cgwb 2017 with 62 million individuals facing the threat of fluoride contamination in india a rise in the frequency of fluorosis has been reported mukherjee and singh 2018 singh et al 2018 presented a detailed review of the distribution and contamination of fluoride in plants soil and water in the indian context adimalla and qian 2019 studied the issue of fluoride contamination in the central region of telangana and reported high levels of fluoride 2 mg l about 57 percent of groundwater samples of the medak district of telangana were found to be unfit for drinking due to high fluoride contamination reaching up to 7 4 mg l narsimha and sudarshan 2018 aravinthasamy et al 2019 studied the f contamination in the shanmuganadhi river basin and reported that 23 of the samples of groundwater had f levels exceeding 1 5 mg l and was unfit for consumption sudarshan et al 2018 studied the contamination and geochemical behavior of f in groundwater of markapur region andhra pradesh high f contamination was reported from the groundwater of hyderabad and guntur districts situated in andhra pradesh because of granitic rock type alkaline environment and fluvial sediment deposits hallett et al 2015 rao et al 2014 studied the groundwater samples from andhra pradesh to find the levels of fluoride ranging from trace amounts to 9 75 mg l brindha et al 2011 reported high groundwater fluoride in district nalgonda in andhra pradesh because of the weathering of rock and evaporation of groundwater the source of fluoride was alluvial sand deposits of the geological past kumar and saxena 2011 another study from district krishnagiri of tamil nadu suggested that 58 of samples contained high fluoride levels manikandan et al 2014 singaraja et al 2014 also selected a district named thoothukudi of tamil nadu to assess the fluoride contamination and found levels as high as 3 3 mg l in the bijapur district 55 out of 65 samples showed fluoride concentration above the drinking water permissible limit ugran et al 2017 in the tumkur and kolar districts of karnataka 70 of samples analyzed were reported with high fluoride concentration mamatha and rao 2010 similarly fluoride contamination is prevalent in the lateritic region of india such as in alleppy town in kerala 50 of the sample reported were poor quality raj and shaji 2017 in kerala the fluoride concentration ranged from 0 06 to 4 33 mg l with the maximum concentration at village karegaon 4 33 mg l narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b kundu et al 2001 reported a high level of groundwater f in nayagarh district orissa because of fluoride enriched hot spring water the quality of groundwater is deteriorating in the industrial region of angul district orissa because of hydrogeochemical conditions reza and singh 2013 a high concentration of f is also reported in rohtas district bihar delhi mehsana district north gujrat bellary district karnataka palghat district kerala and granitic and amphibolite aquifers of chandidongri district madhya pradesh subba rao et al 2016 chakraborti et al 2016a 2016b 2016c studied the fluoride and arsenic endemic districts of india to understand the fate of the inhabitants residing in the affected region ali et al 2018 and gupta and misra 2018 discussed the fluoride problem in haryana along with its health implications the western part of haryana is detected by high fluoride along with the nitrate above the permissible limit which indicates the possibility of anthropogenic fluoride enrichment in groundwater ali et al 2018 the fluoride and nitrate problem in the south western region of punjab was analyzed by sharma et al 2016 to find that fluoride levels as high as 10 6 mg l have been discovered from bathinda and faridkot districts of punjab the groundwater of dongargaon in chhattisgarh was found unsuitable for drinking although it could be used for irrigational purposes due to high fluoride levels sahu et al 2017 samal et al 2015 assessed the spread of fluoride contamination in lateritic districts of purulia and bankura in west bengal samal et al 2015 studied the problem of fluoride contamination in water samples of the lateritic region of west bengal and also provided an insight into the process of bioaccumulation through successive fluoride accumulation in soil and food crops kundu and mandal 2009 analyzed the water samples of west bengal to assess the fluoride contamination to find 2 27 percent of samples exceeded the normal fluoride levels leading to fluorosis in the inhabitants of the study area the major cause of fluoride contamination was intensive agriculture in the area the high fluoride contamination in groundwaters of areas surrounding the dwarka river basin in west bengal has also been reported thapa et al 2017 only 17 of the total samples had fluoride within the who criteria of 1 0 1 5 mg l while 67 had a lower fluoride level p kumar et al 2017a 2017b and gupta et al 2005 assessed the fluoride enrichment scenario in gujarat singh and mukherjee 2015 analyzed the geochemistry of groundwater contaminated with fluoride in rajasthan hussain et al 2012a 2012b reported that 32 of people out of 44 sampling places in central rajasthan consuming 4 ppm fluoride every day nawa situated in the nagaur district of rajasthan was studied for fluoride contamination together with associated health implications where groundwater is used as the chief source of potable water the result showed that thirteen habitations 30 had fluoride levels exceeding 1 5 mg l hussain et al 2012a 2012b avishek et al 2010 analyzed 840 samples in garwa district jharkhand and found that 402 samples had fluoride levels above the permissible limit b nayak et al 2009a 2009b reported an excessive amount of fluoride in the behrait block of jharkhand in uttar pradesh state and central government and several researchers reported fluoride in groundwater and hence the occurrence of fluorosis a range of 0 32 3 5 ppm is also reported in the banda district singh 2016 which makes this area very prone to fluorosis groundwater analysis in the alluvial plain of ganga saidabad mathura district indicated that the dug well shallow aquifer had a higher concentration of fluoride than the bore well deep aquifer janardhana raju 2012 groundwater fluoride concentration above the permissible value was reported in the sonbhadra district by nandimandalam 2012 which was mainly originated from the apatite and biotite mica present in the aquifer material jha et al 2010 reported a maximum of 13 9 ppm of groundwater fluoride with a mean of 4 02 ppm in the unnao district causing severe fluorosis problems in 80 of villagers of the area gupta et al 1999 selected kheragarh tehsil of agra to analyze the groundwater quality and reported that 48 of 658 samples analyzed surpassed the permissible value of 1 5 ppm 3 2 fluoride as groundwater contaminant geogenic input is the prime source of fluoride in groundwater the chemical constitution of water rock water interaction evapotranspiration long residence time limits the fluoride solubility su et al 2013 fluoride geochemistry in groundwater is also limited by high sodium fluorite solubility alkaline ph and low concentration of calcium in rock nahco3 increases caf2 solubility caf2 2nahco3 caco3 2na 2f h2o co2 the relationship between fluoride calcium and bicarbonate is denoted by the equation given above edmunds and smedley 2013a water with a fluoride level of more than 5 ppm is considered as oversaturated concerning fluorite which in turn accelerates its solubility aluminum al and ph level also affect the f levels in groundwater as al forms strong complexes with fluoride at ph less than 5 f is completely complexed with al and forms alf2 complex as a result free fluoride concentration decreases in groundwater highly evolved magma forms fluoride mineral rich rock of plagioclase composition enriched with sodium than calcium it results in fluoride rich groundwater with high sodium soft water ozsvath 2009 in some cases it is seen that high nitrate concentration is directly associated with high f in the groundwater reddy et al 2010 both humid tropicals and arid regions are prone to high fluoride content owing to their respective leaching and prolonged water mineral interactions higher temperature also leads to high fluoride levels edmunds and smedley 2013 overall the physical chemical and geological environment of the aquifer temperature porosity depth of the aquifer the acidity of rocks and weathering intensity influence the fluoride concentration in groundwater several mechanisms aid the release of fluoride into groundwater such as the ph dependent dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals ionic concentrations aquifer recharge conditions residence and contact time fluoride is introduced in the soil as well as groundwater through the natural process of weathering of rocks and anthropogenic sources including phosphate fertilizers having fluoride as an impurity kanduti et al 2016 fig 4 presents the possible mechanism of fluoride dissolution and its cycling in groundwater 3 2 1 ph dependent dissolution of fluoride containing minerals the minerals like pegmatite granite and granite gneisses contain fluorite caf2 that is responsible for the addition of fluoride in groundwater fluoride in water may either exist independently or in complex forms consequently getting precipitated as fluorite the alkaline environment is highly suitable for fluoride dissolution as fluoride is readily adsorbed in acidic and desorbed in an alkaline environment raj and shaji 2017 3 2 2 aqueous ionic concentrations the groundwater ionic composition plays a vital role in fluoride solubility viz presence of high sodium bicarbonate concentration in groundwater would result in high fluoride dissociation malago 2017 fluoride behaves specifically towards the majority of anions and can easily be replaced under normal conditions of temperature and pressure fluoride f can replace hydroxide ion oh within the mineral structure due to having a similar ionic size and charge as seen in mica muscovite and biotite and clay minerals banerjee 2015 kmg3 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kmg3 alsi3o10 oh 2 2f biotite phlogopite kal3 alsi3o10 f2 2oh kmg3 alsi3o10 oh 2 2f muscovite phlogopite 3 3 contact time of rock water interactions the dissolution of minerals such as amphiboles muscovite and hornblende in the groundwater as a result of the longer residence time of the slow moving groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 arveti et al 2011 3 3 1 aquifer recharge atmospheric fluorides can easily reach the groundwater zone from the surface through aquifer recharge zones brindha et al 2011 3 3 2 fluoride mobilization via carbonate and bicarbonate groundwater contains carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 ions these anions control the mobility of fluoride hco3 shows a higher affinity towards ca and forms caco3 than f to form caf2 an excessive amount of hco3 dissolves more caf2 into groundwater it forms caco3 and releases fluoride in groundwater mukherjee and singh et al 2020 caf2 co3 2 caco3 2f caf2 2hco3 caco3 2f co2 h2o 3 4 toxicity and health effect by fluoride 3 4 1 mechanism of toxicity fluoride is extremely electronegative and hence aims to acquire a negative charge that further gets converted to fluoride ions in solutions an acidic environment like that of the stomach transforms fluoride into hydrogen fluoride hf consuming about 40 of ingested fluoride the tiny neutrally charged molecule of hf is can rapidly penetrate cell membranes enhancing the chances of intracellular intake barbier et al 2010 the other significant mechanism related to fluoride toxicity is oxidative stress the saturation of natural antioxidant defense mechanism by the excessive formation of reactive species of oxygen and nitrogen ros and rns is termed oxidative stress maritim et al 2003 f is believed to inhibit the activities of antioxidant enzymes like catalase superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase the cellular system is protected against lipid peroxidation and its toxic effects by an enzyme called reduced glutathione gsh in contrast tissues are protected from the extremely reactive hydroxyl radicals by catalase cat which is a heme protein that helps in hydrogen peroxide degradation oxidative stress resulting from fluoride toxicity cause reduced activity of these enzymes giri et al 2016 3 4 2 health impact and risk assessment fluoride consumption via groundwater is similar to a two edged knife due to the health effects caused by both high as well as low concentrations the low concentration of fluoride ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 ppm is necessary for the human system as it is useful in avoiding dental caries bone development mineralization and enamel development of teeth in contrast the intake of a high amount of fluoride can cause serious health concerns like fluorosis singh et al 2013 it forms a protective crystalline structure around the enamel fluorosis leads to dental caries enamel formation bone fragility bilateral lameness and stiffness edmunds and smedley 2013b fluoride replaces the hydroxyapatite also called crystalline calcium phosphate 87 which is the first compound found in tooth enamel it forms fluorapatite by displacing the hydroxide ion in hydroxyapatite chronic exposure makes the tooth hard and brittle this is called dental fluorosis viswanathan et al 2010 prolonged subjection to a high amount of fluoride 4 ppm can cause calcification in bones resulting in the formation of osteoporosis and osteosclerosis joshi et al 2011 barbier et al 2010 designated fluoride as the culprit for disturbed intracellular redox homeostasis oxidative stress apoptosis protein carbonyl content lipid peroxidation and modified expressions of genes of the stress response cell cell communications metabolic enzymes cell cycle and signal transduction minerals such as apatite topaz fluorite fluorspar mica get weathered through the natural process of adding fluoride to soils moreover several industries mainly glass and ceramic industries fertilizer steel aluminum zinc smelting industries also contribute towards fluoride contamination of soils this bioaccumulation leads to the contamination of the food chain in addition to the drinking water route causing a larger risk of fluorosis particularly to infants and children bhattacharya and samal 2018 in the jilin region of china widespread fluorosis was observed specifically in children and expecting mothers from drinking water contaminated with excessive fluoride 1 0 mg l zhang et al 2003 blinkhorn and mekertichian 2013 and o mullane et al 2016 presented a detailed discussion of fluoride and dental health badeenezhad et al 2020 observed that a low dosage of fluoride leads to the problem of dental fluorosis due to low fluoride levels in the groundwater of iran fordyce 2011 and 2018 also described the f impact on human health to find the rise in the cases of fluorosis patil et al 2018 also discussed the curse of fluorosis as skeletal non skeletal and dental fluorosis the walawe river basin in the southern region of sri lanka is also reported to be affected by dental fluorosis ali et al 2016 the value of 1 5 mg l world health organization 1984 was surpassed by 27 samples from singhpur and sagaragan villages of orissa with an average value of around 7 ppm giving rise to the cases of fluorosis in singhpur but not in sagaragan kundu et al 2001 the children of dharmanagar tripura are at high risk of dental fluorosis due to contaminated groundwater in the area bhattacharya et al 2020 the study from the southern regions of punjab also demonstrated similar results fluoride concentration ranging from 2 5 to 4 0 mg l in groundwater was found in about 50 of sampling locations with few sites exceeding 5 0 mg l villages of barnala were found to have the maximum health risk for both adults and children ahada and suthar 2019 the studies from the groundwater of siddipet area medak district of telangana reported fluoride concentration of 0 2 2 2 mg l with approximately 22 of the samples exceeding the recommended limit 1 5 mg l causing endemic dental fluorosis narsimha and sudarshan 2017a 2017b dental and skeletal fluorosis is most prevalent in the villages such as madhuri rohiniyadamar neruiyadamar kunrwa and gobardaha of district sonbhadra in uttar pradesh in the fluoride contaminated villages health implications like the bending of the spinal column deformation of ligaments aging problem and mottling of teeth have threatened both the minor and adult population the other affected villages with high fluoride content 1 39 2 06 mg 1 include charakpatli lohrakholi and tumiya raju et al 2009 many health index models have been used for researchers for fluoride risk assessment as well amalraj and pius 2013 applied the community fluorosis index cfi for studying the effects of fluoride using dean s classification in tamil nadu of india karunanidhi et al 2019 also used the usepa method for the health risk analysis of f in the river basin of shanmuganadhi in south india alarcon herrera et al 2001 used the dean index di of fluorosis for the assessment of risk in the well water samples of the guadiana valley of mexico another popular index associated with fluorosis is the dmft decayed missing filled teeth index which is one of the important tools in the field of dental epidemiology several researchers have conducted an extensive study in this field correlating the excessive levels of fluoride with the dmft index including bischoff et al 1976 li et al 2019 evaluated the cancer risk for the f exposure through the consumption of drinking water in the northwestern part of china and suggested that children were at higher risk of f toxicity with a health risk value with an average of 1 51 while that of adults was within the acceptable range with an average of 0 42 bhattacharya et al 2017 assessed the hazard index hi for the children of west bengal and discovered that they were at high risk of dental fluorosis due to exposure to fluoride contaminated water soil and crops mohanta et al 2020 investigated the non cancer risk by applying the usepa method by using a fuzzy based index in gharwar village of dhanbad in india the fhi fuzzy hazard index revealed that 10 out of 20 samples were in the risk category for fluoride while the remaining ten samples were in the safe category adimalla 2019 also applied the usepa method for the non carcinogenic risk analysis for f and no3 2 in groundwater of southern india and observed that 67 65 of the total samples for men 79 41 for women and 82 35 for children exceeded the safe limit of 1 rashid et al 2020 discovered a community fluorosis index cfi for investing the health risk exposure in the dargai area of pakistan a value above 0 6 indicated community fluorosis the results suggested that all the endemic as well as control regions exceeded the safe limit of 0 6 chen et al 2017a 2017b calculated the risk values in the inhabitants of the dawukou region of china for the combined exposure of as and f in groundwater samples they used the triangular fuzzy numbers approach and discovered that while the risk values of f were mostly less than 1 risk values of as in all samples exceeded the safe limit das et al 2018 stated that the co occurrence of as f and u in the brahmaputra floodplain has a non significant risk of cancer on the population but children were exposed to greater threat followed by adult males and females rasool et al 2015 applied the usepa method and calculated the estimated daily intake edi and target hazard quotient thq for as and f co occurrence in pakistan and found that the values after analysis surpassed the safe limit 1 in the groundwater samples of the study area 3 5 fluoride contamination removal techniques there are multiple traditional removal techniques of fluoride from groundwater like coagulation reverse osmosis adsorption nano filtration ion exchange precipitation and electrochemical methods available from earlier studies maity et al 2018 among these the processes of membrane and ion exchange are not extremely popular because of their high establishment and cost waghmare and arfin 2015 each fluoride removal technique has its benefits and operational limitations as each technology has some limitations the site specific treatment process as per local requirements and prevailing conditions would be effective singh et al 2013 some of them are discussed below 3 5 1 coagulation and precipitation method yinfang 2011 treated wastewater containing 10 ppm of fluoride ion by coagulation and precipitation the effects of treatment conditions on the treatment of fluoride enriched wastewater were examined and the optimum treatment process was followed using aluminum sulfate as a coagulator the amount of f in wastewater decreased to below one ppm gong et al 2012 investigated the effect of complexation of aluminum fluoride on fluoride removal by coagulation of al salts through batch experiments it was demonstrated that a new al f oh coprecipitate was formed in the coagulation process that was effective in fluoride removal by co precipitation atasoy et al 2013 used raw modified bauxite for removing as and f from contaminated groundwater and observed that fluoride contamination 3 ppm could be reduced to the acceptable limit of 1 5 ppm by b mg 500 singh et al 2013 precipitated fluoride by the use of chlorine alkali aluminum chloride or aluminum sulfate or both and found that it was an effective fluoride remediation technique 3 5 2 membrane process tahaikt et al 2007 conducted fluoride removal on groundwater through the use of a nanofiltration plant containing two modules and observed that after double pass the fluoride in the product water was reduced to an acceptable value boubakri et al 2014 studied fluoride removal through direct contact membrane distillation dcmd by a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane pvdf from aqueous media and found that the dcmd process produced almost fluoride free water ghosh et al 2013 prepared ceramic membranes by uniaxial and paste methods and observed that the fluoride concentration depleted rapidly with time and after 35 min reached below the recommendable limit i e 1 mg l 3 5 3 ion exchange process alkan et al 2008 studied fluoride removal by the donnan dialysis method with plasma modified afx membranes anion exchange it was seen that fluoride removal was most efficient with afx plasma modified membrane allowing effective fluoride removal as compared to the pristine afx membrane samatya et al 2007 used la3 al3 and zro2 exchanged zeolite to assess the fluoride sorption properties of the sorbents the metal loaded zeolite had a fluoride removal efficiency of 94 from a solution containing 2 5 mg f l jamhour 2005 used an ion exchanger zirconium iv oxide ethanolamine zro ea for selective removal of fluoride ions to find that zro ea exchanger is an effective substance for a water treatment process that complies with the maximum contaminate concentration for fluoride ion in drinking water chakrabortty et al 2013 succeeded in removing 98 of fluoride using a cross flow polyamide nanofiltration membrane from groundwater the ph of the water was also reduced to a suitable level 3 5 4 electro coagulation ec process behbahani et al 2011 in their research applied response surface methodology and assessed the cost and effect of chief operational factors including current density initial fluoride level reaction time and initial ph for fluoride remediation by electrocoagulation the effect of initial ph on the suitability and cost of fluoride removal was negligible the decline in initial fluoride levels improved fluoride removal efficiency without any impact on operating costs mahvi et al 2012 assessed the remediation of fluoride from solutions through the electrocoagulation process applying fe and al electrodes and revealed that an electric potential of 40 v had the most significant remediation of fluoride thus the remediation of fluoride from water and wastewater can be carried out effectively and economically by the electrocoagulation process palahouane et al 2015 studied an electrocoagulation technique using sheets of aluminum as an electrode to remediate fluoride ions from wastewater the results suggest effective removal can be attained if the electrocoagulation is applied to wastewater post treatment 3 5 5 adsorption process tembhurkar and dongre 2006 estimated the potential of activated charcoal commercially available to remediate fluoride contaminated water undertook batch adsorption studies the result showed that the suitable sorbent dose was 2 0 g 100 ml while equilibrium was reached in 2 h and increased adsorption occurred at ph 2 and maximum fluoride removal at optimum conditions was 94 chen et al 2010 developed a new granular ceramic media for fluoride remediation it was seen that this media in the remediation process upheld the water quality without allowing the leaching of aluminum or ferric ions from the adsorbents therefore this new material proved to be promising for fluoride remediation from aqueous media islamuddin et al 2016 used coconut husk for the defluoridation of water and succeeded in removing 86 of fluoride chidambaram et al 2003 used natural substances such as charcoal serpentine red soil fly ash and brick for effective fluoride removal yadav et al 2013 used sawdust wheat straw and activated bagasse sugarcane carbon for remediating fluoride from artificial as well as natural groundwater samples they concluded that an acceptable amount of fluoride could be acquired in the neutral ph range with the help of these adsorbents which makes them suitable for utilization in drinking water treatment especially in rural areas where facilities are minimal ganvir and das 2011 used aluminum coated rice husk ash rha for remediating fluoride from groundwater and the result indicated the linear proportion of fluoride removal with the quantity of rha coated hence the coated rha can be effectively stepped up to a filtration unit device for practical use maity et al 2018 used bacterial surfactin mediated nano hydroxyapatite as an adsorbent for fluoride removal and concluded that this novel technique can be used for pollution control 4 co occurrence of arsenic and fluoride the existence of as and f in samples of groundwater suggests a common source or path of contamination for both the elements which can be supported by the reports of a positive correlation rasool et al 2015 the most common contributions of as and f are natural sources for instance arsenic mobilization involves changes in redox conditions in contrast reducing conditions are more favorable for the fe release which in turn contributes to the addition of arsenic in groundwater the geogenic release of fluoride as a contaminant is generally dependent on rock water interaction bibi et al 2017 however a high recharge discharge rate proves to be a hindrance to the proximity between the groundwater and the aquifer materials kumar et al 2016 water rock interaction is considered as the leading cause for as and f contamination which may further be accelerated because of geothermal and mining activities and by over exploitation of aquifers multi element enrichment of nutrients in groundwater systems is an emerging concern their cooccurrences can lead to an enhanced effect through various complex synergistic antagonistic interactions patel et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 reported that co occurrence of as f undergo several combined and complex interactions with the groundwater and can have severe health impacts as compared to their individual impacts laboratory experiments suggest fe hydroxides be the major source of as and f as it has a high affinity for f as well as as oxyanions bundschuh et al 2017 the deposition of newer sediments and the recharge conditions controlled by the river plays a significant role in governing the concentration of as and f das et al 2016 alarcón herrera et al 2013 suggested a direct proportion between a high concentration of as and f specifically in arid regions the separate toxic effects of both the contaminants have been studied intensively yet few studies focus on their co occurrences and simultaneous treatment options kumar et al 2020 elaborated the anthropogenic activities like irrigation return flow mining extraction recharge and agrochemicals as the major contributing source of as and f co occurrence kumar et al 2016 studied the occurrence of both as and f in diphu district of assam arsenic and fluoride presence in punjab pakistan by rasool et al 2015 while the semi arid zones of latin america were assessed for the combined occurrence of as and f by alarcón herrera et al 2013 reyes gómez et al 2013 studied the rocks sediments and groundwater for their geochemical properties of mexican aquifers to analyze as and f co occurrence and found them to be of geogenic origin kumar et al 2016 studied the combined occurrence of as and f in the brahmaputra floodplains of assam and found that the isolated aquifers characterized by low recharge rates could have high f levels and hence co occurrence is possible due to oxidizing conditions chen et al 2017a 2017b analyzed the provenance of as and f contaminants in groundwater of dawukou region northwest china where residents depend on groundwater as a drinking water source and the results suggested that the feebly alkaline conditions influenced their concentration in groundwater by the dissolution and precipitation of arsenate and fluorite ca the shallow groundwater had a relatively higher concentration of as and f chandrajith et al 2020 reported as f co occurrence in sri lanka and reported over 80 percent of the population use groundwater for drinking and suffered from fluorosis while arsenic was limited to sedimentary aquifers and was not a critical concern toolabi et al 2020 studied the groundwater of iran to find that both as and f exceeded their permissible limits 4 1 toxicity and health by arsenic fluoride co occurrence the impact of arsenic fluoride co exposure was studied extensively by researchers who suggested that dentine and dental tissues do not accumulate a significant amount of as and f however nervous damage including decreased learning ability and memory are also attributed to the coupled exposure to as and f mishra et al 2010 have reported the effect of combined arsenic fluoride exposure in the form of abnormal histology of cerebral hemisphere with arsenic exerting more pronounced effect than fluoride the individual impact of as and f are less predominant as compared to the genotoxic effects of their integrated exposure arsenic can aggravate the toxicity of fluoride through synergistic pathways rao and tiwari 2006 several studies conducted on experimental animals have also observed that combined as and f exposure damages the rat brain decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and increases lipid peroxidation birkner et al 2008 das et al 2018 studied the origin distribution and health implications of as f co occurrence together with uranium in the brahmaputra river flood plain aquifers and observed that children face a greater threat of associated diseases than adults due to their larger water intake to body weight ratio and underdeveloped physiology sariñana ruiz et al 2017 assessed environmental and health risk factors and observed that bioavailability of arsenic was predominant in the gastric phase while that of fluoride was prominent in the intestinal phase of arsenic and fluoride necessitating the urge for continuous ecology and human health monitoring in the endemic region of comarca lagunera of mexico bhattacharya et al 2020 reported a high risk of severe chronic toxicity as indicated by the high cumulative noncancerous lifetime hazard index value for as and f in the dharmanagar region tripura kumar et al 2020 reported that huge population from china india and pakistan suffer from as f co occurrence as the corrosive hydrofluoric acid weakens the bone while arsenic leads to arsenicosis maity et al 2021 studied the global impact of as f co occurrence and reported malignancies and fluorosis mainly in south asian countries 4 2 removal techniques of arsenic fluoride from groundwater researchers who studied the concurrent of arsenic and fluoride remediation include sandoval et al 2019 who used a flow reactor composed of aluminum for the electro coagulating f and as simultaneously from groundwater they observed that the concentrations of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater 5 5 mg l and arsenic 0 054 mg l depleted and met with the who standards post the process of electrocoagulation saikia et al 2017 attempted remediation of arsenic and fluoride using a surface methodology from an aqueous solution by activated biochar and found it to be a favorable cost effective and eco friendly adsorbent due to the multiple active adsorption sites and larger specific surface area qiao et al 2014 simultaneously removed arsenate and fluoride from water by using al fe hydroxides to find that arsenate adsorption on al fe hydroxides depended strongly on ph with increased adsorption at higher ph the concurrent removal of as v and f was also studied by jing et al 2012 who developed an adsorbent with oxides of ti and la on activated carbon tlac and found it to be more effective than commercial adsorbents thakur and mondal 2017 used electrocoagulation using the aluminum electrode for simultaneous remediation of as and f from samples along with the effects of run time current density the distance between electrodes initial ph and nacl levels on the percentage remediation and economic aspects the suitable experimental conditions in the result were found as initial ph 7 a current density of 10 a m2 and so on for removal of approximately 98 arsenic and 88 33 fluoride the treated water had arsenic and fluoride concentrations of 8 19 μg l and 1 4 mg l respectively costing about 0 357 usd m3 treated water deeming it to be an effective method for simultaneous as and f removal from water samples patel et al 2019 studied as f contamination in assam and discovered that fe hydroxides play an important role in adsorption of as and f from water hence can be used in remediation haldar et al 2020 used metal organic framework to trap arsenic and fluoride from water samples in order to purify the water from these contaminants 5 conclusion the deterioration of groundwater quality is a global issue arsenic and fluoride are two important contaminants of groundwater in varied regions of the world studies have reported that arsenic contamination has spread over 70 countries the major countries facing the issue of arsenic contamination are east asia and south east asia in india the worst affected regions include the gangetic plains of west bengal ganga plains of uttar pradesh as well as bihar the important mechanisms that release as in the groundwater are reductive dissolution of minerals containing iron oxidation of sulfide minerals alkali desorption geothermal activity and action of microbes and organic matter among this reductive dissolution of minerals containing iron is a dominant process for the indo gangetic belt consumption of water contaminated with arsenic may lead to multiple health disorders including cancer melanosis keratosis and arsenicosis the major arsenic removal techniques are the use of membrane technology ion exchange process chemical precipitation and coagulation adsorption and biological treatment methods the other important groundwater contaminant i e fluoride is mostly contributed through geogenic sources fluoride contamination has been reported from south korea pakistan afghanistan vietnam and malaysia in india 14 states have reported fluoride contamination these include uttar pradesh bihar andhra pradesh madhya pradesh rajasthan gujarat tamil nadu and punjab the major factors influencing the groundwater fluoride include dissolution of fluoride rich minerals the contribution from aquifer recharge and mobilization via carbonate and bicarbonate within the aquifer it can cause fluorosis leading to dental caries bone fragility and stiffness the major fluoride removal techniques are the use of membrane technology chemical precipitation and coagulation adsorption ion exchange process and electro coagulation process the combined occurrence of as and f discussed in distinguished studies may have a synergistic or antagonistic effect on health further studies are significant for the better knowledge of the mechanisms behind the co occurrence and the co removal of these two pollutants from the groundwater the over exploitation of groundwater without minding the recharging potential of aquifers can be one of the major factors behind the increase in the arsenic contamination zones this problem could only be resolved by an integrated effort of the people and the policy makers as well people need increased awareness about the hazards of such indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater and the policy makers should also make provision for strict rules and regulations to check the depletion of groundwater resources the proper mapping of contaminated wells is required to reduce the health implications related to the contamination of as and f the research on the development of economically viable remedial techniques for the arsenic and fluoride remediation from the groundwater should be promoted such technologies will encourage providing safe water to the population inhabiting arsenic and fluoride affected areas declaration of competing interest the authors

11959,high fluoride contaminated in ground water and surface water has been prompting researchers to look for a high efficiency low cost environmental friendly method a novel micron zirconia zeolite molecular sieve zro2 ze composite was synthesized and its characterization and adsorption mechanism for fluoride was studied scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir were used to analyze the structure and morphology of the zro2 ze adsorbents experimental conditions such as adsorbent dose 0 5 7 0

time 8 h ph value 6 and temperature 25 c batch adsorption experiments showed that fluoride adsorption followed the pseudo second order kinetics freundlich isotherm model can better describe the behavior of zro2 ze adsorption of fluoride thermodynamic parameters δh δs and δg were calculated to indicate an exothermic and randomness reaction process the results in adsorption and regeneration tests showed the evidence that zro2 ze composite was a promising adsorbent for fluoride removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro zirconia zeolite molecular sieves fluoride groundwater 1 introduction fluoride ion is a non biodegradable and persistent pollutant fluoride pollution in water can occur due to both natural and human activity reasons alcaine et al 2020 kimambo et al 2019 since fluoride is present in several minerals it can leach from water flow then contaminate ground water on the other hand fluoride compounds are usually used for industrial applications such as aluminum extraction electronics glass and ceramics production semiconductor fertilizer and etching processes murambasvina and mahamadi 2020 meenakshi and maheshwari 2006 shen et al 2003 kusrini et al 2015 fluoride can leach into air and contaminate the surface water by rainwater according to the world health organization who the maximum acceptable concentration of fluoride ions in drinking water is less than 1 5 mg l who 1984 the limit fluoride concentration of china drinking water standard is less than 1 mg l yao et al 2009 an excess of fluoride ions more than 2 ppm in drinking water can cause various health problems such as dental fluorosis softening of bones and neurological damage hou et al 2010 poinern et al 2011 in china most water purification plants use the conventional treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation filtration disinfection zheng et al 2014 however these methods are not efficient in the removal of fluoride especially with high concentration many researches perform on defluorination to remove the excess of fluoride effectively from drinking water li et al 2013 including adsorption yadav et al 2018 ion exchange robshaw et al 2019 precipitation chen et al 2017 membrane bouhadjar et al 2019 and electrodialysis belkada et al 2018 among these methods adsorption was the most commonly used method for fluoride removal from drinking water due to its selectivity low cost and high availability teutli sequeira et al 2013 different adsorbents for fluoride removal have also been developed such as alumina and aluminum impregnated based adsorbents goswami and purkait 2012 carbon based adsorbents kathikeyan and elango 2008 calcium based adsorbents basu et al 2013 nanoparticles he et al 2014 naturals materials meseret et al 2017 agricultural and biomass based adsorbents maity et al 2018 manna et al 2018 however most of the adsorbents worked efficiently at acidic ph which was a drawback for actual application yadav et al 2018 some of the aluminum impregnated based adsorbents can be dangerous to human being health during the defluoridation water treatment process because the aluminum leached into the water and may cause neurodegenerative diseases yadav et al 2018 ahamad et al 2018 nanomaterials has been widely investigated for fluoride removal due to the high costs of the nanomaterials it is difficult to produce a sufficient quantity and limits its application for industrial use yadav et al 2018 wallace et al 2019 therefore it is imperative to develop high efficiency low cost environmental friendly new adsorbents for fluoride removal from drinking water system zirconia zro2 powder have been widely used in material field it is characterized by significant feature such as high thermal and chemical stability with the feature of both acid and base active centre as well as oxidizing and reducing sites on the surface and considered as a potential fluoride adsorbent due to its high electrical affinity for fluoride dou et al 2012 fattahi et al 2020 micron zirconia has a small particle size and contains a large amount of active zr oh and zr o which can react with fluoride by ion exchange due to its lower cost than nano zirconia the use of micron zirconia can be more cost efficient and easier to put into production however the micron zirconia powder has no fixed shape when it is being used alone and easy to be lost during the adsorption process liu et al 2018 embedded zro2 in the metal skeleton for phosphate removal sun et al 2017 used zro2 in combination with magnetic fe3o4 to remove arsenite by photocatalytic oxidation therefore it is important to find a supporter to optimize the micron zro2 powder during the process of removal fluoride zeolite molecular sieve is a synthetic aluminosilicate with a tetrahedral structure due to its regular internal pores large specific surface area and stable structure it has more efficient adsorption performance than natural zeolite and therefore often used as a carrier for adsorption separation duan et al 2017 in this study a low cost and environmental friendly adsorbent was synthesized by micron zirconia modified zeolite molecular sieve for fluoride contaminated groundwater treatment to investigate the characterization of zro2 ze before and after fluoride removal several techniques was invited in this study such as x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to check the performance of zro2 ze at different dose adsorption time ph value and temperature batch experiments have been done to obtain the adsorption rate and adsorption capacity the adsorption mechanism was studied from kinetics adsorption isotherms and adsorption thermodynamics additionally optimal regenerant was studied as well for future application 2 experimental procedure 2 1 chemicals materials the raw materials included micron zirconia and

adsorption at 5000 and 10000 magnification respectively the images fig 1a and b showed that zro2 ze before fluoride adsorption presented cube like rhombohedral shapes with smooth surface the porous structure of zro2 ze was loosening zhang et al 2014 according to the detection result of bet the specific surface area of zro2 ze was 24 606 m2 g 1 the average pore diameter was 4 208 nm and the pore volume was 0 006 cm3 g 1 after adsorption fig 1c and d the surface of zro2 ze was wrapped in densely packed small particles no other changes were observed in the morphology of the zro2 ze fig 2 and table 1 showed the composition of zro2 ze adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorption obtained by eds analysis it was observed that o 51 64 si 14 84 al 9 79 and zr 10 39 were the main compensation element in zro2 ze adsorbent it also verified the presence of c na ca after adsorption with fluoride f 1 18 element increased on zro2 ze which indicated zro2 ze reacted with fluoride content of o element was lowered after adsorption which showed parts of zr oh zr o exchanged with fluoride ions yu et al 2018 3 2 xrd analysis fig 3 showed the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of zro2 ze adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorption according to the characteristic peak of zms 2θ values at 17 36 34 22 and 57 10 had good agreement with the nax zeolite crystal structure data file jcpds no 38 0241 in the instrument library cai et al 2015 and the new diffraction peaks at the diffraction angles 2θ of 23 96 28 19 31 36 35 19 38 54 40 68 44 70 45 47 49 18 50 07 54 07 55 29 and 57 94 were the characteristic peaks of hydrated zirconia jcpds 65 1022 dou et al 2011 which indicated that the zirconia was supported on the zeolite molecular sieve surface comparing patterns between zro2 ze adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorption the characteristic peaks of the zro2 ze framework remain basically unchanged for the composite after adsorption the additional peaks at 40 78 57 23 44 88 and 49 31 55 42 represented nazrf5 and zrf4 respectively due to the interaction of fluoride ions with zirconium jcpds pdf 19 1197 15 0346 dunne et al 2009 3 3 ftir analysis ftir spectra from the scanning range 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 of zro2 ze adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorption were shown in fig 4 in the spectrum of zro2 ze line a the band at 3385 cm 1 was attributed to the tensile vibration of the x oh group zr oh si al oh on the surface of the zeolite molecular sieve skeleton samatya et al 2007 the strong band at 975 cm 1 was caused by yo4 group y means si al these two bands indicated the tetrahedral basic skeleton of zeolite molecular sieve yu et al 2019 the peak observed at 490 58 cm 1 was due to the stretching vibration of zr o group a significant decrease in the intensities of peaks were observed for both groups zr oh and zr o after f adsorption due to the f exchange with oh and o groups on the surface of adsorbents raghav and kumar 2019 and the position of the two peaks were shifted to 3436 29 cm 1 and 577 24 cm 1 after adsorption with fluoride ion new bands appeared in 1642 4 cm 1 hf2 group 739 17 cm 1 zr f group and 505 08 cm 1 zrf5 group which indicated the presence of f on the surface of zro2 ze adsorbent after fluoride adsorption the peak at 873 21 cm 1 corresponding to al f was observed after absorbed with fluoride which might be due to the interaction among the fluoride ions and al oh groups present on the zeolite molecular sieve 3 4 effect of the adsorbent dose the effect of zro2 ze adsorbent dose 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0g 150 ml on fluoride removal at the fluoride concentration of 5 mg l ph of 7 and temperature of 25 c was illustrated in fig 5 it was shown that the removal rate of fluoride was increased from 85 5 to 92 7 with the increase in the dose of zro2 ze from 0 5g 150 ml to 2 0g 150 ml when the dose was more than 2g 150 ml the fluoride removal rate increased slowly in contrast to the removal rate the amount of adsorption capacity decreased with the dose increasing this was due to the concentration of fluoride in the solution was limited with increasing amount of the adsorbent accumulation of adsorbent particles could reduce the adsorption rate of adsorbents which illustrated the decreasing of the adsorption capacity teimouri et al 2016 in terms of raw material cost as well as comprehensive adsorption amount and removal rate the optimum dose was chosen to be 2 g 150 ml 3 5 effect of the contact time fig 6 showed the effect of contact time on the zro2 ze adsorbent adsorption capacity and fluoride removal rate at dose of 2 g 150 ml initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l temperature of 25 c and ph of 7 it was observed that the fluoride capacities increased faster in the first 8 h adsorption of fluoride ions increased with increasing contact time however after 8 h reaction the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was almost unchanged due to low concentration of fluoride remaining in water optimal time was fixed as 8 h 3 6 effect of ph the ph value was one of the critical factors during the fluoride removal process fig 7 showed the adsorption capacity results in the ph range of 3 12 with zro2 ze adsorbent dose of 2 g 150 ml initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l contact time of 8 h at 25 c temperature when ph value was 3 4 hydrogen fluoride was predominant ions in the solution velazquez peña et al 2017 fluoride was not available to be absorbed consequently the adsorption capacity and removal rate of fluoride were not high in the acidic environment h combined with fluoride to form hf the presence of a large amount of h inhibited the hydrolysis of hf making the zro2 ze adsorbent unable to exchange with fluoride asgari et al 2012 when ph value was between 5 and 6 adsorption ph intervals of the adsorbent were at high efficiency and the adsorption capacity and removal rate reached 0 36 mg g and 94 89 when ph was 7 the adsorption amount and removal rate decreased slightly but still maintain at a high level indicating that it was applicable in practice in the alkaline environment the oh and the fluoride formed a competitive relationship the hydroxyl ions may compete with fluoride ions for the active sites on the zro2 ze adsorbent which resulted in the decreasing of the removal efficiency at ph values above 7 bia et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 chaudhary et al 2016 therefore zro2 ze adsorbent had a good adsorption capacity for fluoride removal under neutral and acidic conditions 3 7 effect of temperature the relation between the temperature and adsorption capacity fluoride removal efficiency of zro2 ze adsorbent was shown in fig 8 the tests were conducted at the condition of zro2 ze adsorbent dose of 2 g 150 ml contact time of 8h initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l and ph value of 6 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and removal rate of fluoride increased from 0 32 mg g to 0 34 mg g and from 89 46 to 94 83 with increasing temperature from 5 c to 25 c after that there was no obvious change from 25 c to 40 c taking the actual water temperature and economic cost into consideration the optimal adsorption temperature was determined to be 25 c 3 8 adsorption kinetics kinetic studies of fluoride removal were conducted with an initial concentration of 5 mg l fig 9 according to the kinetic data of the adsorption fluoride ions in water by zro2 ze adsorbent at room temperature table 2 showed the kinetic parameters by correlating the kinetic data with the above two rate models it was found that the plot of t q t against time produced straight lines r 2 0 9999 which was more correlated than pseudo first order model r 2 0 8904 the values of q e1 and q e2 obtained by two theoretical model were 0 051 mg g and 0 364 mg g respectively according to the results of previous effects experiments the adsorption capacity of the zro2 ze adsorbent was 0 34 mg g with zro2 ze adsorbent dose of 2g 150 ml contact time of 8h initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l ph value of 6 and temperature of 25 c which was almost consistent with the q e2 result by quasi secondary rate model the results showed that the adsorption process mainly followed the quasi secondary rate model and the whole process was controlled by chemical adsorption 3 9 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm experiment was conducted by using the langmuir and freundlich isotherms 2 0g zro2 ze adsorbent was added to conical flasks containing 150 ml fluoride ions solution with different initial fluoride concentration respectively then each was put into a thermostatic shaker for 8h finally the suspension was passed through a filter pore size 0 45 μm and the fluoride concentration of the filtrate was analyzed it can be seen from table 3 and fig 10 that the freundlich adsorption isotherm model r 2 0 986 can better describe the behavior of zro2 ze adsorption of fluoride which indicated the adsorption process was a multi layer adsorption it was generally considered that when n 0 5 adsorption was difficult to proceed and in the isothermal formula n 0 515 so the adsorption reaction was easy to continue kusrini et al 2015 3 10 adsorption thermodynamic by studying thermodynamics to determine the nature of the adsorption process and verify its feasibility the three basic thermodynamic parameters including standard gibbs free energy change δg 0 standard enthalpy change δh 0 and standard entropy change δs 0 were calculated in table 4 values of δh 0 and δs 0 calculated from the van t hoff plot of lnk vs 1 t according to the data shown in table 4 k increased with temperature changing from 5 c to 40 c which indicated high temperature improved the adsorption capacity of fluoride on zro2 ze negative values of δg 0 at above 20 c temperatures for zro2 ze confirmed that the adsorption of fluoride was spontaneous and thermodynamically favourable the δg values were positive below 15 c indicating that the adsorption required energy from an external source to convert reactants into products kara et al 2003 δs 0 for zro2 ze adsorbents was 68 35 10 3 kj k mol the value of δs 0 indicated that there was an increase in randomness at the solid liquid interface during fluoride adsorption on the zro2 ze adsorbents lai et al 2018 values of δh 0 for zro2 ze showed that the adsorption of fluoride was endothermic and this proved that the adsorption amount increased as the temperature increasing 3 11 regeneration the fluoride removal rates of the zro2 ze absorbents after regeneration by naoh na2co3 nahco3 and nacl were 79 65 42 02 59 36 and 62 88 respectively fig 11 the fluoride adsorption regeneration rate was 79 14 with 1 mol l naoh as the regenerant which was the best among four regenerants 3 12 reaction mechanism the possible mechanism of fluoride adsorption onto the zro2 ze surface can be explained from different perspectives characterization tests ftir and xrd were conducted to investigate the functional groups and bonds present on the surface of adsorbents before and after use from xrd and ftir analysis it was observed that zirconia was present mostly in oxidized form of zr o and zr oh which had significant contribution in enhancing the adsorption efficiency by surface reactions between zro2 and f ions wang et al 2019 as described by mohan et al 2017 one molecule of zro2 can bind with five fluoride ions which caused increasing uptake capacity of adsorbents fig 12 ph value of the solution was an important effector on protonation or deprotonation of the adsorbent taking place during hydroxyl protonation the zro2 existed as seven coordinated polyhedral form and f can be adsorbed by the protonated hydroxyl group of zro2 mullick and neogi 2019 as each f ion attached with the protonated hydroxyl group h2o the zirconium fluoride was formed by losing one molecule of water as shown in fig 12 1 5 dou et al 2012 in this way one molecule of zro2 can combine up to five f ions with the gradual formation of mono di tri tetra and pentafluoro zirconium species mullick and neogi 2018 on the other hand zeolite molecular sieve was a kind of synthetic sodium zeolite with a si al si framework tetrahedral structure and large specific surface area due to the zeolite molecular sieve had a weak adsorption effect on anions it can be modified by hydrochloric acid during the preparation process which made it hydrophobic and non polar and easy to adsorb the f as shown in ftir analysis al f was found after the f adsorption it was illustrated that al oh in zeolite molecular sieves can be protonated and had ion exchange reaction with fluoride ions mukherjee et al 2018 4 conclusion drinking fluoride contaminated groundwater for prolonged time can cause severe harm to human health this study focused on preparing a low cost environmentally friendly adsorbent zro2 ze for treating fluoride in groundwater the adsorbent was mainly characterized by use of micro zirconia which was lower cost compared to nano zirconia additionally the prepared zro2 ze can act as an adsorbent for the groundwater treatment with good adsorption for fluoride when initial fluoride concentration was 5 mg l removal rate of fluoride can reach 94 89 by using this zro2 ze adsorbent with dose of 2g 150 ml contact time of 8h ph value of 6 and temperature of 25 c based on results of characterization and adsorption mechanism of xrd and ftir zr o and zr oh in zirconium have significant contribution in adsorption efficiency and al oh in zeolite molecular sieves also had ion exchange reaction with fluoride ions the regeneration study revealed that the zro2 ze has good adsorption efficiency of 79 65 after regenerated by 1m naoh solution higher than na2co3 nahco3 and nacl future research on this zro2 ze adsorbent will focus on the optimization of regeneration processes and experiments on dynamic processes to provide technical parameters for large scale production applications declaration of

time 8 h ph value 6 and temperature 25 c batch adsorption experiments showed that fluoride adsorption followed the pseudo second order kinetics freundlich isotherm model can better describe the behavior of zro2 ze adsorption of fluoride thermodynamic parameters δh δs and δg were calculated to indicate an exothermic and randomness reaction process the results in adsorption and regeneration tests showed the evidence that zro2 ze composite was a promising adsorbent for fluoride removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro zirconia zeolite molecular sieves fluoride groundwater 1 introduction fluoride ion is a non biodegradable and persistent pollutant fluoride pollution in water can occur due to both natural and human activity reasons alcaine et al 2020 kimambo et al 2019 since fluoride is present in several minerals it can leach from water flow then contaminate ground water on the other hand fluoride compounds are usually used for industrial applications such as aluminum extraction electronics glass and ceramics production semiconductor fertilizer and etching processes murambasvina and mahamadi 2020 meenakshi and maheshwari 2006 shen et al 2003 kusrini et al 2015 fluoride can leach into air and contaminate the surface water by rainwater according to the world health organization who the maximum acceptable concentration of fluoride ions in drinking water is less than 1 5 mg l who 1984 the limit fluoride concentration of china drinking water standard is less than 1 mg l yao et al 2009 an excess of fluoride ions more than 2 ppm in drinking water can cause various health problems such as dental fluorosis softening of bones and neurological damage hou et al 2010 poinern et al 2011 in china most water purification plants use the conventional treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation filtration disinfection zheng et al 2014 however these methods are not efficient in the removal of fluoride especially with high concentration many researches perform on defluorination to remove the excess of fluoride effectively from drinking water li et al 2013 including adsorption yadav et al 2018 ion exchange robshaw et al 2019 precipitation chen et al 2017 membrane bouhadjar et al 2019 and electrodialysis belkada et al 2018 among these methods adsorption was the most commonly used method for fluoride removal from drinking water due to its selectivity low cost and high availability teutli sequeira et al 2013 different adsorbents for fluoride removal have also been developed such as alumina and aluminum impregnated based adsorbents goswami and purkait 2012 carbon based adsorbents kathikeyan and elango 2008 calcium based adsorbents basu et al 2013 nanoparticles he et al 2014 naturals materials meseret et al 2017 agricultural and biomass based adsorbents maity et al 2018 manna et al 2018 however most of the adsorbents worked efficiently at acidic ph which was a drawback for actual application yadav et al 2018 some of the aluminum impregnated based adsorbents can be dangerous to human being health during the defluoridation water treatment process because the aluminum leached into the water and may cause neurodegenerative diseases yadav et al 2018 ahamad et al 2018 nanomaterials has been widely investigated for fluoride removal due to the high costs of the nanomaterials it is difficult to produce a sufficient quantity and limits its application for industrial use yadav et al 2018 wallace et al 2019 therefore it is imperative to develop high efficiency low cost environmental friendly new adsorbents for fluoride removal from drinking water system zirconia zro2 powder have been widely used in material field it is characterized by significant feature such as high thermal and chemical stability with the feature of both acid and base active centre as well as oxidizing and reducing sites on the surface and considered as a potential fluoride adsorbent due to its high electrical affinity for fluoride dou et al 2012 fattahi et al 2020 micron zirconia has a small particle size and contains a large amount of active zr oh and zr o which can react with fluoride by ion exchange due to its lower cost than nano zirconia the use of micron zirconia can be more cost efficient and easier to put into production however the micron zirconia powder has no fixed shape when it is being used alone and easy to be lost during the adsorption process liu et al 2018 embedded zro2 in the metal skeleton for phosphate removal sun et al 2017 used zro2 in combination with magnetic fe3o4 to remove arsenite by photocatalytic oxidation therefore it is important to find a supporter to optimize the micron zro2 powder during the process of removal fluoride zeolite molecular sieve is a synthetic aluminosilicate with a tetrahedral structure due to its regular internal pores large specific surface area and stable structure it has more efficient adsorption performance than natural zeolite and therefore often used as a carrier for adsorption separation duan et al 2017 in this study a low cost and environmental friendly adsorbent was synthesized by micron zirconia modified zeolite molecular sieve for fluoride contaminated groundwater treatment to investigate the characterization of zro2 ze before and after fluoride removal several techniques was invited in this study such as x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to check the performance of zro2 ze at different dose adsorption time ph value and temperature batch experiments have been done to obtain the adsorption rate and adsorption capacity the adsorption mechanism was studied from kinetics adsorption isotherms

adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorption the characteristic peaks of the zro2 ze framework remain basically unchanged for the composite after adsorption the additional peaks at 40 78 57 23 44 88 and 49 31 55 42 represented nazrf5 and zrf4 respectively due to the interaction of fluoride ions with zirconium jcpds pdf 19 1197 15 0346 dunne et al 2009 3 3 ftir analysis ftir spectra from the scanning range 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 of zro2 ze adsorbent before and after fluoride adsorption were shown in fig 4 in the spectrum of zro2 ze line a the band at 3385 cm 1 was attributed to the tensile vibration of the x oh group zr oh si al oh on the surface of the zeolite molecular sieve skeleton samatya et al 2007 the strong band at 975 cm 1 was caused by yo4 group y means si al these two bands indicated the tetrahedral basic skeleton of zeolite molecular sieve yu et al 2019 the peak observed at 490 58 cm 1 was due to the stretching vibration of zr o group a significant decrease in the intensities of peaks were observed for both groups zr oh and zr o after f adsorption due to the f exchange with oh and o groups on the surface of adsorbents raghav and kumar 2019 and the position of the two peaks were shifted to 3436 29 cm 1 and 577 24 cm 1 after adsorption with fluoride ion new bands appeared in 1642 4 cm 1 hf2 group 739 17 cm 1 zr f group and 505 08 cm 1 zrf5 group which indicated the presence of f on the surface of zro2 ze adsorbent after fluoride adsorption the peak at 873 21 cm 1 corresponding to al f was observed after absorbed with fluoride which might be due to the interaction among the fluoride ions and al oh groups present on the zeolite molecular sieve 3 4 effect of the adsorbent dose the effect of zro2 ze adsorbent dose 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0g 150 ml on fluoride removal at the fluoride concentration of 5 mg l ph of 7 and temperature of 25 c was illustrated in fig 5 it was shown that the removal rate of fluoride was increased from 85 5 to 92 7 with the increase in the dose of zro2 ze from 0 5g 150 ml to 2 0g 150 ml when the dose was more than 2g 150 ml the fluoride removal rate increased slowly in contrast to the removal rate the amount of adsorption capacity decreased with the dose increasing this was due to the concentration of fluoride in the solution was limited with increasing amount of the adsorbent accumulation of adsorbent particles could reduce the adsorption rate of adsorbents which illustrated the decreasing of the adsorption capacity teimouri et al 2016 in terms of raw material cost as well as comprehensive adsorption amount and removal rate the optimum dose was chosen to be 2 g 150 ml 3 5 effect of the contact time fig 6 showed the effect of contact time on the zro2 ze adsorbent adsorption capacity and fluoride removal rate at dose of 2 g 150 ml initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l temperature of 25 c and ph of 7 it was observed that the fluoride capacities increased faster in the first 8 h adsorption of fluoride ions increased with increasing contact time however after 8 h reaction the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was almost unchanged due to low concentration of fluoride remaining in water optimal time was fixed as 8 h 3 6 effect of ph the ph value was one of the critical factors during the fluoride removal process fig 7 showed the adsorption capacity results in the ph range of 3 12 with zro2 ze adsorbent dose of 2 g 150 ml initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l contact time of 8 h at 25 c temperature when ph value was 3 4 hydrogen fluoride was predominant ions in the solution velazquez peña et al 2017 fluoride was not available to be absorbed consequently the adsorption capacity and removal rate of fluoride were not high in the acidic environment h combined with fluoride to form hf the presence of a large amount of h inhibited the hydrolysis of hf making the zro2 ze adsorbent unable to exchange with fluoride asgari et al 2012 when ph value was between 5 and 6 adsorption ph intervals of the adsorbent were at high efficiency and the adsorption capacity and removal rate reached 0 36 mg g and 94 89 when ph was 7 the adsorption amount and removal rate decreased slightly but still maintain at a high level indicating that it was applicable in practice in the alkaline environment the oh and the fluoride formed a competitive relationship the hydroxyl ions may compete with fluoride ions for the active sites on the zro2 ze adsorbent which resulted in the decreasing of the removal efficiency at ph values above 7 bia et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 chaudhary et al 2016 therefore zro2 ze adsorbent had a good adsorption capacity for fluoride removal under neutral and acidic conditions 3 7 effect of temperature the relation between the temperature and adsorption capacity fluoride removal efficiency of zro2 ze adsorbent was shown in fig 8 the tests were conducted at the condition of zro2 ze adsorbent dose of 2 g 150 ml contact time of 8h initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l and ph value of 6 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and removal rate of fluoride increased from 0 32 mg g to 0 34 mg g and from 89 46 to 94 83 with increasing temperature from 5 c to 25 c after that there was no obvious change from 25 c to 40 c taking the actual water temperature and economic cost into consideration the optimal adsorption temperature was determined to be 25 c 3 8 adsorption kinetics kinetic studies of fluoride removal were conducted with an initial concentration of 5 mg l fig 9 according to the kinetic data of the adsorption fluoride ions in water by zro2 ze adsorbent at room temperature table 2 showed the kinetic parameters by correlating the kinetic data with the above two rate models it was found that the plot of t q t against time produced straight lines r 2 0 9999 which was more correlated than pseudo first order model r 2 0 8904 the values of q e1 and q e2 obtained by two theoretical model were 0 051 mg g and 0 364 mg g respectively according to the results of previous effects experiments the adsorption capacity of the zro2 ze adsorbent was 0 34 mg g with zro2 ze adsorbent dose of 2g 150 ml contact time of 8h initial fluoride concentration of 5 mg l ph value of 6 and temperature of 25 c which was almost consistent with the q e2 result by quasi secondary rate model the results showed that the adsorption process mainly followed the quasi secondary rate model and the whole process was controlled by chemical adsorption 3 9 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm experiment was conducted by using the langmuir and freundlich isotherms 2 0g zro2 ze adsorbent was added to conical flasks containing 150 ml fluoride ions solution with different initial fluoride concentration respectively then each was put into a thermostatic shaker for 8h finally the suspension was passed through a filter pore size 0 45 μm and the fluoride concentration of the filtrate was analyzed it can be seen from table 3 and fig 10 that the freundlich adsorption isotherm model r 2 0 986 can better describe the behavior of zro2 ze adsorption of fluoride which indicated the adsorption process was a multi layer adsorption it was generally considered that when n 0 5 adsorption was difficult to proceed and in the isothermal formula n 0 515 so the adsorption reaction was easy to continue kusrini et al 2015 3 10 adsorption thermodynamic by studying thermodynamics to determine the nature of the adsorption process and verify its feasibility the three basic thermodynamic parameters including standard gibbs free energy change δg 0 standard enthalpy change δh 0 and standard entropy change δs 0 were calculated in table 4 values of δh 0 and δs 0 calculated from the van t hoff plot of lnk vs 1 t according to the data shown in table 4 k increased with temperature changing from 5 c to 40 c which indicated high temperature improved the adsorption capacity of fluoride on zro2 ze negative values of δg 0 at above 20 c temperatures for zro2 ze confirmed that the adsorption of fluoride was spontaneous and thermodynamically favourable the δg values were positive below 15 c indicating that the adsorption required energy from an external source to convert reactants into products kara et al 2003 δs 0 for zro2 ze adsorbents was 68 35 10 3 kj k mol the value of δs 0 indicated that there was an increase in randomness at the solid liquid interface during fluoride adsorption on the zro2 ze adsorbents lai et al 2018 values of δh 0 for zro2 ze showed that the adsorption of fluoride was endothermic and this proved that the adsorption amount increased as the temperature increasing 3 11 regeneration the fluoride removal rates of the zro2 ze absorbents after regeneration by naoh na2co3 nahco3 and nacl were 79 65 42 02 59 36 and 62 88 respectively fig 11 the fluoride adsorption regeneration rate was 79 14 with 1 mol l naoh as the regenerant which was the best among four regenerants 3 12 reaction mechanism the possible mechanism of fluoride adsorption onto the zro2 ze surface can be explained from different perspectives characterization tests ftir and xrd were conducted to investigate the functional groups and bonds present on the surface of adsorbents before and after use from xrd and ftir analysis it was observed that zirconia was present mostly in oxidized form of zr o and zr oh which had significant contribution in enhancing the adsorption efficiency by surface reactions between zro2 and f ions wang et al 2019 as described by mohan et al 2017 one molecule of zro2 can bind with five fluoride ions which caused increasing uptake capacity of adsorbents fig 12 ph value of the solution was an important effector on protonation or deprotonation of the adsorbent taking place during hydroxyl protonation the zro2 existed as seven coordinated polyhedral form and f can be adsorbed by the protonated hydroxyl group of zro2 mullick and neogi 2019 as each f ion attached with the protonated hydroxyl group h2o the zirconium fluoride was formed by losing one molecule of water as shown in fig 12 1 5 dou et al 2012 in this way one molecule of zro2 can combine up to five f ions with the gradual formation of mono di tri tetra and pentafluoro zirconium species mullick and neogi 2018 on the other hand zeolite molecular sieve was a kind of synthetic sodium zeolite with a si al si framework tetrahedral structure and large specific surface area due to the zeolite molecular sieve had a weak adsorption effect on anions it can be modified by hydrochloric acid during the preparation process which made it hydrophobic and non polar and easy to adsorb the f as shown in ftir analysis al f was found after the f adsorption it was illustrated that al oh in zeolite molecular sieves can be protonated and had ion exchange reaction with fluoride ions mukherjee et al 2018 4 conclusion drinking fluoride contaminated groundwater for prolonged time can cause severe harm to human health this study focused on preparing a low cost environmentally friendly adsorbent zro2 ze for treating fluoride in groundwater the adsorbent was mainly characterized by use of micro zirconia which was lower cost compared to nano zirconia additionally the prepared zro2 ze can act as an adsorbent for the groundwater treatment with good adsorption for fluoride when initial fluoride concentration was 5 mg l removal rate of fluoride can reach 94 89 by using this zro2 ze adsorbent with dose of 2g 150 ml contact time of 8h ph value of 6 and temperature of 25 c based on results of characterization and adsorption mechanism of xrd and ftir zr o and zr oh in zirconium have significant contribution in adsorption efficiency and al oh in zeolite molecular sieves also had ion exchange reaction with fluoride ions the regeneration study revealed that the zro2 ze has good adsorption efficiency of 79 65 after regenerated by 1m naoh solution higher than na2co3 nahco3 and nacl future research on this zro2 ze adsorbent will focus on the optimization of regeneration processes and experiments on dynamic processes to provide technical parameters for large scale production applications declaration of
