12625,the ballast water management convention bwmc establishes limits for viable organisms in discharged ballast water uv based ballast water management systems bmws are among the most common especially those with low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury lamps an interesting alternative to mercury lamps could be uv leds that have been developing over recent years uva uvb and uvc leds have been tested as a method to inactivate microalgae in ballast water for this study the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum was selected as a target organism comparing the d 2 dose required to achieve two log reductions for p tricornutum from different uv treatments it was observed that uvc leds were 74 2 more efficient than uvb leds and compared with previous studies 48 1 more efficient than uvc lp mercury lamps if a five day dark post treatment was combined with the uv irradiation to avoid photoreactivation uvc leds were 90 more efficient than uvb leds and compared with previous studies 36 8 more efficient than uvc lp mercury lamps no damage with or without photoreactivation was caused by uva irradiation with doses up to 4 104 mj cm 2 the combination of peroxymonosulfate pms with uva uvb and uvc leds did not significantly increase the inactivation and the combination of the peroxydisulfate pds with uvc leds slightly decreases the inactivation compared with uvc irradiation alone in conclusion uvc leds were the most efficient for inactivating p tricornutum and the combination of pms and pds with uv leds did not notably improve it graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ballast water uv leds photoreactivation persulfate salts advanced oxidation processes aops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the spread of organisms between different ecosystems occurs in various ways one of the most important vectors is ballast water which negatively impacts economically environmentally and socially with invasive species in addition the number of invasions by non indigenous species has been increasing over the preceding years 1 6 since ballast water is an important pathway for the dispersal of species in the marine environment 1 7 8 the international maritime organization imo adopted the international convention for the control and management of ballast water and sediments from ships bwmc 9 in 2004 it entered into force in 2017 and is currently ratified by 88 countries representing approximately 91 20 of the world merchant fleet 10 the regulation d2 ballast water performance standard of the bwmc establishes limits on the allowable maximum concentration of viable organisms in discharged ballast water table 1 beginning in the year 2024 ships will be required to have a ballast water management system bwms in place for achieving this d2 standard ballast water treatment can be applied during the procedures of ballasting or the de ballasting in both procedures or during the journey most bwmss consist of a mechanical filtration or separation followed by a disinfection treatment chemical physical or both with ultraviolet radiation as the most current common option 11 13 the code for approval of ballast water management systems bmws code defines viable organisms as organisms that have the ability to successfully generate new individuals in order to reproduce the species 14 since the bwmc refers to viable organisms and uv radiation most commonly approved bwms primarily affects the viability of the organisms the evaluation of the treatment efficacy requires using techniques such as growth phase modelling that are focused on determining the organisms that are able to reproduce 15 16 17 uv radiation has a number of advantages such as the effectiveness on damaging dna preventing the reproduction of the organisms or other cellular structures resulting in cell death in certain cases the safety of its use or the minimum production of toxic disinfection by products 18 20 one disadvantage of uv radiation as a treatment is the lack of residual effect that allows the regrowth of organisms once they are exposed to favourable environmental conditions 21 22 regrowth can be due to organisms that were not affected by the treatment as well as those that recovered their viability through dna repair processes such as photoreactivation and dark repair with the former being more effective 23 24 nonetheless it has been demonstrated that photorepair processes can be limited by the combination of uvc radiation and the absence of light during storage in the ballast tanks 25 ultraviolet light can be divided into three wavelength regions uva 315 400 nm uvb 280 315 nm and uvc 200 280 nm 26 the action mode of uv radiation can differ according to the uv emissions range as the dna maximum absorption peak is at 260 nm 27 the uvc presents the higher inactivation because it is highly absorbed by the dna but also presents much more photoreactivation that could considerably decrease the effectiveness of the treatment the uvb is partially absorbed by the dna and causes less damage than the uvc and also presents less photoreactivation the uva is not absorbed by the dna but it is capable of damaging cell membranes and other cellular components by oxidative damage 28 31 the combination of uv radiation with persulfate salts usually applied in the form of peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds could increase the inactivation effect with the formation of radicals principally sulfate radicals so4 with high reactivity 32 34 it can result in an advanced oxidation processes aop that can also advantageously prolong the effect of the treatment allow disinfection beyond the time of exposure to uv radiation and avoiding possible growth during the storage in the ballast tanks thanks to the residual oxidants that are formed another advantage of this disinfection enhancement is the possibility of reducing the necessary uv dose required to reach the d2 standard and consequently lower energy consumption to date most of the studies on the combination of uv with pms and pds in the search for aops with leds as a source of uv radiation have been with bacteria and not with microalgae during the preceding years the development of uv light emitting diode uv led technologies have made uv leds a promising source to replace uv mercury lamps for water disinfection processes uv leds are safer because of the absence of mercury have a higher energy efficiency longer lifetime faster start time no need for a warm up time lower heat generation easier control of the temperature and high design flexibility because of the small size of the units 35 37 the objective of the present paper is to evaluate the inactivation effectiveness of the three different uv emission wavelengths uva uvb uvc provided by uv leds the photoreactivation associated with them and the improvement of the inactivation by their combination with persulfate salts pms and pds the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum was used as a standard organism for the experiments and growth modelling was the technique employed to determine the inactivation of each treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 organisms culture medium and pre treatment procedure the target organism used in this work was the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum oval morphotype ccmm 07 0402 that was provided by the marine microalgal culture collection of the institute of marine sciences of andalucía the selection of p tricornutum was based on a number of general favourable characteristics for experimentation such as its worldwide distribution 38 and its use as a standard organism for water quality bioassays 39 further several other organism s features made it specifically interesting for this work on one hand its high growth rate 40 was advantageous for growth modelling on the other hand its relatively high sensitivity to uv radiation allows analysing the inactivation overcoming the problem of the low output power of actual uvc leds few milliwatts and the consequential relatively low doses associated with it 37 41 the culture medium was ground saltwater from the campus of puerto real of the university of cadiz ph 7 65 and conductivity 48 9 ms cm 1 that was sterilized in autoclave and enriched with guillard f 2 medium 42 and 500 μg l 1 of silicate the cultures were maintained in a culture chamber at 20 c with continuous light with a photosynthetically active radiation of 36 μeinstein m 2 s 1 qsl 2100 radiometer biospherical instruments inc san diego ca usa after dilution in a fresh medium the organisms needed time to acclimatize 43 44 in the case of p tricornutum the dilution in the fresh medium two days before the experiment was sufficient for ensuring acclimatization and the application of the treatment in the exponential growth phase 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 uv reactor samples were irradiated with a collimated beam reactor cbr with uva uvb and uvc independent leds photolab led275 0 01 300 0 03 365 1cb apria systems s l guarnizo spain main parameters of the uv leds are shown in table 2 the distance from the leds to the sample surface was 12 2 cm and the irradiance reaching the surface of the target culture was measured with a radiometer hd2102 1 delta ohm srl pd italy that was equipped with the corresponding uv probe according to the wavelength range delta ohm lp471uva for uva delta ohm lp471uvb for uvb and delta ohm lp471uvbc for uvc the mean intensity i m was calculated according to the protocol of bolton linden 87 based on the reactor morphometry and measured irradiance and water transmittance the uv dose was determined as the product of the i m and the exposure time 2 2 2 uv irradiation and incubation in each experimental series aliquots of 20 ml of the target culture were placed in a petri plate of 5 5 cm of internal diameter and subsequently irradiated with one wavelength of the uv leds fig 1 during the uv irradiation the cultures were continuously homogenized with a magnetic stirrer considering the different action mode of the three wavelengths the exposure times of each wavelength were defined according to their specific emission uva 2 5 46 6 min 2 103 4 104 mj cm 2 uvb 1 2 30 0 min 10 9 271 8 mj cm 2 or uvc 1 2 18 1 min 4 2 63 0 mj cm 2 following the treatment all of the samples were placed in the culture chamber each uv dose was the content of two petri plates treated subsequently and placed in borosilicate flasks two different incubations were performed i untreated culture and treated cultures that were immediately exposed to light and ii untreated culture and treated cultures that were covered for five days with aluminium foil to imitate the storage in the ballast tanks after the treatment the day of exposure to light was considered as day 0 of the growth comparing the untreated sample covered for five days with the untreated sample immediately exposed to light the effect due to only the darkness was calculated 2 3 determining the concentration of viable organisms after the treatment cell concentration was monitored throughout the post treatment incubation with chlorophyll fluorescence measurements according to the linear correlation between them and the cell concentration measured by microscopy and the neubauer chamber determined in previous studies 45 the chlorophyll fluorescence along the post treatment incubation was measured with a microplate fluorescence reader tecan infinite f200 software tecan i control 1 6 19 2 plate corning 96 flat bottom white polystyrol excitation at 360 nm emission at 670 nm 25 flashes 20 μs integration time three different measurements were made for each sample growth curves were obtained by plotting chlorophyll fluorescence measurements in logarithmic scale since the detection of exponential growth versus exposure time to environmental light the growth of the cultures followed a verhulst logistic model 46 47 with an initial phase without significant changes in the cell concentration a second phase with exponential growth and a final phase with no significant increases in the cell concentration as the culture became closer to the carrying capacity a simplification of the logistic model used in previous studies 48 2021 17 to the exponential model eq 1 in which n v concentration of viable organisms cells ml 1 at the time equal to t d n v0 initial concentration of viable organisms cells ml 1 r growth rate d 1 was done considering that only the points of the exponential phase are those that influence the calculation of the number of viable cells after treatment 1 n v t n v 0 ⅇ rt survival s was calculated as the quotient between the nv 0 of the treated samples and nv 0 of the untreated sample immediately exposed to light of the same experiment inactivation curves were determined by representing the values of log s against the uv dose the ginafit tool for ms excel 49 was used to fit the inactivation curves to the best inactivation model and to obtain the corresponding inactivation kinetics parameters the d n parameter uv dose required to achieve n log reductions was utilized to compare the inactivation effect of the different uv leds 2 4 determining the effect of uv irradiation combined with persulfate salts 2 4 1 determination of the test concentration two persulfate salts were selected to be combined with ultraviolet light peroxymonosulfate salt pms hso5 oxone sigma aldrich khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 and peroxydisulfate salt pds s2o8 2 panreac applichem 98 na2s2o8 a toxicity assay was performed to determine the initial concentration to use for each persulfate salt the formula proposed by hampel et al 50 was employed to determine the concentration that causes the minimum amount of damage this was established as causing 10 of the inhibition and allows quantifying possible inactivation enhancement by the combination of the persulfate salts and the uv irradiation concentrations between 0 34 and 6 78 μm were tested in the pms and 1 66 μm was determined as the concentration to be applied in pms uv experiments concentrations up to 0 430 mm were tested in pds and no inactivation was observed therefore it was decided to select 0 043 and 0 430 mm as the concentrations to be applied in pds uv experiments 2 4 2 determination of the uv wavelengths combinations to decide which uv wavelengths would be combined with the pms and pds a uv vis spectrum was obtained with a spectrophotometer jenway 7315 for each salt solution fig 2 both persulfate salts have considerable absorbance in the uvc range but only the pms has some absorbance in the uvb and uva range therefore the pds was only combined with uvc wavelength while the pms was combined with the three uv wavelengths 2 4 3 experimental setup and persulfate salts decay monitoring during the experiments the addition of the pms and pds was performed simultaneously with the initiation of uv irradiation in both cases the corresponding volume of each persulfate salt solution was added in a single dose to the petri plate where the culture was being irradiated after the treatment the concentration of the pds was measured by spectrophotometric determination 352 nm with an iodometric titration method 51 to determine their consumption in the case of the pms this was not done due to the low concentration that was tested 1 66 μm 3 results and discussion 3 1 modelling of the growth curves growth curves were obtained by representing the logarithm of the chlorophyll fluorescence versus the incubation time under ambient light the delay in reaching the exponential phase was proportional to the uv dose that was applied the growth curve of one of the experiments with uvc is shown as an example in order to understand the modelling of the growth curves fig 3 as was mentioned in section 2 3 only the data from the exponential phase were considered for the modelling considering that photorepair occurs in the first hours after the irradiation 52 the delay in reaching the exponential phase in treated samples was due to a decrease in the initial concentration of viable organisms caused by the uv irradiation the growth curves of the different samples of each experimental series were analyzed together further anova for variables in the order fitted with statgraphics centurion xvi software 16 1 03 to ascertain their corresponding intercept and slope values as well as determining if there were significant differences between their slopes growth rate r since there were none in practically all of the cases it was decided to assume the same r for all of the growth curves of the same experimental series in addition no relevant changes were observed in the slopes due to uv wavelength uva uvb or uvc or post treatment conditions light immediately after treatment or five days of darkness this absence of influence of the treatment on the r was already observed in previous studies 45 48 the growth rate r mean se from all of the experiments was 0 74 0 04 d 1 n 19 intercept values decreased according to the uv dose that was applied and were used to determine the values of nv 0 3 2 inactivation curves and kinetic parameters due to the characteristics of each of the wavelengths the same uv exposure times result in very different dose values to better understand the differences between the three wavelengths inactivation curves were obtained by confronting log s versus exposure time samples with a dark post treatment avoid photorepair processes due to darkness while samples exposed to light immediately after irradiation undergo these processes that can repair part of the dna damage 25 the uva inactivation curve described a log linear inactivation characterized by maintaining the inactivation rate k constant throughout the different doses eq 2 in which s survival of organisms s 0 initial survival of organisms k inactivation rate min 1 t exposure time min 53 the uvc and uvb inactivation curves described a log linear with shoulder inactivation characterized by a first stage with practically no disinfection up to a threshold dose followed by a log linear disinfection stage eq 3 in which s survival of organisms s 0 initial survival of organisms k inactivation rate min 1 sl shoulder length min t exposure time min 54 fig 4 the kinetic constants values of the models are indicated in table 3 2 s t s 0 e k t 3 s t s 0 e k t e k sl 1 e k sl 1 e k t to compare with literature results uv doses for each of the wavelengths to achieve one d 1 two d 2 and three log reductions d 3 were calculated practically no inactivation was observed for the uva wavelength therefore the dose required for the different log reductions could not be calculated based on the data that were obtained table 4 3 2 1 uva wavelength practically no inactivation of p tricornutum was observed with the uva doses tested in this study 2 103 4 104 mj cm 2 in addition no increase in inactivation was observed due to the five day dark post treatment table 3 the results obtained were compared with those of previous studies using different organisms the dose response mj cm 2 per log reduction at uva irradiation of 365 nm for e coli with 13 8 103 mj cm 2 28 55 3 103 mj cm 2 55 or 260 0 103 mj cm 2 56 or for other organisms like salmonella enteritidis with 148 3 103 mj cm 2 at 365 nm 55 or mesophilic bacteria with 12 5 mj cm 2 at 365 nm or 88 mj cm 2 at 405 57 indicates a notably greater resistance by p tricornutum for which doses up to 4 104 mj cm 2 at 365 nm caused practically no inactivation the minimal amount of damage produced by the uva irradiation is consistent with the low energy of the wavelength and being outside the absorption spectrum of dna ranging from 200 nm to 300 nm 58 60 on the other hand the lack of increase in disinfection by the five day dark post treatment table 3 is consistent with the absence of absorbance of uva radiation by the dna and therefore there is no photoreparable damage 31 55 although some studies show substantial damage to some pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria with uva 28 55 they are based on very high doses and long exposures that make it an ineffective especially in the case of ballast water 3 2 2 uvb wavelength in this study there was considerable damage to p tricornutum by the uvb irradiation and a five day dark post treatment increased the efficacy of the treatment by preventing photoreactivation with an increase of 13 5 on the k table 3 inactivation data from other organisms of the literature were compared with the results from this study the dose response from e coli with different uvb wavelengths with 94 8 mj cm 2 at 310 nm 30 5 5 mj cm 2 at 285 nm 56 and 26 9 mj cm 2 at 300 nm 61 and from other organisms with 300 nm with 23 4 mj cm 2 for pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 8 mj cm 2 for legionella pneumophila 38 4 mj cm 2 for the bacteriophage qβ and 525 0 mj cm 2 for bacillus subtilis spores 61 indicate a higher resistance from p tricornutum 152 5 mj cm 2 at 300 nm d 1 from table 4 with the exception of the bacillus subtilis spores compared to the d 1 of other marine microalgae such as tetraselmis sp treated with uvb leds 516 mj cm 2 at 280 nm and more than 2000 mj cm 2 at 300 nm 58 p tricornutum has more sensitivity to uvb irradiation 152 5 mj cm 2 at 300 nm d 1 from table 4 in the case of the uvb wavelength 280 315 nm some of it is absorbed by the dna and thymidine dimers are formed 62 which would explain the higher inactivation of uvb irradiation at the same dose compared to uva irradiation table 4 the lower k in the samples without a dark post treatment table 3 is consistent with the reparation of the damage throughout the photorepair processes 56 63 more radiation is absorbed by the dna when the wavelength in the uvb region is closer to the dna absorption peak 260 nm 26 and higher increases in inactivation could be achieved in these cases if photoreactivation is avoided 3 2 3 uvc wavelength in this study p tricornutum was significantly damaged by the uvc irradiation and a five day dark post treatment increased the efficacy of the treatment by preventing photoreactivation with an increase of 45 6 on the k table 3 comparing with the dose response of other type of organisms at different uvc wavelengths with leds p tricornutum showed higher resistance 28 4 mj cm 2 at 275 nm d1 from table 4 in practically all of the cases with the exception of the adenovirus 5 atcc vr5 and in some studies the bacteriophages ms2 and qβ table 5 in this experiment the emission peak of the uvc leds was 275 nm and the inactivation of p tricornutum would probably have been different at other wavelengths as demonstrated by the inactivations for the same organism at various wavelengths table 5 to compare inactivations and photoreactivation in microalgae between leds and mercury lamps low lp and medium mp pressure the d 2 parameter dose required to reach two log reductions was used this parameter was selected considering that two log reductions were needed to achieve the minimum concentration of organisms between 10 and 50 μm in discharged ballast water 10 cells ml 1 from the minimum concentration established by the bwmc 103 cells ml 1 to test the bwms 14 the d 2 without a dark post treatment for p tricornutum with uvc leds 42 9 mj cm 2 was significantly lower than the d 2 with uvc lp mercury lamps 82 7 mj cm 2 p 0 031 analysis of covariance ancova under the same experimental conditions 45 indicating a higher efficiency of uvc leds this dose with the uvc leds was also lower than the d 2 with uvc lp and mp mercury lamps applied to other microalgae like t suecica with values between 83 8 and 636 4 mj cm 2 33 71 72 or synechococcus sp and anabaena sp with values of 240 7 and 111 8 mj cm 2 respectively 45 this improvement in the inactivation from the uvc leds over uvc mercury lamps agrees with data from studies with other organisms 58 65 73 on the other hand comparing with uvc leds inactivation at different wavelengths for other marine microalgae like the diatom asterionellopsis glacialis 256 262 268 and 274 nm or the chlorophyta tetraselmis sp 265 and 280 nm 58 74 indicated a lower resistance by p tricornutum that was consistent with its high sensitivity to uv radiation 45 photoreactivation makes it possible in the presence of light to repair dna damage caused by uv irradiation within the uvc region although it is less energetic with a higher wavelength and the damage should be lower the photoreactivation is also lower thus the treatment may end up being more effective if this is considered 29 30 65 in p tricornutum there is an increase in the d 2 due to the photoreactivation from 23 7 to 42 9 mj cm 2 factor of 1 8 when it is irradiated with uvc leds and from 37 5 to 82 7 mj cm 2 factor of 2 2 when it is irradiated with a uv lp mercury lamp 45 the lower photoreactivation in the case of the uvc leds used in this study 275 nm compared with lp mercury lamps 254 nm was expected due to its greater distance to the absorption peak of the dna 260 nm and is consistent with other results from the literature for e coli 29 65 75 on the other hand the absence of differences observed by 65 between photoreactivation with uvc leds at 265 nm and lp mercury lamps at 254 nm in e coli could be related to the fact that they are practically at the same distance from the absorption peak of the dna 260 nm the uvc wavelength is the most energetic one and its entire spectrum 200 280 nm is absorbed by the dna additionally the peak of absorption from the dna 260 nm 26 is in its region for these reasons the uvc has been the one most used for disinfection the data from this experiment agree with those from the literature where uvc irradiation has the most germicidal effect and the higher photoreactivation 29 30 56 61 3 2 4 application of the three different wavelengths in the ships when implementing a uv based bwms the differences in inactivation and subsequent photoreactivation of the various wavelengths must be considered the results of this experiment seem to indicate a higher resistance to uv radiation at the three wavelengths uva uvb and uvc of phytoplanktonic organisms than that for viruses and bacteria this is consistent with uvc data from the literature 44 uva leds alone would not be of interest for ballast water treatment specially focused on microalgae inactivation because of the enormous doses that are needed additionally no photoreactivation is associated with the uva irradiation therefore the possibility of increasing the efficacy of the treatment by avoiding it treating at the ballasting procedure and subsequent storage in darkness in the ballast tanks is not possible although the inactivation with uvb leds is higher than with uva leds they are less effective for inactivating microalgae compared with mercury lamps that are the most used at present the d 2 parameter has been used to compare the differences between both uv treatments applied to p tricornutum without a dark post treatment uvb leds are 65 less efficient than a uvc lp mercury lamp while uvb leds are 77 6 less efficient with a five day dark post treatment table 6 45 in the case of uvc leds the d 2 parameter was also used to compare with the other uv treatments applied to p tricornutum it was observed that uvc leds were the most efficient of all of the uv leds tested in this study without a dark post treatment uvc leds were 74 2 more efficient than uvb leds and 48 1 more efficient than uvc lp mercury lamps table 6 with a five day dark post treatment the uvc leds were 90 more efficient than uvb leds and 36 8 more efficient than uvc lp mercury lamps table 6 considering the possibility of avoiding photoreactivation by dark storage in ballast tanks it might be interesting to develop uvc leds with emission peaks closer to the absorbance peak of dna in these cases the combination of uvc irradiation and subsequent storage in ballast tanks would further enhance inactivation 3 3 combination of uv leds with pms and pds as described in section 2 4 2 the uv vis spectra of the two persulfate salts was obtained for determining the best uv emission wavelength if the absorption and emission spectra coincide a possible photolysis of the compound is ensured and therefore greater efficiency accordingly it was decided to combine the pms with the three uv wavelengths uva uvb and uvc and the pds with the uvc wavelength the activation of the pms and the pds with uvc 32 34 and uva 76 78 has been demonstrated and tested as a way to increase disinfection on the other hand while some activation studies of the pms with solar light that includes uva and uvb have been done 79 81 the authors did not find research about pms combined with only uvb 3 3 1 inactivation curves of uv lights combined with pms and pds in the case of the pms looking for a moderate effect of uv irradiation and based on the results from section 3 2 an exposure time of 5 min was selected for the uvc and the same exposure time was considered for the other wavelengths five minutes of exposure suppose uv doses of 17 4 45 3 and 3606 9 mj cm 2 at uvc uvb and uva wavelength respectively in the case of pds in both concentrations 0 043 and 0 430 mm exposures times of 10 and 20 min of the uvc wavelength were selected suppose 34 8 and 69 6 mj cm 2 respectively these longer exposure times and thus higher uv doses for pds were based on its higher stability compared to pms 34 the pms by itself causes significant damage to p tricornutum and if an increase in inactivation due to its combination with uv irradiation is the desired effect very low concentrations must be used in the toxicity assay it was ascertained that 1 78 μm caused an inhibition of 54 5 of the initial culture while 3 39 μm caused an inhibition of 98 0 considering the inactivation of the pms uvc and uvb alone with 0 04 0 31 and 0 07 log reductions respectively there was a higher inactivation by combining the pms with uvc 0 43 log reductions and uvb 0 21 log reductions than the simple addition of their inactivations alone these increases in the inactivation when uvc and uvb were combined with pms might be related to the wavelengths used 275 nm for uvc leds and 300 nm for uvb leds that produce strong absorption into pms fig 2 uvc irradiation produces more biological damage to microalgae than uvb irradiation accordingly the increase effect due to the combination of the uv pms is more evident in the uvb region than the uvc fig 5 no enhancement of inactivation was determined with the combination of uva and pms as its inactivation was the same as that with only pms fig 5a probably higher exposure times would be needed to obtain a more efficient process in the case of uva in any case p tricornutum was found to be very sensitive to the pms which agrees with literature for other microalgae such as microcystis aeruginosa 82 therefore it would be difficult to correctly quantify the increasing effect by combination with uv because of the lowest pms doses used in the case of the combination of the pds with uvc a slight detrimental effect was obtained compared with uvc alone in the present study and according to the literature 82 83 the effect of pds by itself was negligible thus the combination with uvc was expected to accelerate the inactivation of p tricornutum due to the photolysis of pds into sulfate radicals absorption of the pds into 275 nm uvc from the leds of this study was confirmed by a uv vis spectra fig 2 the slight consumption of the pds after uvc irradiation 0 8 in the first 20 min was consistent with that seen in other studies 84 although no pds was detected in the cultures on the last day of the inactivation experiment day 12 no inactivation enhancement was detected in the tested conditions similar experiences have been reported with algal organic matter mineralization 85 in this scenario it is important to take into account that specific parameters such as pds dosage uv wavelength or inorganic substances that are present in water can influence the uv activation of pds 86 in this case a complex aqueous matrix could have notably influenced the process due to the significant amount of inorganic organic compounds inherent in microalgal cultures the emission wavelength at 275 nm also differs a bit in previous studies that obtain disinfection enhancement under a uv pds process 32 88 89 that utilizes 254 nm as an emission source additionally the stability of pds 83 makes its efficient activation difficult under these conditions accordingly more research must be conducted in the future in order to clarify the effects and performance of uv pds on seawater microalgae 4 conclusions uva uvb and uvc leds have been tested as methods of inactivating microalgae in ballast water by using the diatom p tricornutum as the target organism the inactivation efficiency and the level of photoreactivation of the three wavelengths observed in this study follows uva uvb uvc on the other hand comparing results from this study and from previous studies that used uvc leds and uvc from mercury lamps low pressure or medium pressure it was determined that the inactivation with leds is higher with the same doses finally the combination of the three uv wavelengths with the pms and uvc with pds was tested in p tricornutum there was a slight increase when the pms was combined with uvc and uvb but not when it was combined with uva the combination of uvb with the pms was especially relevant since although there are data on uvc and uva as a source of pms activation in the literature no references to uvb alone as a source of activation were found by the authors in the case of the pds no increase on the inactivation was ascertained with its combination with uvc p tricornutum as a representative of phytoplanktonic organisms has demonstrated higher resistance than viruses and bacteria to uv based treatments at the three wavelengths which must be considered for future research in testing bwmss considering the implementation of a bwms uvc leds would be a promising technology due to their higher efficacy compared to uvc mercury lamps although it would be interesting to develop uvc leds with greater output power on the other hand the combination of uv leds with persulfate salts would not enhance the inactivation therefore the treatment with only uv irradiation would be safer and less expensive

lp mercury lamps if a five day dark post treatment was combined with the uv irradiation to avoid photoreactivation uvc leds were 90 more efficient than uvb leds and compared with previous studies 36 8 more efficient than uvc lp mercury lamps no damage with or without photoreactivation was caused by uva irradiation with doses up to 4 104 mj cm 2 the combination of peroxymonosulfate pms with uva uvb and uvc leds did not significantly increase the inactivation and the combination of the peroxydisulfate pds with uvc leds slightly decreases the inactivation compared with uvc irradiation alone in conclusion uvc leds were the most efficient for inactivating p tricornutum and the combination of pms and pds with uv leds did not notably improve it graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ballast water uv leds photoreactivation persulfate salts advanced oxidation processes aops data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the spread of organisms between different ecosystems occurs in various ways one of the most important vectors is ballast water which negatively impacts economically environmentally and socially with invasive species in addition the number of invasions by non indigenous species has been increasing over the preceding years 1 6 since ballast water is an important pathway for the dispersal of species in the marine environment 1 7 8 the international maritime organization imo adopted the international convention for the control and management of ballast water and sediments from ships bwmc 9 in 2004 it entered into force in 2017 and is currently ratified by 88 countries representing approximately 91 20 of the world merchant fleet 10 the regulation d2 ballast water performance standard of the bwmc establishes limits on the allowable maximum concentration of viable organisms in discharged ballast water table 1 beginning in the year 2024 ships will be required to have a ballast water management system bwms in place for achieving this d2 standard ballast water treatment can be applied during the procedures of ballasting or the de ballasting in both procedures or during the journey most bwmss consist of a mechanical filtration or separation followed by a disinfection treatment chemical physical or both with ultraviolet radiation as the most current common option 11 13 the code for approval of ballast water management systems bmws code defines viable organisms as organisms that have the ability to successfully generate new individuals in order to reproduce the species 14 since the bwmc refers to viable organisms and uv radiation most commonly approved bwms primarily affects the viability of the organisms the evaluation of the treatment efficacy requires using techniques such as growth phase modelling that are focused on determining the organisms that are able to reproduce 15 16 17 uv radiation has a number of advantages such as the effectiveness on damaging dna preventing the reproduction of the organisms or other cellular structures resulting in cell death in certain cases the safety of its use or the minimum production of toxic disinfection by products 18 20 one disadvantage of uv radiation as a treatment is the lack of residual effect that allows the regrowth of organisms once they are exposed to favourable environmental conditions 21 22 regrowth can be due to organisms that were not affected by the treatment as well as those that recovered their viability through dna repair processes such as photoreactivation and dark repair with the former being more effective 23 24 nonetheless it has been demonstrated that photorepair processes can be limited by the combination of uvc radiation and the absence of light during storage in the ballast tanks 25 ultraviolet light can be divided into three wavelength regions uva 315 400 nm uvb 280 315 nm and uvc 200 280 nm 26 the action mode of uv radiation can differ according to the uv emissions range as the dna maximum absorption peak is at 260 nm 27 the uvc presents the higher inactivation because it is highly absorbed by the dna but also presents much more photoreactivation that could considerably decrease the effectiveness of the treatment the uvb is partially absorbed by the dna and causes less damage than the uvc and also presents less photoreactivation the uva is not absorbed by the dna but it is capable of damaging cell membranes and other cellular components by oxidative damage 28 31 the combination of uv radiation with persulfate salts usually applied in the form of peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds could increase the inactivation effect with the formation of radicals principally sulfate radicals so4 with high reactivity 32 34 it can result in an advanced oxidation processes aop that can also advantageously prolong the effect of the treatment allow disinfection beyond the time of exposure to uv radiation and avoiding possible growth during the storage in the ballast tanks thanks to the residual oxidants that are formed another advantage of this disinfection enhancement is the possibility of reducing the necessary uv dose required to reach the d2 standard and consequently lower energy consumption to date most of the studies on the combination of uv with pms and pds in the search for aops with leds as a source of uv radiation have been with bacteria and not with microalgae during the preceding years the development of uv light emitting diode uv led technologies have made uv leds a promising source to replace uv mercury lamps for water disinfection processes uv leds are safer because of the absence of mercury have a higher energy efficiency longer lifetime faster start time no need for a warm up time lower heat generation easier control of the temperature and high design flexibility because of the small size of the units 35 37 the objective of the present paper is to evaluate the inactivation effectiveness of the three different uv emission wavelengths uva uvb uvc provided by uv leds the photoreactivation associated with them and the improvement of the inactivation by their combination with persulfate salts pms and pds the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum was used as a standard organism for the experiments and growth modelling was the technique employed to determine the inactivation of each treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 organisms culture medium and pre treatment procedure the target organism used in this work was the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum oval morphotype ccmm 07 0402 that was provided by the marine microalgal culture collection of the institute of marine sciences of andalucía the selection of p tricornutum was based on a number of general favourable characteristics for experimentation such as its worldwide distribution 38 and its use as a standard organism for water quality bioassays 39 further several other organism s features made it specifically interesting for this work on one hand its high growth rate 40 was advantageous for growth modelling on the other hand its relatively high sensitivity to uv radiation allows analysing the inactivation overcoming the problem of the low output power of actual uvc leds few milliwatts and the consequential relatively low doses associated with it 37 41 the culture medium was ground saltwater from the campus of puerto real of the university of cadiz ph 7 65 and conductivity 48 9 ms cm 1 that was sterilized in autoclave and enriched with guillard f 2 medium 42 and 500 μg l 1 of silicate the cultures were maintained in a culture chamber at 20 c with continuous light with a photosynthetically active radiation of 36 μeinstein m 2 s 1 qsl 2100 radiometer biospherical instruments inc san diego ca usa after dilution in a fresh medium the organisms needed time to acclimatize 43 44 in the case of p tricornutum the dilution in the fresh medium two days before the experiment was sufficient for ensuring acclimatization and the application of the treatment in the exponential growth phase 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 uv reactor samples were irradiated with a collimated beam reactor cbr with uva uvb and uvc independent leds photolab led275 0 01 300 0 03 365 1cb apria systems s l guarnizo spain main parameters of the uv leds are shown in table 2 the distance from the leds to the sample surface was 12 2 cm and the irradiance reaching the surface of the target culture was measured with a radiometer hd2102 1 delta ohm srl pd italy that was equipped with the corresponding uv probe according to the wavelength range delta ohm lp471uva for uva delta ohm lp471uvb for uvb and delta ohm lp471uvbc for uvc the mean intensity i m was calculated according to the protocol of bolton linden 87 based on the reactor morphometry and measured irradiance and water transmittance the uv dose was determined as the product of the i m and the exposure time 2 2 2 uv irradiation and incubation in each experimental series aliquots of 20 ml of the target culture were placed in a petri plate of 5 5 cm of internal diameter and subsequently irradiated with one wavelength of the uv leds fig 1 during the uv irradiation the cultures were continuously homogenized with a magnetic stirrer considering the different action mode of the three wavelengths the exposure times of each wavelength were defined according to their specific emission uva 2 5 46 6 min 2 103 4 104 mj cm 2 uvb 1 2 30 0 min 10 9 271 8 mj cm 2 or uvc 1 2 18 1 min 4 2 63 0 mj cm 2 following the treatment all of the samples were placed in the culture chamber each uv dose was the content of two petri plates treated subsequently and placed in borosilicate flasks two different incubations were performed i untreated culture and treated cultures that were immediately exposed to light and ii untreated culture and treated cultures that were covered for five days with aluminium foil to imitate the storage in the ballast tanks after the treatment the day of exposure to light was considered as day 0 of the growth comparing the untreated sample covered for five days with the untreated sample immediately exposed to light the effect due to only the darkness was calculated 2 3 determining the concentration of viable organisms after the treatment cell concentration was monitored throughout the post treatment incubation with chlorophyll fluorescence measurements according to the linear correlation between them and the cell concentration measured by microscopy and the neubauer chamber determined in previous studies 45 the chlorophyll fluorescence along the post treatment incubation was measured with a microplate fluorescence reader tecan infinite f200 software tecan i control 1 6 19 2 plate corning 96 flat bottom white polystyrol excitation at 360 nm emission at 670 nm 25 flashes 20 μs integration time three different measurements were made for each sample growth curves were obtained by plotting chlorophyll fluorescence measurements in logarithmic scale since the detection of exponential growth versus exposure time to environmental light the growth of the cultures followed a verhulst logistic model 46 47 with an initial phase without significant changes in the cell concentration a second phase with exponential growth and a final phase with no significant increases in the cell concentration as the culture became closer to the carrying capacity a simplification of the logistic model used in previous studies 48 2021 17 to the exponential model eq 1 in which n v concentration of viable organisms cells ml 1 at the time equal to t d n v0 initial concentration of viable organisms cells ml 1 r growth rate d 1 was done considering that only the points of the exponential phase are those that influence the calculation of the number of viable cells after treatment 1 n v t n v 0 ⅇ rt survival s was calculated as the quotient between the nv 0 of the treated samples and nv 0 of the untreated sample immediately exposed to light of the same experiment inactivation curves were determined by representing the values of log s against the uv dose the ginafit tool for ms excel 49 was used to fit the inactivation curves to the best inactivation model and to obtain the corresponding inactivation kinetics parameters the d n parameter uv dose required to achieve n log reductions was utilized to compare the inactivation effect of the different uv leds 2 4 determining the effect of uv irradiation combined with persulfate salts 2 4 1 determination of the test concentration two persulfate salts were selected to be combined with ultraviolet light peroxymonosulfate salt pms hso5 oxone sigma aldrich khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 and peroxydisulfate salt pds s2o8 2 panreac applichem 98 na2s2o8 a toxicity assay was performed to determine the initial concentration to use for each persulfate salt the formula proposed by hampel et al 50 was employed to determine the concentration that causes the minimum amount of damage this was established as causing 10 of the inhibition and allows quantifying possible inactivation enhancement by the combination of the persulfate salts and the uv irradiation concentrations between 0 34 and 6 78 μm were tested in the pms and 1 66 μm was determined as the concentration to be applied in pms uv experiments concentrations up to 0 430 mm were tested in pds and no inactivation was observed therefore it was decided to select 0 043 and 0 430 mm as the concentrations to be applied in pds uv experiments 2 4 2 determination of the uv wavelengths combinations to decide which uv wavelengths would be combined with the pms and pds a uv vis spectrum was obtained with a spectrophotometer jenway 7315 for each salt solution fig 2 both persulfate salts have considerable absorbance in the uvc range but only the pms has some absorbance in the uvb and uva range therefore the pds was only combined with uvc wavelength while the pms was combined with the three uv wavelengths 2 4 3 experimental setup and persulfate salts decay monitoring during the experiments the addition of the pms and pds was performed simultaneously with the initiation of uv irradiation in both cases the corresponding volume of each persulfate salt solution was added in a single dose to the petri plate where the culture was being irradiated after the treatment the concentration of the pds was measured by spectrophotometric determination 352 nm with an iodometric titration method 51 to determine their consumption in the case of the pms this was not done due to the low concentration that was tested 1 66 μm 3 results and discussion 3 1 modelling of the growth curves growth curves were obtained by representing the logarithm of the chlorophyll fluorescence versus the incubation time under ambient light the delay in reaching the exponential phase was proportional to the uv dose that was applied the growth curve of one of the experiments with uvc is shown as an example in order to understand the modelling of the growth curves fig 3 as was mentioned in section 2 3 only the data from the exponential phase were considered for the modelling considering that photorepair occurs in the first hours after the irradiation 52 the delay in reaching the exponential phase in treated samples was due to a decrease in the initial concentration of viable organisms caused by the uv irradiation the growth curves of the different samples of each experimental series were analyzed together further anova for variables in the order fitted with statgraphics centurion xvi software 16 1 03 to ascertain their corresponding intercept and slope values as well as determining if there were significant differences between their slopes growth rate r since there were none in practically all of the cases it was decided to assume the same r for all of the growth curves of the same experimental series in addition no relevant changes were observed in the slopes due to uv wavelength uva uvb or uvc or post treatment conditions light immediately after treatment or five days of darkness this absence of influence of the treatment on the r was already observed in previous studies 45 48 the growth rate r mean se from all of the experiments was 0 74 0 04 d 1 n 19 intercept values decreased according to the uv dose that was applied and were used to determine the values of nv 0 3 2 inactivation curves and kinetic parameters due to the characteristics of each of the wavelengths the same uv exposure times result in very different dose values to better understand the differences between the three wavelengths inactivation curves were obtained by confronting log s versus exposure time samples with a dark post treatment avoid photorepair processes due to darkness while samples exposed to light immediately after irradiation undergo these processes that can repair part of the dna damage 25 the uva inactivation curve described a log linear inactivation characterized by maintaining the inactivation rate k constant throughout the different doses eq 2 in which s survival of organisms s 0 initial survival of organisms k inactivation rate min 1 t exposure time min 53 the uvc and uvb inactivation curves described a log linear with shoulder inactivation characterized by a first stage with practically no disinfection up to a threshold dose followed by a log linear disinfection stage eq 3 in which s survival of organisms s 0 initial survival of organisms k inactivation rate min 1 sl shoulder length min t exposure time min 54 fig 4 the kinetic constants values of the models are indicated in table 3 2 s t s 0 e k t 3 s t s 0 e k t e k sl 1 e k sl 1 e k t to compare with literature results uv doses for each of the wavelengths to achieve one d 1 two d 2 and three log reductions d 3 were calculated practically no inactivation was observed for the uva wavelength therefore the dose required for the different log reductions could not be calculated based on the data that were obtained table 4 3 2 1 uva wavelength practically no inactivation of p tricornutum was observed with the uva doses tested in this study 2 103 4 104 mj cm 2 in addition no increase in inactivation was observed due to the five day dark post treatment table 3 the results obtained were compared with those of previous studies using different organisms the dose response mj cm 2 per log reduction at uva irradiation of 365 nm for e coli with 13 8 103 mj cm 2 28 55 3 103 mj cm 2 55 or 260 0 103 mj cm 2 56 or for other organisms like salmonella enteritidis with 148 3 103 mj cm 2 at 365 nm 55 or mesophilic bacteria with 12 5 mj cm 2 at 365 nm or 88 mj cm 2 at 405 57 indicates a notably greater resistance by p tricornutum for which doses up to 4 104 mj cm 2 at 365 nm caused practically no inactivation the minimal amount of damage produced by the uva irradiation is consistent with the low energy of the wavelength and being outside the absorption spectrum of dna ranging from 200 nm to 300 nm 58 60 on the other hand the lack of increase in disinfection by the five day dark post treatment table 3 is consistent with the absence of absorbance of uva radiation by the dna and therefore there is no photoreparable damage 31 55 although some studies show substantial damage to some pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria with uva 28 55 they are based on very high doses and long exposures that make it an ineffective especially in the case of ballast water 3 2 2 uvb wavelength in this study there was considerable damage to p tricornutum by the uvb irradiation and a five day dark post treatment increased the efficacy of the treatment by preventing photoreactivation with an increase of 13 5 on the k table 3 inactivation data from other organisms of the literature were compared with the results from this study the dose response from e coli with different uvb wavelengths with 94 8 mj cm 2 at 310 nm 30 5 5 mj cm 2 at 285 nm 56 and 26 9 mj cm 2 at 300 nm 61 and from other organisms with 300 nm with 23 4 mj cm 2 for pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 8 mj cm 2 for legionella pneumophila 38 4 mj cm 2 for the bacteriophage qβ and 525 0 mj cm 2 for bacillus subtilis spores 61 indicate a higher resistance from p tricornutum 152 5 mj cm 2 at 300 nm d 1 from table 4 with the exception of the bacillus subtilis spores compared to the d 1 of other marine microalgae such as tetraselmis sp treated with uvb leds 516 mj cm 2 at 280 nm and more than 2000 mj cm 2 at 300 nm 58 p tricornutum has more sensitivity to uvb irradiation 152 5 mj cm 2 at 300 nm d 1 from table 4 in the case of the uvb wavelength 280 315 nm some of it is absorbed by the dna and thymidine dimers are formed 62 which would explain the higher inactivation of uvb irradiation at the same dose compared to uva irradiation table 4 the lower k in the samples without a dark post treatment table 3 is consistent with the reparation of the damage throughout the photorepair processes 56 63 more radiation is absorbed by the dna when the wavelength in the uvb region is closer to the dna absorption peak 260 nm 26 and higher increases in inactivation could be achieved in these cases if photoreactivation is avoided 3 2 3 uvc wavelength in this study p tricornutum was significantly damaged by the uvc irradiation and a five day dark post treatment increased the efficacy of the treatment by preventing photoreactivation with an increase of 45 6 on the k table 3 comparing with the dose response of other type of organisms at different uvc wavelengths with leds p tricornutum showed higher resistance 28 4 mj cm 2 at 275 nm d1 from table 4 in practically all of the cases with the exception of the adenovirus 5 atcc vr5 and in some studies the bacteriophages ms2 and qβ table 5 in this experiment the emission peak of the uvc leds was 275 nm and the inactivation of p tricornutum would probably have been different at other wavelengths as demonstrated by the inactivations for the same organism at various wavelengths table 5 to compare inactivations and photoreactivation in microalgae between leds and mercury lamps low lp and medium mp pressure the d 2 parameter dose required to reach two log reductions was used this parameter was selected considering that two log reductions were needed to achieve the minimum concentration of organisms between 10 and 50 μm in discharged ballast water 10 cells ml 1 from the minimum concentration established by the bwmc 103 cells ml 1 to test the bwms 14 the d 2 without a dark post treatment for p tricornutum with uvc leds 42 9 mj cm 2 was significantly lower than the d 2 with uvc lp mercury lamps 82 7 mj cm 2 p 0 031 analysis of covariance ancova under the same experimental conditions 45 indicating a higher efficiency of uvc leds this dose with the uvc leds was also lower than the d 2 with uvc lp and mp mercury lamps applied to other microalgae like t suecica with values between 83 8 and 636 4 mj cm 2 33 71 72 or synechococcus sp and anabaena sp with values of 240 7 and 111 8 mj cm 2 respectively 45 this improvement in the inactivation from the uvc leds over uvc mercury lamps agrees with data from studies with other organisms 58 65 73 on the other hand comparing with uvc leds inactivation at different wavelengths for other marine microalgae like the diatom asterionellopsis glacialis 256 262 268 and 274 nm or the chlorophyta tetraselmis sp 265 and 280 nm 58 74 indicated a lower resistance by p tricornutum that was consistent with its high sensitivity to uv radiation 45 photoreactivation makes it possible in the presence of light to repair dna damage caused by uv irradiation within the uvc region although it is less energetic with a higher wavelength and the damage should be lower the photoreactivation is also lower thus the treatment may end up being more effective if this is considered 29 30 65 in p tricornutum there is an increase in the d 2 due to the photoreactivation from 23 7 to 42 9 mj cm 2 factor of 1 8 when it is irradiated with uvc leds and from 37 5 to 82 7 mj cm 2 factor of 2 2 when it is irradiated with a uv lp mercury lamp 45 the lower photoreactivation in the case of the uvc leds used in this study 275 nm compared with lp mercury lamps 254 nm was expected due to its greater distance to the absorption peak of the dna 260 nm and is consistent with other results from the literature for e coli 29 65 75 on the other hand the absence of differences observed by 65 between photoreactivation with uvc leds at 265 nm and lp mercury lamps at 254 nm in e coli could be related to the fact that they are practically at the same distance from the absorption peak of the dna 260 nm the uvc wavelength is the most energetic one and its entire spectrum 200 280 nm is absorbed by the dna additionally the peak of absorption from the dna 260 nm 26 is in its region for these reasons the uvc has been the one most used for disinfection the data from this experiment agree with those from the literature where uvc irradiation has the most germicidal effect and the higher photoreactivation 29 30 56 61 3 2 4 application of the three different wavelengths in the ships when implementing a uv based bwms the differences in inactivation and subsequent photoreactivation of the various wavelengths must be considered the results of this experiment seem to indicate a higher resistance to uv radiation at the three wavelengths uva uvb and uvc of phytoplanktonic organisms than that for viruses and bacteria this is consistent with uvc data from the literature 44 uva leds alone would not be of interest for ballast water treatment specially focused on microalgae inactivation because of the enormous doses that are needed additionally no photoreactivation is associated with the uva irradiation therefore the possibility of increasing the efficacy of the treatment by avoiding it treating at the ballasting procedure and subsequent storage in darkness in the ballast tanks is not possible although the inactivation with uvb leds is higher than with uva leds they are less effective for inactivating microalgae compared with mercury lamps that are the most used at present the d 2 parameter has been used to compare the differences between both uv treatments applied to p tricornutum without a dark post treatment uvb leds are 65 less efficient than a uvc lp mercury lamp while uvb leds are 77 6 less efficient with a five day dark post treatment table 6 45 in the case of uvc leds the d 2 parameter was also used to compare with the other uv treatments applied to p tricornutum it was observed that uvc leds were the most efficient of all of the uv leds tested in this study without a dark post treatment uvc leds were 74 2 more efficient than uvb leds and 48 1 more efficient than uvc lp mercury lamps table 6 with a five day dark post treatment the uvc leds were 90 more efficient than uvb leds and 36 8 more efficient than uvc lp mercury lamps table 6 considering the possibility of avoiding photoreactivation by dark storage in ballast tanks it might be interesting to develop uvc leds with emission peaks closer to the absorbance peak of dna in these cases the combination of uvc irradiation and subsequent storage in ballast tanks would further enhance inactivation 3 3 combination of uv leds with pms and pds as described in section 2 4 2 the uv vis spectra of the two persulfate salts was obtained for determining the best uv emission wavelength if the absorption and emission spectra coincide a possible photolysis of the compound is ensured and therefore greater efficiency accordingly it was decided to combine the pms with the three uv wavelengths uva uvb and uvc and the pds with the uvc wavelength the activation of the pms and the pds with uvc 32 34 and uva 76 78 has been demonstrated and tested as a way to increase disinfection on the other hand while some activation studies of the pms with solar light that includes uva and uvb have been done 79 81 the authors did not find research about pms combined with only uvb 3 3 1 inactivation curves of uv lights combined with pms and pds in the case of the pms looking for a moderate effect of uv irradiation and based on the results from section 3 2 an exposure time of 5 min was selected for the uvc and the same exposure time was considered for the other wavelengths five minutes of exposure suppose uv doses of 17 4 45 3 and 3606 9 mj cm 2 at uvc uvb and uva wavelength respectively in the case of pds in both concentrations 0 043 and 0 430 mm exposures times of 10 and 20 min of the uvc wavelength were selected suppose 34 8 and 69 6 mj cm 2 respectively these longer exposure times and thus higher uv doses for pds were based on its higher stability compared to pms 34 the pms by itself causes significant damage to p tricornutum and if an increase in inactivation due to its combination with uv irradiation is the desired effect very low concentrations must be used in the toxicity assay it was ascertained that 1 78 μm caused an inhibition of 54 5 of the initial culture while 3 39 μm caused an inhibition of 98 0 considering the inactivation of the pms uvc and uvb alone with 0 04 0 31 and 0 07 log reductions respectively there was a higher inactivation by combining the pms with uvc 0 43 log reductions and uvb 0 21 log reductions than the simple addition of their inactivations alone these increases in the inactivation when uvc and uvb were combined with pms might be related to the wavelengths used 275 nm for uvc leds and 300 nm for uvb leds that produce strong absorption into pms fig 2 uvc irradiation produces more biological damage to microalgae than uvb irradiation accordingly the increase effect due to the combination of the uv pms is more evident in the uvb region than the uvc fig 5 no enhancement of inactivation was determined with the combination of uva and pms as its inactivation was the same as that with only pms fig 5a probably higher exposure times would be needed to obtain a more efficient process in the case of uva in any case p tricornutum was found to be very sensitive to the pms which agrees with literature for other microalgae such as microcystis aeruginosa 82 therefore it would be difficult to correctly quantify the increasing effect by combination with uv because of the lowest pms doses used in the case of the combination of the pds with uvc a slight detrimental effect was obtained compared with uvc alone in the present study and according to the literature 82 83 the effect of pds by itself was negligible thus the combination with uvc was expected to accelerate the inactivation of p tricornutum due to the photolysis of pds into sulfate radicals absorption of the pds into 275 nm uvc from the leds of this study was confirmed by a uv vis spectra fig 2 the slight consumption of the pds after uvc irradiation 0 8 in the first 20 min was consistent with that seen in other studies 84 although no pds was detected in the cultures on the last day of the inactivation experiment day 12 no inactivation enhancement was detected in the tested conditions similar experiences have been reported with algal organic matter mineralization 85 in this scenario it is important to take into account that specific parameters such as pds dosage uv wavelength or inorganic substances that are present in water can influence the uv activation of pds 86 in this case a complex aqueous matrix could have notably influenced the process due to the significant amount of inorganic organic compounds inherent in microalgal cultures the emission wavelength at 275 nm also differs a bit in previous studies that obtain disinfection enhancement under a uv pds process 32 88 89 that utilizes 254 nm as an emission source additionally the stability of pds 83 makes its efficient activation difficult under these conditions accordingly more research must be conducted in the future in order to clarify the effects and performance of uv pds on seawater microalgae 4 conclusions uva uvb and uvc leds have been tested as methods of inactivating microalgae in ballast water by using the diatom p tricornutum as the target organism the inactivation efficiency and the level of photoreactivation of the three wavelengths observed in this study follows uva uvb uvc on the other hand comparing results from this study and from previous studies that used uvc leds and uvc from mercury lamps low pressure or medium pressure it was determined that the inactivation with leds is higher with the same doses finally the combination of the three uv wavelengths with the pms and uvc with pds was tested in p tricornutum there was a slight increase when the pms was combined with uvc and uvb but not when it was combined with uva the combination of uvb with the pms was especially relevant since although there are data on uvc and uva as a source of pms activation in the literature no references to uvb alone as a source of activation were found by the authors in the case of the pds no increase on the inactivation was ascertained with its combination with uvc p tricornutum as a representative of phytoplanktonic organisms has demonstrated higher resistance than viruses and bacteria to uv based treatments at the three wavelengths which must be considered for future research in testing bwmss considering the implementation of a bwms uvc leds would be a promising technology due to their higher efficacy compared to uvc mercury lamps although it would be interesting to develop uvc leds with greater output power on the other hand the combination of uv leds with persulfate salts would not enhance the inactivation therefore the treatment with only uv irradiation would be safer and less expensive

12626,ozonation processes have been successfully used to remove organic micropollutants membrane contactors can transfer the ozone via a bubbleless process making them promising devices for many applications thanks to a good control of the transferred ozone here we studied the local transfer of ozone into water through a single and a multi fiber membrane contactor by developing a 3 d model in a comsol multiphysics workflow to our knowledge this is the first model to combine 3 d analysis and a multi fiber membrane contactor for an ozonation application the model established here could serve as a startpoint for optimizing bubbleless processes and scaling up membrane contactor processes including the ozonation of micropollutants dedicated experiments were performed to check the model using of a 3 d modeling approach makes it possible to account for the non ideal effects that occur in hollow fiber membrane contactors the simulations highlighted hydrodynamics as a very important factor to ensure good distribution of ozone and therefore good treatment of pollutants moreover the transferred ozone does not increase proportionally with increasing membrane length or residence time finding

navier stokes wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction ozonation has long been widely applied for disinfection of drinking water and wastewater ozonation processes have long been successfully used to remove organic micropollutants such as cbz 1 5 conventional ozonation processes e g bubble columns and ozonation chambers employ ozone dispersion in the form of bubbles which carries several disadvantages including foam generation stripping volatile organic compounds a high reactor footprint high operational costs and high energetic cost due to mass transfer limitations 6 furthermore the ozone dosage is difficult to control and can in some cases result in over consumption of ozone and generate by products that may prove even more dangerous than the original products 7 9 for instance ozonation of waters that contain bromides produces bromates which are regulated in drinking water due to their carcinogenic potential 10 11 the eu and the european us epa have set a limit cap of 10 μg l 1 bromate in drinking water 12 13 ozonation induced paraben by products are another example indeed gao et al 7 showed that the paraben by products were more toxic to green algae than the original compound itself due to its reaction with hydroxyl radicals membrane contactors transfer zone via a bubbleless process which makes them very promising devices to overcome these issues the membrane acts as a barrier between the liquid and the gas phases and the mass transfer occurs by diffusion due to a concentration gradient the process takes place under low pressure which makes it energy efficient moreover hollow fiber membrane contactors offer the huge advantage of a very high exchange surface up to 10 000 m2 m 3 compared to conventional processes between 3 and 600 m2 m 3 14 16 membrane contactors are usually used as separation method in two phase contacting systems 17 for instance these installations are frequently used for co2 absorption where a concentration gradient drives the transfer of gaseous co2 through the membrane into the liquid phase i e the absorbent which it gets transformed into dissolved co2 at the gas liquid interface 18 20 membrane contactors have recently highlighted the potential value of ozonation applications in wastewater treatment as a way to efficiently remove micropollutants while limiting bromate formation 16 21 22 in a previous study our team performed an experimental evaluation of an ozone diffusion process using a hollow fiber membrane contactor 23 however we pointed out a need to better understand the mass transfer optimize the device design and determine the most suitable process parameters a numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics cfd would greatly assist this effort 17 note too that a literature review on ozone membrane contactors for water and wastewater treatment concluded that there is huge potential to optimize membrane contactor geometry 24 a few studies have already made progress on modeling membrane contactors for ozonation processes this extant literature generally employs two different approaches first the model can be created from a global approach where the membrane contactor acts as a black box 25 in this case semi empirical correlations are commonly used to calculate the mass and heat transfer coefficients involved in the full process transfers as the fibers have a simple geometry these classical correlations provide a fairly reliable estimation of the transfer coefficients however it is much trickier to find the most relevant correlation for estimating the transfer coefficient in the cartridge side this is a huge limitation in the model presented here since the main resistance to mass transfer is expected to be localized in the liquid phase given the value of the henry coefficient between ozone and water and the water circulates in the cartridge using a semi empirical correlation would prove difficult and lead to serious approximations these kinds of model offer a global vision of the process and allow general comparison of the installations engineered but they do not account for variations in velocity or concentration and thus fail to address diffusion and convection effects along the module whereas these effects can have a substantial impact on the mass transfer second in order to improve the understanding of the mass transfers and phenomena involved in the process the model can also be established via a local approach which has the added advantage of enabling optimization of the contactor design stylianou et al 26 worked on modeling ozonation in a ceramic membrane contactor via a global approach in order to provide a fundamental basis for the design of bubbleless ozonation processes in particular for the removal of micropollutants their model was based on both mass transfer and ozone decomposition reactions and was established by mobilizing experimental data obtained in situ with a hydrophobized α al2o3 ceramic membrane contactor the aim was to allow their model to be extrapolated to different devices scale up and experimental conditions by adapting the values of major physical parameters e g diffusivity or solubility taken from the literature or measured in experiments in this sense they used the leveque equation including dimensionless numbers such as the sherwood and the peclet numbers and the model was validated for a laminar regime berry et al 27 worked with a local approach and established a model by using comsol multiphysics for the simulation of ozone and oxygen transfer through a capillary non porous membrane the single fiber was simulated with a two dimensional axisymmetric computation domain and the model was validated for a laminar flow regime however based on experimental results found in the literature berry et al were unable to successfully validate their numerical model in the transitional flow regime furthermore the authors presented no result for turbulent flow regime focusing on experimental studies zoumpouli et al 28 worked on ozone transfer through a non porous tubular membrane using experimental data obtained in absence of chemical reaction they found that the local model developed by berry et al slightly overestimated the mass transfer coefficients they calculated molar fluxes of ozone and overall mass transfer coefficients for different ozone gas concentrations and liquid side velocities based on their experimental data and showed that membrane size i e inner diameter was a key parameter for the ozone transfer they also experimentally studied the effect of the matrix on the removal of a model compound i e para chlorobenzoic acid but without including the chemical reaction in the model according to bein et al 24 one of the barriers to upscaling lab scale results from mass transfer enhancement theory is the change in ozone concentration over fiber length research using the local approach could help ease this bottleneck although results presented further in this paper have been obtained by using a simplified model setting a constant gas concentration and validated in the case of the membrane contactor studied the not simplified model established in our work runs also with variation of the ozone concentration over fiber length which is essential in the case of longer membrane contactor the studies cited above simulated only one fiber whereas multi fiber contactors hold much more promise for enhancing mass transfer due to their higher exchange surface multi fiber simulation allows to get closer to reality where the membrane contactors are often made of a lot of fibers within a cartridge and therefore to consider the liquid flow between the fibers and along the contactor qatezadeh deriss et al 17 investigated the effect of number of fibers on removal of ibuprofen another pharmaceutical by using a hollow fiber membrane contactor with octanol the simulation was performed with a two dimensional model and the influence of number of fibers was studied using the method developed by happel 29 governing equations for the shell membrane and tube sides were solved using comsol multiphysics in order to validate the model they compared their simulation results against experimental data from the literature their results showed that the final concentration of ibuprofen was not proportional to number of fibers thus highlighting the need to simulate a multi fiber system to predict the efficiency of the whole process this brief look at the state of art finds that efforts are still needed to model ozonation processes using membrane contactors however to the best of our knowledge 3 d multi fiber simulation of the ozonation process has never been achieved zhao et al 30 had already highlighted that regardless of the applications targeted a convection diffusion approach through a 3 d grid would be make significant headway toward module characterization for membrane contactors in a recent review ng et al 31 showed that only very few studies on gas separation processes had used a 3 d approach 31 34 and none had addressed ozonation processes ng et al 31 concluded that previous models failed to consider non ideal effects such as a random fiber distribution a random flow distribution and the presence of channelling or dead zones 31 3 d modeling uses much more computation time than other models due to additional directions and variables but it could nevertheless overcome these challenges indeed 3 d modeling could help to stay close to the reality of experimental set ups or industrial scale installations by taking into account the real contactor geometry which is crucial for validation of a relevant model 31 here to address these challenges this study set out to use a modeling approach to gain a better understanding of the process of ozone transfer through a hollow fiber membrane contactor we evaluated the effects of contactor geometry number of fibers and fiber length process conditions ozone concentration in the gas phase and liquid flow rate and hydrodynamics on ozone transfer and carbamazepine removal efficiency in order to check the numerical model before going deeper into the extrapolation and interpretation of results we compared our simulation results were against experimental data obtained using a single hollow fiber membrane contactor 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup 2 1 1 membrane contactor technology the single fiber membrane contactor used in this work was home made designed and fabricated in the lab manufacturing workshop of the iem the

is weight of the dry membrane diso is isopropanol density and dptfe is density of the polymer 2 1 2 pilot ozonation system the lab scale pilot ozonation system fig 1 consisted of a single fiber membrane contactor continuously fed by an oxygen ozone mix ozone was produced by an ozone generator bmt 803 n from a tank of lab grade pure oxygen and then diluted with oxygen in order to achieve the desired gas flow rate and the desired concentration of the o2 o3 mix with two solenoid valves connected to a computer ozone concentration at both the gas inlet and at the gas outlet was monitored with an ozone gas analyzer bmt 964 after dehumidification the liquid flowed into the pilot from a thermostatically controlled 20 c stirred 30 l feed tank liquid circulation was driven by a peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 in order to collect samples one tap located upstream of the membrane contactor and one tap located downstream of the membrane contactor were available the liquid was circulated through the membrane contactor once a container with potassium iodide solution was then used to recover the liquid in order to prevent the ozone degassing gas circulated via a counter current flow inside the fiber and the liquid in the shell a concentration gradient transferred ozone from the gas phase of the membrane contactor to the liquid phase 2 1 3 chemicals carbamazepine c15h12n2o cbz was chosen as a model compound due to its well known reaction kinetics determined through numerous previous studies cbz is an anti epileptic drug that is widely used in many countries this cbz compound is only partially removed in conventional wwtps 37 38 like many other pharmaceuticals cbz is widely found in secondary treatment stages of wwtp effluents as widely reported in the literature 39 42 this study used high purity 99 analytical grade cbz from sigma pure potassium indigotrisulfonate sigma aldrich was used as ozone scavenging reagent 2 1 4 cbz solution acid buffered cbz solution was used the solution was obtained by dissolving 2 ppm of cbz in buffered water which was produced by dissolving 1 2 g l 1 of sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 sigma aldrich in deionized water total organic carbon 30 ppb resistivity 5 mω cm 15 mω cm and then adjusting the ph with a few milliliters of phosphoric acid h3po4 concentrated at 84 sigma aldrich the ph of the final matrix was 3 after 24 h of stirring the solution was injected into the feed tank the liquid was then left to circulate for at least 12 h in closed loop mode with compressed air flowing in the fiber this recirculation serves to achieve a balance between the system i e the pilot materials and the solution due to potential adsorption the pilot was then switched into an open loop circuit configuration before starting the ozonation experiment the initial concentration of cbz was determined using 3 samples collected in both the feed tank and at the tap upstream of the membrane contactor see fig 1 2 1 5 analytical methods the indigo method 43 was used to determine dissolved ozone concentration in the liquid phase spectrophotometric determination was made by using the indigo method corresponding to the anticipated range between 0 01 and 0 1 mgo3 l 1 cbz was quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms using a waters device an xselect hss t3 c18 resin column 100 mm 21 mm with a 2 5 μm particle size was used as stationary phase at room temperature with a first eluent composed of 90 hplc grade water 10 hplc grade acetonitrile acn and 0 1 formic acid and with a second eluent composed of acn and 0 1 formic acid the following detection conditions were applied to the ms capillary potential 3 5 kv cone voltage 25 v source temperature 120 c desolvation temperature 450 c cone gas flow 50 nl h 1 desolvation gas flow of 450 nl h 1 and collision energy of 20 v the calibration curves were plotted using buffered water with known concentrations of cbz to avoid matrix effects on detection the instrument limit of quantification iloq and the instrument limit of detection ilod for cbz were about 10 μg l 1 and 3 μg l 1 respectively 2 2 3 d model development herein we developed an original multi physical model of the hollow fiber membrane contactor including a i coupling between fluid flows within the membrane contactor ii ozone mass transport though the membrane iii mass transfer at the membrane liquid flow interface and iv chemical reactions involving ozone and carbamazepine in the liquid phase to ensure reliable validation of the numerical model using the experimental data a 3 d model was necessary in order to consider the geometry of the experimental pilot fig 1 the experimental water flow rate of 50 l h 1 used in the lab scale pilot ozonation system allowed to calculate a reynolds number of 1650 for liquid flow in the case of the single fiber contactor the experimental gas flow rate used of 1 l h 1 corresponded to a reynolds number of 55 for gas flow at this step with a global approach we were able to consider laminar flow in the hydrodynamic model and both liquid and gas flow patterns were assessed numerically by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans transport equations additional transport equations had to be solved to calculate ozone concentration in the gas within the membrane and in the water as well as cbz concentration in the water moreover despite the reynolds number there will still be mixing taking place due to the contactor geometry liquid inlet and outlet perpendicular to the fibers the numerical

gmres method has been used in this study this solver provides robust solutions when simulating hydrodynamics in 2d axisymmetric or 3d geometries 2 2 1 monofiber 3 d model a first model was developed with only one fiber within the cartridge to properly validate the numerical results using our own experiment data the 3 d geometry of the single hollow fiber membrane contactor was built using comsol multiphysics software fig 2 a the overall dimensions corresponding to the device are 600 mm length and a 10 mm diameter of the water inlet the water outlet and the main axial tube containing the fiber the inlet and the outlet are arranged perpendicular to the main tube and thus also perpendicular to the fiber the external fiber diameter is 0 87 mm the model configuration is characterized by a longitudinal yz plane of symmetry such that the simulations were launched in a half contactor geometry meshing of the 3 d geometry required the use of hybrid hexahedral tetrahedral meshes fig 2 b to optimize the mesh quality and thus improve the numerical convergence of the model boundary layers were built on the wall surfaces to properly simulate the flow in the vicinity of the walls assuming no slip conditions despite the plane of symmetry 1 5 million meshes were necessary to obtain reliable convergence with rans model 2 2 2 gas phase 2 2 2 1 fluid flow working to the assumptions described in the previous section the gas flow within the inner side of the membrane can be described using the following equation 44 2 ρ gas v gas v gas p gas η gas v gas v gas t where ρgas is density of the

the fluid flow boundary conditions were at the hollow fiber inlet a fully developed flow was imposed with a constant gas flow rate qgas in l h 1 thus the parabolic laminar flow profile was already established at this boundary at the hollow fiber outlet pgas out patm inside the hollow fiber at the gas membrane interface a no slip wall condition was applied at the plane of symmetry no flow crossing the boundary i e velocity normal to the boundary was equal to zero v n gas 0 2 2 2 2 mass transfer the mass transfer of ozone requires solving an additional convection diffusion transport equation as follows 44 3 d o 3 gas c o 3 gas c o 3 gas v gas 0 where c o 3 gas is ozone concentration in the gas in mol m 3 v gas is the gas velocity vector in m s 1 and d o 3 gas is the diffusion coefficient of the ozone in the gas in m2 s 1 which is assumed to be isotropic and constant the boundary conditions for gas transport within the hollow fiber were as follows inlet an inflow boundary

diffusion n d o 3 gas c o 3 gas 0 thus leading to c o 3 gas y 0 2 2 3 mass transfer within the porous membrane the ozone transfers from the gas side of the hollow fiber through the porous membrane it is assumed that ozone diffuses through the membrane pores and that no chemical reaction occurs within the membrane assumption of non wettability consequently we assumed a stagnant gas phase within the membrane pores with ozone transport driven exclusively by diffusion phenomena as described by the following equation 5 d o 3 m eff c o 3 gas 0 where d o 3 m eff represents the effective diffusion coefficient of ozone in the membrane in m2 s 1 in porous media both molecular and knudsen diffusions occur and the knudsen number indicates the dominant phenomenon 46 in this work as knudsen number was very low knudsen diffusion was neglected appendix a thus the effective diffusion coefficient was calculated from equations 47 6 d o 3 m eff d o 3 gas ε m τ where d o 3 g in m2 s 1 is the ozone diffusion coefficient in the gas 48 εm is membrane porosity and τ is membrane tortuosity tortuosity τ was estimated by the porosity tortuosity relationship defined by 49 7 τ 2 ε m 2 ε m the boundary conditions at the membrane water interface were the following henry s law was used for gas liquid transfer of ozone in water 50 8 h o 3 c o 3 liq c o 3 gas where c o 3 gas and c o 3 liq are the concentrations of ozone in the gas phase and in water respectively in mol m 3 h o 3 is the partition coefficient of ozone at the gas liquid interface 2 2 4 liquid phase within the cartridge 2 2 4 1 fluid flow liquid flow was described using the navier stokes equations i e the momentum equation and the conservation equation as follows 44 9 ρ liq v liq v liq p liq η liq v liq v liq t 10 v liq 0 where ρliq is density of the water v liq is the water velocity vector pliq is the static pressure and η liq is the dynamic viscosity of the water the boundary conditions for fluid flow in the cartridge were inlet a fully developed flow was assumed with a constant water flow rate qliq in assuming a parabolic laminar flow profile outlet pliq out patm a no slip wall condition imposed at the membrane water interface and the contactor wall 2 2 4 2 mass transport in the liquid phase convection diffusion equations were used to simulate the mass transport of ozone and cbz assuming a coupling with chemical reactions source term as follows 44 11 d i liq c i liq c i liq v liq r i liq where c i liq is concentration of species i in the water in mol m 3 v liq is the water velocity vector in m s 1 d i liq is the diffusion coefficient of species i in water and is assumed to be isotropic and constant in m2 s 1 r i liq is the reaction term of species i in water in mol m 3 s 1 due to chemical reactions the boundary conditions for ozone and cbz in the liquid phase were inlet an inflow boundary condition danckwerts flux for cbz in water was considered 12 n d cbz liq c cbz liq v liq c cbz liq v liq in c cbz liq in a null flux was considered for ozone in the feed water flux outlet for all species i the convective flux dominates the outgoing mass flux so c i liq z 0 at the outer cartridge wall boundary conditions were simulated with an impermeable wall 2 2 4 3 chemical reactions in this first study the model considered the chemical reaction between ozone and cbz but not the other chemical reactions involved during ozone decomposition this decision was motivated by the fact that the reaction between cbz and molecular ozone is fast because ozone attacks the double bond of cbz 51 leading to a high reaction rate constant ko3 3 0 105 mol l 1 s 1 this reaction gives rise to the formation of several by products containing quinazoline based functional groups 52 the reaction rate constants of the different by products with o3 are significantly slower by about five orders of magnitude compared to cbz 52 moreover the residence time of the liquid in the membrane contactor was very short about 7 s for a liquid flow rate of 40 l h 1 so we assumed that reactions between by products from cbz and o3 could be neglected the reaction of cbz with hydroxyl radicals generally present during ozonation processes due to ozone decomposition processes was not taken into account in the model due to the acidic conditions imposed 53 54 the irreversible chemical reaction between ozone and cbz was thus described as follows 13 cbz o 3 bqm the rate of this second order reaction was given by 14 r i liq k r c o 3 liq c cbz liq where k r is the reaction rate constant in m3 mol 1 s 1 2 2 5 solving the equations with the solver in 3d geometry the simulation involving the coupling between hydrodynamics mass transfer and chemical reaction involving ozone and carbamazepine lasted 22 h in the case of the mono fiber contactor and 36 h in the case of the multi fiber contactor the simulation was performed using a 3 4 ghz xeon gold 12 core workstation with 96 gb of ram the parameters used for the simulation are specified in the table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 model simplification a first set of numerical simulations was launched in order to check whether the model could be simplified especially concerning the gas flow within the inner fiber indeed ozone transfer resistance from gas phase to liquid phase can be characterized based on four contributions i resistance in the gas phase due to ozone diffusion ii resistance within the pores of the membrane iii resistance at the gas liquid interface due to phase change henry s law and iv resistance in the liquid phase mainly due to molecular diffusion within the boundary layer among these four resistances it was reasonable to expect that the resistance to ozone transfer in the gas phase within the fiber could be neglected therefore preliminary simulations were run to confirm this assumption rather than computing gas flow within the fiber a dirichlet boundary condition was tested assuming that ozone supply from the gas inlet was much higher than the rate of ozone transfer through the membrane thus enabling us to consider a constant ozone concentration at the gas membrane interface along the membrane length in other words a boundary condition of ozone concentration instead of the gas flow rate was considered at this interface thus significantly simplifying the numerical simulations the results of the ozone concentration at the liquid outlet c o 3 liq out obtained with the simplified model simulations for an ozone concentration c o 3 gas in of 50 g nm 3 assumed to be the same all along the fiber were 71 1 μg l 1 63 8 μg l 1 and 60 6 μg l 1 for a liquid flow rate q0 w of 30 40 and 50 l h 1 respectively when comparing these results against the complete model simulations with gas flow within the fibers we found a maximum relative error between the two models of 0 9 which is very low therefore circulation of the gas inside the fiber and the evolution of ozone concentration along the fiber were not taken into account in the following results note that this model simplification was valid in the specific case of the membrane contactor studied but would not hold in the case of longer membrane contactor due to a higher and thus significant variation of the ozone concentration along the contactor in the gas phase in this last case the completed model would be therefore used also note that for the graphical presentation of the main results obtained by numerical simulation given the 60 fold difference in the ratio between membrane contactor length 600 mm and membrane thickness 10 mm the main figures graph the results considering two specific regions of the contactor the inlet region 80 mm length and the outlet region 60 mm length 3 2 single fiber contactor 3 d model without chemical reaction the results presented in this section correspond to a liquid flow rate q0 w of 50 l h 1 at the inlet of the contactor and an ozone concentration c o 3 gas in in the gas phase of 50 g nm 3 this corresponds to an ozone concentration c o 3 gas at the membrane water interface i e at the external surface of the fiber of 12 4 mg l 1 according to henry s law equation 10 57 these conditions were chosen to accommodate the experimental limits of the pilot ozonation system the main objective of this first set of simulation results compared to the experimental results obtained was to properly validate the complex numerical model obviously with only one fiber in the cartridge the global ozonation process was far from optimized optimization is discussed in part 3 4 multi fiber contactor 3 2 1 hydrodynamics fig 3 shows the velocity field in the membrane contactor and clearly illustrates that the center of the fiber cannot be considered as an axis of symmetry thus justifying the choice of performing 3 d simulations rather than 2d axisymmetric plane simulations due to the geometry of the cartridge inlet small dead zones can be identified especially in the vicinity of each end of the cartridge the velocity field at the inlet zone shows that the magnitude of velocity is much higher below the membrane which is due to the geometry of the inlet feed more precisely at the inlet the average velocity magnitude is 0 18 m s 1 which corresponds to a flow rate of 50 l h 1 the flow velocity ranged between 0 30 and 0 40 m s 1 below the fiber and along the z axis whereas it was close to 0 15 m s 1 below the fiber the flow then becomes parallel to the fiber and the velocity magnitude tends toward a homogeneous average value around 0 25 m s 1 on both sides of the fiber the flow pattern is strongly affected by the geometry of the contactor outlet where counter current flows promote the emergence of a high speed area in the outlet channel around 0 35 m s 1 and small recirculation zones characterized by low velocity magnitude despite a reynolds number indicating a laminar flow the assumption of a laminar flow in the shell side appears to be inappropriate as also suggested in previous work 59 60 a 2 d modeling approach would not have provided this information 31 3 2 2 ozone transfer fig 4 shows ozone concentration in the liquid phase in the yz plane of symmetry and on two zx cross sections located close to the inlet and outlet regions respectively ozone concentrations superior to 0 2 mg l 1 and up to 12 4 mg l 1 which was the maximum achieved here are shown in white ozone concentration under the fiber along the z axis was very low 0 01 mg l 1 due to the high velocity magnitude fig 3 conversely ozone concentration was high up to 12 4 mg l 1 in a thin layer around the fiber all along the contactor as expected when using only one fiber in the cartridge this underlines the very small effective volume of the contactor i e the volume of liquid containing dissolved ozone which means that a large portion of the volume is not involved in the mass transfer this layer can be interpreted as a boundary layer where the transversal diffusion of ozone is the limiting parameter in the vicinity of the outlet an area of high ozone concentration above the fiber corresponds to a dead zone of flow as the main flow is directed upward and there is a recirculation zone at the end of the contactor ozone concentration was homogenous at the outlet of the contactor cartridge side at a mean value of 0 064 mg l 1 range 0 03 0 08 mg l 1 it should also be mentioned that for the mono fiber configuration and near the module entrance radial convective flux due to vertical inlet geometry cannot be neglected fig 3 exhibits that large vortices are created in the first 80 mm thus creating vertical convection in parallel the longitudinal liquid velocity is higher in the lower part of the module so that the ozone is transported more rapidly toward the outlet of the module both phenomena explain the higher ozone concentration in the upper part of the module without reaction with cbz these findings are important because they show that the spatial distribution of the ozone is heterogeneous along the membrane contactor with highly concentrated zones near the membrane but very low concentrations of ozone in a large fraction of the bulk the numerical results therefore suggest that the diameter of the shell of the membrane contactor with only one fiber is oversized meaning that the bulk volume containing the water could be significantly reduced note that a 2d axisymmetrical model would fail to describe the hydrodynamics within the membrane contactor and thus the ozone concentration in the bulk from inlet to outlet along the contactor the 3d numerical work here provides a better understanding of the phenomena limiting ozone transfer and can thus serve to optimize the contactor geometry more results concerning ozone concentration in the single fiber membrane contactor are available in appendix b and support the importance of the shell design on transfer 3 2 3 model validation simulation vs experiments there are still lots of studies that present numerical simulations without validating their results on experimental data obtained in parallel here we decided to validate the simulation results by comparing the ozone concentration calculated by the model against the ozone concentration determined experimentally using a purpose designed lab scale pilot experimentally ozone concentration was calculated using the indigo method on samples collected at the outlet of the module whereas in the simulations ozone concentration was calculated using the equation 15 c o 3 liq out φ o 3 n ds out v liq n ds out where c o 3 liq out is the concentration of ozone at the outlet in mg l 1 v liq is the water velocity vector in m s 1 n the vector normal to the outlet surface sout and φ o 3 is the vector of total density flux diffusive and convective flux in mg h 1 m 2 such that φ o 3 d o 3 liq c o 3 liq c o 3 liq v liq table 3 reports the results obtained experimentally versus using simulation for two different liquid flow rates and for an ozone concentration at the gas inlet of around 50 g nm 3 the numerical simulations are consistent with the experimental results especially given that the model did not contain any adjustable parameters based on this comparison we considered the numerical model for mass transfer as validated once the model was validated we ran simulations to quantify the effect of some of the major operating parameters on process efficiency 3 2 4 effect of process conditions liquid flow rate and ozone concentration in the gas phase on ozone transfer through the single fiber membrane contactor in fig 5 plots the residual ozone concentration calculated at the outlet against liquid flow rate in the membrane contactor for increasing ozone concentrations in the inlet gas flux when ozone concentration in the gas phase doubles the flux of transferred ozone also doubles when liquid flow rate doubles the ozone transfer is multiplied by 1 6 due to the decrease in resistance on the liquid side therefore both liquid flow rate and ozone concentration in the gas phase have a positive impact on ozone transfer which is in agreement with previous studies 26 35 3 3 one fiber contactor 3 d model with chemical reaction of ozone in this part of the study the chemical reaction of ozone with cbz was coupled to the mass transfer equations in the model results presented below correspond to a simulation run with a water flow rate qliq in at the inlet of 40 l h 1 an ozone concentration in the gas phase co3 gas inof 59 g nm 3 corresponding to an ozone concentration at the fiber of 14 9 mg l 1 according to henry s law and a cbz concentration at the water inlet ccbz liq in of 1366 5 μg l 1 these conditions were chosen to accommodate the experimental limits of the pilot ozonation system 3 3 1 ozone transfer fig 6 represents the ozone concentration in water and can be directly compared to fig 4 simulations without chemical reaction as expected ozone concentration was lower with cbz than without cbz in the liquid phase because of the consumption of cbz by o3 which is known to be non limiting ozone concentration was low far from the membrane especially below the fiber more precisely in mono fiber configuration hydrodynamics within the liquid phase induces vertical velocities due to the presence of large vortices thus transporting rapidly ozone from the membrane by convection in the upper part of the module in this region the characteristic time of the convection is of the same order of magnitude of the characteristic time of reaction so that the ozone concentration is not null in the lower part of the module the velocity field is mainly composed of longitudinal velocities which does not contribute to rapidly transport ozone in the vertical direction from the membrane interface therefore ozone concentration is lower in the lower part of the module in the vicinity of the fiber there was a small effective volume with a thin layer of ozone thinner than in fig 4 where ozone concentration is high up to 14 9 mg l 1 based on the simulation results the boundary layer 130 μm thick on average and thus the hatta number was close to 3 7 which corresponds to a fast reaction occurring in the liquid film 54 this result further confirms the observations made from fig 6 i e a large part of the shell is not useful for the chemical reaction between o3 and cbz because this reaction takes place in the liquid film at the outlet of the contactor the values of ozone concentration ranged from 0 01 to 0 06 mg l 1 with an average of 0 02 mg l 1 fig 6 can also be compared to fig 7 showing a correlation between cbz and o3 concentration due to the consumption of cbz by o3 3 3 2 cbz degradation fig 7 represents the concentration of cbz in water in the contactor for qliq in 40 l h 1 co3 gas 59 g nm 3 and ccbz liq in 1366 5 μg l 1 these conditions were chosen in order to validate the model and no significant degradation of cbz was expected conversely to the spatial distribution of ozone the cbz was completely degraded in the vicinity of the fiber and in the dead zone close to the outlet where ozone concentration was shown to be highest elsewhere cbz was partially transformed with residual values ranging between 1070 and 1360 μg l 1 cbz concentration was slightly lower above the fiber than below because of higher liquid velocities in the lower region cbz concentration was lower in the outlet zone where the concentration of dissolved ozone was highest cbz concentrations at the outlet ranged from 1030 to 1160 μg l 1 with an average of 1078 μg l 1 3 3 3 model validation simulation vs experiment in order to validate the reaction part of the model an experiment was conducted at 20 c with a liquid flow rate of 40 l h 1 a gas flow rate of 1 l h 1 an ozone concentration at the gas inlet of 59 g nm 3 and a cbz concentration at the liquid inlet of 1367 33 μg l 1 results are presented in table 4 the simulation results are consistent with those found experimentally thus confirming that reaction transfer transport model presented herein is reliable 3 4 multi fiber contactor 3 d model without chemical reaction once the model had been validated with experimental data the next step was to focus on a real multi fiber contactor in this section we simulated the transfer of ozone in a 10 mm diameter membrane contactor with 64 hollow fibers these fibers were evenly distributed and separated 0 18 mm apart from each other for numerical reasons the simulations were performed for a water flow rate qliq in of 48 l h 1 at the inlet and an ozone concentration in the gas phase co3 gas of 50 g nm 3 corresponding to a concentration on the fiber c o3 liq of 12 4 mg l 1 according to henry s law 3 4 1 hydrodynamics in the multi fiber membrane contactor fig 8 reports the velocity field simulated in the multi fiber membrane contactor configuration with the parameters previously described in section 3 4 more specifically fig 8 plots the velocity magnitude and direction located on the yz plane of symmetry and on the inlet and outlet sections fibers are shown in brown to facilitate readability although the velocity field is clearly more uniform than in the single fiber configuration there are still preferential paths visible within the contactor particularly at each side of the shell this result is consistent a previous study by cai et al 33 concerning 3 d modeling of a hollow fiber membrane contactor for co2 absorption the authors observed that modules with a high packing density led to a more uniform distribution of flow compared to sparsely packed modules in our case packing density i e the ratio between the exchange surface and volume at the shell side was higher for the multi fiber contactor than for the single fiber contactor due to the higher number of fibers in shells of identical volume like in the single fiber membrane contactor the velocity field will affect the distribution of ozone in the contactor the preferential paths could potentially induce the formation of short circuits leading to low ozone supply in specific zones where cbz removal could therefore prove much less efficient in order to limit these preferential paths the contactor design could be improved such as by adding baffles on the shell this potential improvement has not yet been tested in this work but warrants investigation in future studies 3 4 2 ozone transfer fig 9 shows the concentration distribution of dissolved ozone in the multi fiber contactor ozone concentration was more homogeneous between fibers in the vicinity of the outlet and rises up to 12 mg l 1 despite an equal velocity of liquid in the upper side and bottom side fig 8 we notice that the ozone concentration in the bottom side is much higher than the upper side to explain this phenomenon supporting information are available in appendix c along the sides of the shell the ozone concentration was 0 2 mg l 1 on the upper side and between 0 8 and 5 mg l 1 on bottom side due to the presence of short circuits in these areas the channelling effect provoking these short circuits has already been observed in previous studies 61 62 this phenomenon leads to a lower mass transfer efficiency due to fluid by pass around bundles of fibers 31 ozone concentration was homogeneous at the outlet at a value of 3 3 mg l 1 which was significantly higher than with the single fiber contactor where the average value was 0 64 mg l 1 this difference is explained by the hydrodynamics in the multi fiber contactor where the presence of multiple fibers leads to a better ozone distribution 3 4 3 effect of fiber length in the multi fiber membrane contactor in order to evaluate the impact of membrane contactor length or residence time the flux of transferred ozone was calculated from simulations with qliq in 42 l h 1 these calculations were based on the ozone concentration applied at the gas inlet and on the dissolved ozone concentration calculated at the liquid outlet a three fold longer contactor 600 mm instead of 200 mm only enabled 19 more ozone transferred 3 62 10 2 mgo3 s 1 instead of 3 05 10 2 mgo3 s 1 this finding again highlights the value of the 3 d model for efforts to optimize contactor geometry in a previous study on the ozonation of humic substances in a membrane contactor with a peroxone treatment i e o3 was injected with h2o2 jansen et al 63 had already suggested that module length and or residence time may have a strong impact on oh and ozone exposures the 3 d modeling approach implemented here suggests that transferred ozone was not proportional to membrane area because ozone concentration was at an equilibrium at the surface of the membrane this equilibrium corresponds to the maximum of dissolved ozone concentration achievable for a specified ozone concentration in the gas phase only better mixing in the liquid phase can promote convective transport and improve the mass transfer this result emphases the need to consider the geometry and hydrodynamics of the membrane contactor in order to improve the mass transfer which can only be done using a 3 d modeling approach here we followed this 3 d modeling approach to overcome the unused potential recently highlighted by bein et al 24 for optimizing the design of ozone membrane contactors as both fiber diameters and module length affect mass transfers 3 5 multi fiber contactor 3 d model with chemical reaction of ozone in this section we performed simulations of ozone transfer in the multi fiber contactor for a water flow rate equal to qliq in of 48 l h 1 at the inlet and an ozone concentration in the gas phase co3 gas in of 50 g nm 3 the ozone concentration in gas phase corresponds to an ozone concentration in liquid phase at gas liquid interface of c o 3 liq of 12 4 mg l 1 according to henry s law the cbz concentration at inlet was ccbz liq in of 1367 μg l 1 in order to make a comparison with the single fiber contactor section 3 3 fig 10 reports the cbz concentration profile in water in the multi fiber contactor conversely to the spatial distribution of ozone without cbz the cbz was completely degraded in the vicinity of the fibers where the ozone concentration was shown to be highest above the fibers a short branch cut can be detected very near the wall boundary this phenomenon is due to a short branch cut for the liquid flow a part of the liquid passes in this small region between the membranes and the upper module wall whereas the other part of the liquid passes through the membrane beam the liquid velocity is quite high in the short branch cut region and the ozone has not enough time to diffuse toward this region before being involved in the reaction with cbz this result highlights the potential impact of shell design on the dynamics of transfer and the necessity to create mixing along the sides of the shell for instance with baffles the multi fiber configuration obviously led to better cbz removal than with the single fiber contactor due to a better ozone distribution cbz concentration at the outlet of 86 μg l 1 on average vs 1078 μg l 1 with the single fiber contactor with slightly different ozonation conditions qliq in 40 l h 1 and c o 3 gas 59 g nm 3 without cbz q liq in 48 l h 1 co3 gas 50 g nm 3 with cbz 4 conclusions the 3 d numerical model developed in this work involving a coupling between mass transport mass transfer and chemical reaction was first successfully validated for a mono fiber contactor using experimental data obtained from a purpose dedicated ozonation device and was then used to predict the ozonation performances of a multi fiber contactor this 3 d model is therefore useful for further optimization of bubbleless processes and for membrane contactor scale up including on applications using ozonation for micropollutant abatement the main conclusions of this study are as follows the 3 d modeling approach developed here made it possible to account for non ideal effects that occur in real hollow fiber membrane contactor configurations such as random flow distribution channelling and dead zones 31 hydrodynamics from the liquid side were shown to strongly affect ozonation performances especially as the ozonation reaction is so fast so mixing efficiency needs to be optimized whatever the configuration single fiber or multi fiber a small boundary layer was observed around the fibers which confirms the need to optimize the fiber density in the contactor a multi fiber contactor enables efficient flow distribution while offering a larger transfer area the simulation results showed that the increase of ozone transferred from the gas phase to the liquid phase is not proportional to membrane length and thus to residence time an optimized process geometry has to be found between contactor length and geometry number of fibers and gas and liquid flow rates in order to maximize the

12626,ozonation processes have been successfully used to remove organic micropollutants membrane contactors can transfer the ozone via a bubbleless process making them promising devices for many applications thanks to a good control of the transferred ozone here we studied the local transfer of ozone into water through a single and a multi fiber membrane contactor by developing a 3 d model in a comsol multiphysics workflow to our knowledge this is the first model to combine 3 d analysis and a multi fiber membrane contactor for an ozonation application the model established here could serve as a startpoint for optimizing bubbleless processes and scaling up membrane contactor processes including the ozonation of micropollutants dedicated experiments were performed to check the model using of a 3 d modeling approach makes it possible to account for the non ideal effects that occur in hollow fiber membrane contactors the simulations highlighted hydrodynamics as a very important factor to ensure good distribution of ozone and therefore good treatment of pollutants moreover the transferred ozone does not increase proportionally with increasing membrane length or residence time finding the right compromise between contactor length and fibers number can help optimize the contactor geometry and thus make the process as effective as possible graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

navier stokes wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction ozonation has long been widely applied for disinfection of drinking water and wastewater ozonation processes have long been successfully used to remove organic micropollutants such as cbz 1 5 conventional ozonation processes e g bubble columns and ozonation chambers employ ozone dispersion in the form of bubbles which carries several disadvantages including foam generation stripping volatile organic compounds a high reactor footprint high operational costs and high energetic cost due to mass transfer limitations 6 furthermore the ozone dosage is difficult to control and can in some cases result in over consumption of ozone and generate by products that may prove even more dangerous than the original products 7 9 for instance ozonation of waters that contain bromides produces bromates which are regulated in drinking water due to their carcinogenic potential 10 11 the eu and the european us epa have set a limit cap of 10 μg l 1 bromate in drinking water 12 13 ozonation induced paraben by products are another example indeed gao et al 7 showed that the paraben by products were more toxic to green algae than the original compound itself due to its reaction with hydroxyl radicals membrane contactors transfer zone via a bubbleless process which makes them very promising devices to overcome these issues the membrane acts as a barrier between the liquid and the gas phases and the mass transfer occurs by diffusion due to a concentration gradient the process takes place under low pressure which makes it energy efficient moreover hollow fiber membrane contactors offer the huge advantage of a very high exchange surface up to 10 000 m2 m 3 compared to conventional processes between 3 and 600 m2 m 3 14 16 membrane contactors are usually used as separation method in two phase contacting systems 17 for instance these installations are frequently used for co2 absorption where a concentration gradient drives the transfer of gaseous co2 through the membrane into the liquid phase i e the absorbent which it gets transformed into dissolved co2 at the gas liquid interface 18 20 membrane contactors have recently highlighted the potential value of ozonation applications in wastewater treatment as a way to efficiently remove micropollutants while limiting bromate formation 16 21 22 in a previous study our team performed an experimental evaluation of an ozone diffusion process using a hollow fiber membrane contactor 23 however we pointed out a need to better understand the mass transfer optimize the device design and determine the most suitable process parameters a numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics cfd would greatly assist this effort 17 note too that a literature review on ozone membrane contactors for water and wastewater treatment concluded that there is huge potential to optimize membrane contactor geometry 24 a few studies have already made progress on modeling membrane contactors for ozonation processes this extant literature generally employs two different approaches first the model can be created from a global approach where the membrane contactor acts as a black box 25 in this case semi empirical correlations are commonly used to calculate the mass and heat transfer coefficients involved in the full process transfers as the fibers have a simple geometry these classical correlations provide a fairly reliable estimation of the transfer coefficients however it is much trickier to find the most relevant correlation for estimating the transfer coefficient in the cartridge side this is a huge limitation in the model presented here since the main resistance to mass transfer is expected to be localized in the liquid phase given the value of the henry coefficient between ozone and water and the water circulates in the cartridge using a semi empirical correlation would prove difficult and lead to serious approximations these kinds of model offer a global vision of the process and allow general comparison of the installations engineered but they do not account for variations in velocity or concentration and thus fail to address diffusion and convection effects along the module whereas these effects can have a substantial impact on the mass transfer second in order to improve the understanding of the mass transfers and phenomena involved in the process the model can also be established via a local approach which has the added advantage of enabling optimization of the contactor design stylianou et al 26 worked on modeling ozonation in a ceramic membrane contactor via a global approach in order to provide a fundamental basis for the design of bubbleless ozonation processes in particular for the removal of micropollutants their model was based on both mass transfer and ozone decomposition reactions and was established by mobilizing experimental data obtained in situ with a hydrophobized α al2o3 ceramic membrane contactor the aim was to allow their model to be extrapolated to different devices scale up and experimental conditions by adapting the values of major physical parameters e g diffusivity or solubility taken from the literature or measured in experiments in this sense they used the leveque equation including dimensionless numbers such as the sherwood and the peclet numbers and the model was validated for a laminar regime berry et al 27 worked with a local approach and established a model by using comsol multiphysics for the simulation of ozone and oxygen transfer through a capillary non porous membrane the single fiber was simulated with a two dimensional axisymmetric computation domain and the model was validated for a laminar flow regime however based on experimental results found in the literature berry et al were unable to successfully validate their numerical model in the transitional flow regime furthermore the authors presented no result for turbulent flow regime focusing on experimental studies zoumpouli et al 28 worked on ozone transfer through a non porous tubular membrane using experimental data obtained in absence of chemical reaction they found that the local model developed by berry et al slightly overestimated the mass transfer coefficients they calculated molar fluxes of ozone and overall mass transfer coefficients for different ozone gas concentrations and liquid side velocities based on their experimental data and showed that membrane size i e inner diameter was a key parameter for the ozone transfer they also experimentally studied the effect of the matrix on the removal of a model compound i e para chlorobenzoic acid but without including the chemical reaction in the model according to bein et al 24 one of the barriers to upscaling lab scale results from mass transfer enhancement theory is the change in ozone concentration over fiber length research using the local approach could help ease this bottleneck although results presented further in this paper have been obtained by using a simplified model setting a constant gas concentration and validated in the case of the membrane contactor studied the not simplified model established in our work runs also with variation of the ozone concentration over fiber length which is essential in the case of longer membrane contactor the studies cited above simulated only one fiber whereas multi fiber contactors hold much more promise for enhancing mass transfer due to their higher exchange surface multi fiber simulation allows to get closer to reality where the membrane contactors are often made of a lot of fibers within a cartridge and therefore to consider the liquid flow between the fibers and along the contactor qatezadeh deriss et al 17 investigated the effect of number of fibers on removal of ibuprofen another pharmaceutical by using a hollow fiber membrane contactor with octanol the simulation was performed with a two dimensional model and the influence of number of fibers was studied using the method developed by happel 29 governing equations for the shell membrane and tube sides were solved using comsol multiphysics in order to validate the model they compared their simulation results against experimental data from the literature their results showed that the final concentration of ibuprofen was not proportional to number of fibers thus highlighting the need to simulate a multi fiber system to predict the efficiency of the whole process this brief look at the state of art finds that efforts are still needed to model ozonation processes using membrane contactors however to the best of our knowledge 3 d multi fiber simulation of the ozonation process has never been achieved zhao et al 30 had already highlighted that regardless of the applications targeted a convection diffusion approach through a 3 d grid would be make significant headway toward module characterization for membrane contactors in a recent review ng et al 31 showed that only very few studies on gas separation processes had used a 3 d approach 31 34 and none had addressed ozonation processes ng et al 31 concluded that previous models failed to consider non ideal effects such as a random fiber distribution a random flow distribution and the presence of channelling or dead zones 31 3 d modeling uses much more computation time than other models due to additional directions and variables but it could nevertheless overcome these challenges indeed 3 d modeling could help to stay close to the reality of experimental set ups or industrial scale installations by taking into account the real contactor geometry which is crucial for validation of a relevant model 31 here to address these challenges this study set out to use a modeling approach to gain a better understanding of the process of ozone transfer through a hollow fiber membrane contactor we evaluated the effects of contactor geometry number of fibers and fiber length process conditions ozone concentration in the gas phase and liquid flow rate and hydrodynamics on ozone transfer and carbamazepine removal efficiency in order to check the numerical model before going deeper into the extrapolation and interpretation of results we compared our simulation results were against experimental data obtained using a single hollow fiber membrane contactor 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup 2 1 1 membrane contactor technology the single fiber membrane contactor used in this work was home made designed and fabricated in the lab manufacturing workshop of the iem the

is weight of the dry membrane diso is isopropanol density and dptfe is density of the polymer 2 1 2 pilot ozonation system the lab scale pilot ozonation system fig 1 consisted of a single fiber membrane contactor continuously fed by an oxygen ozone mix ozone was produced by an ozone generator bmt 803 n from a tank of lab grade pure oxygen and then diluted with oxygen in order to achieve the desired gas flow rate and the desired concentration of the o2 o3 mix with two solenoid valves connected to a computer ozone concentration at both the gas inlet and at the gas outlet was monitored with an ozone gas analyzer bmt 964 after dehumidification the liquid flowed into the pilot from a thermostatically controlled 20 c stirred 30 l feed tank liquid circulation was driven by a peristaltic pump watson marlow 323 in order to collect samples one tap located upstream of the membrane contactor and one tap located downstream of the membrane contactor were available the liquid was circulated through the membrane contactor once a container with potassium iodide solution was then used to recover the liquid in order to prevent the ozone degassing gas circulated via a counter current flow inside the fiber and the liquid in the shell a concentration gradient transferred ozone from the gas phase of the membrane contactor to the liquid phase 2 1 3 chemicals carbamazepine c15h12n2o cbz was chosen as a model compound due to its well known reaction kinetics determined through numerous previous studies cbz is an anti epileptic drug that is widely used in many countries this cbz compound is only partially removed in conventional wwtps 37 38 like many other pharmaceuticals cbz is widely found in secondary treatment stages of wwtp effluents as widely reported in the literature 39 42 this study used high purity 99 analytical grade cbz from sigma pure potassium indigotrisulfonate sigma aldrich was used as ozone scavenging reagent 2 1 4 cbz solution acid buffered cbz solution was used the solution was obtained by dissolving 2 ppm of cbz in buffered water which was produced by dissolving 1 2 g l 1 of sodium dihydrogen phosphate nah2po4 sigma aldrich in deionized water total organic carbon 30 ppb resistivity 5 mω cm 15 mω cm and then adjusting the ph with a few milliliters of phosphoric acid h3po4 concentrated at 84 sigma aldrich the ph of the final matrix was 3 after 24 h of stirring the solution was injected into the feed tank the liquid was then left to circulate for at least 12 h in closed loop mode with compressed air flowing in the fiber this recirculation serves to achieve a balance between the system i e the pilot materials and the solution due to potential adsorption the pilot was then switched into an open loop circuit configuration before starting the ozonation experiment the initial concentration of cbz was determined using 3 samples collected in both the feed tank and at the tap upstream of the membrane contactor see fig 1 2 1 5 analytical methods the indigo method 43 was used to determine dissolved ozone concentration in the liquid phase spectrophotometric determination was made by using the indigo method corresponding to the anticipated range between 0 01 and 0 1 mgo3 l 1 cbz was quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms using a waters device an xselect hss t3 c18 resin column 100 mm 21 mm with a 2 5 μm particle size was used as stationary phase at room temperature with a first eluent composed of 90 hplc grade water 10 hplc grade acetonitrile acn and 0 1 formic acid and with a second eluent composed of acn and 0 1 formic acid the following detection conditions were applied to the ms capillary potential 3 5 kv cone voltage 25 v source temperature 120 c desolvation temperature 450 c cone gas flow 50 nl h 1 desolvation gas flow of 450 nl h 1 and collision energy of 20 v the calibration curves were plotted using buffered water with known concentrations of cbz to avoid matrix effects on detection the instrument limit of quantification iloq and the instrument limit of detection ilod for cbz were about 10 μg l 1 and 3 μg l 1 respectively 2 2 3 d model development herein we developed an original multi physical model of the hollow fiber membrane contactor including a i coupling between fluid flows within the membrane contactor ii ozone mass transport though the membrane iii mass transfer at the membrane liquid flow interface and iv chemical reactions involving ozone and carbamazepine in the liquid phase to ensure reliable validation of the numerical model using the experimental data a 3 d model was necessary in order to consider the geometry of the experimental pilot fig 1 the experimental water flow rate of 50 l h 1 used in the lab scale pilot ozonation system allowed to calculate a reynolds number of 1650 for liquid flow in the case of the single fiber contactor the experimental gas flow rate used of 1 l h 1 corresponded to a reynolds number of 55 for gas flow at this step with a global approach we were able to consider laminar flow in the hydrodynamic model and both liquid and gas flow patterns were assessed numerically by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans transport equations additional transport equations had to be solved to calculate ozone concentration in the gas within the membrane and in the water as well as cbz concentration in the water moreover despite the reynolds number there will still be mixing taking place due to the contactor geometry liquid inlet and outlet perpendicular to the fibers the numerical

gmres method has been used in this study this solver provides robust solutions when simulating hydrodynamics in 2d axisymmetric or 3d geometries 2 2 1 monofiber 3 d model a first model was developed with only one fiber within the cartridge to properly validate the numerical results using our own experiment data the 3 d geometry of the single hollow fiber membrane contactor was built using comsol multiphysics software fig 2 a the overall dimensions corresponding to the device are 600 mm length and a 10 mm diameter of the water inlet the water outlet and the main axial tube containing the fiber the inlet and the outlet are arranged perpendicular to the main tube and thus also perpendicular to the fiber the external fiber diameter is 0 87 mm the model configuration is characterized by a longitudinal yz plane of symmetry such that the simulations were launched in a half contactor geometry meshing of the 3 d geometry required the use of hybrid hexahedral tetrahedral meshes fig 2 b to optimize the mesh quality and thus improve the numerical convergence of the model boundary layers were built on the wall surfaces to properly simulate the flow in the vicinity of the walls assuming no slip conditions despite the plane of symmetry 1 5 million meshes were necessary to obtain reliable convergence with rans model 2 2 2 gas phase 2 2 2 1 fluid flow working to the assumptions described

is assumed that ozone diffuses through the membrane pores and that no chemical reaction occurs within the membrane assumption of non wettability consequently we assumed a stagnant gas phase within the membrane pores with ozone transport driven exclusively by diffusion phenomena as described by the following equation 5 d o 3 m eff c o 3 gas 0 where d o 3 m eff represents the effective diffusion coefficient of ozone in the membrane in m2 s 1 in porous media both molecular and knudsen diffusions occur and the knudsen number indicates the dominant phenomenon 46 in this work as knudsen number was very low knudsen diffusion was neglected appendix a thus the effective diffusion coefficient was calculated from equations 47 6 d o 3 m eff d o 3 gas ε m τ where d o 3 g in m2 s 1 is the ozone

v liq in c cbz liq in a null flux was considered for ozone in the feed water flux outlet for all species i the convective flux dominates the outgoing mass flux so c i liq z 0 at the outer cartridge wall boundary conditions were simulated with an impermeable wall 2 2 4 3 chemical reactions in this first study the model considered the chemical reaction between ozone and cbz but not the other chemical reactions involved during ozone decomposition this decision was motivated by the fact that the reaction between cbz and molecular ozone is fast because ozone attacks the double bond of cbz 51 leading to a high reaction rate constant ko3 3 0 105 mol l 1 s 1 this reaction gives rise to the formation of several by products containing quinazoline based functional groups 52 the reaction rate constants of the different by products with o3 are significantly slower by about five orders of magnitude compared to cbz 52 moreover the residence time of the liquid in the membrane contactor was very short about 7 s for a liquid flow rate of 40 l h 1 so we assumed that reactions between by products from cbz and o3 could be neglected the reaction of cbz with hydroxyl radicals generally present during ozonation processes due to ozone decomposition processes was not taken into account in the model due to the acidic conditions imposed 53 54 the irreversible chemical reaction between ozone and cbz was thus described as follows 13 cbz o 3 bqm the rate of this second order reaction was given by 14 r i liq k r c o 3 liq c cbz liq where k r is the reaction rate constant in m3 mol 1 s 1 2 2 5 solving the equations with the solver in 3d geometry the simulation involving the coupling between hydrodynamics mass transfer and chemical reaction involving ozone and carbamazepine lasted 22 h in the case of the mono fiber contactor and 36 h in the case of the multi fiber contactor the simulation was performed using a 3 4 ghz xeon gold 12 core workstation with 96 gb of ram the parameters used for the simulation are specified in the table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 model simplification a first set of numerical simulations was launched in order to check whether the model could be simplified especially concerning the gas flow within the inner fiber indeed ozone transfer resistance from gas phase to liquid phase can be characterized based on four contributions i resistance in the gas phase due to ozone diffusion ii resistance within the pores of the membrane iii resistance at the gas liquid interface due to phase change henry s law and iv resistance in the liquid phase mainly due to molecular diffusion within the boundary layer among these four resistances it was reasonable to expect that the resistance to ozone transfer in the gas phase within the fiber could be neglected therefore preliminary simulations were run to confirm this assumption rather than computing gas flow within the fiber a dirichlet boundary condition was tested assuming that ozone supply from the gas inlet was much higher than the rate of ozone transfer through the membrane thus enabling us to consider a constant ozone concentration at the gas membrane interface along the membrane length in other words a boundary condition of ozone concentration instead of the gas flow rate was considered at this interface thus significantly simplifying the numerical simulations the results of the ozone concentration at the liquid outlet c o 3 liq out obtained with the simplified model simulations for an ozone concentration c o 3 gas in of 50 g nm 3 assumed to be the same all along the fiber were 71 1 μg l 1 63 8 μg l 1 and 60 6 μg l 1 for a liquid flow rate q0 w of 30 40 and 50 l h 1 respectively when comparing these results against the complete model simulations with gas flow within the fibers we found a maximum relative error between the two models of 0 9 which is very low therefore circulation of the gas inside the fiber and the evolution of ozone concentration along the fiber were not taken into account in the following results note that this model simplification was valid in the specific case of the membrane contactor studied but would not hold in the case of longer membrane contactor due to a higher and thus significant variation of the ozone concentration along the contactor in the gas phase in this last case the completed model would be therefore used also note that for the graphical presentation of the main results obtained by numerical simulation given the 60 fold difference in the ratio between membrane contactor length 600 mm and membrane thickness 10 mm the main figures graph the results considering two specific regions of the contactor the inlet region 80 mm length and the outlet region 60 mm length 3 2 single fiber contactor 3 d model without chemical reaction the results presented in this section correspond to a liquid flow rate q0 w of 50 l h 1 at the inlet of the contactor and an ozone concentration c o 3 gas in in the gas phase of 50 g nm 3 this corresponds to an ozone concentration c o 3 gas at the membrane water interface i e at the external surface of the fiber of 12 4 mg l 1 according to henry s law equation 10 57 these conditions were chosen to accommodate the experimental limits of the pilot ozonation system the main objective of this first set of simulation results compared to the experimental results obtained was to properly validate the complex numerical model obviously with only one fiber in the cartridge the global ozonation process was far from optimized optimization is discussed in part 3 4 multi fiber contactor 3 2 1 hydrodynamics fig 3 shows the velocity field in the membrane contactor and clearly illustrates that the center of the fiber cannot be considered as an axis of symmetry thus justifying the choice of performing 3 d simulations rather than 2d axisymmetric plane simulations due to the geometry of the cartridge inlet small dead zones can be identified especially in the vicinity of each end of the cartridge the velocity field at the inlet zone shows that the magnitude of velocity is much higher below the membrane which is due to the geometry of the inlet feed more precisely at the inlet the average velocity magnitude is 0 18 m s 1 which corresponds to a flow rate of 50 l h 1 the flow velocity ranged between 0 30 and 0 40 m s 1 below the fiber and along the z axis whereas it was close to 0 15 m s 1 below the fiber the flow then becomes parallel to the fiber and the velocity magnitude tends toward a homogeneous average value around 0 25 m s 1 on both sides of the fiber the flow pattern is strongly affected by the geometry of the contactor outlet where counter current flows promote the emergence of a high speed area in the outlet channel around 0 35 m s 1 and small recirculation zones characterized by low velocity magnitude despite a reynolds number indicating a laminar flow the assumption of a laminar flow in the shell side appears to be inappropriate as also suggested in previous work 59 60 a 2 d modeling approach would not have provided this information 31 3 2 2 ozone transfer fig 4 shows ozone concentration in the liquid phase in the yz plane of symmetry and on two zx cross sections located close to the inlet and outlet regions respectively ozone concentrations superior to 0 2 mg l 1 and up to 12 4 mg l 1 which was the maximum achieved here are shown in white ozone concentration under the fiber along the z axis was very low 0 01 mg l 1 due to the high velocity magnitude fig 3 conversely ozone concentration was high up to 12 4 mg l 1 in a thin layer around the fiber all along the contactor as expected when using only one fiber in the cartridge this underlines the very small effective volume of the contactor i e the volume of liquid containing dissolved ozone which means that a large portion of the volume is not involved in the mass transfer this layer can be interpreted as a boundary layer where the transversal diffusion of ozone is the limiting parameter in the vicinity of the outlet an area of high ozone concentration above the fiber corresponds to a dead zone of flow as the main flow is directed upward and there is a recirculation zone at the end of the contactor ozone concentration was homogenous at the outlet of the contactor cartridge side at a mean value of 0 064 mg l 1 range 0 03 0 08 mg l 1 it should also be mentioned that for the mono fiber configuration and near the module entrance radial convective flux due to vertical inlet geometry cannot be neglected fig 3 exhibits that large vortices are created in the first 80 mm thus creating vertical convection in parallel the longitudinal liquid velocity is higher in the lower part of the module so that the ozone is transported more rapidly toward the outlet of the module both phenomena explain the higher ozone concentration in the upper part of the module without reaction with cbz these findings are important because they show that the spatial distribution of the ozone is heterogeneous along the membrane contactor with highly concentrated zones near the membrane but very low concentrations of ozone in a large fraction of the bulk the numerical results therefore suggest that the diameter of the shell of the membrane contactor with only one fiber is oversized meaning that the bulk volume containing the water could be significantly reduced note that a 2d axisymmetrical model would fail to describe the hydrodynamics within the membrane contactor and thus the ozone concentration in the bulk from inlet to outlet along the contactor the 3d numerical work here provides a better understanding of the phenomena limiting ozone transfer and can thus serve to optimize the contactor geometry more results concerning ozone concentration in the single fiber membrane contactor are available in appendix b and support the importance of the shell design on transfer 3 2 3 model validation simulation vs experiments there are still lots of studies that present numerical simulations without validating their results on experimental data obtained in parallel here we decided to validate the simulation results by comparing the ozone concentration calculated by the model against the ozone concentration determined experimentally using a purpose designed lab scale pilot experimentally ozone concentration was calculated using the indigo method on samples collected at the outlet of the module whereas in the simulations ozone concentration was calculated using the equation 15 c o 3 liq out φ o 3 n ds out v liq n ds out where c o 3 liq out is the concentration of ozone at the outlet in mg l 1 v liq is the water velocity vector in m s 1 n the vector normal to the outlet surface sout and φ o 3 is the vector of total density flux diffusive and convective flux in mg h 1 m 2 such that φ o 3 d o 3 liq c o 3 liq c o 3 liq v liq table 3 reports the results obtained experimentally versus using simulation for two different liquid flow rates and for an ozone concentration at the gas inlet of around 50 g nm 3 the numerical simulations are consistent with the experimental results especially given that the model did not contain any adjustable parameters based on this comparison we considered the numerical model for mass transfer as validated once the model was validated we ran simulations to quantify the effect of some of the major operating parameters on process efficiency 3 2 4 effect of process conditions liquid flow rate and ozone concentration in the gas phase on ozone transfer through the single fiber membrane contactor in fig 5 plots the residual ozone concentration calculated at the outlet against liquid flow rate in the membrane contactor for increasing ozone concentrations in the inlet gas flux when ozone concentration in the gas phase doubles the flux of transferred ozone also doubles when liquid flow rate doubles the ozone transfer is multiplied by 1 6 due to the decrease in resistance on the liquid side therefore both liquid flow rate and ozone concentration in the gas phase have a positive impact on ozone transfer which is in agreement with previous studies 26 35 3 3 one fiber contactor 3 d model with chemical reaction of ozone in this part of the study the chemical reaction of ozone with cbz was coupled to the mass transfer equations in the model results presented below correspond to a simulation run with a water flow rate qliq in at the inlet of 40 l h 1 an ozone concentration in the gas phase co3 gas inof 59 g nm 3 corresponding to an ozone concentration at the fiber of 14 9 mg l 1 according to henry s law and a cbz concentration at the water inlet ccbz liq in of 1366 5 μg l 1 these conditions were chosen to accommodate the experimental limits of the pilot ozonation system 3 3 1 ozone transfer fig 6 represents the ozone concentration in water and can be directly compared to fig 4 simulations without chemical reaction as expected ozone concentration was lower with cbz than without cbz in the liquid phase because of the consumption of cbz by o3 which is known to be non limiting ozone concentration was low far from the membrane especially below the fiber more precisely in mono fiber configuration hydrodynamics within the liquid phase induces vertical velocities due to the presence of large vortices thus transporting rapidly ozone from the membrane by convection in the upper part of the module in this region the characteristic time of the convection is of the same order of magnitude of the characteristic time of reaction so that the ozone concentration is not null in the lower part of the module the velocity field is mainly composed of longitudinal velocities which does not contribute to rapidly transport ozone in the vertical direction from the membrane interface therefore ozone concentration is lower in the lower part of the module in the vicinity of the fiber there was a small effective volume with a thin layer of ozone thinner than in fig 4 where ozone concentration is high up to 14 9 mg l 1 based on the simulation results the boundary layer 130 μm thick on average and thus the hatta number was close to 3 7 which corresponds to a fast reaction occurring in the liquid film 54 this result further confirms the observations made from fig 6 i e a large part of the shell is not useful for the chemical reaction between o3 and cbz because this reaction takes place in the liquid film at the outlet of the contactor the values of ozone concentration ranged from 0 01 to 0 06 mg l 1 with an average of 0 02 mg l 1 fig 6 can also be compared to fig 7 showing a correlation between cbz and o3 concentration due to the consumption of cbz by o3 3 3 2 cbz degradation fig 7 represents the concentration of cbz in water in the contactor for qliq in 40 l h 1 co3 gas 59 g nm 3 and ccbz liq in 1366 5 μg l 1 these conditions were chosen in order to validate the model and no significant degradation of cbz was expected conversely to the spatial distribution of ozone the cbz was completely degraded in the vicinity of the fiber and in the dead zone close to the outlet where ozone concentration was shown to be highest elsewhere cbz was partially transformed with residual values ranging between 1070 and 1360 μg l 1 cbz concentration was slightly lower above the fiber than below because of higher liquid velocities in the lower region cbz concentration was lower in the outlet zone where the concentration of dissolved ozone was highest cbz concentrations at the outlet ranged from 1030 to 1160 μg l 1 with an average of 1078 μg l 1 3 3 3 model validation simulation vs experiment in order to validate the reaction part of the model an experiment was conducted at 20 c with a liquid flow rate of 40 l h 1 a gas flow rate of 1 l h 1 an ozone concentration at the gas inlet of 59 g nm 3 and a cbz concentration at the liquid inlet of 1367 33 μg l 1 results are presented in table 4 the simulation results are consistent with those found experimentally thus confirming that reaction transfer transport model presented herein is reliable 3 4 multi fiber contactor 3 d model without chemical reaction once the model had been validated with experimental data the next step was to focus on a real multi fiber contactor in this section we simulated the transfer of ozone in a 10 mm diameter membrane contactor with 64 hollow fibers these fibers were evenly distributed and separated 0 18 mm apart from each other for numerical reasons the simulations were performed for a water flow rate qliq in of 48 l h 1 at the inlet and an ozone concentration in the gas phase co3 gas of 50 g nm 3 corresponding to a concentration on the fiber c o3 liq of 12 4 mg l 1 according to henry s law 3 4 1 hydrodynamics in the multi fiber membrane contactor fig 8 reports the velocity field simulated in the multi fiber membrane contactor configuration with the parameters previously described in section 3 4 more specifically fig 8 plots the velocity magnitude and direction located on the yz plane of symmetry and on the inlet and outlet sections fibers are shown in brown to facilitate readability although the velocity field is clearly more uniform than in the single fiber configuration there are still preferential paths visible within the contactor particularly at each side of the shell this result is consistent a previous study by cai et al 33 concerning 3 d modeling of a hollow fiber membrane contactor for co2 absorption the authors observed that modules with a high packing density led to a more uniform distribution of flow compared to sparsely packed modules in our case packing density i e the ratio between the exchange surface and volume at the shell side was higher for the multi fiber contactor than for the single fiber contactor due to the higher number of fibers in shells of identical volume like in the single fiber membrane contactor the velocity field will affect the distribution of ozone in the contactor the preferential paths could potentially induce the formation of short circuits leading to low ozone supply in specific zones where cbz removal could therefore prove much less efficient in order to limit these preferential paths the contactor design could be improved such as by adding baffles on the shell this potential improvement has not yet been tested in this work but warrants investigation in future studies 3 4 2 ozone transfer fig 9 shows the concentration distribution of dissolved ozone in the multi fiber contactor ozone concentration was more homogeneous between fibers in the vicinity of the outlet and rises up to 12 mg l 1 despite an equal velocity of liquid in the upper side and bottom side fig 8 we notice that the ozone concentration in the bottom side is much higher than the upper side to explain this phenomenon supporting information are available in appendix c along the sides of the shell the ozone concentration was 0 2 mg l 1 on the upper side and between 0 8 and 5 mg l 1 on bottom side due to the presence of short circuits in these areas the channelling effect provoking these short circuits has already been observed in previous studies 61 62 this phenomenon leads to a lower mass transfer efficiency due to fluid by pass around bundles of fibers 31 ozone concentration was homogeneous at the outlet at a value of 3 3 mg l 1 which was significantly higher than with the single fiber contactor where the average value was 0 64 mg l 1 this difference is explained by the hydrodynamics in the multi fiber contactor where the presence of multiple fibers leads to a better ozone distribution 3 4 3 effect of fiber length in the multi fiber membrane contactor in order to evaluate the impact of membrane contactor length or residence time the flux of transferred ozone was calculated from simulations with qliq in 42 l h 1 these calculations were based on the ozone concentration applied at the gas inlet and on the dissolved ozone concentration calculated at the liquid outlet a three fold longer contactor 600 mm instead of 200 mm only enabled 19 more ozone transferred 3 62 10 2 mgo3 s 1 instead of 3 05 10 2 mgo3 s 1 this finding again highlights the value of the 3 d model for efforts to optimize contactor geometry in a previous study on the ozonation of humic substances in a membrane contactor with a peroxone treatment i e o3 was injected with h2o2 jansen et al 63 had already suggested that module length and or residence time may have a strong impact on oh and ozone exposures the 3 d modeling approach implemented here suggests that transferred ozone was not proportional to membrane area because ozone concentration was at an equilibrium at the surface of the membrane this equilibrium corresponds to the maximum of dissolved ozone concentration achievable for a specified ozone concentration in the gas phase only better mixing in the liquid phase can promote convective transport and improve the mass transfer this result emphases the need to consider the geometry and hydrodynamics of the membrane contactor in order to improve the mass transfer which can only be done using a 3 d modeling approach here we followed this 3 d modeling approach to overcome the unused potential recently highlighted by bein et al 24 for optimizing the design of ozone membrane contactors as both fiber diameters and module length affect mass transfers 3 5 multi fiber contactor 3 d model with chemical reaction of ozone in this section we performed simulations of ozone transfer in the multi fiber contactor for a water flow rate equal to qliq in of 48 l h 1 at the inlet and an ozone concentration in the gas phase co3 gas in of 50 g nm 3 the ozone concentration in gas phase corresponds to an ozone concentration in liquid phase at gas liquid interface of c o 3 liq of 12 4 mg l 1 according to henry s law the cbz concentration at inlet was ccbz liq in of 1367 μg l 1 in order to make a comparison with the single fiber contactor section 3 3 fig 10 reports the cbz concentration profile in water in the multi fiber contactor conversely to the spatial distribution of ozone without cbz the cbz was completely degraded in the vicinity of the fibers where the ozone concentration was shown to be highest above the fibers a short branch cut can be detected very near the wall boundary this phenomenon is due to a short branch cut for the liquid flow a part of the liquid passes in this small region between the membranes and the upper module wall whereas the other part of the liquid passes through the membrane beam the liquid velocity is quite high in the short branch cut region and the ozone has not enough time to diffuse toward this region before being involved in the reaction with cbz this result highlights the potential impact of shell design on the dynamics of transfer and the necessity to create mixing along the sides of the shell for instance with baffles the multi fiber configuration obviously led to better cbz removal than with the single fiber contactor due to a better ozone distribution cbz concentration at the outlet of 86 μg l 1 on average vs 1078 μg l 1 with the single fiber contactor with slightly different ozonation conditions qliq in 40 l h 1 and c o 3 gas 59 g nm 3 without cbz q liq in 48 l h 1 co3 gas 50 g nm 3 with cbz 4 conclusions the 3 d numerical model developed in this work involving a coupling between mass transport mass transfer and chemical reaction was first successfully validated for a mono fiber contactor using experimental data obtained from a purpose dedicated ozonation device and was then used to predict the ozonation performances of a multi fiber contactor this 3 d model is therefore useful for further optimization of bubbleless processes and for membrane contactor scale up including on applications using ozonation for micropollutant abatement the main conclusions of this study are as follows the 3 d modeling approach developed here made it possible to account for non ideal effects that occur in real hollow fiber membrane contactor configurations such as random flow distribution channelling and dead zones 31 hydrodynamics from the liquid side were shown to strongly affect ozonation performances especially as the ozonation reaction is so fast so mixing efficiency needs to be optimized whatever the configuration single fiber or multi fiber a small boundary layer was observed around the fibers which confirms the need to optimize the fiber density in the contactor a multi fiber contactor enables efficient flow distribution while offering a larger transfer area the simulation results showed that the increase of ozone transferred from the gas phase to the liquid phase is not proportional to membrane length and thus to residence time an optimized process geometry has to be found between contactor length and geometry number of fibers and gas and liquid flow rates in order to maximize the

12627,a low cost in situ micro laser transmission imlt analysis system for particle size monitoring based on the principle of laser transmission extinction was developed to monitor the flocculation process in this study the imlt system was used to obtain the voltage generated with the changes of flocculant dosage and floc sizes in different flocculation stages a typical machine learning model convolution neural network cnn method was built to manage the flocculant dosage detection voltage and floc size to improve the accuracy of the correlation between the them results of imlt revealed that the particle size of flocs was inversely proportional to the voltage and a larger final voltage r value indicated better effects of flocculation and sedimentation the correlation between the particle size obtained by cnn training and measured particle size was 42 4 and 30 5 higher than that without training at low and high concentrations respectively imlt is effective in reflecting the floc sedimentation stability and dynamic influence of the coagulant aid on flocculation system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords flocculation on line monitoring deep learning laser projection floc detection data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction flocculation is an important aspect of water treatment its efficiency will affect the subsequent operation and final treatment effects however it is often difficult to determine the proper dosage of flocculants and coagulants to ensure flocculating effect due to the lack of on line measurement methods 32 current researchers were mainly conducted on floc morphology fractal dimension sedimentation rate water turbidity removal and uv254 removal to evaluate flocculation among them floc size as a critical physical index is more influential in evaluating flocculation 31 37 53 56 generally large flocs have higher settling rate lead to better effects 20 45 therefore the dynamic and continuous evaluation of floc size is crucial in flocculation present monitoring techniques such as image analysis ultrasonic techniques and light scattering can be adapted to the evaluation of floc size 10 12 18 27 the image technique provides a good data regarding flocculent shape but cannot get rid of the limitation of the two dimensional scale so it is not suitable for measuring irregular particles 6 13 25 30 54 the ultrasonic technology can free from this limitation to some extent but its application is often hindered by unknown physical parameters of particles 2 15 19 34 furthermore the immaturity of the method in inverting the floc size also needs to be solved light scattering techniques are relatively commonly used in measuring particle sizes 17 40 49 55 the laser transmission extinction method is one of them which measures the attenuation of the transmitted light intensity caused by the scattering and absorption of particles as the light beam passes through a medium containing particles 29 then it determines the particle system according to the relationship between the extent of attenuation and size and quantity of particles currently the on line monitoring technology based on laser extinction has been applied to the formation of vapor bubbles the thickness of liquid film the measurement of soot and so on 28 36 42 it has the advantages of simple structure non contact measurement moreover the sensitivity and accuracy are relatively high 46 therefore this method has found an increasingly utilization in several fields in addition there were interactions among various factors in the flocculation so it is necessary to consider the influences between them and improve the accuracy of the results through model training convolution neural network cnn is a deep learning model that is universally used in computer vision applications 21 it is able to extract meaningful features from locally associated data sources the output of convoluted kernel is then fed to the activation function which aids in learning and embedding the nonlinearity into the features this nonlinear generates different activation functions for each reaction making it easier to learn meaningful dissimilarities in images furthermore a nonlinear activation function produces an output that is frequently trailed by sub samples this helps with summarizing the outputs which makes the input insensitive to geometrical deceptions 3 at present many researchers have used cnn model to refine as much as possible the operating parameters in the flocculation a model for prediction is constructed by inputting recorded images or data as training data 26 33 48 in this study an in situ micro laser transmission imlt analysis system for on line detection and comprehensive analysis of floc formation and sedimentation effect was designed based on the laser transmission extinction principle specifically correlation between light transmission intensity of the system and the actual state of the flocculation process was determined and then the dynamic process of the flocculation with different concentrations of flocculants and coagulants were continuously monitored by laser system furthermore we applied the cnn model in deep learning to train the unknown relationship between voltage and flocculent size obtained from experimental measurement so as to construct a training model 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials raw water was employed in the experiment as the source from an artificial lake analysis grade polyaluminum chloride chloride pac shanghai aladdin company china and anionic polyacrylamide pam shanghai aladdin company china were selected as flocculant and coagulant aid respectively the floc size distribution was determined using the light detection device which consisted of apd light conversion module as light source receiver 650 nm red laser transmitter as light source and a square flocculent tank made of plexiglass as the reaction tank the superfine kaolin 5um functioned as the labeled substance being measured the instruments used were a magnetic stirrer rct basic ika germany turbidity meter 2100p hach usa and marvin laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 marvin uk 2 2 experimental principle this experiment mainly adopted the extinction method to measure particle size when the incident light intensity remains constant light will be continuously scattered and absorbed in the system with the change of the particle size and concentration of flocs in the coagulation system this leads to the attenuation of emitted light intensity this method complies with the lambert beer law eq 1 combining the principle of extinction method and the equivalent approximation law the floc size can be revealed by measuring the extinction ratio 5 11 1 i i 0 e ux where i0 is the incident light intensity i represents the transmitted light intensity u denotes the light absorption coefficient of the medium and x stands for the length of optical path the transmitted light intensity is mainly affected by the light absorption coefficient among them at a certain value of optical path length fig 1 shows the principle of laser projection in situ detection and the circuit board of photoelectric conversion in this detector device the raw water was placed in the shading reactor the laser transmitter was placed on the outer wall of the shading reaction tank and the signal receiver was placed on the outer wall on the opposite side which ensured the alignment of the two optical paths a magnetic rotor was set at the bottom of the reaction tank in the experiment and the magnetic stirrer served as the power device of flocculation so any influence on light path propagation was avoided flocculation occurred and flocs in water produced after adding pac and pam to the reactor after the incident light generated by the laser emitter entered the reactor part of the light would be scattered and absorbed by the flocs while the other part of the light was received by the signal receiver through the system then the signal receiver converted the optical signal into the recorded voltage value according to the corresponding linear relationship between the optical intensity and the electrical signal the relevant data was input into a computer in real time using a data acquisition tool 2 3 experimental method 2 3 1 methodology two standard systems were measured in order to determine the feasibility of the voltage response with particle size and turbidity the particle size was 0 3 μm and 2 μm of polystyrene microspheres were selected to prepare a suspension as the tested system since the concentration of particles in the system affects light scattering pattern 1 16 38 therefore the differences of voltage between polystyrene microspheres with different size and deionized water were compared simultaneously the voltages of kaolin solutions with different turbidity ntu 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 were measured laser transmission detection technology helped detect changes in the flocculation effect of lake water with a ph range of 7 3 8 2 and turbidity of about 16 18 ntu under varying dosages during the experiment the dosage range of pac and pam was selected according to the optimal dosage of flocculation process to treat actual surface water 9 43 47 50 pac reagents were added with the concentration of 10 mg l 20 mg l 30 mg l 40 mg l respectively and rapidly mixed at 300 rotations per minute rpm for 1 min then pam reagent with the concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 0 mg l 2 0 mg l and 3 0 mg l was added respectively finally the content was mixing slowly at 80 rpm for 8 min and followed by a settling period lasting 10 min the dynamic changes of the system were measured through 20 groups of orthogonal experiments in the experiment each group of experiments was done in triplicate and the average value was taken 2 3 2 construction of cnn model fig 2 depicts the structure of the cnn model which consists of convolutional layer pooling layer fully connected layer and rectified linear unit layer 22 firstly the data vector was expanded and then 16 6 vector was obtained by one dimensional convolution of the input data with 16 convolutional kernel which was regarded as the input value of the convolutionii and convoluted as described above after that the max pooling convoluted the 32 6 order vector after the convolutionii pool into 32 2 order vector which was regarded as the input data for entering the convolution iii in the convolution iii the size of the convolutional kernel changed and set the output vector to 64 1 order vector then the value of finally output floc size was obtained through a fully connected layer in order to avoid the impact of sample size on accuracy we first classify data features based on the classification theory of cnn model 44 the specific calculational process was as follows firstly the matrix of data was inputted 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 raised its dimension to get the following matrix 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 expand it to 4 h 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 0 the convolution kernel was 5 u a 1 b 1 c 1 use the following formula to convoluted the h

15 a 16 b 16 e 15 f 15 e 15 f 15 the convolutionii was consistent with the calculated method above after expanding with 0 32 convolution operations were performed with the size of convolutional kernel was 3 to obtain 32 6 order matrix then the 32 6 order matrix was pooled by the method of max pooling and the calculated method as follows 10 a a 1 b 1 max the dimensions of the above matrix were reduced by pooling to obtain the matrix of 32 3 order as follows 11 a 1 a 2 c 1 c 2 a 31 a 32 c 31 c 32 then in the convolutioniii 64 times convolutions were performed using a convolution kernel with a size of 3 to obtain the output result of the convolution iii 12 a 1 a 2 a 63 a 64 then used the weight matrix of 64 32 called w to calculate depending on the following formula 13 z w t x b where x represented the output result of convolution iii b was offset matrix of 32 1 then the weight matrix of 32 1 performed the same operation on the output value of the last operation to obtain the final output value 3 results and discussion 3 1 measurement of standard system two polystyrene microsphere suspensions with particle sizes of 0 3 μm and 2 μm were used at a volume concentration 1 mg l and they had an average turbidity of 74 2 ntu and 99 3 ntu the values of voltage under different conditions were measured when the experiments were maintained under the same conditions the voltages of different systems are shown in fig 3 a the corresponding voltage values for the system of different particle sizes varied for polystyrene microsphere suspensions with the concentration of 1 ml l the voltage of 2um microspheres was 2 14 v and the voltage of 0 3 um microspheres was 2 42 v while the voltage of deionized water was 2 81 v at the same rotating speed it means that the voltage declined with the increase of particle size in the 1 ml l suspended liquid system which showed a good correlation since the scattering cross section was proportional to the geometric cross sectional area of the floc for the suspension system with the same properties and concentration the scattering cross section was larger for particles with larger particle size and the light scattering was more serious and the voltage corresponding to the light signal were lower 52 the kaolin suspension systems of the same size with different turbidity meanwhile were measured and results are shown in fig 3 b the suspension systems with ntu of 5 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 were configured respectively and measured at the same speed of the magnetic stirrer the system s voltage decreased with the increase of turbidity and the fitting value r2 was 0 99627 so a good correlation was evident here the results in fig 3 showed that the voltage generated by the optical signal decreased significantly with the rise of particle size or turbidity in flocculation which demonstrated the feasibility of imlt for monitoring the dynamics of flocs 3 2 flocculation system monitoring it can be observed from fig 4 in the stage involving the addition of pac reagent for flocculation the laser transmittance decreased and the detection voltage presented a downward trend with the flocculation with the pam adding the laser transmittance was enhanced and the detection voltage began to rise finally it reached a level of stability which was due to the dynamic balance between floc growth and breakage where the floc size distribution no longer varied with time as shown in the voltage and time diagram of fig 4 a d in the case of the dosage of pac and pam were different the change of voltage lead to diverse outcomes however the general tendency was that the value of voltage dropped to a certain extent after pac adding which is probably due to the appearance of flocs in the flocculation process hindering the laser transmission and reducing the optical signal intensity absorbed by the optical signal detector at the receiving end this phenomenon was similar to previous studies 8 41 pam was added after the pac reacted with the raw water for one minute the voltage of the system either remained stable and then began to increase or increased immediately which reflected the rising trend generally the flocs in the system became denser under rapid stirring and led to an increase in sedimentation performance and light transmission intensity for this reason the flocculation process was divided into floc formation stage and sedimentation stage according to the fall or rise in voltage the experimental data in fig 4 shows that for the same concentration and dosage of pac reagent the flocculent rate of particles in raw water promoted with the rise of pam concentration however it can be seen from fig 4 a and b at pac dosages of 10 mg l and 20 mg l no obvious indicative point of starting settlement was observed after adding pam reagent probably due to the formed flocs being small and relatively dense meanwhile the space between flocs was small in the process of stopping stirring and static settlement so it was affected by the dynamic migration of flocs to a small extent as shown in fig 4 c and d in the case of pac dose was 30 mg l or 40 mg l an evident indicating start of sedimentation appeared the dosage of pam reagent increased from 0 5 mg l to 5 mg l and the time point of starting sedimentation was advanced from 8 min to 7 min which suggested that the continuous movement of flocs by occasion of inertia after mixing was the reason for the change in precipitation time when pac reagent was constant the dosage that added pam reagent to enable the system to reach a stable state followed the order of 5 mg l 2 mg l 1 mg l and 0 5 mg l it demonstrated that the more coagulant was added the faster the flocs reached a stable state however the charge neutralization and bridging effects were weakened when too much coagulant was added thus the best effluent quality could not be guaranteed at maximum pam dose 4 14 23 24 35 as shown in the particle size and time diagram of fig 4 a d no matter whether the stage of floc formation or floc sedimentation was involved the floc size in the flocculation system remained stable after increasing to a certain value but then falling steadily correspondingly the voltage changed with the variation of particle size when the dosage of pac was 10 mg l and 20 mg l the size of flocs increased first and then fell however at the dosage of pac was 30 mg l and 40 mg l the sizes of flocs showed a trend of increasing then kept stable and finally decreasing the variation of voltage and floc size over time can be seen before the particle size rose to the maximum value the voltage stopped decreasing showing a stable or increasing trend this phenomenon indicated that the settling process of flocs occurred before the floc size reached its maximum which was more obvious when the pac concentration was high according to the stage of floc formation and sedimentation the relationship between floc size and voltage in different stages were obtained at low concentrations of pac between 10 mg l and 20 mg l in figs 5 6 the voltage of the system showed a slightly downward trend with the increase of the floc particle size during the formation stage as shown in figs 7 8 the voltage decreased slightly and then increased at high concentrations of pac the main reason for the low initial voltage of the system was that the flocculation was incomplete while the system was turbid and brought about serious light attenuation with the constant occurrence of the coagulation the flocs were gradually compacted and the settlement performance was enhanced in the floc settlement stage meanwhile the majority of the suspended particles in the flocculation system were adsorbed on the flocs the water became clear and the light transmittance improved consequently the voltage value of the system increased in tandem with the particle settlement at high concentrations of pac with 30 mg l and 40 mg l in figs 7 8 due to the rapid increase of particle size the agglomeration compaction and settlement of flocs occurred in the formation stage of flocs thus the voltage increased to a certain extent during the floc formation stage since the discontinuity between the ending voltage of floc formation stage and the initial voltage of floc settlement stage the intermittent points were called breakpoints compared with the working condition of flocculant dosage from low to high there were breakpoints in the voltage from floc formation to the floc settlement stage as shown in figs 5 and 6 with the pac dosage of 10 mg l and 20 mg l the disparity between the ending voltage of floc formation stage and the starting voltage of floc settlement stage was slight and there were no obvious breakpoints however figs 7 and 8 show that an obvious breakpoints formed between them when the dosage of pac increased to 30 mg l and 40 mg l this phenomenon revealed that flocs settlement was not closely related to the reduction of floc size with the elevation in flocculant dosage the volume concentration increased which made sedimentation more likely to occur before the floc size increased to its maximum the sedimentation begun this further proved the validity of the results of the reaction in fig 4 a similar conclusion was drawn by comparing the stage of floc formation under four different working scenarios in figs 5 8 and the voltage diminished with the rise of particle size in the smaller flocculant dosage there was however no strict positive correlation between them and the settlement occurred when the particle size rose to a certain extent this phenomenon was more obvious in the high dosage of flocculant showing that floc settlement commenced before the floc size increased to the maximum as shown in fig 5 b when the floc increased to 210 μm the system voltage stopped falling and gradually increased with a dosage of pac and pam was 10 mg l and 1 mg l respectively indicated here is that flocs began to settle at this time 3 3 comparison of fitting degree before and after cnn training fig 9 reflects the fitting degree of floc size and voltage at different concentrations in order to judge the relationships between them fig 9 a shows that the linear fitting degree was 0 87 in case of relatively low flocculant usage such as 10 mg l and 20 mg l this phenomenon illustrated that the voltage decreased with the rise of floc size in the floc formation stage which was considered to reveal a good linear correlation it can be observed from fig 9 c that the voltage rose linearly with the decrease of particle size in the floc settling stage but the correlation was relatively low at high concentrations however the linear correlation between voltage and particle size was relatively weak both in the stage of floc formation and sedimentation as shown in fig 9 b and d the fitting degrees in the formation and settlement stages were 0 77 and 0 73 respectively at the higher flocculant doses of 30 mg l and 40 mg l due to the phenomenon of floc settlement altering before the increase of particle size during floc occurrence because the correlation between coagulant dosage detected voltage and particle size were not clearly determined which led to certain errors the cnn method was used to train these three parameters the dosage of coagulant and detected voltage were taken as the input values and the particle size under the corresponding working conditions was regarded as the output value in addition the measured data validated the accuracy of the training model the monitoring of low and high concentration dosages was compared with the results generated by the cnn model in fig 10 indicating the degree of fit between the output results fig 10 a and b showed the correlation between the particle size measured by mastersizer 2000 and the particle size measured by imlt without cnn training fig 10 c and d indicated the correlation between the particle size measured by mastersizer 2000 and the particle size measured by imlt with cnn training in fig 10 c and d the slopes at low and high concentrations were 1 0932 and 1 0586 respectively it can be seen that the slopes of the fitted curve are close to 1 which indicates that the model is reliable besides the measured value at low flocculant dosage was 0 831 which was higher while the fitting degree was 0 742 which fell slightly at a high flocculant dosage it significantly improved compared with 0 407 and 0 437 when there was no cnn training in fig 10 a and b it emerged found that the value of particle size created by the cnn model under different flocculant concentrations had a high correlation with the actual measurement hence it was determined that the training model can be applicable to floc size analysis however in fig 10 c d the degree of fit between the particle sizes obtained by the cnn training and the measured particle size at low concentration was slightly higher than that without training this was mainly because the distributions of floc size and shape were more diversified at a high concentration of pac 51 as well when adding a high dose of flocculant the settling time of flocs was shorter and the change in the speed of flocs was relatively fast 7 25 39 this change and diversity prevented cnn from extracting some characteristics used to determine the flocculation sedimentation 48 when cnn was used for training at high concentration the robustness of the model was poor resulting in a weaker fit than at low concentration therefore the accuracy of particle size obtained by training was inferior 4 conclusions the results of the experiments showed that the imlt system based on the extinction principle can serve to evaluate the dynamic process of coagulation in real time and in situ the detection of the imlt system was affected by many factors such as particle size particle volume concentration etc combined with the measured turbidity the floc size was inversely proportional to the detection voltage in addition the larger the final voltage value r the better the floc settlement the variation in floc size in the flocculation system can be obtained through the imlt system but it was not synchronized with the change in flocculation the fact that sedimentation took place before the flocs size reached the maximum which meant that the imlt system has a faster response for the evaluation of the flocculation effect of the system the correlation between the particle size after cnn training and the measured particle size were significantly higher than that without training under both low and high concentrations of pac however due to the strong variability and diversity of particle size at high concentrations its degree of fit was slightly lower than that at low

12627,a low cost in situ micro laser transmission imlt analysis system for particle size monitoring based on the principle of laser transmission extinction was developed to monitor the flocculation process in this study the imlt system was used to obtain the voltage generated with the changes of flocculant dosage and floc sizes in different flocculation stages a typical machine learning model convolution neural network cnn method was built to manage the flocculant dosage detection voltage and floc size to improve the accuracy of the correlation between the them results of imlt revealed that the particle size of flocs was inversely proportional to the voltage and a larger final voltage r value indicated better effects of flocculation and sedimentation the correlation between the particle size obtained by cnn training and measured particle size was 42 4 and 30 5 higher than that without training at low and high concentrations respectively imlt is effective in reflecting the floc sedimentation stability and dynamic influence of the coagulant aid on flocculation system graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords flocculation on line monitoring deep learning laser projection floc detection data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction flocculation is an important aspect of water treatment its efficiency will affect the subsequent operation and final treatment effects however it is often difficult to determine the proper dosage of flocculants and coagulants to ensure flocculating effect due to the lack of on line measurement methods 32 current researchers were mainly conducted on floc morphology fractal dimension sedimentation rate water turbidity removal and uv254 removal to evaluate flocculation among them floc size as a critical physical index is more influential in evaluating flocculation 31 37 53 56 generally large flocs have higher settling rate lead to better effects 20 45 therefore the dynamic and continuous evaluation of floc size is crucial in flocculation present monitoring techniques such as image analysis ultrasonic techniques and light scattering can be adapted to the evaluation of floc size 10 12 18 27 the image technique provides a good data regarding flocculent shape but cannot get rid of the limitation of the two dimensional scale so it is not suitable for measuring irregular particles 6 13 25 30 54 the ultrasonic technology can free from this limitation to some extent but its application is often hindered by unknown physical parameters of particles 2 15 19 34 furthermore the immaturity of the method in inverting the floc size also needs to be solved light scattering techniques are relatively commonly used in measuring particle sizes 17 40 49 55 the laser transmission extinction method is one of them which measures the attenuation of the transmitted light intensity caused by the scattering and absorption of particles as the light beam passes through a medium containing particles 29 then it determines the particle system according to the relationship between the extent of attenuation and size and quantity of particles currently the on line monitoring technology based on laser extinction has been applied to the formation of vapor bubbles the thickness of liquid film the measurement of soot and so on 28 36 42 it has the advantages of simple structure non contact measurement moreover the sensitivity and accuracy are relatively high 46 therefore this method has found an increasingly utilization in several fields in addition there were interactions among various factors in the flocculation so it is necessary to consider the influences between them and improve the accuracy of the results through model training convolution neural network cnn is a deep learning model that is universally used in computer vision applications 21 it is able to extract meaningful features from locally associated data sources the output of convoluted kernel is then fed to the activation function which aids in learning and embedding the nonlinearity into the features this nonlinear generates different activation functions for each reaction making it easier to learn meaningful dissimilarities in images furthermore a nonlinear activation function produces an output that is frequently trailed by sub samples this helps with summarizing the outputs which makes the input insensitive to geometrical deceptions 3 at present many researchers have used cnn model to refine as much as possible the operating parameters in the flocculation a model for prediction is constructed by inputting recorded images or data as training data 26 33 48 in this study an in situ micro laser transmission imlt analysis system for on line detection and comprehensive analysis of floc formation and sedimentation effect was designed based on the laser transmission extinction principle specifically correlation between light transmission intensity of the system and the actual state of the flocculation process was determined and then the dynamic process of the flocculation with different concentrations of flocculants and coagulants were continuously monitored by laser system furthermore we applied the cnn model in deep learning to train the unknown relationship between voltage and flocculent size obtained from experimental measurement so as to construct a training model 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials raw water was employed in the experiment as the source from an artificial lake analysis grade polyaluminum chloride chloride pac shanghai aladdin company china and anionic polyacrylamide pam shanghai aladdin company china were selected as flocculant and coagulant aid respectively the floc size distribution was determined using the light detection device which consisted of apd light conversion module as light source receiver 650 nm red laser transmitter as light source and a square flocculent tank made of plexiglass as the reaction tank the superfine kaolin 5um functioned as the labeled substance being measured the instruments used were a magnetic stirrer rct basic ika germany turbidity meter 2100p hach usa and marvin laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 marvin uk 2 2 experimental principle this experiment mainly adopted the extinction method to measure particle size when the incident light intensity remains constant light will be continuously scattered and absorbed in the system with the change of the particle size and concentration of flocs in the coagulation system this leads to the attenuation of emitted light intensity this method complies with the lambert beer law eq 1 combining the principle of extinction method and the equivalent approximation law the floc size can be revealed by measuring the extinction ratio 5 11 1 i i 0 e ux where i0 is the incident light intensity i represents the transmitted light intensity u denotes the light absorption coefficient of the medium and x stands for the length of optical path the transmitted light intensity is mainly affected by the light absorption coefficient among them at a certain value of optical path length fig 1 shows the principle of laser projection in situ detection and the circuit board of photoelectric conversion in this detector device the raw water was placed in the shading reactor the laser transmitter was placed on the outer wall of the shading reaction tank and the signal receiver was placed on the outer wall on the opposite side which ensured the alignment of the two optical paths a magnetic rotor was set at the bottom of the reaction tank in the experiment and the magnetic stirrer served as the power device of flocculation so any influence on light path propagation was avoided flocculation occurred and flocs in water produced after adding pac and pam to the reactor after the incident light generated by the laser emitter entered the reactor part of the light would be scattered and absorbed by the flocs while the other part of the light was received by the signal receiver through the system then the signal receiver converted the optical signal into the recorded voltage value according to the corresponding linear relationship between the optical intensity and the electrical signal the relevant data was input into a computer in real time using a data acquisition tool 2 3 experimental method 2 3 1 methodology two standard systems were measured in order to determine the feasibility of the voltage response with particle size and turbidity the particle size was 0 3 μm and 2 μm of polystyrene microspheres were selected to prepare a suspension as the tested system since the concentration of particles in the system affects light scattering pattern 1 16 38 therefore the differences of voltage between polystyrene microspheres with different size and deionized water were compared simultaneously the voltages of kaolin solutions with different turbidity ntu 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 were measured laser transmission detection technology helped detect changes in the flocculation effect of lake water with a ph range of 7 3 8 2 and turbidity of about 16 18 ntu under varying dosages during the experiment the dosage range of pac and pam was selected according to the optimal dosage of flocculation process to treat actual surface water 9 43 47 50 pac reagents were added with the concentration of 10 mg l 20 mg l 30 mg l 40 mg l respectively and rapidly mixed at 300 rotations per minute rpm for 1 min then pam reagent with the concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 0 mg l 2 0 mg l and 3 0 mg l was added respectively finally the content was mixing slowly at 80 rpm for 8 min and followed by a settling period lasting 10 min the dynamic changes of the system were measured through 20 groups of orthogonal experiments in the experiment each group of experiments was done in triplicate and the average value was taken 2 3 2 construction of cnn model fig 2 depicts the structure of the cnn model which consists of convolutional layer pooling layer fully connected layer and rectified linear unit layer 22 firstly the data vector was expanded and then 16 6 vector was obtained by one dimensional convolution of the input data with 16 convolutional kernel which was regarded as the input value of the convolutionii and convoluted as described above after that the max pooling convoluted the 32 6 order vector after the convolutionii pool into 32 2 order vector which was regarded as the input data for entering the convolution iii in the convolution iii the size of the convolutional kernel changed and set the output vector to 64 1 order vector then the value of finally output floc size was obtained through a fully connected layer in order to avoid the impact of sample size on accuracy we first classify data features based on the classification theory of cnn model 44 the specific calculational process was as follows firstly the matrix of data was inputted 2 a 1 a 2 a 3 raised its dimension to get the following matrix 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 expand it to 4 h 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 1 a 2 a 3 0 the convolution kernel was 5 u a 1 b 1 c 1 use the following formula to convoluted the h matrix 6 y k h k u k i 0 n h k i u i calculated according to the sliding stride of 1 the elements of the first row and the first column of the convolution matrix are 7 0 a 1 a 2 a 1 b 1 c 1 a 1 b 1 a 2 c 1 the first row of convolution kernel obtained by sliding to the right is 8 a 1 b 1 c 1 d 1 e 1 f 1 where a1 a1b1 a2c1 b1 a1a1 a2b1 a3c1 c1 a2a1 a3b1 a1c1 d1 a3a1 a1b1 a2c1 e1 a1a1 a2b1 a3c1 f1 a2a1 a3b1 using sixteen convolutional kernels to convolve the input vector respectively the dimension of the input vector could be raised to 16 6 order matrix 9 a 1 b 1 a 2 b 2 e 1 f 1 e 2 f 2 a 15 b 15 a 16 b 16 e 15 f 15 e 15 f 15 the convolutionii was consistent with the calculated method above after expanding with 0 32 convolution operations were performed with the size of convolutional kernel was 3 to obtain 32 6 order matrix then the 32 6 order matrix was pooled by the method of max pooling and the calculated method as follows 10 a a 1 b 1 max the dimensions of the above matrix were reduced by pooling to obtain the matrix of 32 3 order as follows 11 a 1 a 2 c 1 c 2 a 31 a 32 c 31 c 32 then in the convolutioniii 64 times convolutions were performed using a convolution kernel with a size of 3 to obtain the output result of the convolution iii 12 a 1 a 2 a 63 a 64 then used the weight matrix of 64 32 called w to calculate depending on the following formula 13 z w t x b where x represented the output result of convolution iii b was offset matrix of 32 1 then the weight matrix of 32 1 performed the same operation on the output value of the last operation to obtain the final output value 3 results and discussion 3 1 measurement of standard system two polystyrene microsphere suspensions with particle sizes of 0 3 μm and 2 μm were used at a volume concentration 1 mg l and they had an average turbidity of 74 2 ntu and 99 3 ntu the values of voltage under different conditions were measured when the experiments were maintained under the same conditions the voltages of different systems are shown in fig 3 a the corresponding voltage values for the system of different particle sizes varied for polystyrene microsphere suspensions with the concentration of 1 ml l the voltage of 2um microspheres was 2 14 v and the voltage of 0 3 um microspheres was 2 42 v while the voltage of deionized water was 2 81 v at the same rotating speed it means that the voltage declined with the increase of particle size in the 1 ml l suspended liquid system which showed a good correlation since the scattering cross section was proportional to the geometric cross sectional area of the floc for the suspension system with the same properties and concentration the scattering cross section was larger for particles with larger particle size and the light scattering was more serious and the voltage corresponding to the light signal were lower 52 the kaolin suspension systems of the same size with different turbidity meanwhile were measured and results are shown in fig 3 b the suspension systems with ntu of 5 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 were configured respectively and measured at the same speed of the magnetic stirrer the system s voltage decreased with the increase of turbidity and the fitting value r2 was 0 99627 so a good correlation was evident here the results in fig 3 showed that the voltage generated by the optical signal decreased significantly with the rise of particle size or turbidity in flocculation which demonstrated the feasibility of imlt for monitoring the dynamics of flocs 3 2 flocculation system monitoring it can be observed from fig 4 in the stage involving the addition of pac reagent for flocculation the laser transmittance decreased and the detection voltage presented a downward trend with the flocculation with the pam adding the laser

effects were weakened when too much coagulant was added thus the best effluent quality could not be guaranteed at maximum pam dose 4 14 23 24 35 as shown in the particle size and time diagram of fig 4 a d no matter whether the stage of floc formation or floc sedimentation was involved the floc size in the flocculation system remained stable after increasing to a certain value but then falling

this time 3 3 comparison of fitting degree before and after cnn training fig 9 reflects the fitting degree of floc size and voltage at different concentrations in order to judge the relationships

the rise of floc size in the floc formation stage which was considered to reveal a good linear correlation it can be observed from fig 9 c that the voltage rose linearly with the decrease of particle size in the floc settling stage but the correlation was relatively low at high concentrations however the linear correlation between voltage and particle size was relatively weak both in the stage of floc formation and sedimentation as shown in fig 9 b and d the fitting degrees in the formation and settlement stages were 0 77 and 0 73 respectively at the higher flocculant doses of 30 mg l and 40 mg l due to the phenomenon of floc settlement altering before the increase of particle size during floc occurrence because the correlation between coagulant dosage detected voltage and particle size were not clearly determined which led to certain errors the cnn method was used to train these three parameters the dosage of coagulant and detected voltage were taken as the input values and the particle size under the corresponding working conditions was regarded as the output value in addition the measured data validated the accuracy of the training model the monitoring of low and high concentration dosages was compared with the results generated by the cnn model in fig 10 indicating the degree of fit between the output results fig 10 a and b showed the correlation between the particle size measured by mastersizer 2000 and the particle size measured by imlt without cnn training fig 10 c and d indicated the correlation between the particle size measured by mastersizer 2000 and the particle size measured by imlt with cnn training in fig 10 c and d the slopes at low and high concentrations were 1 0932 and 1 0586 respectively it can be seen that the slopes of the fitted curve are close to 1 which indicates that the model is reliable besides the measured value at low flocculant dosage was 0 831 which was higher while the fitting degree was 0 742 which fell slightly at a high flocculant dosage it significantly improved compared with 0 407 and 0 437 when there was no cnn training in fig 10 a and b it emerged found that the value of particle size created by the cnn model under different flocculant concentrations had a high correlation with the actual measurement hence it was determined that the training model can be applicable to floc size analysis however in fig 10 c d the degree of fit between the particle sizes obtained by the cnn training and the measured particle size at low concentration was slightly higher than that without training this was mainly because the distributions of floc size and shape were more diversified at a high concentration of pac 51 as well when adding a high dose of flocculant the settling time of flocs was shorter and the change in the speed of flocs was relatively fast 7 25 39 this change and diversity prevented cnn from extracting some characteristics used to determine the flocculation sedimentation 48 when cnn was used for training at high concentration the robustness of the model was poor resulting in a weaker fit than at low concentration therefore the accuracy of particle size obtained by training was inferior 4 conclusions the results of the experiments showed that the imlt system based on the extinction principle can serve to evaluate the dynamic process of coagulation in real time and in situ the detection of the imlt system was affected by many factors such as particle size particle volume concentration etc combined with the measured turbidity the floc size was inversely proportional to the detection voltage in addition the larger the final voltage value r the better the floc settlement the variation in floc size in the flocculation system can be obtained through the imlt system but it was not synchronized with the change in flocculation the fact that sedimentation took place before the flocs size reached the maximum which meant that the imlt system has a faster response for the evaluation of the flocculation effect of the system the correlation between the particle size after cnn training and the measured particle size were significantly higher than that without training under both low and high concentrations of pac however due to the strong variability and diversity of particle size at high concentrations its degree of fit was slightly lower than that at low

12628,the occurrence and behavior of pharmaceuticals especially in sewage sludge have attracted great attention nowadays due to the intensive application of sewage sludge in agriculture in terms of the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals although anaerobic digestion is a well developed and widely applied treatment process in terms of stabilization of sewage sludges and removal of organics the treatment performances of this technology for different pharmaceutical subgroups are still not well known in this study the occurrence and seasonal variations of 45 pharmaceutical compounds consisting of 27 parent compounds and 18 main metabolites from 10 different therapeutic groups were investigated both in thickened and digested sludge generated in a large scale urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp in this way the seasonal removal performances of full scale anaerobic digesters for parent compounds and metabolites have been determined and compared simultaneously while the total pharmaceutical concentrations in the thickened sludge varied between 21 1 and 177 6 μg kg seasonally it was determined in the range of 21 5 and 88 8 μg kg in the digested sludge in the thickened sludge the predominant group was found as antibiotics 35 9 while in the digested sludge it was determined as anticonvulsants 31 3 besides seasonal relationships of parent compounds and metabolites both in thickened and digested sludges were evaluated statistically in terms of both occurrence and removal in general although the capacities for sorption onto sewage sludges were found as different removal patterns of both parent compounds and metabolites in anaerobic digesters have been determined as quite similar the removal performance of the anaerobic digesters showed great differences based on the investigated pharmaceutical subgroups although varies seasonally while antibiotic up to 82 9 nsaid up to 70 9 and nerve stimulant up to 89 6 groups tended to be treated in anaerobic digesters negative removal efficiencies were determined for anticonvulsant up to 242 9 steroid hormone up to 155 3 and antidepressant up to 5010 groups while the total pharmaceutical treatment performances of anaerobic sludge digesters varied between 78 in summer and 65 in winter seasonally it has been determined as 28 5 annually therefore it has been determined in this study that the pharmaceutical treatment performance of full scale anaerobic digesters is not effective enough graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion pharmaceutically active compounds micropollutants seasonal distribution sewage sludge soil amendment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction together with dramatic increases in the world population especially in the last century the amount of chemicals produced due to the developments of science technology and national economies is mounting dramatically every year as a result of increasing chemical production excessively there has emerged a critically important chemicalization problem in the world 1 pharmaceuticals consisting of tens of thousands of chemical compounds are one of the biggest and most complex groups of micropollutants 2 consisting of different subgroups pharmaceuticals are primarily used intensively in the field of medicine to prevent and treat human diseases besides pharmaceuticals are also used in the field of veterinary medicine as well as animal husbandry aquaculture biotechnology and many other commercial sectors for various purposes 3 as a result of extensive consumption of these biologically active compounds pharmaceuticals have become ubiquitous in various environmental matrices all over the world 2 4 5 passing of these pharmaceutically active compounds phacs to receiving environments in an uncontrolled manner with their known and unknown adverse effects on ecosystems animals and people has become a crucial global environmental and health problem it is known that after pharmaceuticals are taken by humans or animals metabolites of parent compounds are also formed apart from the residue of parent compounds due to the incomplete metabolization of most phacs 6 7 therefore parent compounds and various metabolites reach wastewater treatment plants wwtps throughout the sewerage system together as a mixture via urine and feces besides some studies have also revealed that exposure to certain pharmaceutical metabolites is much more dangerous than parent compounds to ecosystems and almost all living creatures 8 9 although some other factors affect the passing of pharmaceuticals to the receiving environments the major source for the transition of these pollutants to the natural environment is considered domestic and municipal wwtps 2 10 the main reason for this situation is that many existing wwtps are not designed to treat micropollutants 11 therefore depending on the specific physicochemical properties molecular weight chemical structure acidity biodegradability sorption potential etc of phacs as well as the treatment types activated sludge processes waste stabilization ponds constructed wetlands etc and operational conditions hydraulic retention time hrt sludge retention time srt temperature ph redox potential etc of the investigated wwtps significant removal differences have been reported ranging from serious negative removal efficiencies to complete elimination of phacs in literature 3 10 12 the main removal mechanisms of phacs in wwtps are biodegradation biotransformation and sorption onto sewage sludge 13 14 although many performed studies have shown that the percentage of sorption onto sewage sludge was found below 5 in general in terms of contribution to the total removal of various phacs in wwtps 2 14 15 significant amounts of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites pass into the sewage sludges produced in wwtps until recently to dispose of sewage sludge formed in wwtps in general it was preferred to send sewage sludge to solid waste landfills or to incinerate them in incineration plants nowadays the application of sewage sludges as soil amendment has become widespread in many countries for real scale agricultural production since the sewage sludge contains beneficial organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and can significantly improve soil quality 5 16 about half of the sewage sludges produced at wwtps in the usa china and europe are used in the form of dry matter as soil amendment or fertilizer on farmland 17 18 in türkiye approximately 5 of the total sewage sludge produced in wwtps is used in agricultural applications 19 the widespread use of sewage sludge as soil amendment in the world not only reduces the disposal costs of sewage sludge of wwtps but also provides significant benefits to agricultural production within the scope of sustainable agriculture however mainly depending on whether the characteristic of wastewater treated in wwtps is domestic or urban the sewage sludges also contain different pollutants belonging to various micropollutant groups with threatening toxic properties like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 20 pesticides 21 phthalate esters 22 heavy metals 23 pharmaceutical residues 2 etc the most critical sludge treatment unit that stabilizes the sewage sludge in wwtps is the anaerobic digester in which biological treatment occurs 24 in addition the anaerobic digester unit plays an important role in determining the final concentration levels of phacs in sewage sludge that would be used as soil amendment in agricultural lands 14 25 although there are many studies investigating the pharmaceutical treatment performances of anaerobic digesters operated under different working conditions on a lab scale 15 26 28 the number of studies conducted in this context on real scale anaerobic digesters present in wwtps 29 30 is quite limited in many lab scale studies it has been reported that the operating parameters of anaerobic digesters such as srt hrt and temperature 27 28 31 can directly or indirectly affect the removal efficiency of the investigated phacs in various ways including affecting the presence of the microbial communities 32 33 in anaerobic reactors however the concentrations of many phacs studied belonging to different therapeutic subgroups in most lab scale studies are well above the concentrations of the same pharmaceutical compounds found in natural environments therefore there is a great knowledge gap about the treatment performances of full scale anaerobic digesters present in wwtps in terms of evaluating the pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites together with a holistic view in türkiye the use of sewage sludge has been regulated by regulation on the use of domestic and urban sewage sludge in soil published by the year of 2010 by the ministry of environment and urbanization 34 this regulation covers all technical and administrative principles regarding the controlled use of sewage sludge which is produced as a result of the treatment of domestic and urban wastewater in the soil in a way that does not harm the soil plants animals and humans according to this regulation for the stabilized sludge to be applied to agricultural areas as soil amendment there are limit concentration values for some compounds including heavy metals pahs polychlorinated biphenyl and dibenzodioxins alkylbenzene sulfonates bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate halogenated compounds nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates however similar to the directive in force in europe on the application of sewage sludge to agricultural land 35 this regulation does not contain a provision for monitoring or restricting any pharmaceutical compounds in the application of sewage sludge as soil amendment therefore possible environmental and human health risks that may arise from the application of sewage sludges in agricultural lands related to phacs are ignored the first objective of this study was to determine the seasonal occurrence concentrations of 45 phacs including 27 parent compounds and 18 main metabolites from 10 different subgroups both in thickened and anaerobically digested sewage sludge generated in the large scale urban wwtp in this context eleven antibiotics ten nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids six anticonvulsants four nerve stimulants six steroid hormones three anticancer drugs two lipid regulators one antidepressant one receptor antagonist and one antiseptic were investigated the second objective was to determine and compare the seasonal removal performances of full scale anaerobic sludge digesters one of the original aspects of this study is that it provides a general opinion on the removal efficiency of real scale anaerobic sludge digesters on the group of pharmaceuticals not over a few compounds or subgroups but over a very wide scale one of the other original aspects of this study is to demonstrate that the investigated compounds can be treated with different removal efficiencies in real scale anaerobic digesters in different seasons depending on various parameters in this scope the effects of different seasons on the treatment performance of the anaerobic sludge digester were evaluated by comparing them with other phacs in the same subgroup within the scope of the removal efficiencies obtained for each compound the third objective was to evaluate the fate and behavior of parent compounds and their metabolites in sewage sludges during the anaerobic digestion within the scope of possible removal mechanisms biodegradation and biotransformation in addition it was also aimed to determine possible correlations between parent compounds and their metabolites during anaerobic digestion within the scope of statistical analysis apart from being the first real scale study performed in türkiye it is one of the original studies in terms of evaluating the removals of many phacs consisting of parent compounds and metabolites simultaneously in the full scale anaerobic digester including the seasonal effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents in this study 45

study was performed in urban advanced biological wwtp located in the city of konya türkiye found in the middle anatolian of türkiye the metropolitan city of konya is the largest city of türkiye in terms of a total surface area of approximately 41 000 km2 covering 5 2 of the country s surface area the population of about 2 25 million people of konya city corresponds to approximately 2 7 of türkiye s total population the studied large scale wwtp is called konya wwtp and serves about 1 3 million people operated as 4 stage bardenpho process with partial nitrogen removal konya wwtp treats nearly 200 000 m3 day of wastewater including domestic industrial and hospital there are five different and large scale organized industrial zones in konya consisting of many different sectors especially automotive metal and machinery manufacturing industries a total of approximately 15 000 m3 day of industrial wastewater is generated in these organized industrial zones industrial wastewater comes to konya wwtp via a combined sewerage system after the pre treatment stage in organized industrial zones and constitutes approximately 7 5 of the flow rate of daily wastewater treated at the plant hospital wastewater produced in konya city is given directly to the combined sewerage system without any pre treatment the total flow of hospital wastewater coming to the konya wwtp is approximately 6000 m3 day and constitutes approximately 3 of the total daily wastewater flow rate treated in the plant after mixing the sewage sludge produced both in the primary and secondary clarifiers in konya wwtp they are thickened and blended in the sludge thickener units percentages of solid matter of primary and secondary sewage sludge are in the range of 2 0 2 5 and 1 0 1 5 respectively based on the operational conditions of the plant after being processed in sludge thickener units sewage sludge is fed to anaerobic sludge digesters finally after being treated in the anaerobic sludge digesters sewage sludges are dewatered in the sludge dewatering units decanter via centrifuge in general the dry matter percentage of dewatered sludge is in the range of 25 27 then to be used as soil amendment to agricultural lands by the farmers with the intent of real scale agricultural production treated sludge formed is kept in the wwtp under suitable conditions and for sufficient periods 8 9 months to become fully stabilized the sewage sludge which becomes completely stabilized at the end is used as soil amendment in agricultural areas by the farmers prevalently after performing the necessary analysis within the scope of the regulation on the use of domestic and urban sewage sludge in soil the location of the city of konya in türkiye and both the location and top view of the investigated konya wwtp are shown together in fig 1 konya wwtp is the only treatment plant in türkiye that is authorized to use stabilized sewage sludge to farmers with legal permission the most important share in stabilizing the sewage sludge belongs to the anaerobic sludge digesters in the plant there are 4 anaerobic sludge digesters operated in parallel and simultaneously at konya wwtp the volume of each anaerobic sludge digester is 7000 m3 anaerobic sludge digesters are being operated in mesophilic conditions 37 0 5 c with an average of nearly 20 days of srt seasonal operational conditions including many parameters and removal performance of the studied anaerobic digester are given together in table s2 in detail 2 3 sampling sampling campaigns were performed in the year 2020 seasonally during the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic samplings were conducted in january winter season may spring season august summer season and october autumn season sewage sludge samples were collected from the inlet thickened sludge and outlet digested sludge of the anaerobic digester unit as a composite sample 2 h pre cleaned and baked brown wide mouth glass containers 1 5 l were used for collecting the sludge samples srt value 20 days of the anaerobic digesters was taken into account to determine the removal performances of anaerobic digesters accurately while sampling in this study which was carried out during four seasons to represent the annual average a total of four different sewage sludge samples two of which were thickened sludge at the beginning and end of the sampling month and two of which were anaerobically digested sludge were taken each season collected all sludge samples were kept in the ice bath until they were brought to the laboratory from the konya wwtp to preserve the characterization of samples after being brought to the laboratory sludge samples were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until the analysis was performed 2 4 sample preparation and extraction two extraction processes have been applied successively to make all collected sewage sludge samples ready for chromatographic analysis ultrasonic assisted extraction method epa 3550c ultrasonic extraction was performed in the first stage the supernatant was taken and concentrated using a gentle nitrogen stream and rotary evaporator in the second stage obtained final extracts were cleaned by solid phase extraction spe method after being diluted with deionized water after completing the conditioning of cartridges diluted extracts were passed through the spe cartridges then the used spe cartridges were rinsed with deionized water immediately after the drying procedure was conducted for rinsed cartridges for about 7 5 min under the vacuum system as a result of all these procedures phacs were eluted from the cartridges with methanol after eluted extracts were concentrated by using the gentle nitrogen stream the rotary evaporator was utilized to dissolve the concentrated extracts in a mixed solution consisting of deionized water and methanol 90 10 or 80 20 v v then selected internal standards were added and the final volume of extracts was adjusted to 4 ml finally extracts were taken to vials and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms all seasonal sludge samples were analyzed in duplicate after the extraction method was applied for each one the concentrations determined for the investigated phacs in the sewage sludge samples which were taken and analyzed in duplicate seasonally were found to be close to each other and therefore average values of two samples were used to represent each season 2 5 calibration curve and quality assurance in order to perform the quantitative analyses multi point calibration curves up to eight points were used in the range of 100 2000 ng g at least six different concentrations were used for drawing the calibration curves providing r2 values 0 99 besides that to improve the assurance of the analyses together with preventing both random and systematic errors internal standards were used in all the analyses in this study applied lod and loq values were 30 ng g and 100 ng g for all phacs respectively both recovery and repeatability studies have also been carried out simultaneously for the quality assurance and quality control qa qc of the applied method based on the eu regulations 36 in addition to these the mixed solution of phacs having a concentration of 500 ng g was also analyzed for quality control in every seasonal analysis period besides efficiencies of the applied extraction methods and clean up procedures were evaluated by using both spike free and phacs spiked sewage sludges in the scope of this purpose used sewage sludge samples were spiked by phacs having concentrations ranging between 100 and 2000 ng g finally the extractions of these spiked sewage sludge samples were performed using the same extraction methods information of the analytical conditions in the lc ms ms system together with the results obtained in recovery studies conducted both for thickened and digested sludges for all phacs are given in tables s3 and s4 respectively 2 6 instrumental analysis quantitative analyses of 45 phacs were performed by triple quadrupole lc ms ms system agilent 6460 hplc series 1200 using dynamic multiple reaction monitoring dmrm mode according to the slightly modified method of epa 1694 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water soil sediment and biosolids by hplc ms ms 37 the quantification of each investigating phacs was performed by at least two ion transitions that were selected as a quantification precursor and confirmation product ions 38 the ms was operated with two main groups which were electrospray ionization modes of both positive esi and negative esi two different column types were used for chromatographic separation while poroshell column 120 sb c 18 4 6 mm i d 150 mm 2 7 μm particle size was utilized at acidic analyses at alkali analyses zorbax extend c 18 column 3 0 mm i d 100 mm 3 7 μm particle size was used the sample injection volume was 30 μl while acidic mobile phase a b 90 10 was prepared by using eluent a deionized water containing 5 mm ammonium formate and 0 1 formic acid and eluent b methanol for the mode of esi alkali mobile phase a b 80 20 was prepared by using eluent a deionized water containing 0 1 ammonia and eluent b methanol for the mode of esi nitrogen was used as the carrier gas flow rates and the temperatures of the used two types of columns were 0 6 ml min and 35 c respectively the flow rate and the temperature of the gas were 10 ml min and 325 c respectively 2 7 calculation of removal efficiencies some recalcitrant pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites can degrade much more slowly in the anaerobic digester than in the organic matter they are contained in or are bound to 30 in addition to this many phacs present in sewage sludge either metabolized or in conjugated forms can be transformed back to parent compounds during anaerobic digestion 10 as a result of these two main factors quite higher effluent concentrations can be determined for some phacs after anaerobic digestion especially when mass basis e g μg phacs kg of dry total solids ts approaches are used these achieved relatively higher concentrations arise from the lower mass of volatile solids vs ts exiting in an anaerobic digester after biodegradation one of the important removal mechanisms of phacs 39 in this study concentrations of the investigated phacs were determined as μg kg dm ts both in thickened and digested sewage sludges therefore influent concentrations of phacs cinf entering the anaerobic digester detected thickened sludge concentrations of phacs have been adjusted by the fractional volatile solids reduction vsr between the anaerobic digester s feed and effluent as performed in some other studies 39 40 eq 1 then the removal efficiencies of phacs in the anaerobic digester were calculated according to the both adjusted influent cinf adj and effluent concentrations ceff of phacs eq 2 39 since the photodegradation of phacs in the anaerobic digester is not possible it can be supposed that the removals of phacs achieved in the anaerobic digester were totally due to removal mechanisms of biodegradation and biotransformation 1 c inf adj 1 1 vsr c inf 2 removal efficiency c inf adj c eff c inf adj 100 2 8 data analysis microsoft excel program was used to compile the seasonal data including minimum average and maximum values together with standard deviation and detection frequencies of the detected phacs both in thickened and digested sludges table s5 in addition analysis of variance anova was performed for determining the significance level of differences between variables at a 95 confidence interval by using graph pad prism 8 software in this context the seasonal concentrations of the investigated parent compounds individually and together with the parent compounds and metabolites in two different types of sewage sludge were evaluated for significance levels in addition it was also evaluated whether the seasonal removal efficiencies obtained for the parent compounds and their metabolites in anaerobic digesters were significant or not table s6 the values of 0 05 0 05 and 0 01 obtained for p as a result of the anova analyses mean not significant significant and highly significant respectively 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and removal of antibiotics in anaerobic digester in the study 11 phacs consisting of 8 parent compounds and 3 metabolites from the group of antibiotics were investigated in sewage sludges three of the parent compounds ciprofloxacin cip clarithromycin cla and azithromycin azi were determined in two types of sewage sludge seasonally however sludge concentrations of the other investigated phacs sulfamethoxazole and its metabolites n acetyl sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole β d glucuronide trimethoprim erythromycin metronidazole clindamycin and its metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide were determined below the 0 1 μg kg seasonal occurrence concentrations of determined antibiotic compounds cip cla and azi in thickened and digested sewage sludge are given in fig 2 as can be seen in fig 2 while concentrations of cip cla and azi in thickened sludge were determined in the range of 0 20 19 03 μg kg 0 13 48 36 μg kg and 0 33 8 77 μg kg respectively their concentrations in digested sludge were found between the range of 0 73 9 78 μg kg 0 1 7 59 μg kg and 0 1 μg kg it has been reported that fluoroquinolone group antibiotic compounds of which cip is a member were detected in sewage sludge at much higher concentrations up to over 1000 μg kg compared to other pharmaceutical groups 14 42 similarly in a study conducted with 45 different wwtps located in 23 different cities of china it was reported that cip concentrations in sewage sludge ranged from 0 to 926 μg kg 43 higher concentrations detected in sewage sludge for antibiotic compounds like cip and tetracycline were explained by strong electrostatic attractions by the sludge particles toward these compounds 44 in addition quite higher water sludge distribution coefficients kd up to 38 900 l kg mlss 45 obtained for cip in real scale studies confirming the significant potential for cip in terms of passing to sewage sludge verlicchi and zambello 14 reported higher concentrations for cip in almost all types of sludge including primary secondary digested biosolids composted and dried compared to cla and azi antibiotics performed some other real scale studies have reported the values of kd up to 1200 and 2156 l kg mlss for cla and azi respectively 46 47 in a study conducted in two different municipal wwtps in switzerland it was stated that only cla and azi were detected among the macrolide group compounds investigated in activated sludge similar to our study in the mentioned study cla and azi concentrations in activated sludge were reported as 67 28 and 64 30 μg kg respectively 48 in another study performed with 5 different wwtps in slovakia cla and azi concentrations were reported as 26 and 78 μg kg respectively in the stabilized sewage sludges aerobically or anaerobically as the average values of 5 investigated plants 49 in our study obtained seasonal average concentrations for cip 6 86 μg kg cla 14 7 μg kg and azi 4 90 μg kg in thickened sludge were determined at lower levels compared to the literature in addition the determination of the highest sludge concentrations for cla among the antibiotics investigated both seasonally and annually was found different from most studies in the literature in the anaerobic digester moderate positive removal efficiency 52 2 was determined for cip only in the winter season while significant negative removal efficiencies ranging from 283 3 to 48 4 were obtained in the other seasons similar to our study results liu et al 50 reported that while they determined positive removal 73 5 in the winter season negative removal efficiency 19 4 was obtained in the summer season in industrial scale anaerobic digestion for cip in a study conducted with pig manure as the average of the four seasons the removal efficiency obtained in the anaerobic sludge digester for cip was calculated as 136 1 it has been observed that the cip exhibited uniform behavior in the anaerobic digester except in the winter season according to the obtained seasonal data it can be said that cip could not be treated in the anaerobic digester in general therefore digested sludge concentrations of cip were determined about up to 3 8 times higher than its thickened concentration values an important finding in our study is that all antibiotic compounds that we detected cip cla and azi were treated with positive and much higher removal rates in anaerobic digesters in cases where the influent concentrations of them were relatively higher especially in the winter season regardless of the seasons therefore it was evaluated that the removal efficiencies of these compounds in anaerobic digesters may be related to their influent concentrations in anaerobic digesters apart from this negative removals for cip have been generally associated with the resistance of the compound to biodegradation in anaerobic conditions and the strong tendencies of some of its main metabolites present in relatively high concentrations in sewage sludge to return to the parent compound during anaerobic digestion 14 25 26 as can be seen from the fig 2 the seasonal behavior of cla in the anaerobic digester has been determined to be rather inconsistent while treated with a removal rate of 92 in the winter season in the anaerobic digester the removal efficiency of cla in the summer season was determined as about 160 in addition to these removal performances of the anaerobic digester did not exceed 25 for cla in the other two seasons therefore it can be said that cla is more likely to be eliminated to some extent in an anaerobic digester similar to our study studies are showing that cla is partially biodegraded in the anaerobic digesters 29 51 including the relatively high negative removal efficiency obtained for cla in the summer season in the annual average will result in the calculation of the yearly removal average for cla as negative and will result in misinterpretation of the behavior of the cla in the anaerobic digester excluding the extreme negative removal efficiency the seasonal average removal rate of cla in the anaerobic digester was found to be approximately 43 narumiya et al 29 reported similar removals of around 50 in real scale anaerobic digesters for cla in a study conducted in 4 different wwtps in japan zeng et al 51 have revealed that cla was partially biodegraded during the anaerobic digester and accordingly converted to oleandomycin and 5 o desosaminyl 6 o methylerythronolide metabolites which have much lower antimicrobial activity compared to the parent compound similarly alenzi et al 26 have supported the partial biodegradation of cla in the anaerobic digester and claimed that anaerobic microorganisms are more effective in the removal of cla than aerobic microorganisms azi was the only compound that was treated with high removal efficiencies from 69 7 to 98 9 by showing uniform behavior in all seasons in the anaerobic digester the seasonal average removal efficiency of azi in the anaerobic digester was determined higher than 90 this indicates that azi can be biodegraded and or biologically transformed to its metabolites under anaerobic conditions 14 52 the very high removal efficiencies obtained for azi within the scope of the study revealed that the azi compound is readily degraded in anaerobic digesters and unlike other compounds in the antibiotic group is not affected by the seasons similarly aziz et al 53 stated that the dominant removal mechanism of azi in the anaerobic digestion process was biodegradation zhang and li 31 reported that approximately 80 of azi was treated in the anaerobic digester in their lab scale study in addition gonzález pleiter et al 54 have supported the high removal efficiencies for these compounds in the anaerobic digesters by emphasizing the possibility that antibiotics such as azi and cla are more likely to pass from the solid phase into the aqueous phase 3 2 occurrence and removal of nsaids in anaerobic digester in the study 4 parent compounds and 6 metabolites from the group of nsaids were investigated in sewage sludges of the studied wwtp four parent compounds paracetamol par diclofenac dcf ibuprofen ibu and naproxen nap were determined both in thickened and digested sludge besides one of the metabolites of ibu 2 hydroxyibuprofen 2 hydroxy ibu was also quantified concentrations of other investigated nsaids two metabolites of dcf 4 hydroxydiclofenac and 5 hydroxydiclofenac two metabolites of ibu 1 hydroxyibuprofen and carboxyibuprofen and metabolite of nap s o desmethyl naproxen have been found below 0 1 μg kg seasonal occurrences of determined nsaids par dcf ibu 2 hydroxy ibu and nap both in thickened and digested sludge are given in fig 3 as is shown in fig 3 concentration values in thickened sludge for par dcf ibu 2 hydroxy ibu and nap were found in the range of 0 32 9 78 μg kg 1 47 6 95 μg kg 0 1 0 22 μg kg 1 32 4 79 μg kg and 2 82 35 71 μg kg respectively maximum concentrations in digested sludge were determined up to 3 10 μg kg for par 6 16 μg kg for dcf 0 75 μg kg for ibu 11 74 μg kg for 2 hydroxy ibu and 5 67 μg kg for nap the detection frequency 50 of the group of nsaids was found higher than the group of antibiotics 27 based on the number of investigated compounds the highest concentrations of investigated nsaids in thickened sludge were determined in the winter season similar to antibiotics one of the important reasons for this situation is the frequent consumption of these pharmaceuticals as a result of seen many human related diseases especially in the winter season 2 apart from the high tendency of these compounds to sorption onto sludge 55 in a study performed with 10 different wwtps in spain the highest sludge concentrations for par 21 5 μg kg and ibu 99 1 μg kg were determined in primary sludge while for dcf 35 3 μg kg and nap 37 2 μg kg in secondary sludge 44 verlicchi and zambello 14 reported in their review study that ibu par nap and dcf were detected in anaerobically digested sludge up to about 2000 500 400 and 300 μg kg respectively as can be seen in fig 3c and d the mean thickened sludge concentration of 2 hydroxy ibu 2 94 μg kg was determined as 21 times its parent compound ibu 0 14 μg kg moreover 2 hydroxy ibu was detected seasonally in thickened and digested sludge up to 35 and 48 times more than ibu similar to our results luis malvar et al 25 have reported that 2 hydroxy ibu passes into the sewage sludge more than ibu the fact that there is such a big difference between the parent compound and its metabolite reveals that the sorption onto the sludge potential of the metabolites can be quite different compared to the parent compounds besides the seasonal relationships of ibu and 2 hydroxy ibu both in thickened and digested sludge in terms of detected concentrations were determined as highly significant p 0 001 and significant p 0 029 respectively these results also indicate how important it is to monitor metabolites along with the parent compounds in the use of sewage sludge as soil amendment as can be calculated from fig 3 par and nap compounds were treated seasonally in the anaerobic digesters with removal efficiencies ranging from 68 3 to 95 1 and 38 6 to 84 1 respectively on an annual average while par was highly eliminated 79 nap was moderately 58 treated the determination of high removal rates for par in the anaerobic digester in all seasons indicates that par was readily biodegraded in sewage sludge as well as in wastewater 28 phan et al 56 reported 83 removal for par with a pilot scale anaerobic digester operated under mesophilic conditions narumiya et al 29 in a study performed with real scale anaerobic digesters present in different wwtps have determined over the 80 removal for the par the results of these studies are in good agreement with our results in a real scale wwtp in greece removal efficiencies of 80 for nap have been determined in an anaerobic digester operated under mesophilic conditions 30 carballa et al 15 reported in their lab scale study that nap removal was not much affected by changing srt values and was generally treated above 85 in the anaerobic digester in our study the removal efficiency achieved for nap of over 84 in winter was found to be quite consistent with these studies while the calculated annual average removal efficiency of 58 for nap was found to be slightly below the general average contrary to par and nap dcf exhibited quite divergent behaviors in the anaerobic digester based on the different seasons as can be seen in fig 3 dcf could not be eliminated sufficiently in the anaerobic sludge digester treatment rates were lower than 30 for dcf in two seasons but considerable negative removal efficiencies of up to 120 were determined in the other two seasons the low removal efficiencies obtained for dcf demonstrate that this compound exhibits high resistance to biodegradation in the anaerobic conditions 25 nas et al 2 reported that the removal efficiencies obtained for dcf in a real scale anaerobic digester were 15 narumiya et al 29 reported that dcf removals were well below 50 in a study performed with real scale anaerobic digesters the relatively lower removals achieved for dcf in anaerobic digestion can be explained by occurring the very limited removal mechanisms of biodegradation biotransformation in the sewage sludge mainly associated with the presence of chlorine atoms in its molecular structure which makes dcf more recalcitrant 57 in the anaerobic digester removal efficiencies were calculated for ibu only in two seasons while removal efficiencies were calculated for 2 hydroxy ibu in all seasons in both two seasons very serious negative removal efficiencies of up to 241 were determined for ibu since quite different removal efficiencies have been reported in the literature the treatment of ibu under anaerobic conditions is considered a controversial issue the majority of the studies reported positive removal efficiencies for ibu in anaerobic digesters albeit at different rates 58 59 carballa et al 15 determined in their pilot scale study that the removal efficiency of ibu in the anaerobic digester 41 15 decreased with increasing srt values moreover samaras et al 30 reported treatment efficiencies exceeding 80 for ibu in real scale anaerobic digester the negative removal efficiencies exceeding 200 for ibu in our study differ considerably compared to the literature much like the parent compound ibu removal efficiencies of the 2 hydroxy ibu in anaerobic digester were also found as negative up to 261 except in the winter season however the annual average removal efficiency obtained for the 2 hydroxy ibu 112 2 in the anaerobic digester was determined to be approximately half that obtained for ibu 227 6 there are very few studies in the literature reporting negative removal efficiencies for ibu in the anaerobic digestion processes ahmad et al 27 reported a negative removal efficiency of 62 for ibu in a pilot scale anaerobic digester operated with 18 days of hrt using the mixed sludge gonzalez salgado et al 60 stated that 2 hydroxy ibu was found in higher concentration than ibu in the primary sludge and negative removal efficiencies were obtained for both compounds in the pilot scale mesophilic anaerobic digester it has been also determined in the same study that higher negative removal efficiencies up to 30 were obtained for ibu compared to 2 hydroxy ibu this study shows serious similarities to our study in terms of detecting 2 hydroxy ibu in sewage sludge at a higher concentration than ibu and determining higher negative removal for ibu in anaerobic digestion compared to 2 hydroxy ibu 3 3 occurrence and removal of anticonvulsants in anaerobic digester in this study 6 pharmaceutical compounds consisting of 2 parent compounds and 4 metabolites from the group of anticonvulsants were investigated both in thickened and digested sludge while carbamazepine cbz and its two metabolites carbamazepine diol cbz diol and 3 hydroxy carbamazepine 3 hydroxy cbz were determined quantitatively in sewage sludge the other two investigated metabolites of cbz carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide and 2 hydroxy carbamazepine were found lower than loq value primidone prm on the other hand was detected in the digested sludge only in one season above the 0 1 μg kg occurrence concentrations of determined anticonvulsants cbz cbz diol 3 hydroxy cbz and prm in sewage sludges are given seasonally in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 concentrations of cbz and its two metabolites cbz diol and 3 hydroxy cbz were determined in thickened sludge in the range of 1 75 2 53 μg kg 1 15 15 55 μg kg and 0 1 0 23 μg kg respectively concentrations of them in the digested sludge were found up to 6 49 18 89 and 1 47 μg kg respectively thus there were considerable concentration increases in digested sludge for cbz and its metabolites moreover much higher concentration values were detected in the digested sludge in the spring season for all compounds in the anticonvulsant group compared to other seasons this situation can be explained by the fact that the percentage of volatile solids reduction vsr in the anaerobic digester in spring 26 was determined much lower than in the other seasons up to 49 nas et al 2 reported concentration values ranging from 0 20 to 2 08 μg kg for the concentrations of cbz in digested sludge in a 12 month study conducted in a real scale wwtp in another study conducted in different wwtps by narumiya et al 29 while the cbz concentrations in thickened sludge were determined up to 5 μg kg concentrations of cbz in digested sludge were detected up to 11 μg kg which confirms the concentration increases for cbz after anaerobic treatment very similar to the detected cbz concentrations 3 14 6 49 μg kg in anaerobically digested sludge in our study concentration values ranging from 6 7 to 9 3 μg kg were reported for cbz in anaerobically digested sludge in another study 61 besides verlicchi and zambello 14 have reported concentration values up to around 900 μg kg for cbz in anaerobically digested sludge in their review study as can be seen from fig 4 it has been determined that the metabolites of cbz behaved quite differently than the parent compound while the mean concentrations of cbz cbz diol and 3 hydroxy cbz in thickened sludge were determined as 2 21 6 91 and 0 16 μg kg respectively in digested sludge were calculated as 4 28 11 23 and 0 73 μg kg the seasonal average concentrations of cbz diol were found to be 3 1 and 2 6 times cbz for the thickened and digested sewage sludge respectively however the annual mean concentrations of 3 hydroxy cbz were determined as approximately 7 and 17 of the concentrations of cbz in thickened and digested sludge respectively seasonal concentrations of cbz diol in thickened and digested sludge were determined up to 68 and 28 times the 3 hydroxy cbz respectively therefore it has been revealed that the potential of sorption onto sewage sludge of the parent compound and its metabolites which affect directly the total removal efficiencies of these compounds in wwtps could be quite different from each other apart from all these seasonal correlations between cbz and its metabolites or only between investigated metabolites were found as significant p 0 05 or highly significant p 0 01 in terms of detected concentrations based on the type of sewage sludge table s6 as seen in fig 4 none of the phacs in the group of anticonvulsants could be treated in the anaerobic digester on the contrary very serious negative removal efficiencies were determined annual mean removal efficiencies of cbz cbz diol and 3 hydroxy cbz in the anaerobic digester were determined as about 92 249 and 393 it is quite remarkable that both of the metabolites were treated with much higher negative removal efficiencies up to 740 than the cbz these results have revealed that the metabolites of cbz cannot be eliminated under anaerobic conditions like the parent compound both the relatively high polarity of cbz and the lack of specific interaction sites make the cbz compound extraordinarily persistent making it very difficult to remove under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions 39 in our study increasing concentrations of metabolites after anaerobic treatment revealed that metabolites of cbz can be converted to each other as well as to the parent compound during anaerobic digestion by conversion reactions some studies have reported that cbz and its metabolites can interconvert during the anaerobic digestion process supporting our study results 62 63 nas et al 2 reported nearly 95 removal efficiency for cbz in a study with a real scale anaerobic digester similarly in a real scale study performed by narumiya et al 29 negative removal efficiencies have been determined for cbz in anaerobic digesters however the lab scale study performed by ahmad et al 27 reported positive removal efficiencies up to 67 for cbz in anaerobic digestion depending on the applied different treatment configurations similar to our results miao et al 64 have reported that the concentrations of cbz and its metabolites in treated biosolids in a wwtp in which an anaerobic digestion process was applied increased compared to raw biosolids based on the concentrations in the biosolid in the same study the removal efficiencies for the parent compound cbz and its metabolites 2 hydroxy cbz 3 hydroxy cbz and cbz diol were calculated as about 271 79 169 and 105 respectively for the other investigated anticonvulsant compound prm in our study the removal efficiency was calculated only in the spring season and found to be 340 yang et al 28 have revealed that increasing negative removal efficiencies in anaerobic sludge digester were obtained for prm with increasing srt values in their lab scale study in the same study the concentrations of the prm which were determined up to approximately 50 μg kg in the primary sludge were detected up to about 100 μg kg in the digested sludge similar to our results zheng et al 65 have also reported that both prm and cbz were not biodegraded in the anaerobic digester in a lab scale study 3 4 occurrence and removal of nerve stimulants in anaerobic digester in this study 2 parent compounds and 2 metabolites from the group of nerve stimulants were investigated both in thickened and digested sludge while caffeine caf nicotine nct and one metabolite of nct trans 3 hydroxy cotinine trans 3 hydroxy cot were determined in sewage sludge seasonally concentrations of the other investigated metabolite of nct n formylnornicotine were always found lower than 0 1 μg kg thus the detection frequency of the group of nerve stimulants in sewage sludge was calculated as 75 fig 5 shows the seasonal occurrence concentrations of nerve stimulants caf nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot in sewage sludges as given in fig 5 while the concentrations of caf nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot in thickened sludge were determined up to 23 74 3 37 and 0 40 μg kg respectively concentrations of them in digested sludge were found at lower levels up to 18 92 0 1 and 0 14 μg kg this indicates that in contrast to anticonvulsants nerve stimulant concentrations were significantly lower in digested sludge compared to thickened sludge relatively higher concentrations of caf in sewage sludge compared to nct and its metabolite can be associated with quite higher concentrations of caf in raw wastewater as a result of excessive consumption of products containing caf like tea coffee cola chocolate and some energy drinks therefore the reported concentration values for caf in sewage sludge may differ significantly depending on the consumption habits of people living in different regions for example luis malvar et al 25 have determined the caf concentrations in anaerobically digested dehydrated sludge up to 41 4 μg kg while mejías et al 55 have reported up to 2828 μg kg concentration values for caf in digested sludge apart from these yang et al 28 have reported increasing concentration values of caf nearly up to 200 μg kg in digested sludge directly proportional to increased srt values 15 20 and 30 days in their lab scale study indicating the key role of the srt parameter the annual mean concentration of nct 1 66 μg kg in the thickened sludge was found as nearly eight times its metabolite trans 3 hydroxy cot 0 21 μg kg thus it has been determined that the metabolite of nct can be found in thickened sludge together with nct although not at concentrations as high as the parent compound however no significant correlation p 0 05 could be established between nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot in terms of seasonal concentrations detected in either thickened or digested sludge the number of studies showing the concentration levels of nct and its metabolites in sewage sludges together and associating them with each other is negligible in the study conducted with 2 different urban wwtps in spain nct concentrations in sewage sludge were reported to vary between 23 and 173 μg kg 66 petrie et al 67 reported the nct concentrations in the range of 139 26 4 μg kg in digested sludge treated in the anaerobic digestion plant which was operated under mesophilic conditions although a maximum concentration value of 3 37 μg kg was determined for nct in thickened sludge in our study the relatively higher concentration values obtained in sewage sludges for nct in other studies may be mainly associated with high tobacco consumption in the different regions as shown in fig 5 nerve stimulants were treated in anaerobic digesters positively in all seasons seasonal removal efficiencies for caf in the anaerobic digester ranged from 13 1 in winter to 87 8 in autumn in general caf has shown resistance to anaerobic degradation except for one season similarly luis malvar et al 25 have reported that the persistence of caf under anaerobic conditions was higher than under aerobic conditions however the achieved annual average removal efficiency for caf 35 7 remains at lower levels in our study compared to the majority of the other studies found in the literature for example narumiya et al 29 determined higher than 90 removal efficiencies for caf in the real scale anaerobic digesters yang et al 28 in their lab scale study have also reported that the removal efficiency for caf obtained in the anaerobic digester was similar to the quite higher removal efficiency obtained for caf in the aqueous phase azizan et al 24 have explained the achieved relatively higher removals for caf in the anaerobic digestion mainly by the enhanced biotransformation mechanism which occurred under the predominant methanogenic and sulphate reducing conditions as can be seen in fig 5 nct was treated above 96 in both seasons winter and autumn although trans 3 hydroxy cot was also eliminated in the anaerobic digester obtained removal efficiencies were determined as lower compared to nct in the context of bi seasonal data obtained for both compounds the average removal efficiencies for nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot obtained in the anaerobic digester were calculated as higher than 96 and 57 respectively therefore it can be said that nct and its metabolites can be eliminated simultaneously under anaerobic conditions there are also some studies showing that the behavior patterns of the nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot in wwtps are compatible with each other 68 69 however there is a serious lack of information in the literature about explaining the fate of nct and its metabolites simultaneously in real scale anaerobic digesters therefore further studies are needed to understand the behaviors of nct and its metabolites under anaerobic conditions 3 5 occurrence and removal of steroid hormones in anaerobic digester in the scope of this study 4 parent compounds and 2 metabolites from the group of steroid hormones were investigated in sewage sludges among the investigated six phacs only two parent compounds testosterone tes and progesterone prg were detected either in thickened or digested sludge seasonally the concentration values of the remaining 2 parent compounds 17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 and 2 metabolites estrone e1 and estriol e3 were found below 0 1 μg kg these results are consistent with the fact that the log kd values determined for both tes 5 18 70 and prg 6 62 71 compounds are much higher than the log kd values determined for e2 2 56 ee2 2 46 e1 2 45 72 and e3 2 67 73 compounds table s1 seasonal occurrence concentrations of determined steroid hormones tes and prg both in thickened and digested sewage sludges are given in fig 6 as given in fig 6 while the concentrations of prg in thickened sludge were found always below 0 1 μg kg in all seasons tes concentrations were determined only one season with a concentration value of 0 28 μg kg therefore it can be said that detected concentrations of steroid hormones in thickened sludge were determined as lower levels compared to other pharmaceutical subgroups this situation can be associated with very low concentrations of them in raw wastewater in general 2 however both tes and prg were determined in digested sludge in spring and summer seasons up to 0 26 and 0 71 μg kg respectively martín et al 74 have reported concentrations ranging from 4 95 to 836 μg kg for various pharmaceutical compounds in the group of steroid hormones in digested sludges in different wwtps verlicchi and zambello 14 have reported concentration values up to about 100 μg kg in anaerobically digested sludges for prg wu et al 75 determined concentration values of 10 ng g loq 1 2 1 4 ng g and 100 ng g for e1 e2 e3 and prg compounds respectively in sewage sludges of four different wwtps in general it can be said that although detected at quite lower concentrations in raw wastewater compared to other pharmaceutical therapeutic subgroups steroid hormones can be detected in different types of sewage sludges this situation can be explained by the high tendency to accumulate in sewage sludges depending on both the hydrophobic nature and low volatility of the steroid hormones 76 removal performances of the anaerobic digester both for tes and prg were determined in the spring and summer seasons as shown in fig 6 sludge concentrations of tes after the anaerobic digestion were not changed markedly in the anaerobic digester one positive 7 1 and one negative 30 removal efficiency were determined for tes during the two seasons and the average removal efficiency was calculated as about 11 4 however very serious negative removal efficiencies were determined for prg in the same seasons removal efficiencies of approximately 610 and 110 were calculated for prg in the spring and summer seasons respectively it is a quite striking result that the prg concentrations increased approximately 7 times after being treated in the anaerobic sludge digester on a seasonal basis negative removals of prg can be explained by either conversion reactions of metabolites to parent compounds or transformation of one parent compound into another 77 up to now quite contradictory results have been reported for the removal of steroid hormones in anaerobic digestion due to the still not fully understood behaviors of steroid hormone conjugates during sludge treatment in the lab scale study of paterakis et al 78 removal efficiencies ranging from 4 to 79 have been determined in the anaerobic digester for e1 e3 and ee2 while negative removal efficiencies of up to 325 for e2 have been reported gonzalez gil et al 59 reported in their lab scale study that e1 and e2 were not treated at all in the anaerobic digester but ee2 was eliminated about up to 75 contrary to this study nas et al 2 reported that ee2 showed greater resistance to biodegradation in the anaerobic digester compared to e2 besides some studies have suggested that operating conditions of the anaerobic digesters such as temperature and srt do not affect the removal of steroid hormones much 14 79 nevertheless although there are many studies investigating e1 e2 e3 and ee2 in anaerobic digesters in the literature there is no study on the subject of the fate of tes and prg compounds in real scale anaerobic digesters 3 6 occurrence and removal of antidepressants in anaerobic digester in the study 1 parent compound fluoxetine flx belonging to the group of antidepressants was investigated in two types of sewage sludge of the studied wwtp seasonal occurrence concentrations of flx are given in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 while the concentrations of flx in thickened sludge were determined 0 1 μg kg in all seasons its concentrations in digested sludge were detected in the range of 0 31 and 5 11 μg kg the annual mean concentration of flx was found as 1 83 μg kg in digested sludge suanon et al 80 have reported flx concentrations in the range of 11 2 and 39 3 μg kg in digested sludge in their lab scale and single state anaerobic digester systems in another study petrie et al 67 determined concentration values of 139 26 4 μg kg in digested sludges for flx in an anaerobic digestion plant that was operated under mesophilic conditions ferhi et al 81 have determined flx concentrations as 105 12 μg kg in digested sludges in the study performed in urban wwtp in general flx concentrations detected in the digested sludges in studies found in the literature were found to be quite high compared to our study results considering that the log kd value of flx 3 78 is higher than many phacs investigated in this study table s1 the most likely reason for this situation can be considered as the quite low flx consumption by people in the city of konya as can be seen from fig 7 unbelievable negative removal efficiencies were achieved for flx in the anaerobic digester flx concentrations increased significantly in all seasons after the anaerobic digestion for this reason negative removal efficiencies ranging from 210 in autumn to 5100 in spring were obtained for flx similar to the compounds in the anticonvulsant group the highest negative removal efficiency for flx was detected in the spring season which can be explained by the fact that the determined percentage of vsr 26 in anaerobic digesters was much lower in this season compared to other seasons negative removals obtained for flx can be explained by the release of free parent compound flx from the conjugated forms during the anaerobic sludge treatment 82 in addition both quite resistant structure to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions together with high sludge affinity due to the hydrophobic nature of flx can be considered as the other effective parameters in making sense of these negative removals 26 71 suanon et al 80 have determined negative removal efficiencies for flx in all three different anaerobic digesters operated under different conditions in their lab scale study using domestic sewage sludge similarly alenzi et al 26 have reported negative removal efficiencies for flx in lab scale anaerobic digesters in which synthetic sewage sludges were used therefore negative removal efficiencies for flx have been obtained in anaerobic digesters regardless of whether the sewage sludge used was real or synthetic in the lab scale studies besides there are also studies showing that flx is either not degraded at all or negligibly degraded in anaerobic digesters 28 58 however unlike these studies gonzalez gil et al 59 have claimed that flx was eliminated between 50 and 75 in the anaerobic digester 3 7 other investigated pharmaceutical subgroups in this study apart from the 6 pharmaceutical subgroups explained in detail above 4 different therapeutic subgroups have been also investigated in sewage sludges of the studied wwtp the concentration values of all investigated phacs belonging to these subgroups anticancer drugs lipid regulators receptor antagonists and antiseptics in both thickened and digested sewage sludge were determined below the loq value in all seasons stated in other words concentrations of tamoxifen ifosfamide cyclophosphamide anticancer drugs gemfibrozil clofibric acid lipid regulators cimetidine receptor antagonist and triclosan antiseptic were detected below the 0 1 μg kg therefore the fate of these phacs in full scale anaerobic sludge digesters could not be evaluated 3 8 comparison of the investigated pharmaceutical subgroups in terms of seasonal occurrence concentrations and removals seasonal variations in the total pharmaceutical concentrations consisting of six different therapeutic groups both in thickened and digested sludge are provided in fig 8 total pharmaceutical concentration 178 μg kg calculated in the thickened sewage sludge was determined by far the highest in the winter season while the season in which the total pharmaceutical concentration was determined at the highest level in the thickened sludge after the winter season was spring 73 5 μg kg the total pharmaceutical concentration detected in the thickened sludge in the summer and autumn seasons was found to be almost the same levels 21 5 μg kg as can be easily seen from fig 8 the determination of the highest level of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the thickened sewage sludge in winter compared to other seasons especially arises from the phacs belonging to the antibiotic and nsaid groups because about 42 9 76 16 μg kg and 32 3 24 18 μg kg of the total pharmaceutical concentration determined in thickened sludge in winter derives from antibiotic and nsaid groups respectively due to the gradual decrease in antibiotic consumption from winter to autumn the percentage of representation of antibiotics in total pharmaceutical concentrations in thickened sludge sharply decreased to 3 1 0 66 μg kg in the autumn season in this context it has been determined that the group in which the seasonal effect was most clearly seen in terms of the reflection of drug use on the concentration of sewage sludge is antibiotics even so considering the annual average the group of antibiotics has been determined as the group with the highest ratio with a concentration value of 26 38 μg kg in thickened sludge constituting 35 9 of the total pharmaceutical concentration the percentages of the nsaid group in the total pharmaceutical concentration in the thickened sludge varied between 18 3 in spring and 33 3 in autumn seasonally in addition the nsaid group constituted 30 3 of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the thickened sludge in the summer season and ranked first on an annual average the group of nsaids with 28 7 21 1 μg kg was found as the second most detected group in thickened sludge after antibiotics the seasons in which nerve stimulants were detected with the highest concentration in thickened sludge were winter and spring with a similar concentration value 25 μg kg although detected with relatively lower concentrations in the summer 5 40 μg kg and autumn 9 94 μg kg seasons the group of nerve stimulants constitutes 25 6 and 46 of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the thickened sludge in these seasons respectively nerve stimulants were determined at an annual average level of 16 24 μg kg in thickened sludge and constituted 22 1 of the total annual average pharmaceutical concentration another pharmaceutical group that was regularly detected in thickened sludge in all seasons is anticonvulsants anticonvulsants were calculated seasonally in the thickened sludge with a concentration range of 3 52 in autumn and 18 41 μg kg in winter anticonvulsants determined at an annual average value of 9 38 μg kg in thickened sludge constitute 12 8 of the annual average concentration of total pharmaceuticals however percentages of other investigated groups steroid hormones and antidepressants in total pharmaceutical concentration in thickened sludge were not exceeded 1 and 0 5 respectively in any season as shown in fig 9 the percentages of the pharmaceutical subgroups detected in the digested sludge after being treated in the anaerobic digesters in the total pharmaceutical concentration varied considerably the changes in the percentages based on annual average concentrations of different pharmaceutical subgroups in the total pharmaceutical concentration in the sewage sludge before and after anaerobic treatment are given in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 the group with the largest share in the total pharmaceutical concentration in the digested sludge was determined as anticonvulsants with a percentage of 31 3 the total anticonvulsant concentration in digested sludge was determined up to 27 29 μg kg in spring seasonally the group of nsaids was found to have the highest share after anticonvulsants in terms of total pharmaceutical concentration determined in digested sludge the percentage of nsaids which were detected seasonally between 6 97 and 19 50 μg kg in digested sludge in the total pharmaceutical concentration on an annual average was determined as 24 2 the annual average percentages of the groups of nerve stimulants 1 03 19 16 μg kg and antibiotics 0 93 17 47 μg kg in the digested sludge were found to be very close to each other as 20 5 and 19 7 respectively in addition the percentages of total concentrations of steroid hormones from 0 35 to 0 8 and antidepressants from 0 15 to 3 5 in the digested sludge increased compared to the thickened sludge as an annual average the highest total concentration values in digested sludge for both steroid hormones 0 97 μg kg and antidepressants 5 11 μg kg were determined in the spring season the treatment performances of full scale anaerobic digesters for different pharmaceutical subgroups were calculated according to the annual average mass balance of the pharmaceutical subgroups fig 10 in this context the most treated subgroups in the anaerobic digesters were determined as antibiotics 60 8 nsaids 39 7 and nerve stimulants 33 7 respectively however negative removal efficiencies were achieved for the groups of anticonvulsants 75 1 steroid hormones 74 5 and antidepressants 1730 0 according to the seasonal mass balance the best removal efficiencies for the groups of antibiotics nsaids and anticonvulsants in the anaerobic digesters were obtained in the winter season with removal rates of 82 9 70 9 and 32 8 respectively however the best removal efficiencies for the groups of nerve stimulants 89 6 and antidepressants 210 have been determined in the autumn season therefore it has been revealed that the best removal efficiencies in anaerobic digesters were obtained in cold seasons for the investigated pharmaceutical subgroups based on the calculated total mass balance seasonally the best removal efficiency in the anaerobic digester was obtained in winter 65 and the worst removal efficiency in summer 78 besides negative removal was calculated in the spring in the anaerobic digester albeit at a low level 20 8 while the removal was only 0 4 in the autumn indicating no change therefore it has been determined that the total pharmaceutical treatment performances of anaerobic digesters vary significantly according to the seasons besides as can be seen in fig 10 the total pharmaceutical treatment performance of anaerobic digesters was determined as 28 5 according to the calculation of the annual average mass balance of all pharmaceutical subgroups therefore it has been determined that full scale anaerobic digesters treat total phacs poorly and were not very effective 4 conclusions the release of many phacs into the natural environment especially through the application of sewage sludge in agricultural activities is of great concern therefore the anaerobic digestion process a broadly applied technology in wwtps attracts serious attention in determining its potential to eliminate these phacs of the 45 compounds investigated the seasonal occurrence and fate of detected 18 phacs from 6 different pharmaceutical subgroups have been evaluated comparatively in the full scale anaerobic digesters total pharmaceutical concentrations determined in the thickened sludge ranged from about 21 1 in summer to 177 6 μg kg in winter this significant difference is due to the fact that especially antibiotics and nsaids are consumed much higher during the winter season it has been determined that the treatment performances of full scale anaerobic digesters can vary significantly seasonally both on the basis of individual pharmaceutical compounds and subgroups although varies seasonally the groups of antibiotics 60 8 nsaids 39 7 and nerve stimulants 33 7 have been treated from poorly to moderately in anaerobic digesters yearly it s one of the important findings that the nerve stimulants group has been determined as the only group that was treated as positively 18 1 89 6 in all seasons however negative removal efficiencies were achieved for all investigated phacs in the groups of anticonvulsants steroid hormones and antidepressants regardless of the seasons flx has been determined as the compound whose concentration increased most markedly in anaerobically digested sludge compared to other phacs although they were detected in quite different concentrations in sewage sludges the removal patterns of parent compounds and metabolites in anaerobic digesters were found to be very similar in addition significant correlations p 0 05 have been determined between each other for the majority of the parent compounds and metabolites within the scope of statistical analyses while the best treatment performance of anaerobic digesters in terms of the total concentration of phacs was determined in the winter season 65 worst was in the summer season 78 in this context the yearly treatment performance of anaerobic digesters for total phacs remained below 30 hence it is determined that applying the anaerobic digestion process alone to stabilize sewage sludges to be used in real scale agronomic practices is unsatisfactory in terms of eliminating pharmaceuticals from sewage sludges therefore it will be more reliable to use different treatment technologies with proven effectiveness on phacs together with anaerobic digesters in wwtps within the scope of cost benefit analysis in terms of reducing possible risks arising from stabilized sewage sludges moreover there is an urgent need to update the relevant regulation by including total pharmaceutical content or some indicator phacs in order to reduce the total pharmaceutical loads passing to the natural environment due to the widespread agricultural applications of sewage sludge as soil amendment to farmland credit authorship contribution statement taylan

12628,the occurrence and behavior of pharmaceuticals especially in sewage sludge have attracted great attention nowadays due to the intensive application of sewage sludge in agriculture in terms of the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals although anaerobic digestion is a well developed and widely applied treatment process in terms of stabilization of sewage sludges and removal of organics the treatment performances of this technology for different pharmaceutical subgroups are still not well known in this study the occurrence and seasonal variations of 45 pharmaceutical compounds consisting of 27 parent compounds and 18 main metabolites from 10 different therapeutic groups were investigated both in thickened and digested sludge generated in a large scale urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp in this way the seasonal removal performances of full scale anaerobic digesters for parent compounds and metabolites have been determined and compared simultaneously while the total pharmaceutical concentrations in the thickened sludge varied between 21 1 and 177 6 μg kg seasonally it was determined in the range of 21 5 and 88 8 μg kg in the digested sludge in the thickened sludge the predominant group was found as antibiotics 35 9 while in the digested sludge it was determined as anticonvulsants 31 3 besides seasonal relationships of parent compounds and metabolites both in thickened and digested sludges were evaluated statistically in terms of both occurrence and removal in general although the capacities for sorption onto sewage sludges were found as different removal patterns of both parent compounds and metabolites in anaerobic digesters have been determined as quite similar the removal performance of the anaerobic digesters showed great differences based on the investigated pharmaceutical subgroups although varies seasonally while antibiotic up to 82 9 nsaid up to 70 9 and nerve stimulant up to 89 6 groups tended to be treated in anaerobic digesters negative removal efficiencies were determined for anticonvulsant up to 242 9 steroid hormone up to 155 3 and antidepressant up to 5010 groups while the total pharmaceutical treatment performances of anaerobic sludge digesters varied between 78 in summer and 65 in winter seasonally it has been determined as 28 5 annually therefore it has been determined in this study that the pharmaceutical treatment performance of full scale anaerobic digesters is not effective enough graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion pharmaceutically active compounds micropollutants seasonal distribution sewage sludge soil amendment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction together with dramatic increases in the world population especially in the last century the amount of chemicals produced due to the developments of science technology and national economies is mounting dramatically every year as a result of increasing chemical production excessively there has emerged a critically important chemicalization problem in the world 1 pharmaceuticals consisting of tens of thousands of chemical compounds are one of the biggest and most complex groups of micropollutants 2 consisting of different subgroups pharmaceuticals are primarily used intensively in the field of medicine to prevent and treat human diseases besides pharmaceuticals are also used in the field of veterinary medicine as well as animal husbandry aquaculture biotechnology and many other commercial sectors for various purposes 3 as a result of extensive consumption of these biologically active compounds pharmaceuticals have become ubiquitous in various environmental matrices all over the world 2 4 5 passing of these pharmaceutically active compounds phacs to receiving environments in an uncontrolled manner with their known and unknown adverse effects on ecosystems animals and people has become a crucial global environmental and health problem it is known that after pharmaceuticals are taken by humans or animals metabolites of parent compounds are also formed apart from the residue of parent compounds due to the incomplete metabolization of most phacs 6 7 therefore parent compounds and various metabolites reach wastewater treatment plants wwtps throughout the sewerage system together as a mixture via urine and feces besides some studies have also revealed that exposure to certain pharmaceutical metabolites is much more dangerous than parent compounds to ecosystems and almost all living creatures 8 9 although some other factors affect the passing of pharmaceuticals to the receiving environments the major source for the transition of these pollutants to the natural environment is considered domestic and municipal wwtps 2 10 the main reason for this situation is that many existing wwtps are not designed to treat micropollutants 11 therefore depending on the specific physicochemical properties molecular weight chemical structure acidity biodegradability sorption potential etc of phacs as well as the treatment types activated sludge processes waste stabilization ponds constructed wetlands etc and operational conditions hydraulic retention time hrt sludge retention time srt temperature ph redox potential etc of the investigated wwtps significant removal differences have been reported ranging from serious negative removal efficiencies to complete elimination of phacs in literature 3 10 12 the main removal mechanisms of phacs in wwtps are biodegradation biotransformation and sorption onto sewage sludge 13 14 although many performed studies have shown that the percentage of sorption onto sewage sludge was found below 5 in general in terms of contribution to the total removal of various phacs in wwtps 2 14 15 significant amounts of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites pass into the sewage sludges produced in wwtps until recently to dispose of sewage sludge formed in wwtps in general it was preferred to send sewage sludge to solid waste landfills or to incinerate them in incineration plants nowadays the application of sewage sludges as soil amendment has become widespread in many countries for real scale agricultural production since the sewage sludge contains beneficial organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and can significantly improve soil quality 5 16 about half of the sewage sludges produced at wwtps in the usa china and europe are used in the form of dry matter as soil amendment or fertilizer on farmland 17 18 in türkiye approximately 5 of the total sewage sludge produced in wwtps is used in agricultural applications 19 the widespread use of sewage sludge as soil amendment in the world not only reduces the disposal costs of sewage sludge of wwtps but also provides significant benefits to agricultural production within the scope of sustainable agriculture however mainly depending on whether the characteristic of wastewater treated in wwtps is domestic or urban the sewage sludges also contain different pollutants belonging to various micropollutant groups with threatening toxic properties like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 20 pesticides 21 phthalate esters 22 heavy metals 23 pharmaceutical residues 2 etc the most critical sludge treatment unit that stabilizes the sewage sludge in wwtps is the anaerobic digester in which biological treatment occurs 24 in addition the anaerobic digester unit plays an important role in determining the final concentration levels of phacs in sewage sludge that would be used as soil amendment in agricultural lands 14 25 although there are many studies investigating the pharmaceutical treatment performances of anaerobic digesters operated under different working conditions on a lab scale 15 26 28 the number of studies conducted in this context on real scale anaerobic digesters present in wwtps 29 30 is quite limited in many lab scale studies it has been reported that the operating parameters of anaerobic digesters such as srt hrt and temperature 27 28 31 can directly or indirectly affect the removal efficiency of the investigated phacs in various ways including affecting the presence of the microbial communities 32 33 in anaerobic reactors however the concentrations of many phacs studied belonging to different therapeutic subgroups in most lab scale studies are well above the concentrations of the same pharmaceutical compounds found in natural environments therefore there is a great knowledge gap about the treatment performances of full scale anaerobic digesters present in wwtps in terms of evaluating the pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites together with a holistic view in türkiye the use of sewage sludge has been regulated by regulation on the use of domestic and urban sewage sludge in soil published by the year of 2010 by the ministry of environment and urbanization 34 this regulation covers all technical and administrative principles regarding the controlled use of sewage sludge which is produced as a result of the treatment of domestic and urban wastewater in the soil in a way that does not harm the soil plants animals and humans according to this regulation for the stabilized sludge to be applied to agricultural areas as soil amendment there are limit concentration values for some compounds including heavy metals pahs polychlorinated biphenyl and dibenzodioxins alkylbenzene sulfonates bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate halogenated compounds nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates however similar to the directive in force in europe on the application of sewage sludge to agricultural land 35 this regulation does not contain a provision for monitoring or restricting any pharmaceutical compounds in the application of sewage sludge as soil amendment therefore possible environmental and human health risks that may arise from the application of sewage sludges in agricultural lands related to phacs are ignored the first objective of this study was to determine the seasonal occurrence concentrations of 45 phacs including 27 parent compounds and 18 main metabolites from 10 different subgroups both in thickened and anaerobically digested sewage sludge generated in the large scale urban wwtp in this context eleven antibiotics ten nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids six anticonvulsants four nerve stimulants six steroid hormones three anticancer drugs two lipid regulators one antidepressant one receptor antagonist and one antiseptic were investigated the second objective was to determine and compare the seasonal removal performances of full scale anaerobic sludge digesters one of the original aspects of this study is that it provides a general opinion on the removal efficiency of real scale anaerobic sludge digesters on the group of pharmaceuticals not over a few compounds or subgroups but over a very wide scale one of the other original aspects of this study is to demonstrate that the investigated compounds can be treated with different removal efficiencies in real scale anaerobic digesters in different seasons depending on various parameters in this scope the effects of different seasons on the treatment performance of the anaerobic sludge digester were evaluated by comparing them with other phacs in the same subgroup within the scope of the removal efficiencies obtained for each compound the third objective was to evaluate the fate and behavior of parent compounds and their metabolites in sewage sludges during the anaerobic digestion within the scope of possible removal mechanisms biodegradation and biotransformation in addition it was also aimed to determine possible correlations between parent compounds and their metabolites during anaerobic digestion within the scope of statistical analysis apart from being the first real scale study performed in türkiye it is one of the original studies in terms of evaluating the removals of many phacs consisting of parent compounds and metabolites simultaneously in the full scale anaerobic digester including the seasonal effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents in this study 45

study was performed in urban advanced biological wwtp located in the city of konya türkiye found in the middle anatolian of türkiye the metropolitan city of konya is the largest city of türkiye in terms of a total surface area of approximately 41 000 km2 covering 5 2 of the country s surface area the population of about 2 25 million people of konya city corresponds to approximately 2 7 of türkiye s total population the studied large scale wwtp is called konya wwtp and serves about 1 3 million people operated as 4 stage bardenpho process with partial nitrogen removal konya wwtp treats nearly 200 000 m3 day of wastewater including domestic industrial and hospital there are five different and large scale organized industrial zones in konya consisting of many different sectors especially automotive metal and machinery manufacturing industries a total of approximately 15 000 m3 day of industrial wastewater is generated in these organized industrial zones industrial wastewater comes to konya wwtp via a combined sewerage system after the pre treatment stage in organized industrial zones and constitutes approximately 7 5 of the flow rate of daily wastewater treated at the plant hospital wastewater produced in konya city is given directly to the combined sewerage system without any pre treatment the total flow of hospital wastewater coming to the konya wwtp is approximately 6000 m3 day and constitutes approximately 3 of the total daily wastewater flow rate treated in the plant after mixing the sewage sludge produced both in the primary and secondary clarifiers in konya wwtp they are thickened and blended in the sludge thickener units percentages of solid matter of primary and secondary sewage sludge are in the range of 2 0 2 5 and 1 0 1 5 respectively based on the operational conditions of the plant after being processed in sludge thickener units sewage sludge is fed to anaerobic sludge digesters finally after being treated in the anaerobic sludge digesters sewage sludges are dewatered in the sludge dewatering units decanter via centrifuge in general the dry matter percentage of dewatered sludge is in the range of 25 27 then to be used as soil amendment to agricultural lands by the farmers with the intent of real scale agricultural production treated sludge formed is kept in the wwtp under suitable conditions and for sufficient periods 8 9 months to become fully stabilized the sewage sludge which becomes completely stabilized at the end is used as soil amendment in agricultural areas by the farmers prevalently after performing the necessary analysis within the scope of the regulation on the use of domestic and urban sewage sludge in soil the location of the city of konya in türkiye and both the location and top view of the investigated konya wwtp are shown together in fig 1 konya wwtp is the only treatment plant in türkiye that is authorized to use stabilized sewage sludge to farmers with legal permission the most important share in stabilizing the sewage sludge belongs to the anaerobic sludge digesters in the plant there are 4 anaerobic sludge digesters operated in parallel and simultaneously at konya wwtp the volume of each anaerobic sludge digester is 7000 m3 anaerobic sludge digesters are being operated in mesophilic conditions 37 0 5 c with an average of nearly 20 days of srt seasonal operational conditions including many parameters and removal performance of the studied anaerobic digester are given together in table s2 in detail 2 3 sampling sampling campaigns were performed in the year 2020 seasonally during the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic samplings were conducted in january winter season may spring season august summer season and october autumn season sewage sludge samples were collected from the inlet thickened sludge and outlet digested sludge of the anaerobic digester unit as a composite sample 2 h pre cleaned and baked brown wide mouth glass containers 1 5 l were used for collecting the sludge samples srt value 20 days of the anaerobic digesters was taken into account to determine the removal performances of anaerobic digesters accurately while sampling in this study which was carried out during four seasons to represent the annual average a total of four different sewage sludge samples two of which were thickened sludge at the beginning and end of the sampling month and two of which were anaerobically digested sludge were taken each season collected all sludge samples were kept in the ice bath until they were brought to the laboratory from the konya wwtp to preserve the characterization of samples after being brought to the laboratory sludge samples were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until the analysis was performed 2 4 sample preparation and extraction two extraction processes have been applied successively to make all collected sewage sludge samples ready for chromatographic analysis ultrasonic assisted extraction method epa 3550c ultrasonic extraction was performed in the first stage the supernatant was taken and concentrated using a gentle nitrogen stream and rotary evaporator in the second stage obtained final extracts were cleaned by solid phase extraction spe method after being diluted with deionized water after completing the conditioning of cartridges diluted extracts were passed through the spe cartridges then the used spe cartridges were rinsed with deionized water immediately after the drying procedure was conducted for rinsed cartridges for about 7 5 min under the vacuum system as a result of all these procedures phacs were eluted from the cartridges with methanol after eluted extracts were concentrated by using the gentle nitrogen stream the rotary evaporator was utilized to dissolve the concentrated extracts in a mixed solution consisting of deionized water and methanol 90 10 or 80 20 v v then selected internal standards were added and the final volume of extracts was adjusted to 4 ml finally extracts were taken to vials and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms all seasonal sludge samples were analyzed in duplicate after the extraction method was applied for each one the concentrations determined for the investigated phacs in the sewage sludge samples which were taken and analyzed in duplicate seasonally were found to be close to each other and therefore average values of two samples were used to represent each season 2 5 calibration curve and quality assurance in order to perform the quantitative analyses multi point calibration curves up to eight points were used in the range of 100 2000 ng g at least six different concentrations were used for drawing the calibration curves providing r2 values 0 99 besides that to improve the assurance of the analyses together with preventing both random and systematic errors internal standards were used in all the analyses in this study applied lod and loq values were 30 ng g and 100 ng g for all phacs respectively both recovery and repeatability studies have also been carried out simultaneously for the quality assurance and quality control qa qc of the applied method based on the eu regulations 36 in addition to these the mixed solution of phacs having a concentration of 500 ng g was also analyzed for quality control in every seasonal analysis period besides efficiencies of the applied extraction methods and clean up procedures were evaluated by using both spike free and phacs spiked sewage sludges in the scope of this purpose used sewage sludge samples were spiked by phacs having concentrations ranging between 100 and 2000 ng g finally the extractions of these spiked sewage sludge samples were performed using the same extraction methods information of the analytical conditions in the lc ms ms system together with the results obtained in recovery studies conducted both for thickened and digested sludges for all phacs are given in tables s3 and s4 respectively 2 6 instrumental analysis quantitative analyses of 45 phacs were performed by triple quadrupole lc ms ms system agilent 6460 hplc series 1200 using dynamic multiple reaction monitoring dmrm mode according to the slightly modified method of epa 1694 pharmaceuticals and personal care products in water soil sediment and biosolids by hplc ms ms 37 the quantification of each investigating phacs was performed by at least two ion transitions that were selected as a quantification precursor and confirmation product ions 38 the ms was operated with two main groups which were electrospray ionization modes of both positive esi and negative esi two different column types were used for chromatographic separation while poroshell column 120 sb c 18 4 6 mm i d 150 mm 2 7 μm particle size was utilized at acidic analyses at alkali analyses zorbax extend c 18 column 3 0 mm i d 100 mm 3 7 μm particle size was used the sample injection volume was 30 μl while acidic mobile phase a b 90 10 was prepared by using eluent a deionized water containing 5 mm ammonium formate and 0 1 formic acid and eluent b methanol for the mode of esi alkali mobile phase a b 80 20 was prepared by using eluent a deionized water containing 0 1 ammonia and eluent b methanol for the mode of esi nitrogen was used as the carrier gas flow rates and the temperatures of the used two types of columns were 0 6 ml min and 35 c respectively the flow rate and the temperature of the gas were 10 ml min and 325 c respectively 2 7 calculation of removal efficiencies some recalcitrant pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites can degrade much more slowly in the anaerobic digester than in the organic matter they are contained in or are bound to 30 in addition to this many phacs present in sewage sludge either metabolized or in conjugated forms can be transformed back to parent compounds during anaerobic digestion 10 as a result of these two main factors quite higher effluent concentrations can be determined for some phacs after anaerobic digestion especially when mass basis e g μg phacs kg of dry total solids ts approaches are used these achieved relatively higher concentrations arise from the lower mass of volatile solids vs ts exiting in an anaerobic digester after biodegradation one of the important removal mechanisms of phacs 39 in this study concentrations of the investigated phacs were determined as μg kg dm ts both in thickened and digested sewage sludges therefore influent concentrations of phacs cinf entering the anaerobic digester detected thickened sludge concentrations of phacs have been adjusted by the fractional volatile solids reduction vsr between the anaerobic digester s feed and effluent as performed in some other studies 39 40 eq 1 then the removal efficiencies of phacs in the anaerobic digester were calculated according to the both adjusted influent cinf adj and effluent concentrations ceff of phacs eq 2 39 since the photodegradation of phacs in the anaerobic digester is not possible it can be supposed that the removals of phacs achieved in the anaerobic digester were totally due to removal mechanisms of biodegradation and biotransformation 1 c inf adj 1 1 vsr c inf 2 removal efficiency c inf adj c eff c inf adj 100 2 8 data analysis microsoft excel program was used to compile the seasonal data including minimum average and maximum values together with standard deviation and detection frequencies of the detected phacs both in thickened and digested sludges table s5 in addition analysis of variance anova was performed for determining the significance level of differences between variables at a 95 confidence interval by using graph pad prism 8 software in this context the seasonal concentrations of the investigated parent compounds individually and together with the parent compounds and metabolites in two different types of sewage sludge were evaluated for significance levels in addition it was also evaluated whether the seasonal removal efficiencies obtained for the parent compounds and their metabolites in anaerobic digesters were significant or not table s6 the values of 0 05 0 05 and 0 01 obtained for p as a result of the anova analyses mean not significant significant and highly significant respectively 41 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and removal of antibiotics in anaerobic digester in the study 11 phacs consisting of 8 parent compounds and 3 metabolites from the group of antibiotics were investigated in sewage sludges three of the parent compounds ciprofloxacin cip clarithromycin cla and azithromycin azi were determined in two types of sewage sludge seasonally however sludge concentrations of the other investigated phacs sulfamethoxazole and its metabolites n acetyl sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole β d glucuronide trimethoprim erythromycin metronidazole clindamycin and its metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide were determined below the 0 1 μg kg seasonal occurrence concentrations of determined antibiotic compounds cip cla and azi in thickened and digested sewage sludge are given in fig 2 as can be seen in fig 2 while concentrations of cip cla and azi in thickened sludge were determined in the range of 0 20 19 03 μg kg 0 13 48 36 μg kg and 0 33 8 77 μg kg respectively their concentrations in digested sludge were found between the range of 0 73 9 78 μg kg 0 1 7 59 μg kg and 0 1 μg kg it has been reported that fluoroquinolone group antibiotic compounds of which cip is a member were detected in sewage sludge at much higher concentrations up to over 1000 μg kg compared to other pharmaceutical groups 14 42 similarly in a study conducted with 45 different wwtps located in 23 different cities of china it was reported that cip concentrations in sewage sludge ranged from 0 to 926 μg kg 43 higher concentrations detected in sewage sludge for antibiotic compounds like cip and tetracycline were explained by strong electrostatic attractions by the sludge particles toward these compounds 44 in addition quite higher water sludge distribution coefficients kd up to 38 900 l kg mlss 45 obtained for cip in real scale studies confirming the significant potential for cip in terms of passing to sewage sludge verlicchi and zambello 14 reported higher concentrations for cip in almost all types of sludge including primary secondary digested biosolids composted and dried compared to cla and azi antibiotics performed some other real scale studies have reported the values of kd up to 1200 and 2156 l kg mlss for cla and azi respectively 46 47 in a study conducted in two different municipal wwtps in switzerland it was stated that only cla and azi were detected among the macrolide group compounds investigated in activated sludge similar to our study in the mentioned study cla and azi concentrations in activated sludge were reported as 67 28 and 64 30 μg kg respectively 48 in another study performed with 5 different wwtps in slovakia cla and azi concentrations were reported as 26 and 78 μg kg respectively in the stabilized sewage sludges aerobically or anaerobically as the average values of 5 investigated plants 49 in our study obtained seasonal average concentrations for cip 6 86 μg kg cla 14 7 μg kg and azi 4 90 μg kg in thickened sludge were determined at lower levels compared to the literature in addition the determination of the highest sludge concentrations for cla among the antibiotics investigated both seasonally and annually was found different from most studies in the literature in the anaerobic digester moderate positive removal efficiency 52 2 was determined for cip only in the winter season while significant negative removal efficiencies ranging from 283 3 to 48 4 were obtained in the other seasons similar to our study results liu et al 50 reported that while they determined positive removal 73 5 in the winter season negative removal efficiency 19 4 was obtained in the summer season in industrial scale anaerobic digestion for cip in a study conducted with pig manure as the average of the four seasons the removal efficiency obtained in the anaerobic sludge digester for cip was calculated as 136 1 it has been observed that the cip exhibited uniform behavior in the anaerobic digester except in the winter season according to the obtained seasonal data it can be said that cip could not be treated in the anaerobic digester in general therefore digested sludge concentrations of cip were determined about up to 3 8 times higher than its thickened concentration values an important finding in our study is that all antibiotic compounds that we detected cip cla and azi were treated with positive and much higher removal rates in anaerobic digesters in cases where the influent concentrations of them were relatively higher especially in the winter season regardless of the seasons therefore it was evaluated that the removal efficiencies of these compounds in anaerobic digesters may be related to their influent concentrations in anaerobic digesters apart from this negative removals for cip have been generally associated with the resistance of the compound to biodegradation in anaerobic conditions and the strong tendencies of some of its main metabolites present in relatively high concentrations in sewage sludge to return to the parent compound during anaerobic digestion 14 25 26 as can be seen from the fig 2 the seasonal behavior of cla in the anaerobic digester has been determined to be rather inconsistent while treated with a removal rate of 92 in the winter season in the anaerobic digester the removal efficiency of cla in the summer season was determined as about 160 in addition to these removal performances of the anaerobic digester did not exceed 25 for cla in the other two seasons therefore it can be said that cla is more likely to be eliminated to some extent in an anaerobic digester similar to our study studies are showing that cla is partially biodegraded in the anaerobic digesters 29 51 including the relatively high negative removal efficiency obtained for cla in the summer season in the annual average will result in the calculation of the yearly removal average for cla as negative and will result in misinterpretation of the behavior of the cla in the anaerobic digester excluding the extreme negative removal efficiency the seasonal average removal rate of cla in the anaerobic digester was found to be approximately 43 narumiya et al 29 reported similar removals of around 50 in real scale anaerobic digesters for cla in a study conducted in 4 different wwtps in japan zeng et al 51 have revealed that cla was partially biodegraded during the anaerobic digester and accordingly converted to oleandomycin and 5 o desosaminyl 6 o methylerythronolide metabolites which have much lower antimicrobial activity compared to the parent compound similarly alenzi et al 26 have supported the partial biodegradation of cla in the anaerobic digester and claimed that anaerobic microorganisms are more effective in the removal of cla than aerobic microorganisms azi was the only compound that was treated with high removal efficiencies from 69 7 to 98 9 by showing uniform behavior in all seasons in the anaerobic digester the seasonal average removal efficiency of azi in the anaerobic digester was determined higher than 90 this indicates that azi can be biodegraded and or biologically transformed to its metabolites under anaerobic conditions 14 52 the very high removal efficiencies obtained for azi within the scope of the study revealed that the azi compound is readily degraded in anaerobic digesters and unlike other compounds in the antibiotic group is not affected by the seasons similarly aziz et al 53 stated that the dominant removal mechanism of azi in the anaerobic digestion process was biodegradation zhang and li 31 reported that approximately 80 of azi was treated in the anaerobic digester in their lab scale study in addition gonzález pleiter et al 54 have supported the high removal efficiencies for these compounds in the anaerobic digesters by emphasizing the possibility that antibiotics such as azi and cla are more likely to pass from the solid phase into the aqueous phase 3 2 occurrence and removal of nsaids in anaerobic digester in the study 4 parent compounds and 6 metabolites from the group of nsaids were investigated in sewage sludges of the studied wwtp four parent compounds paracetamol par diclofenac dcf ibuprofen ibu and naproxen nap were determined both in thickened and digested sludge besides one of the metabolites of ibu 2 hydroxyibuprofen 2 hydroxy ibu was also quantified concentrations of other investigated nsaids two metabolites of dcf 4 hydroxydiclofenac and 5 hydroxydiclofenac two metabolites of ibu 1 hydroxyibuprofen and carboxyibuprofen and metabolite of nap s o desmethyl naproxen have been found below 0 1 μg kg seasonal occurrences of determined nsaids par dcf ibu 2 hydroxy ibu and nap both in thickened and digested sludge are given in fig 3 as is shown in fig 3 concentration values in thickened sludge for par dcf ibu 2 hydroxy ibu and nap were found in the range of 0 32 9 78 μg kg 1 47 6 95 μg kg 0 1 0 22 μg kg 1 32 4 79 μg kg and 2 82 35 71 μg kg respectively maximum concentrations in digested sludge were determined up to 3 10 μg kg for par 6 16 μg kg for dcf 0 75 μg kg for ibu 11 74 μg kg for 2 hydroxy ibu and 5 67 μg kg for nap the detection frequency 50 of the group of nsaids was found higher than the group of antibiotics 27 based on the number of investigated compounds the highest concentrations of investigated nsaids in thickened sludge were determined in the winter season similar to antibiotics one of the important reasons for this situation is the frequent consumption of these pharmaceuticals as a result of seen many human related diseases especially in the winter season 2 apart from the high tendency of these compounds to sorption onto sludge 55 in a study performed with 10 different wwtps in spain the highest sludge concentrations for par 21 5 μg kg and ibu 99 1 μg kg were determined in primary sludge while for dcf 35 3 μg kg and nap 37 2 μg kg in secondary sludge 44 verlicchi and zambello 14 reported in their review study that ibu par nap and dcf were detected in anaerobically digested sludge up to about 2000 500 400 and 300 μg kg respectively as can be seen in fig 3c and d the mean thickened sludge concentration of 2 hydroxy ibu 2 94 μg kg was determined as 21 times its parent compound ibu 0 14 μg kg moreover 2 hydroxy ibu was detected seasonally in thickened and digested sludge up to 35 and 48 times more than ibu similar to our results luis malvar et al 25 have reported that 2 hydroxy ibu passes into the sewage sludge more than ibu the fact that there is such a big difference between the parent compound and its metabolite reveals that the sorption onto the sludge potential of the metabolites can be quite different compared to the parent compounds besides the seasonal relationships of ibu and 2 hydroxy ibu both in thickened and digested sludge in terms of detected concentrations were determined as highly significant p 0 001 and significant p 0 029 respectively these results also indicate how important it is to monitor metabolites along with the parent compounds in the use of sewage sludge as soil amendment as can be calculated from fig 3 par and nap compounds were treated seasonally in the anaerobic digesters with removal efficiencies ranging from 68 3 to 95 1 and 38 6 to 84 1 respectively on an annual average while par was highly eliminated 79 nap was moderately 58 treated the determination of high removal rates for par in the anaerobic digester in all seasons indicates that par was readily biodegraded in sewage sludge as well as in wastewater 28 phan et al 56 reported 83 removal for par with a pilot scale anaerobic digester operated under mesophilic conditions narumiya et al 29 in a study performed with real scale anaerobic digesters present in different wwtps have determined over the 80 removal for the par the results of these studies are in good agreement with our results in a real scale wwtp in greece removal efficiencies of 80 for nap have been determined in an anaerobic digester operated under mesophilic conditions 30 carballa et al 15 reported in their lab scale study that nap removal was not much affected by changing srt values and was generally treated above 85 in the anaerobic digester in our study the removal efficiency achieved for nap of over 84 in winter was found to be quite consistent with these studies while the calculated annual average removal efficiency of 58 for nap was found to be slightly below the general average contrary to par and nap dcf exhibited quite divergent behaviors in the anaerobic digester based on the different seasons as can be seen in fig 3 dcf could not be eliminated sufficiently in the anaerobic sludge digester treatment rates were lower than 30 for dcf in two seasons but considerable negative removal efficiencies of up to 120 were determined in the other two seasons the low removal efficiencies obtained for dcf demonstrate that this compound exhibits high resistance to biodegradation in the anaerobic conditions 25 nas et al 2 reported that the removal efficiencies obtained for dcf in a real scale anaerobic digester were 15 narumiya et al 29 reported that dcf removals were well below 50 in a study performed with real scale anaerobic digesters the relatively lower removals achieved for dcf in anaerobic digestion can be explained by occurring the very limited removal mechanisms of biodegradation biotransformation in the sewage sludge mainly associated with the presence of chlorine atoms in its molecular structure which makes dcf more recalcitrant 57 in the anaerobic digester removal efficiencies were calculated for ibu only in two seasons while removal efficiencies were calculated for 2 hydroxy ibu in all seasons in both two seasons very serious negative removal efficiencies of up to 241 were determined for ibu since quite different removal efficiencies have been reported in the literature the treatment of ibu under anaerobic conditions is considered a controversial issue the majority of the studies reported positive removal efficiencies for ibu in anaerobic digesters albeit at different rates 58 59 carballa et al 15 determined in their pilot scale study that the removal efficiency of ibu in the anaerobic digester 41 15 decreased with increasing srt values moreover samaras et al 30 reported treatment efficiencies exceeding 80 for ibu in real scale anaerobic digester the negative removal efficiencies exceeding 200 for ibu in our study differ considerably compared to the literature much like the parent compound ibu removal efficiencies of the 2 hydroxy ibu in anaerobic digester were also found as negative up to 261 except in the winter season however the annual average removal efficiency obtained for the 2 hydroxy ibu 112 2 in the anaerobic digester was determined to be approximately half that obtained for ibu 227 6 there are very few studies in the literature reporting negative removal efficiencies for ibu in the anaerobic digestion processes ahmad et al 27 reported a negative removal efficiency of 62 for ibu in a pilot scale anaerobic digester operated with 18 days of hrt using the mixed sludge gonzalez salgado et al 60 stated that 2 hydroxy ibu was found in higher concentration than ibu in the primary sludge and negative removal efficiencies were obtained for both compounds in the pilot scale mesophilic anaerobic digester it has been also determined in the same study that higher negative removal efficiencies up to 30 were obtained for ibu compared to 2 hydroxy ibu this study shows serious similarities to our study in terms of detecting 2 hydroxy ibu in sewage sludge at a higher concentration than ibu and determining higher negative removal for ibu in anaerobic digestion compared to 2 hydroxy ibu 3 3 occurrence and removal of anticonvulsants in anaerobic digester in this study 6 pharmaceutical compounds consisting of 2 parent compounds and 4 metabolites from the group of anticonvulsants were investigated both in thickened and digested sludge while carbamazepine cbz and its two metabolites carbamazepine diol cbz diol and 3 hydroxy carbamazepine 3 hydroxy cbz were determined quantitatively in sewage sludge the other two investigated metabolites of cbz carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide and 2 hydroxy carbamazepine were found lower than loq value primidone prm on the other hand was detected in the digested sludge only in one season above the 0 1 μg kg occurrence concentrations of determined anticonvulsants cbz cbz diol 3 hydroxy cbz and prm in sewage sludges are given seasonally in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 concentrations of cbz and its two metabolites cbz diol and 3 hydroxy cbz were determined in thickened sludge in the range of 1 75 2 53 μg kg 1 15 15 55 μg kg and 0 1 0 23 μg kg respectively concentrations of them in the digested sludge were found up to 6 49 18 89 and 1 47 μg kg respectively thus there were considerable concentration increases in digested sludge for cbz and its metabolites moreover much higher concentration values were detected in the digested sludge in the spring season for all compounds in the anticonvulsant group compared to other seasons this situation can be explained by the fact that the percentage of volatile solids reduction vsr in the anaerobic digester in spring 26 was determined much lower than in the other seasons up to 49 nas et al 2 reported concentration values ranging from 0 20 to 2 08 μg kg for the concentrations of cbz in digested sludge in a 12 month study conducted in a real scale wwtp in another study conducted in different wwtps by narumiya et al 29 while the cbz concentrations in thickened sludge were determined up to 5 μg kg concentrations of cbz in digested sludge were detected up to 11 μg kg which confirms the concentration increases for cbz after anaerobic treatment very similar to the detected cbz concentrations 3 14 6 49 μg kg in anaerobically digested sludge in our study concentration values ranging from 6 7 to 9 3 μg kg were reported for cbz in anaerobically digested sludge in another study 61 besides verlicchi and zambello 14 have reported concentration values up to around 900 μg kg for cbz in anaerobically digested sludge in their review study as can be seen from fig 4 it has been determined that the metabolites of cbz behaved quite differently than the parent compound while the mean concentrations of cbz cbz diol and 3 hydroxy cbz in thickened sludge were determined as 2 21 6 91 and 0 16 μg kg respectively in digested sludge were calculated as 4 28 11 23 and 0 73 μg kg the seasonal average concentrations of cbz diol were found to be 3 1 and 2 6 times cbz for the thickened and digested sewage sludge respectively however the annual mean concentrations of 3 hydroxy cbz were determined as approximately 7 and 17 of the concentrations of cbz in thickened and digested sludge respectively seasonal concentrations of cbz diol in thickened and digested sludge were determined up to 68 and 28 times the 3 hydroxy cbz respectively therefore it has been revealed that the potential of sorption onto sewage sludge of the parent compound and its metabolites which affect directly the total removal efficiencies of these compounds in wwtps could be quite different from each other apart from all these seasonal correlations between cbz and its metabolites or only between investigated metabolites were found as significant p 0 05 or highly significant p 0 01 in terms of detected concentrations based on the type of sewage sludge table s6 as seen in fig 4 none of the phacs in the group of anticonvulsants could be treated in the anaerobic digester on the contrary very serious negative removal efficiencies were determined annual mean removal efficiencies of cbz cbz diol and 3 hydroxy cbz in the anaerobic digester were determined as about 92 249 and 393 it is quite remarkable that both of the metabolites were treated with much higher negative removal efficiencies up to 740 than the cbz these results have revealed that the metabolites of cbz cannot be eliminated under anaerobic conditions like the parent compound both the relatively high polarity of cbz and the lack of specific interaction sites make the cbz compound extraordinarily persistent making it very difficult to remove under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions 39 in our study increasing concentrations of metabolites after anaerobic treatment revealed that metabolites of cbz can be converted to each other as well as to the parent compound during anaerobic digestion by conversion reactions some studies have reported that cbz and its metabolites can interconvert during the anaerobic digestion process supporting our study results 62 63 nas et al 2 reported nearly 95 removal efficiency for cbz in a study with a real scale anaerobic digester similarly in a real scale study performed by narumiya et al 29 negative removal efficiencies have been determined for cbz in anaerobic digesters however the lab scale study performed by ahmad et al 27 reported positive removal efficiencies up to 67 for cbz in anaerobic digestion depending on the applied different treatment configurations similar to our results miao et al 64 have reported that the concentrations of cbz and its metabolites in treated biosolids in a wwtp in which an anaerobic digestion process was applied increased compared to raw biosolids based on the concentrations in the biosolid in the same study the removal efficiencies for the parent compound cbz and its metabolites 2 hydroxy cbz 3 hydroxy cbz and cbz diol were calculated as about 271 79 169 and 105 respectively for the other investigated anticonvulsant compound prm in our study the removal efficiency was calculated only in the spring season and found to be 340 yang et al 28 have revealed that increasing negative removal efficiencies in anaerobic sludge digester were obtained for prm with increasing srt values in their lab scale study in the same study the concentrations of the prm which were determined up to approximately 50 μg kg in the primary sludge were detected up to about 100 μg kg in the digested sludge similar to our results zheng et al 65 have also reported that both prm and cbz were not biodegraded in the anaerobic digester in a lab scale study 3 4 occurrence and removal of nerve stimulants in anaerobic digester in this study 2 parent compounds and 2 metabolites from the group of nerve stimulants were investigated both in thickened and digested sludge while caffeine caf nicotine nct and one metabolite of nct trans 3 hydroxy cotinine trans 3 hydroxy cot were determined in sewage sludge seasonally concentrations of the other investigated metabolite of nct n formylnornicotine were always found lower than 0 1 μg kg thus the detection frequency of the group of nerve stimulants in sewage sludge was calculated as 75 fig 5 shows the seasonal occurrence concentrations of nerve stimulants caf nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot in sewage sludges as given in fig 5 while the concentrations of caf nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot in thickened sludge were determined up to 23 74 3 37 and 0 40 μg kg respectively concentrations of them in digested sludge were found at lower levels up to 18 92 0 1 and 0 14 μg kg this indicates that in contrast to anticonvulsants nerve stimulant concentrations were significantly lower in digested sludge compared to thickened sludge relatively higher concentrations of caf in sewage sludge compared to nct and its metabolite can be associated with quite higher concentrations of caf in raw wastewater as a result of excessive consumption of products containing caf like tea coffee cola chocolate and some energy drinks therefore the reported concentration values for caf in sewage sludge may differ significantly depending on the consumption habits of people living in different regions for example luis malvar et al 25 have determined the caf concentrations in anaerobically digested dehydrated sludge up to 41 4 μg kg while mejías et al 55 have reported up to 2828 μg kg concentration values for caf in digested sludge apart from these yang et al 28 have reported increasing concentration values of caf nearly up to 200 μg kg in digested sludge directly proportional to increased srt values 15 20 and 30 days in their lab scale study indicating the key role of the srt parameter the annual mean concentration of nct 1 66 μg kg in the thickened sludge was found as nearly eight times its metabolite trans 3 hydroxy cot 0 21 μg kg thus it has been determined that the metabolite of nct can be found in thickened sludge together with nct although not at concentrations as high as the parent compound however no significant correlation p 0 05 could be established between nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot in terms of seasonal concentrations detected in either thickened or digested sludge the number of studies showing the concentration levels of nct and its metabolites in sewage sludges together and associating them with each other is negligible in the study conducted with 2 different urban wwtps in spain nct concentrations in sewage sludge were reported to vary between 23 and 173 μg kg 66 petrie et al 67 reported the nct concentrations in the range of 139 26 4 μg kg in digested sludge treated in the anaerobic digestion plant which was operated under mesophilic conditions although a maximum concentration value of 3 37 μg kg was determined for nct in thickened sludge in our study the relatively higher concentration values obtained in sewage sludges for nct in other studies may be mainly associated with high tobacco consumption in the different regions as shown in fig 5 nerve stimulants were treated in anaerobic digesters positively in all seasons seasonal removal efficiencies for caf in the anaerobic digester ranged from 13 1 in winter to 87 8 in autumn in general caf has shown resistance to anaerobic degradation except for one season similarly luis malvar et al 25 have reported that the persistence of caf under anaerobic conditions was higher than under aerobic conditions however the achieved annual average removal efficiency for caf 35 7 remains at lower levels in our study compared to the majority of the other studies found in the literature for example narumiya et al 29 determined higher than 90 removal efficiencies for caf in the real scale anaerobic digesters yang et al 28 in their lab scale study have also reported that the removal efficiency for caf obtained in the anaerobic digester was similar to the quite higher removal efficiency obtained for caf in the aqueous phase azizan et al 24 have explained the achieved relatively higher removals for caf in the anaerobic digestion mainly by the enhanced biotransformation mechanism which occurred under the predominant methanogenic and sulphate reducing conditions as can be seen in fig 5 nct was treated above 96 in both seasons winter and autumn although trans 3 hydroxy cot was also eliminated in the anaerobic digester obtained removal efficiencies were determined as lower compared to nct in the context of bi seasonal data obtained for both compounds the average removal efficiencies for nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot obtained in the anaerobic digester were calculated as higher than 96 and 57 respectively therefore it can be said that nct and its metabolites can be eliminated simultaneously under anaerobic conditions there are also some studies showing that the behavior patterns of the nct and trans 3 hydroxy cot in wwtps are compatible with each other 68 69 however there is a serious lack of information in the literature about explaining the fate of nct and its metabolites simultaneously in real scale anaerobic digesters therefore further studies are needed to understand the behaviors of nct and its metabolites under anaerobic conditions 3 5 occurrence and removal of steroid hormones in anaerobic digester in the scope of this study 4 parent compounds and 2 metabolites from the group of steroid hormones were investigated in sewage sludges among the investigated six phacs only two parent compounds testosterone tes and progesterone prg were detected either in thickened or digested sludge seasonally the concentration values of the remaining 2 parent compounds 17β estradiol e2 and 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 and 2 metabolites estrone e1 and estriol e3 were found below 0 1 μg kg these results are consistent with the fact that the log kd values determined for both tes 5 18 70 and prg 6 62 71 compounds are much higher than the log kd values determined for e2 2 56 ee2 2 46 e1 2 45 72 and e3 2 67 73 compounds table s1 seasonal occurrence concentrations of determined steroid hormones tes and prg both in thickened and digested sewage sludges are given in fig 6 as given in fig 6 while the concentrations of prg in thickened sludge were found always below 0 1 μg kg in all seasons tes concentrations were determined only one season with a concentration value of 0 28 μg kg therefore it can be said that detected concentrations of steroid hormones in thickened sludge were determined as lower levels compared to other pharmaceutical subgroups this situation can be associated with very low concentrations of them in raw wastewater in general 2 however both tes and prg were determined in digested sludge in spring and summer seasons up to 0 26 and 0 71 μg kg respectively martín et al 74 have reported concentrations ranging from 4 95 to 836 μg kg for various pharmaceutical compounds in the group of steroid hormones in digested sludges in different wwtps verlicchi and zambello 14 have reported concentration values up to about 100 μg kg in anaerobically digested sludges for prg wu et al 75 determined concentration values of 10 ng g loq 1 2 1 4 ng g and 100 ng g for e1 e2 e3 and prg compounds respectively in sewage sludges of four different wwtps in general it can be said that although detected at quite lower concentrations in raw wastewater compared to other pharmaceutical therapeutic subgroups steroid hormones can be detected in different types of sewage sludges this situation can be explained by the high tendency to accumulate in sewage sludges depending on both the hydrophobic nature and low volatility of the steroid hormones 76 removal performances of the anaerobic digester both for tes and prg were determined in the spring and summer seasons as shown in fig 6 sludge concentrations of tes after the anaerobic digestion were not changed markedly in the anaerobic digester one positive 7 1 and one negative 30 removal efficiency were determined for tes during the two seasons and the average removal efficiency was calculated as about 11 4 however very serious negative removal efficiencies were determined for prg in the same seasons removal efficiencies of approximately 610 and 110 were calculated for prg in the spring and summer seasons respectively it is a quite striking result that the prg concentrations increased approximately 7 times after being treated in the anaerobic sludge digester on a seasonal basis negative removals of prg can be explained by either conversion reactions of metabolites to parent compounds or transformation of one parent compound into another 77 up to now quite contradictory results have been reported for the removal of steroid hormones in anaerobic digestion due to the still not fully understood behaviors of steroid hormone conjugates during sludge treatment in the lab scale study of paterakis et al 78 removal efficiencies ranging from 4 to 79 have been determined in the anaerobic digester for e1 e3 and ee2 while negative removal efficiencies of up to 325 for e2 have been reported gonzalez gil et al 59 reported in their lab scale study that e1 and e2 were not treated at all in the anaerobic digester but ee2 was eliminated about up to 75 contrary to this study nas et al 2 reported that ee2 showed greater resistance to biodegradation in the anaerobic digester compared to e2 besides some studies have suggested that operating conditions of the anaerobic digesters such as temperature and srt do not affect the removal of steroid hormones much 14 79 nevertheless although there are many studies investigating e1 e2 e3 and ee2 in anaerobic digesters in the literature there is no study on the subject of the fate of tes and prg compounds in real scale anaerobic digesters 3 6 occurrence and removal of antidepressants in anaerobic digester in the study 1 parent compound fluoxetine flx belonging to the group of antidepressants was investigated in two types of sewage sludge of the studied wwtp seasonal occurrence concentrations of flx are given in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 while the concentrations of flx in thickened sludge were determined 0 1 μg kg in all seasons its concentrations in digested sludge were detected in the range of 0 31 and 5 11 μg kg the annual mean concentration of flx was found as 1 83 μg kg in digested sludge suanon et al 80 have reported flx concentrations in the range of 11 2 and 39 3 μg kg in digested sludge in their lab scale and single state anaerobic digester systems in another study petrie et al 67 determined concentration values of 139 26 4 μg kg in digested sludges for flx in an anaerobic digestion plant that was operated under mesophilic conditions ferhi et al 81 have determined flx concentrations as 105 12 μg kg in digested sludges in the study performed in urban wwtp in general flx concentrations detected in the digested sludges in studies found in the literature were found to be quite high compared to our study results considering that the log kd value of flx 3 78 is higher than many phacs investigated in this study table s1 the most likely reason for this situation can be considered as the quite low flx consumption by people in the city of konya as can be seen from fig 7 unbelievable negative removal efficiencies were achieved for flx in the anaerobic digester flx concentrations increased significantly in all seasons after the anaerobic digestion for this reason negative removal efficiencies ranging from 210 in autumn to 5100 in spring were obtained for flx similar to the compounds in the anticonvulsant group the highest negative removal efficiency for flx was detected in the spring season which can be explained by the fact that the determined percentage of vsr 26 in anaerobic digesters was much lower in this season compared to other seasons negative removals obtained for flx can be explained by the release of free parent compound flx from the conjugated forms during the anaerobic sludge treatment 82 in addition both quite resistant structure to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions together with high sludge affinity due to the hydrophobic nature of flx can be considered as the other effective parameters in making sense of these negative removals 26 71 suanon et al 80 have determined negative removal efficiencies for flx in all three different anaerobic digesters operated under different conditions in their lab scale study using domestic sewage sludge similarly alenzi et al 26 have reported negative removal efficiencies for flx in lab scale anaerobic digesters in which synthetic sewage sludges were used therefore negative removal efficiencies for flx have been obtained in anaerobic digesters regardless of whether the sewage sludge used was real or synthetic in the lab scale studies besides there are also studies showing that flx is either not degraded at all or negligibly degraded in anaerobic digesters 28 58 however unlike these studies gonzalez gil et al 59 have claimed that flx was eliminated between 50 and 75 in the anaerobic digester 3 7 other investigated pharmaceutical subgroups in this study apart from the 6 pharmaceutical subgroups explained in detail above 4 different therapeutic subgroups have been also investigated in sewage sludges of the studied wwtp the concentration values of all investigated phacs belonging to these subgroups anticancer drugs lipid regulators receptor antagonists and antiseptics in both thickened and digested sewage sludge were determined below the loq value in all seasons stated in other words concentrations of tamoxifen ifosfamide cyclophosphamide anticancer drugs gemfibrozil clofibric acid lipid regulators cimetidine receptor antagonist and triclosan antiseptic were detected below the 0 1 μg kg therefore the fate of these phacs in full scale anaerobic sludge digesters could not be evaluated 3 8 comparison of the investigated pharmaceutical subgroups in terms of seasonal occurrence concentrations and removals seasonal variations in the total pharmaceutical concentrations consisting of six different therapeutic groups both in thickened and digested sludge are provided in fig 8 total pharmaceutical concentration 178 μg kg calculated in the thickened sewage sludge was determined by far the highest in the winter season while the season in which the total pharmaceutical concentration was determined at the highest level in the thickened sludge after the winter season was spring 73 5 μg kg the total pharmaceutical concentration detected in the thickened sludge in the summer and autumn seasons was found to be almost the same levels 21 5 μg kg as can be easily seen from fig 8 the determination of the highest level of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the thickened sewage sludge in winter compared to other seasons especially arises from the phacs belonging to the antibiotic and nsaid groups because about 42 9 76 16 μg kg and 32 3 24 18 μg kg of the total pharmaceutical concentration determined in thickened sludge in winter derives from antibiotic and nsaid groups respectively due to the gradual decrease in antibiotic consumption from winter to autumn the percentage of representation of antibiotics in total pharmaceutical concentrations in thickened sludge sharply decreased to 3 1 0 66 μg kg in the autumn season in this context it has been determined that the group in which the seasonal effect was most clearly seen in terms of the reflection of drug use on the concentration of sewage sludge is antibiotics even so considering the annual average the group of antibiotics has been determined as the group with the highest ratio with a concentration value of 26 38 μg kg in thickened sludge constituting 35 9 of the total pharmaceutical concentration the percentages of the nsaid group in the total pharmaceutical concentration in the thickened sludge varied between 18 3 in spring and 33 3 in autumn seasonally in addition the nsaid group constituted 30 3 of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the thickened sludge in the summer season and ranked first on an annual average the group of nsaids with 28 7 21 1 μg kg was found as the second most detected group in thickened sludge after antibiotics the seasons in which nerve stimulants were detected with the highest concentration in thickened sludge were winter and spring with a similar concentration value 25 μg kg although detected with relatively lower concentrations in the summer 5 40 μg kg and autumn 9 94 μg kg seasons the group of nerve stimulants constitutes 25 6 and 46 of the total pharmaceutical concentration in the thickened sludge in these seasons respectively nerve stimulants were determined at an annual average level of 16 24 μg kg in thickened sludge and constituted 22 1 of the total annual average pharmaceutical concentration another pharmaceutical group that was regularly detected in thickened sludge in all seasons is anticonvulsants anticonvulsants were calculated seasonally in the thickened sludge with a concentration range of 3 52 in autumn and 18 41 μg kg in winter anticonvulsants determined at an annual average value of 9 38 μg kg in thickened sludge constitute 12 8 of the annual average concentration of total pharmaceuticals however percentages of other investigated groups steroid hormones and antidepressants in total pharmaceutical concentration in thickened sludge were not exceeded 1 and 0 5 respectively in any season as shown in fig 9 the percentages of the pharmaceutical subgroups detected in the digested sludge after being treated in the anaerobic digesters in the total pharmaceutical concentration varied considerably the changes in the percentages based on annual average concentrations of different pharmaceutical subgroups in the total pharmaceutical concentration in the sewage sludge before and after anaerobic treatment are given in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 the group with the largest share in the total pharmaceutical concentration in the digested sludge was determined as anticonvulsants with a percentage of 31 3 the total anticonvulsant concentration in digested sludge was determined up to 27 29 μg kg in spring seasonally the group of nsaids was found to have the highest share after anticonvulsants in terms of total pharmaceutical concentration determined in digested sludge the percentage of nsaids which were detected seasonally between 6 97 and 19 50 μg kg in digested sludge in the total pharmaceutical concentration on an annual average was determined as 24 2 the annual average percentages of the groups of nerve stimulants 1 03 19 16 μg kg and antibiotics 0 93 17 47 μg kg in the digested sludge were found to be very close to each other as 20 5 and 19 7 respectively in addition the percentages of total concentrations of steroid hormones from 0 35 to 0 8 and antidepressants from 0 15 to 3 5 in the digested sludge increased compared to the thickened sludge as an annual average the highest total concentration values in digested sludge for both steroid hormones 0 97 μg kg and antidepressants 5 11 μg kg were determined in the spring season the treatment performances of full scale anaerobic digesters for different pharmaceutical subgroups were calculated according to the annual average mass balance of the pharmaceutical subgroups fig 10 in this context the most treated subgroups in the anaerobic digesters were determined as antibiotics 60 8 nsaids 39 7 and nerve stimulants 33 7 respectively however negative removal efficiencies were achieved for the groups of anticonvulsants 75 1 steroid hormones 74 5 and antidepressants 1730 0 according to the seasonal mass balance the best removal efficiencies for the groups of antibiotics nsaids and anticonvulsants in the anaerobic digesters were obtained in the winter season with removal rates of 82 9 70 9 and 32 8 respectively however the best removal efficiencies for the groups of nerve stimulants 89 6 and antidepressants 210 have been determined in the autumn season therefore it has been revealed that the best removal efficiencies in anaerobic digesters were obtained in cold seasons for the investigated pharmaceutical subgroups based on the calculated total mass balance seasonally the best removal efficiency in the anaerobic digester was obtained in winter 65 and the worst removal efficiency in summer 78 besides negative removal was calculated in the spring in the anaerobic digester albeit at a low level 20 8 while the removal was only 0 4 in the autumn indicating no change therefore it has been determined that the total pharmaceutical treatment performances of anaerobic digesters vary significantly according to the seasons besides as can be seen in fig 10 the total pharmaceutical treatment performance of anaerobic digesters was determined as 28 5 according to the calculation of the annual average mass balance of all pharmaceutical subgroups therefore it has been determined that full scale anaerobic digesters treat total phacs poorly and were not very effective 4 conclusions the release of many phacs into the natural environment especially through the application of sewage sludge in agricultural activities is of great concern therefore the anaerobic digestion process a broadly applied technology in wwtps attracts serious attention in determining its potential to eliminate these phacs of the 45 compounds investigated the seasonal occurrence and fate of detected 18 phacs from 6 different pharmaceutical subgroups have been evaluated comparatively in the full scale anaerobic digesters total pharmaceutical concentrations determined in the thickened sludge ranged from about 21 1 in summer to 177 6 μg kg in winter this significant difference is due to the fact that especially antibiotics and nsaids are consumed much higher during the winter season it has been determined that the treatment performances of full scale anaerobic digesters can vary significantly seasonally both on the basis of individual pharmaceutical compounds and subgroups although varies seasonally the groups of antibiotics 60 8 nsaids 39 7 and nerve stimulants 33 7 have been treated from poorly to moderately in anaerobic digesters yearly it s one of the important findings that the nerve stimulants group has been determined as the only group that was treated as positively 18 1 89 6 in all seasons however negative removal efficiencies were achieved for all investigated phacs in the groups of anticonvulsants steroid hormones and antidepressants regardless of the seasons flx has been determined as the compound whose concentration increased most markedly in anaerobically digested sludge compared to other phacs although they were detected in quite different concentrations in sewage sludges the removal patterns of parent compounds and metabolites in anaerobic digesters were found to be very similar in addition significant correlations p 0 05 have been determined between each other for the majority of the parent compounds and metabolites within the scope of statistical analyses while the best treatment performance of anaerobic digesters in terms of the total concentration of phacs was determined in the winter season 65 worst was in the summer season 78 in this context the yearly treatment performance of anaerobic digesters for total phacs remained below 30 hence it is determined that applying the anaerobic digestion process alone to stabilize sewage sludges to be used in real scale agronomic practices is unsatisfactory in terms of eliminating pharmaceuticals from sewage sludges therefore it will be more reliable

12629,due to their high toxicity even a small amount of phenols entering the surrounding aquatic environment poses a serious danger to all living beings to address this important problem commercial micron sized h bn powder was ball milled at 450 600 and 750 rpm surface functionalized with hydroxyl and amino groups by sonication and characterized as a promising photocatalyst the samples were studied by x ray diffraction raman spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 11b nuclear magnetic resonance scanning and transmission electron microscopy diffuse reflectance ultraviolet visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy at all rates of mechanical processing without the use of auxiliary reagents exfoliation of h bn flakes was achieved an increase in the ball milling rate led to a decrease in crystallinity and structure refinement which was accompanied by the formation of a large number of dislocations and nanocrystallites 2 5 nm in size upon subsequent sonication the bn powder underwent partial oxidation and functionalization with o h groups the observed increase in the photocatalytic activity of ball milled h bn particles in the phenol oxidation reaction is explained by an increase in the 254 nm uv light absorption a decrease in the rate of electron hole recombination and an increase in the formation rate of oh radicals our results clearly

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the most important problems facing humanity today is water contamination an increase in industrial production capacity inevitably entails high risks of man made disasters among which emission of phenolic compounds are of great importance in addition oil exploration and refining always generates wastewater contaminated with various persistent organic pollutants which must be removed before they are released into the environment the study of pollution of oilfield water with various compounds showed that the total content of oil containing hydrocarbons and phenols is 152 363 mg l and 0 07 0 21 mg l respectively 1 an analysis of the spatiotemporal change in the water quality of nanxi river in different places over a long period of time showed that the water quality index of most samples taking into account various pollutants including phenol is medium low 2 the release of even a small amount of phenols into the aquatic environment can have a strong impact on all living beings due to their high toxicity chronic exposure to phenol can lead to lung liver kidney and vascular disease 3 in addition due to the high water solubility and chemical stability of phenolic compounds they can enter groundwater and cause long time adverse effects 4 adsorption absorption 5 6 filtration 7 8 reverse osmosis 9 10 and advanced oxidation processes 11 14 are used to reduce the amount of phenolic compounds in wastewater particular attention is paid to the photocatalytic phenol oxidation this is due to the high efficiency of the process low energy consumption the ability to use sunlight and the absence of the need for additional chemicals that can harm the environment to a greater extent than the removed phenol tio2 bcn spongin feo oh modified graphene silica and zeolites were studied in the phenol photooxidation reaction for example b doped g c3n4 coated with microporous tio2 removed up to 87 of phenol from an aqueous solution under visible light irradiation 15 the high activity was achieved due to the optimal rutile anatase ratio in tio2 as well as the low rate of electron hole recombination due to the synergism of the composite components fe phthalocyanine immobilization on the spongin surface ensured efficient removal of phenol in 1 h 16 feo oh graphene composites were activated with visible light to produce oh radicals active in phenol oxidation 17 hexagonal boron nitride h bn is a great interest for various photocatalytic applications this 2d material has excellent physicochemical properties such as high specific surface area thermal and chemical stability and is widely used in various environmental applications 18 19 hexagonal bn has been shown to be a suitable material for the facile synthesis of 2d 2d van der waals heterostructures 20 in addition its hydrophobic nature proved to be effective in adsorbing organic species from aqueous solutions which is beneficial for water purification technologies from organic pollutants 21 22 hexagonal boron nitride is a wide bandgap semiconductor whose electronic properties can be fine tuned through defect engineering 23 25 hexagonal bn has been successfully used for the photodegradation of perfluorooctanoic acid and organic dyes 18 however its wide bandgap limits its application since high energy light is needed to generate excitons most of the works related to the use of h bn in photocatalysis refer to composites in which bn reduces the rate of exciton recombination due to the formation of a heterojunction between the components 26 27 we have previously shown that the interface between oxygen doped mos2 and h bn can be used to achieve a photodegradation rate of organic dyes of 5 5 mmol g 1 h 1 28 however h bn has rarely been studied as a single phase photocatalyst it has recently been shown that crystal lattice defects make a significant contribution to the increase in the h bn photoactivity under 254 nm light irradiation 29 compared with the commercial tio2 photocatalyst the activity can be 2 4 times higher which opens up new possibilities for expanding photocatalytic applications of h bn it has been proven that mechanical activation is a simple and effective method for the synthesis and processing of materials 30 with this method lattice defects surface functional groups and metastable phases that are unattainable using classical wet chemical approaches can be created for example bismuth doped up to 30 mol yttrium orthoferrite was synthesized by high energy ball processing which showed its efficiency in the decomposition of organic dyes and the possibility of restoring properties in a magnetic field 31 an original approach to the preparation of activated carbon tio2 composites for use in photocatalytic water purification was proposed 32 effective caffeine photodegradation in water was achieved due to the homogeneous distribution of phases over the composite inorganic halide perovskites were reproducibly synthesized by mechanical processing and exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for co2 reduction 33 in this work for the first time to achieve high rates of phenol decomposition in an aqueous medium under the action of uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 we used a photocatalyst based on a single phase commercial h bn powder mechanically processed in a ball mill 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials micron size h bn powder plazmoterm russia was first annealed in vacuum at 1400 c for 4 h and then kept in an ar atmosphere until use phenol catechol benzoquinone hydroquinone and 30 aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution of analytical grade were used 2 2 h bn ball milling ball milling bm of the h bn was carried out on an emax machine retsch germany using yttrium stabilized zirconia ysz jars and 10 mm ysz balls 3 g of h bn and 24 balls balls h bn weight ratio was equal to 44 were placed in 2 jars and sealed under ar atmosphere in a glovebox with residual humidity and oxygen controlled below 150 ppm the samples were milled at 450 600 and 750 rpm for 8 h in a 5 min work 5 min pause mode after treatment the h bn powder was sonicated in water to functionalize their surface with hydroxyl and amino groups through the hydrolysis reaction 34 the resulting powder was washed with water by centrifugation and dried under ambient conditions as obtained samples were stored in an ar atmosphere depending on the processing mode the samples were designated as bn450 bn600 and bn750 2 3 samples characterization phase composition of the samples was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd on a difrey 402 diffractometer scientific instruments russia equipped with a position sensitive detector cr kα with a wavelength λ 2 2909 å was used as an x ray source the exposition was 300 s at each detector position the sample structure was studied by raman spectroscopy using a dxr raman microscope thermo scientific us a 532 nm laser was used as the excitation source the spectra were recorded in the range of 100 3500 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed to characterize chemical groups near the sample surface the analysis was performed on a vertex 70v spectrometer bruker germany in the attenuated total reflection mode in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 with 4 cm 1 resolution the average of 32 scans was used to obtain the corresponding spectra 11b magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy 11b mas nmr was performed on an avance ii nmr 400 wb spectrometer bruker at room temperature a magnetic field of 9 4 t and a frequency of 400 mhz the samples were placed in a 4 mm diameter zirconia rotor and spun at a magic angle in a 4 mm h х mas wvt probe at a frequency of 12 khz single pulse sequences were used in combination with high power proton decoupling the chemical shift was expressed relative to boron trifluoride diethyl etherate 0 ppm the relative content of various chemical groups was estimated by fitting the resulting signal with the sum of the pseudo voigt profile peaks x ray photoelectron spectra were obtained on a phi versaprobe iii instrument physical electronics us using an al kα source peak fitting was performed using the casaxps software after shirley type background subtraction the spectra were calibrated using the c1s peak at 284 8 ev hexagonal bn particle morphology was analyzed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy sem and tem the sem analysis was performed on a jsm f7600 microscope jeol japan operating at an accelerating voltage of 15 kv tem characterization was carried out using a technai osiris s tem instrument fei usa operating at 200 kv the band gap of the synthesized materials was determined from a tauc plot plotted from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy data in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectra drs uv vis the drs uv vis spectra were measured on a v750 spectrophotometer jasco japan in the wavelength of 200 800 nm with a resolution of 1 nm absorbance values were calculated using the kubelka munc equation the photoluminescence of h bn samples was measured on a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer agilent us with 208 nm excitation in the wavelength range from 216 to 400 nm 2 4 phenol photooxidation experiments to study the activity of ball milled h bn in phenol photooxidation reaction 10 mg of a sample was dispersed in 100 ml of a 1 mm aqueous phenol solution using a us bandelin sonopuls uw 2200 ultrasound disperser for 5 min the dispersion was placed on a magnetic stirrer and kept for 30 min in the dark to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium then 0 5 ml of a 30 aqueous h2o2 solution was added to the mixture and a 145 w uv lamp with a maximum intensity wavelength of 254 nm was turned on a short wavelength uv light source was used because at higher wavelengths the photon energy is insufficient to form excitons in bn selected 1 ml aliquots were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and analyzed on a uv mini 1240 spectrometer shimadzu japan in the wavelength of 200 500 nm experimental spectra were analyzed using a multicomponent approach 35 using reference solutions of phenol catechol benzoquinone hydroquinone formic acid and hydrogen peroxide chemical oxygen demand cod was used to estimate the total organic carbon remaining after photocatalysis which was determined in accordance with iso 8467 1993 standard to assess the possibility of reusing the photocatalyst repeated experiments were carried out 3 cycles in total the catalyst was regenerated by evaporating liquid from the suspension between cycles and fresh phenol solution was added to the flask 2 5 scavenger tests the nature of active species in the photooxidation of organophenol compounds was investigated by adding isopropyl alcohol ipa dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate na edta to determine oh e and h respectively the scavenger tests were carried out in the same mode as the experiments on phenol photooxidation before turning on the uv lamp 80 μl of ipa 71 μl of dmso or 336 mg of na edta were added to the solution the characterization of products was performed using uv vis spectrophotometry 2 6 oh radicals formation rate terephthalic acid tpa was used to evaluate the ability of h bn to generate hydroxyl radicals 36 10 mg of the sample was dispersed in 100 ml of a saturated aqueous tpa solution using sonication after the adsorption desorption equilibrium was reached after 30 min the uv lamp was turned on and solution probes were periodically taken using 0 22 μm filters probes were analyzed on a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer using 310 nm excitation and 350 500 nm emission wavelengths 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition of h bn samples analysis of the diffraction patterns of the samples shows that they consist only of the h bn phase fig 1a with characteristic peaks at bragg angles of 40 2 63 7 67 5 78 3 87 0 120 5 and 132 7 2θ degrees corresponding to diffraction from the 002 100 101 012 004 014 and 110 planes respectively crystallography open database card 9008997 37 in sample bn450 the intensity ratio of the 100 002 101 002 and 012 002 peaks increases in comparison with the initial h bn sample which can be explained by degradation of the layered structure 34 an increase in ball milling speed led to a broadening of the 002 peak the higher the speed the greater full width at half maximum fwhm and a shift of the 002 peak towards lower bragg angles fig 1d a rebound effect has previously been reported whereby an increase in internal pressure during ball milling results in a reduction in interplanar spacing 38 39 however the fwhm value of the 002 peak did not change which indicates a relatively high sample crystallinity namba et al 40 observed the appearance of a new broad maximum at a smaller bragg angle due to the formation of an amorphous phase thus it can be assumed that the shift of the 002 peak to smaller angles observed in our work accompanied by an increase in the fwhm value is associated with an increase in the interplanar spacing in the 002 direction a decrease in the crystallite size an increase in the number of defects and possible partial amorphization raman spectra fig 1c also confirm the presence of the h bn phase in the samples the only peak at 1366 cm 1 corresponds to the bn stretching vibration mode e2g 41 note that with an increase in the ball milling speed a decrease in the intensity of the peaks is observed with a simultaneous increase in the background intensity the decrease in the peak intensity can be explained by the enhancement of phonon scattering as a result of a decrease in crystallinity and an increase in the volume fraction of interfaces due to a decrease in the crystallite size 38 the appearance of a wide halo in raman spectrum of turbostratic bn films was attributed to a decrease in the interlayer interaction force 42 ftir spectra fig 1b are characterized by peaks corresponding to bn stretching 1330 cm 1 and out of plane bnb bending vibrations 770 cm 1 as the ball milling speed is increased the peaks become broadened and blue shifted which can be explained by an increase in the concentration of lattice defects 34 the shoulder at 1100 1200 cm 1 corresponds to bo vibration 43 which indicates partial oxidation of the samples surface the presence of oh functional groups is evidenced by a broad peak at 3000 3600 cm 1 note that the intensity of oh peaks is lower compared to other bn materials subjected to ball milling 44 45 this is because we did not use any solid or liquid additives in the ball milling process mechanical treatment was carried out in a protective ar atmosphere and the surface functionalization was performed by subsequent ultrasonic dispersion in water as a result functionalization with hydroxyl groups predominantly occurred on the material surface partial oxidation and functionalization of the h bn surface by o h groups after mechanical and ultrasonic treatments is also confirmed by nmr spectroscopy data fig 1e table 1 three peaks were observed in the spectra centered at 0 8 12 0 and 22 4 ppm corresponding to boron in a tetrahedral surroundings bo h groups trigonal boron in bno groups and trigonal boron in nbn groups respectively 40 46 analysis of the relative amount of these groups shows that at 450 rpm oxygen is mainly present in the h bn crystal lattice as a substitution atom bno groups an increase in the processing speed leads to an increase in the content of tetrahedrally coordinated boron which may be associated with the formation of boron oxides hydroxides either in the form of surface groups or as separate phase according to xps analysis the sample surfaces contain b n and o table 2 the results of xps analysis show that oxidation predominantly occurs at processing speeds above 600 rpm the b n ratio increases with increasing ball milling speed which indicates the formation of nitrogen depleted substoichiometric bnx x 1 the high resolution b1s spectra fig 1f were fitted using three components located at 190 4 191 1 and 192 7 ev and attributed to boron in bn bno and bo bonds respectively 47 fig 1g shows the high resolution n1s spectra of ball milled samples the spectra were deconvoluted using two components centered at 398 0 and 398 6 ev and assigned to nitrogen atom in bn and bno bonds respectively 48 note that after processing at a speed of 600 rpm a significant increase in the oxygen content and bo bonds is observed the difference in the number of bno and bo bonds calculated from xps and nmr data is associated with different depth of analysis while photoelectrons carry information from a thin surface layer the nmr signal is recorded from the entire volume of the sample 3 2 morphology of samples the initial h bn sample consists of flake like particles up to 10 μm long and 100 500 nm wide fig 2a e the high resolution tem image fig 2i confirms the hexagonal crystal structure with an interplanar spacing of 0 21 nm corresponding to the 100 plane and a characteristic angle of 120 between 100 and 010 directions after ball milling at 450 rpm the morphology of powders changed sample bn450 retained its micron particle size but individual particles have an accordion like structure fig 2b the formation of which can be explained by the exfoliation of 2d particles 49 50 during ball milling numerous thin sheets with a thickness of approximately 5 10 nm are formed fig 2f note that the crystal structure of individual sheets remain unchanged fig 2j the observed distances between lattice fringes agree well with the 002 d 0 34 nm and 100 d 0 21 nm planes of h bn a further increase in the rate of mechanical treatment leads to more noticeable changes in the microstructure of the samples the micron sized crystal structure of samples bn600 and bn750 becomes highly defective dislocations and subdomain grain boundaries are observed fig 2k also note that according to the hrtem images interplanar distances increased to 0 35 002 plane and 0 22 nm 100 plane being in a good agreement with the xrd results fig 2k l sample bn750 exhibits nanocrystallites ranging from 2 to 5 nm fig 2l curved and closed hexagonal bn planes are also observed on the particle surface 3 3 effect of ball milling on h bn microstructure based on the analysis of the obtained results the following conclusions can be drawn at a low processing speed sample bn450 weak van der waals bonds between the hexagonal bn planes break and the flakes sequentially peel off parallel to the 002 plane the microstructure of individual nanoplates is not disturbed in this case in previous works additional components such as sodium hypochlorite 51 cyclodextrin 44 or glutamic acid 45 were added to the grinding jars to achieve exfoliation of the h bn particles and ball milling without additives led to the formation of irregularly shaped particles 40 in our work bn exfoliation was achieved without additives which however requires careful optimization of processing parameters with an increase in the ball milling rate and accordingly the energy of the system covalent bonds begin to break which leads to the formation of misoriented crystallites with a high concentration of dislocations and subdomain boundaries at a sufficiently high energy 750 rpm a decrease in the degree of crystallinity an increase in the number of defects and possibly partial amorphization and a refinement of the structure formation of crystallites 2 5 nm in size are observed subsequent material exposure to air leads to its oxidation which is more pronounced for the sample processed at higher speed an increase in the oxygen content in the samples leads to a decrease in the intensity of the xps b1s and n1s peaks fig 1f g 3 4 optical properties of h bn samples drs uv vis spectra show that initial h bn sample absorbs light at a wavelength of 217 nm fig 3a as a result of ball milling an additional peak appears at about 240 nm the intensity of this peak increases as the ball milling speed is raised and at 750 rpm it becomes the only component the tauc plot for direct allowed transitions also shows these two components fig 3b the optical band gap values for these components are in the range of 5 3 5 5 ev and 4 1 4 5 ev respectively the shift in the h bn absorbance can be caused by various factors for example point defects such as vacancies at boron and nitrogen sites reduce the optical bandgap value 52 substitutional atoms with low electronegativity such as carbon 53 germanium 24 and phosphorous 25 exhibit a similar effect more electronegative substitution atoms such as oxygen have a more complex influence on the band structure of h bn the available literature data are rather contradictory sota et al 54 experimentally observed an increase in the bandgap from 5 3 to 5 9 ev with increasing oxygen content while xiao showed a nonlinear dependence decrease in the bandgap from 5 78 to 5 73 and then again increase up to 5 84 ev 23 in different theoretical works such contradictory results were explained by different positions of oxygen in the h bn lattice for example the presence of a substituting oxygen in the bno trigonal position leads to a decrease in the bandgap while the formation of obo domains in the bn honeycomb lattice can increase the bandgap 55 liu et al 56 conducted a theoretical study of adsorption at various substitution positions of oxygen atoms an increase in the bandgap was observed in the case of trioxide doped bn while other positions led to a decrease in the bandgap the oh and nh groups have been shown to reduce the bandgap to 4 2 ev 57 the bandgap value of amorphous bn is 4 5 ev which is 1 ev less than that of crystalline h bn 58 59 the bn samples studied in this work contain oxygen atoms in substitution positions oh groups and highly defective bn the amount of hydroxyl groups is small as evidenced by the low intensity of the corresponding ftir peak according to xps analysis the oxygen content reaches up to 17 at most of which is in the bno trigonal groups in addition sample bn750 contains a high concentration of crystal lattice defects thus the decrease in the bandgap is most likely due to the formation of bno groups and a highly defective phase during ball milling and subsequent sonication which effectively increases light absorption pl spectra are shown in fig 3c the pl spectrum of h bn usually has a complex structure due to various sub band transitions such as paired donor acceptor transitions and their replicas and excitons localized at defects 60 61 it can be seen that the intensity of photoluminescence decreases after processing in ball mill this implies a decrease in the rate of electron hole pair recombination which is favorable for photocatalytic activity 26 3 5 phenol photooxidation the phenol photooxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide strongly depends on the h bn ball milling rate fig 4 a rapid change in the phenol concentration occurs in the first 10 20 min after which the concentration remains almost unchanged for 100 min note that experiments without photocatalysts show little phenol oxidation in the presence of h2o2 fig s1 although the concentration of phenol is reduced by uv light the rate of change in concentration is slower than in experiments with photocatalysts the oxidation of phenol in the presence of both hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet light is more pronounced suggesting that the photolysis reaction also occurred when photocatalysts were used in the presence of sample bn450 the phenol concentration decreases to 250 μm while when using samples bn600 and bn750 the phenol concentration drops to zero the formation of intermediates in the phenol photooxidation also depends on the type of sample during the phenol photooxidation on sample bm450 a significant amount of quinones and catechols is formed the concentrations of benzoquinone and catechol increase rapidly during the first 10 min and then decrease to constant values while hydroquinone is formed throughout the experiment when testing sample bn600 the concentration of the intermediate is 2 3 times lower than for sample bm450 the formation of a significant amount of formic acid is also observed note that by the end of experiment there is almost no intermediate compounds dissolved in water sample bm750 proved to be the most active in phenol photooxidation the concentrations of intermediate compounds in this sample are lowest which indicates the predominant oxidation of phenol to co2 and water using this sample the cod value was significantly reduced from 189 3 to 2 3 mgo l the sample reusability was estimated using cycling photocatalytic oxidation experiments fig s2 it can be seen that photocatalyst bm750 showed no deactivation during 3 cycles phenol photooxidation usually proceeds through the formation of hydroxyl radicals as a result of the hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction with participation of an electron from the conduction band cb of the semiconductor reaction 1 or the photolysis reaction according to reaction 2 15 16 1 e cb h 2 o 2 oh oh 2 h 2 o 2 2 ho further reaction steps include the formation of an adduct with a hydroxyl radical or deprotonation of the oh phenol group accompanied by the formation of a water molecule 62 the formation of intermediate aromatic compounds such as quinones and catechol 16 17 ring opening to form light hydrocarbons such as formic acid and finally oxidation to carbon dioxide and water all intermediate complex molecules require oxidation by a hole formed as a result of the light absorption by a semiconductor 3 h vb oh c 6 h 5 oh co 2 h 2 o 3 6 active species tests to understand the mechanism of phenol photooxidation on samples after their mechanical treatment in a ball mill additional tests were carried out to determine the formation rate of hydroxyl radicals as well as in the presence of active species scavengers fig 5 it can be seen from the obtained results that the main active species are holes and electrons formed upon light absorption the efficiency of phenol photodegradation noticeably decreases in the presence of an electron absorber and in the absence of holes it drops to almost 0 while when using hydroxyl radical scavengers a drop of only 5 10 is observed since the phenol degradation rate depends on the active species generation rate which are simultaneously absorbed by scavengers it can be concluded that the exciton generation rate is the limiting process step note that the electron and hole absorption rates by scavengers are different and therefore they affect the phenol degradation rate in different ways hydroxyl radicals are formed so rapidly that the presence of scavenger only slightly affects the phenol oxidation rate note also that the formation of oh radicals is possible on ball milled samples and the rate of their formation increases with an increase in ball milling speed fig 5b 3 7 effect of ball milling on phenol photooxidation the following scheme was proposed for modifying the h bn structure depending on the ball milling rate and its effect on the photocatalytic activity in the phenol oxidation reaction fig 6 the lowest reaction rate is observed in the presence of an untreated h bn sample which is almost equal to the rate of phenol oxidation in presence of h2o2 and uv light this indicates that the initial h bn without mechanical processing is not a suitable photocatalyst and the reaction proceeds mainly through the formation of hydroxyl radicals according to reaction 2 as a result of low speed mechanical processing exfoliated flakes are formed with lateral dimensions comparable to the starting material and a high degree of crystallinity the number of defects and the degree of oxidation of this sample are small compared to other tested materials this structure does not have a strong effect on phenol photooxidation since hydroxyl radicals are practically not formed upon uv light absorption due to thermodynamic limitations and high rates of exciton recombination an increase in the rate of ball milling leads to an increase in the energy of the system and the formation of a highly defective structure with a significant number of bno groups and a reduced band gap this results in more efficient absorption of uv light and a redshift towards 254 nm the induced defects also lead to a lower exciton recombination rate providing active species for chemical transformation as a result a significantly higher phenol activity is observed on defective samples in addition the higher rate of oh radical generation makes it possible to use of these photocatalysts for the complete phenol mineralization since the intermediate products also require active radicals for oxidation at the maximum ball milling rate the bn crystallinity decreases this leads to a further decrease in the rate of electron hole pair recombination a decrease in the optical bandgap and as a consequence an increase in photocatalytic activity the phenol oxidation process proceeds through the formation of adducts with hydroxyl radicals the emission of hydrogen atom occurs as an intermediate step with the formation of quinones and catechol which are further oxidized to carbon dioxide the hydrogen atom is oxidized by a hole in the valence band of the semiconductor to form a proton that closes the overall catalytic cycle thus ball milling of commercial micro sized h bn powder proved to be an efficient approach to enhance its photocatalytic activity in the phenol oxidation reaction 4 conclusions commercial h bn powder ball milled at 450 600 and 750 rpm was characterized as a promising photocatalyst in the phenol photooxidation reaction in the presence of hydrogen peroxide the rate of phenol decomposition in an aqueous medium under the action of uv irradiation strongly depends on the ball milling rate mechanical processing leads to exfoliation of micron sized bn flakes with a thickness of 5 10 nm with an increase in the processing rate multiple defects are formed inside the bn particles and during further sonication the particles undergo partial oxidation and functionalization with o h groups these microstructure changes lead to an increase in the 254 nm uv light absorption and a decrease in the optical bandgap from 5 1 to 4 5 ev which in turn leads to a decrease in the recombination rate of electron hole pairs an increase in the formation rate of oh radicals and an increase in photocatalytic activity the sample processed at a rate of 750 rpm exhibits the highest activity in the phenol photooxidation at the lowest concentrations of intermediate compounds which indicates the predominant oxidation of phenol to co2 and water declaration of

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one of the most important problems facing humanity today is water contamination an increase in industrial production capacity inevitably entails high risks of man made disasters among which emission of phenolic compounds are of great importance in addition oil exploration and refining always generates wastewater contaminated with various persistent organic pollutants which must be removed before they are released into the environment the study of pollution of oilfield water with various compounds showed that the total content of oil containing hydrocarbons and phenols is 152 363 mg l and 0 07 0 21 mg l respectively 1 an analysis of the spatiotemporal change in the water quality of nanxi river in different places over a long period of time showed that the water quality index of most samples taking into account various pollutants including phenol is medium low 2 the release of even a small amount of phenols into the aquatic environment can have a strong impact on all living beings due to their high toxicity chronic exposure to phenol can lead to lung liver kidney and vascular disease 3 in addition due to the high water solubility and chemical stability of phenolic compounds they can enter groundwater and cause long time adverse effects 4 adsorption absorption 5 6 filtration 7 8 reverse osmosis 9 10 and advanced oxidation processes 11 14 are used to reduce the amount of phenolic compounds in wastewater particular attention is paid to the photocatalytic phenol oxidation this is due to the high

phenol from an aqueous solution under visible light irradiation 15 the high activity was achieved due to the optimal rutile anatase ratio in tio2 as well as the low rate of electron hole recombination due to the synergism of the composite components fe phthalocyanine immobilization on the spongin surface ensured efficient removal of phenol in 1 h 16 feo oh graphene composites were activated with visible light to produce oh radicals active in phenol oxidation 17 hexagonal boron nitride h bn is a great interest for various photocatalytic applications this 2d material has excellent physicochemical properties such as high specific surface area thermal and chemical stability and is widely used in various environmental applications 18 19 hexagonal bn has been shown to be a suitable material for the facile synthesis of 2d 2d van der waals heterostructures 20 in addition its hydrophobic nature proved to be effective in adsorbing organic species from aqueous solutions which is beneficial for water purification technologies from organic pollutants 21 22 hexagonal boron nitride is a wide bandgap semiconductor whose electronic properties can be fine tuned through defect engineering 23 25 hexagonal bn has been successfully used for the photodegradation of perfluorooctanoic acid and organic dyes 18 however its wide bandgap limits its application since high energy light is needed to generate excitons most of the works related to the use of h bn in photocatalysis refer to composites in which bn reduces the rate of exciton recombination due to the formation of a heterojunction between the components 26 27 we have previously shown that the interface between oxygen doped mos2 and h bn can be used to achieve a photodegradation rate of organic dyes of 5 5 mmol g 1 h 1 28 however h bn has rarely been studied as a single phase photocatalyst it has recently been shown that crystal lattice defects make a significant contribution to the increase in the h bn photoactivity under 254 nm light irradiation 29 compared with the commercial tio2 photocatalyst the activity can be 2 4 times higher which opens up new possibilities for expanding photocatalytic applications of h bn it has been proven that mechanical activation is a simple and effective method for the synthesis and processing of materials 30 with this method lattice defects surface functional groups and metastable phases that are unattainable using classical wet chemical approaches can be created for example bismuth doped up to 30 mol yttrium orthoferrite was synthesized by high energy ball processing which showed its efficiency in the decomposition of organic dyes and the possibility of restoring properties in a magnetic field 31 an original approach to the preparation of activated carbon tio2 composites for use in photocatalytic water purification was proposed 32 effective caffeine photodegradation in water was achieved due to the homogeneous distribution of phases over the composite inorganic halide perovskites were reproducibly synthesized by mechanical processing and exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for co2 reduction 33 in this work for the first time to achieve high rates of phenol decomposition in an aqueous medium under the action of uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 we used a photocatalyst based on a single phase commercial h bn powder mechanically processed in a ball mill 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials micron size h bn powder plazmoterm russia was first annealed in vacuum at 1400 c for 4 h and then kept in an ar atmosphere until use phenol catechol benzoquinone hydroquinone and 30 aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution of analytical grade were used 2 2 h bn ball milling ball milling bm of the h bn was carried out on an emax machine retsch germany using yttrium stabilized zirconia ysz jars and 10 mm ysz balls 3 g of h bn and 24 balls balls h bn weight ratio was equal to 44 were placed in 2 jars and sealed under ar atmosphere in a glovebox with residual humidity and oxygen controlled below 150 ppm the samples were milled at 450 600 and 750 rpm for 8 h in a 5 min work 5 min pause mode after treatment the h bn powder was sonicated in water to functionalize their surface with hydroxyl and amino groups through the hydrolysis reaction 34 the resulting powder was washed with water by centrifugation and dried under ambient conditions as obtained samples were stored in an ar atmosphere depending on the processing mode the samples were designated as bn450 bn600 and bn750 2 3 samples characterization phase

materials was determined from a tauc plot plotted from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy data in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectra drs uv vis the drs uv vis spectra were measured on a v750 spectrophotometer jasco japan in the wavelength of 200 800 nm with a resolution of 1 nm absorbance values were calculated using the kubelka munc equation the photoluminescence of h bn samples was measured on a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer agilent us with 208 nm excitation in the wavelength range from 216 to 400 nm 2 4 phenol photooxidation experiments to study the activity of ball milled h bn in phenol photooxidation reaction 10 mg of a sample was dispersed in 100 ml of a 1 mm aqueous phenol solution using a us bandelin sonopuls uw 2200 ultrasound disperser for 5 min the dispersion was placed on a magnetic stirrer and kept for 30 min in the dark to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium then 0 5 ml of a 30 aqueous h2o2 solution was added to the mixture and a 145 w uv lamp with a maximum intensity wavelength of 254 nm was turned on a short wavelength uv light source was used because at higher wavelengths the photon energy is insufficient to form excitons in bn selected 1 ml aliquots were filtered through a 0 22 μm filter and analyzed on a uv mini 1240 spectrometer shimadzu japan in the wavelength of 200 500 nm experimental spectra were analyzed using

carbon remaining after photocatalysis which was determined in accordance with iso 8467 1993 standard to assess the possibility of reusing the photocatalyst repeated experiments were carried out 3 cycles in total the catalyst was regenerated by evaporating liquid from the suspension between cycles and fresh phenol solution was added to the flask 2 5 scavenger tests the nature of active species in the photooxidation of organophenol compounds was investigated by adding isopropyl alcohol ipa dimethyl sulfoxide dmso and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate na edta to determine oh e and h respectively the scavenger tests were carried out in the same mode as the experiments on phenol photooxidation before turning on the uv lamp 80 μl of ipa 71 μl of dmso or 336 mg of na edta were added to the solution the characterization of products was performed using uv vis spectrophotometry 2 6 oh radicals formation rate terephthalic acid tpa was used to evaluate the ability of h bn to generate

wavelengths 3 results and discussion 3 1 composition of h bn samples analysis of the diffraction patterns of the samples shows that they consist only of the h bn phase fig 1a with characteristic peaks at bragg angles of 40 2 63 7 67 5 78 3 87 0 120 5 and 132 7 2θ degrees corresponding to diffraction from the 002 100 101 012 004 014 and 110 planes respectively crystallography open database card 9008997 37 in sample bn450 the intensity ratio of the 100 002 101 002 and 012 002 peaks increases in comparison with the initial h bn sample which can be explained by degradation of the layered structure 34 an increase in ball milling speed led to a broadening of the 002 peak the higher the speed the greater full width at half maximum fwhm and a shift of the 002 peak towards lower bragg angles fig 1d a rebound effect has previously been reported whereby an increase in internal pressure during ball milling results in a reduction in interplanar spacing 38 39 however the fwhm value of the 002 peak did not change which indicates a relatively high sample crystallinity namba et al 40 observed the appearance of a new broad maximum at a smaller bragg angle due to the formation of an amorphous phase thus it can be assumed that the shift of the 002 peak to smaller angles observed in our work accompanied by an increase in the fwhm value is associated with an increase in the interplanar spacing in the 002 direction a decrease in the crystallite size an increase in the number of defects and possible partial amorphization raman spectra fig 1c also confirm the presence of the h bn phase in the samples the only peak at 1366 cm 1 corresponds to the bn stretching vibration mode e2g 41 note that with an increase in the ball milling speed a decrease in the intensity of the peaks is observed with a simultaneous increase in the background intensity the decrease in the peak intensity can be explained by the enhancement of phonon scattering as a result of a decrease in crystallinity and an increase in the volume fraction of interfaces due to a decrease in the crystallite size 38 the appearance of a wide halo in raman spectrum of turbostratic bn films was attributed to a decrease in the interlayer interaction force 42 ftir spectra fig 1b are characterized by peaks corresponding to bn stretching 1330 cm 1 and out of plane bnb bending vibrations 770 cm 1 as the ball milling speed is increased the peaks become broadened and blue shifted which can be explained by an increase in the concentration of lattice defects 34 the shoulder at 1100 1200 cm 1 corresponds to bo vibration 43 which indicates partial oxidation of the samples surface the presence of oh functional groups is evidenced by a broad peak at 3000 3600 cm 1 note that the intensity of oh peaks is lower compared to other bn materials subjected to ball milling 44 45 this is because we did not use any solid or liquid additives in the ball milling process mechanical treatment was carried out in a protective ar atmosphere and the surface functionalization was performed by subsequent ultrasonic dispersion in water as a result functionalization with hydroxyl groups predominantly occurred on the material surface partial oxidation and functionalization of the h bn surface by o h groups after mechanical and ultrasonic treatments is also confirmed by nmr spectroscopy data fig 1e table 1 three peaks were observed in the spectra centered at 0 8 12 0 and 22 4 ppm corresponding to boron in a tetrahedral surroundings bo h groups trigonal boron in bno groups and trigonal boron in nbn groups respectively 40 46 analysis of the relative amount of these groups shows that at 450 rpm oxygen is mainly present in the h bn crystal lattice as a substitution atom bno groups an increase in the processing speed leads to an increase in the content of tetrahedrally coordinated boron which may be associated with the formation of boron oxides hydroxides either in the form of surface groups or as separate phase according to xps analysis the sample surfaces contain b n and o table 2 the results of xps analysis show that oxidation predominantly occurs at processing speeds above 600 rpm the b n ratio increases with increasing ball milling speed which indicates the formation of nitrogen depleted substoichiometric bnx x 1 the high resolution b1s spectra fig 1f were fitted using three components located at 190 4 191 1 and 192 7 ev and attributed to boron in bn bno and bo bonds respectively 47 fig 1g shows the high resolution n1s spectra of ball milled samples the spectra were deconvoluted using two components centered at 398 0 and 398 6 ev and assigned to nitrogen atom in bn and bno bonds respectively 48 note that after processing at a speed of 600 rpm a significant increase in the oxygen content and bo bonds is observed the difference in the number of bno and bo bonds calculated from xps and nmr data is associated with different depth of analysis while photoelectrons carry information from a thin surface layer the nmr signal is recorded from the entire volume of the sample 3 2 morphology of samples the initial h bn sample consists of flake like particles up to 10 μm long and 100 500 nm wide fig 2a e the high resolution tem image fig 2i confirms the hexagonal crystal structure with an interplanar spacing of 0 21 nm corresponding to the 100 plane and a characteristic angle of 120 between 100 and 010 directions after ball milling at 450 rpm the morphology of powders changed sample bn450 retained its micron particle size but individual particles have an accordion like structure fig 2b the formation of which can be explained by the exfoliation of 2d particles 49 50 during ball milling numerous thin sheets with a thickness of approximately 5 10 nm are formed fig 2f note that the crystal structure of individual sheets remain unchanged fig 2j the observed distances between lattice fringes agree well with the 002 d 0 34 nm and 100 d 0 21 nm planes of h bn a further increase in the rate of mechanical treatment leads to more noticeable changes in the microstructure of the samples the micron sized crystal structure of samples bn600 and bn750 becomes highly defective dislocations and subdomain grain boundaries are observed fig 2k also note that according to the hrtem images interplanar distances increased to 0 35 002 plane and 0 22 nm 100 plane being in a good agreement with the xrd results fig 2k l sample bn750 exhibits nanocrystallites ranging from 2 to 5 nm fig 2l curved and closed hexagonal bn planes are also observed on the particle surface 3 3 effect of ball milling on h bn microstructure based on the analysis of the obtained results the following conclusions can be drawn at a low processing speed sample bn450 weak van der waals bonds between the hexagonal bn planes break and the flakes sequentially peel off parallel to the 002 plane the microstructure of individual nanoplates is not disturbed in this case in previous works additional components such as sodium hypochlorite 51 cyclodextrin 44 or glutamic acid 45 were added to the grinding jars to achieve exfoliation of the h bn particles and ball milling without additives led to the formation of irregularly shaped particles 40 in our work bn exfoliation was achieved without additives which however requires careful optimization of processing parameters with an increase in the ball milling rate and accordingly the energy of the system covalent bonds begin to break which leads to the formation of misoriented crystallites with a high concentration of dislocations and subdomain boundaries at a sufficiently high energy 750 rpm a decrease in the degree of crystallinity an increase in the number of defects and possibly partial amorphization and a refinement of the structure formation of crystallites 2 5 nm in size are observed subsequent material exposure to air leads to its oxidation which is more pronounced for the sample processed at higher speed an increase in the oxygen content in the samples leads to a decrease in the intensity of the xps b1s and n1s peaks fig 1f g 3 4 optical properties of h bn samples drs uv vis spectra show that initial h bn sample absorbs light at a wavelength of 217 nm fig 3a as a result of ball milling an additional peak appears at about 240 nm the intensity of this peak increases as the ball milling speed is raised and at 750 rpm it becomes the only component the tauc plot for direct allowed transitions also shows these two components fig 3b the optical band gap values for these components are in the range of 5 3 5 5 ev and 4 1 4 5 ev respectively the shift in the h bn absorbance can be caused by various factors for example point defects such as vacancies at boron and nitrogen sites reduce the optical bandgap value 52 substitutional atoms with low electronegativity such as carbon 53 germanium 24 and phosphorous 25 exhibit a similar effect more electronegative substitution atoms such as oxygen have a more complex influence on the band structure of h bn the available literature data are rather contradictory sota et al 54 experimentally observed an increase in the bandgap from 5 3 to 5 9 ev with increasing oxygen content while xiao showed a nonlinear dependence decrease in the bandgap from 5 78 to 5 73 and then again increase up to 5 84 ev 23 in different theoretical works such contradictory results were explained by different positions of oxygen in the h bn lattice for example the presence of a substituting oxygen in the bno trigonal position leads to a decrease in the bandgap while the formation of obo domains in the bn honeycomb lattice can increase the bandgap 55 liu et al 56 conducted a theoretical study of adsorption at various substitution positions of oxygen atoms an increase in the bandgap was observed in the case of trioxide doped bn while other positions led to a decrease in the bandgap the oh and nh groups have been shown to reduce the bandgap to 4 2 ev 57 the bandgap value of amorphous bn is 4 5 ev which is 1 ev less than that of crystalline h bn 58 59 the bn samples studied in this work contain oxygen atoms in substitution positions oh groups and highly defective bn the amount of hydroxyl groups is small as evidenced by the low intensity of the corresponding ftir peak according to xps analysis the oxygen content reaches up to 17 at most of which is in the bno trigonal groups in addition sample bn750 contains a high concentration of crystal lattice defects thus the decrease in the bandgap is most likely due to the formation of bno groups and a highly defective phase during ball milling and subsequent sonication which effectively increases light absorption pl spectra are shown in fig 3c the pl spectrum of h bn usually has a complex structure due to various sub band transitions such as paired donor acceptor transitions and their replicas and excitons localized at defects 60 61 it can be seen that the intensity of photoluminescence decreases after processing in ball mill this implies a decrease in the rate of electron hole pair recombination which is favorable for photocatalytic activity 26 3 5 phenol photooxidation the phenol photooxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide strongly depends on the h bn ball milling rate fig 4 a rapid change in the phenol concentration occurs in the first 10 20 min after which the concentration remains almost unchanged for 100 min note that experiments without photocatalysts show little phenol oxidation in the presence of h2o2 fig s1 although the concentration of phenol is reduced by uv light the rate of change in concentration is slower than in experiments with photocatalysts the oxidation of phenol in the presence of both hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet light is more pronounced suggesting that the photolysis reaction also occurred when photocatalysts were used in the presence of sample bn450 the phenol concentration decreases to 250 μm while when using samples bn600 and bn750 the phenol concentration drops to zero the formation of intermediates in the phenol photooxidation also depends on the type of sample during the phenol photooxidation on sample bm450 a significant amount of quinones and catechols is formed the concentrations of benzoquinone and catechol increase rapidly during the first 10 min and then decrease to constant values while hydroquinone is formed throughout the experiment when testing sample bn600 the concentration of the intermediate is 2 3 times lower than for sample bm450 the formation of a significant amount of formic acid is also observed note that by the end of experiment there is almost no intermediate compounds dissolved in water sample bm750 proved to be the most active in phenol photooxidation the concentrations of intermediate compounds in this sample are lowest which indicates the predominant oxidation of phenol to co2 and water using this sample the cod value was significantly reduced from 189 3 to 2 3 mgo l the sample reusability was estimated using cycling photocatalytic oxidation experiments fig s2 it can be seen that photocatalyst bm750 showed no deactivation during 3 cycles phenol photooxidation usually proceeds through the formation of hydroxyl radicals as a result of the hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction with participation of an electron from the conduction band cb of the semiconductor reaction 1 or the photolysis reaction according to reaction 2 15 16 1 e cb h 2 o 2 oh oh 2 h 2 o 2 2 ho further reaction steps include the formation of an adduct with a hydroxyl radical or deprotonation of the oh phenol group accompanied by the formation of a water molecule 62 the formation of intermediate aromatic compounds such as quinones and catechol 16 17 ring opening to form light hydrocarbons such as formic acid and finally oxidation to carbon dioxide and water all intermediate complex molecules require oxidation by a hole formed as a result of the light absorption by a semiconductor 3 h vb oh c 6 h 5 oh co 2 h 2 o 3 6 active species tests to understand the mechanism of phenol photooxidation on samples after their mechanical treatment in a ball mill additional tests were carried out to determine the formation rate of hydroxyl radicals as well as in the presence of active species scavengers fig 5 it can be seen from the obtained results that the main active species are holes and electrons formed upon light absorption the efficiency of phenol photodegradation noticeably decreases in the presence of an electron absorber and in the absence of holes it drops to almost 0 while when using hydroxyl radical scavengers a drop of only 5 10 is observed since the phenol degradation rate depends on the active species generation rate which are simultaneously absorbed by scavengers it can be concluded that the exciton generation rate is the limiting process step note that the electron and hole absorption rates by scavengers are different and therefore they affect the phenol degradation rate in different ways hydroxyl radicals are formed so rapidly that the presence of scavenger only slightly affects the phenol oxidation rate note also that the formation of oh radicals is possible on ball milled samples and the rate of their formation increases with an increase in ball milling speed fig 5b 3 7 effect of ball milling on phenol photooxidation the following scheme was proposed for modifying the h bn structure depending on the ball milling rate and its effect on the photocatalytic activity in the phenol oxidation reaction fig 6 the lowest reaction rate is observed in the presence of an untreated h bn sample which is almost equal to the rate of phenol oxidation in presence of h2o2 and uv light this indicates that the initial h bn without mechanical processing is not a suitable photocatalyst and the reaction proceeds mainly through the formation of hydroxyl radicals according to reaction 2 as a result of low speed mechanical processing exfoliated flakes are formed with lateral dimensions comparable to the starting material and a high degree of crystallinity the number of defects and the degree of oxidation of this sample are small compared to other tested materials this structure does not have a strong effect on phenol photooxidation since hydroxyl radicals are practically not formed upon uv light absorption due to thermodynamic limitations and high rates of exciton recombination an increase in the rate of ball milling leads to an increase in the energy of the system and the formation of a highly defective structure with a significant number of bno groups and a reduced band gap this results in more efficient absorption of uv light and a redshift towards 254 nm the induced defects also lead to a lower exciton recombination rate providing active species for chemical transformation as a result a significantly higher phenol activity is observed on defective samples in addition the higher rate of oh radical generation makes it possible to use of these photocatalysts for the complete phenol mineralization since the intermediate products also require active radicals for oxidation at the maximum ball milling rate the bn crystallinity decreases this leads to a further decrease in the rate of electron hole pair recombination a decrease in the optical bandgap and as a consequence an increase in photocatalytic activity the phenol oxidation process proceeds through the formation of adducts with hydroxyl radicals the emission of hydrogen atom occurs as an intermediate step with the formation of quinones and catechol which are further oxidized to carbon dioxide the hydrogen atom is oxidized by a hole in the valence band of the semiconductor to form a proton that closes the overall catalytic cycle thus ball milling of commercial micro sized h bn powder proved to be an efficient approach to enhance its photocatalytic activity in the phenol oxidation reaction 4 conclusions commercial h bn powder ball milled at 450 600 and 750 rpm was characterized as a promising photocatalyst in the phenol photooxidation reaction in the presence of hydrogen peroxide the rate of phenol decomposition in an aqueous medium under the action of uv irradiation strongly depends on the ball milling rate mechanical processing leads to exfoliation of micron sized bn flakes with a thickness of 5 10 nm with an increase in the processing rate multiple defects are formed inside the bn particles and during further sonication the particles undergo partial oxidation and functionalization with o h groups these microstructure changes lead to an increase in the 254 nm uv light absorption and a decrease in the optical bandgap from 5 1 to 4 5 ev which in turn leads to a decrease in the recombination rate of electron hole pairs an increase in the formation rate of oh radicals and an increase in photocatalytic activity the sample processed at a rate of 750 rpm exhibits the highest activity in the phenol photooxidation at the lowest concentrations of intermediate compounds which indicates the predominant oxidation of phenol to co2 and water declaration of
