21950,the hydrodynamic responses characterized by 6 degrees of freedom dof motions wave run up and air gap of a three column semi submersible platform in random sea are experimentally investigated irregular waves representative of a 100 yr typhoon were used as the incident wave field and the actions of wind and current are included it was found that extremely large slow drift surge motions occur under irregular waves while the low frequency pitch motions are relatively small which were believed to be remarkable for the deep draft semi submersible a wavelet cross bicoherence analysis was applied to investigate the extreme wave run up responses the high frequency components in the extreme wave run ups were found to be from the quadratic phase coupling between the dominant response frequencies of the incident waves heave motion and pitch motion keywords three column semi submersible model test wave run up air gap wavelet bicoherence 1 introduction the semi submersible platform concept has been widely used to provide the production drilling and riser support needed for drilling in the past decades the three column semi submersible platforms were introduced and has been playing a very significant role in the development of the marginal oil and gas and renewable energy fields due to economic considerations in recent years these three column semi submersible concepts have also been applied for floating wind turbines such as oc4 deepcwind bayati et al 2014 simos et al 2018 the stability and dynamic motion response characteristics were investigated in earlier research jiang and xie 2013 senra et al 2010 and these characteristics may affect the safety of the drilling production activities and mooring lines risers significant low frequency components have been found in the roll and pitch motions of semi submersibles in irregular sea areas and these components may lead to the observed non gaussian responses matos et al 2011 xiao et al 2009 these low frequency components in the pitch and roll directions can also contribute to the nonlinearities of the air gap response dallinga et al 1988 pinkster 1979 they are believed to be excited by the second order wave drift moments current and wind loads and surge pitch coupling from mooring lines and risers stansberg 2007a it is much more complex to consider the free surface elevations in the vicinity of the columns in the array the violent water motion around the columns can be excited by the interaction between the incident reflected waves and radiated waves due to the motions of the floating platforms swan et al 1997 the influence of slow pitch motions on the air gap response was examined matsumoto et al 2010 2013 stansberg 2007b watai et al 2011 and was shown to have a negative impact on the instant air gap stansberg 1999a 1999b subsequently the dynamic behaviour of a conventional semi submersible was investigated both numerically and experimentally in regular and irregular waves kurian et al 2010 by combining linear numerical simulation nonlinear numerical simulation and model tests the air gap response of a twin pontoon four legged semi submersible was carefully analysed kvaleid et al 2014 more recently two semi submersibles operating in a deep water field were investigated numerically and experimentally liapis et al 2015 2016 vazquez hernandez et al 2015 it was demonstrated that in survival conditions the list angle could increase due to changes in the vertical centre of gravity clearly this is a critical consideration the wave run up or air gap responses of a floating platform are also related to a phenomenon called the near trapped mode around the structures which are natural properties of the structural geometry this phenomenon corresponds to frequencies where the incident wave energy of that particular frequency produces locally enhanced responses between the columns the near trapped and almost standing wave modes these then slowly leak energy outwards to infinity an exact solution for a column array of vertical cylinders with circular cross sections was developed by linton and evans 1990 using a simplified expression for the potential terms close to the column when the incident wave with a certain frequency interacts with the column array strong local free surface oscillations can be observed which are associated with near trapped modes meylan and eatock taylor 2009 in this study we focus on the run up and air gap responses of a three column semi submersible platform in the random sea for this purpose model tests were performed in the deep water ocean basin of shanghai jiao tong university irregular waves representative of a 100 yr typhoon were used as the incident wave field and the actions of wind and current are included numerical calculations in the frequency domain were also carried out to obtain the motion responses the corresponding results were tested against the experiment with a scaled model 1 60 the detailed results are discussed in section 3 following a description of the experimental setup in section 2 the conclusions are summarized through the model tests and numerical calculations in section 4 2 experimental setup a series of model tests were conducted for a semi submersible platform with deep draft in the deepwater wave basin of shanghai jiao tong university the tests were run at a model scale of 1 60 in a large wave basin with a length of 50 0 m width of 40 0 m and maximum effective depth of 10 0 m 2 1 model description a three column semi submersible platform was used in this study the column spacing of the semi submersible is 90 0 m centre to centre with three columns each of which is 15 m in diameter and the height of the pontoon is 7 m the columns are circular with a diameter of 15 m for the lower part and 18 m for the node and top part of the column the design draft is 26 m from the keel resulting in an initial air gap distance between the calm water surface to the underside of the deck also called the freeboard of 17 2 m the geometry of the structure and the coordinate system are illustrated in fig 1 the z axis goes upwards from the keel z 0 m the relevant information regarding the geometry mass data mooring lines of the model and the environment modelling are presented in appendix in the test the semi hull was moored using nine identical chain polyester chain mooring lines with each going through the columns while the other end of the mooring line was attached to a foundation point on the basin floor as shown in fig 1 the wind dynamics were given based on the norwegian petroleum directorate npd wind spectrum in which both mean wind velocity and spectra were modelled the vertical profile of the current velocity was also generated based on pre defined profiles irregular waves were then modelled with the existence of current jonswap spectrum with significant wave height of hs 13 5 m spectral peak period of tp 15 2 s and spectral factors of γ 2 4 at prototype scale was used to produce the incident waves during the model tests the platform motions of 6 degrees of freedom dof were captured with un contact optical system and the wave run up and air gap responses were measured through resistance wave probes installed on the platform the data acquisition system starts collecting the required data signals after the model motions reach a steady state to avoid transient effects the irregular wave was generated for 25 min which after removing an incident transient phase corresponded to 23 24 min at the laboratory scale corresponding to 3 h at the full scale all data signals were collected at a sampling frequency of 60 hz in the lab 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental validation prior to the irregular wave tests an inclination test and decay and offset tests were carried out to check the experimental set up by analysing the vertical position of the cog the natural frequency of each dof the damping coefficients and the stiffness of the mooring system when dealing with the slow drift motions of a moored floater linear viscous damping can be obtained by decay tests which are associated with the wave frequency motions and the corresponding slow drift motions the natural periods and non dimensional linear damping coefficients obtained by the decay tests are summarized in table 1 the offset tests should then be conducted accordingly to ensure that the mooring lines are manufactured as designed thus the whole floating system can respond precisely under the wave excitations and the numerical model can be validated by the model tests the results from the offset tests are presented in appendix fig 14 for in line direction and fig 15 for between line direction good agreement is observed in the comparison which can sufficiently validate the fabrication and set up of the mooring lines the same signals used to drive the environmental generators such as the wave paddles current pumps and wind fans were then regenerated with the model in place to investigate the motion responses of the platform 3 2 frequency domain and time domain properties of motions white noise tests were conducted to investigate the frequency domain properties of motions such as the response amplitude operator rao a white noise wave with period ranging from 5 s to 25 s and height of 3 5 m was applied as the incident wave the raos for the surge heave and pitch motions obtained accordingly are presented in fig 2 and these were compared with the results predicted by the frequency domain numerical calculations the results from the numerical calculations were observed to behave well in the wave frequency range ω 0 251 rad s for the surge heave and pitch motions nevertheless deviations between the numerical calculations and model tests can be recognized in the low frequency range ω 0 251 rad s for surge motion the differences appear in the low frequency range may result in the nonlinear response generated from the interaction between frequency components a phase shift in the peak in the rao can be observed for the heave motion due to the additional restoring force contributed by the mooring lines a similar trend should appear in the pitch motion an irregular wave test 100 yr survival conditions wave heading 0 was then conducted after the completion of the white noise tests the motion spectra were obtained from the time series measured in the model tests as shown in fig 3 the spectra of the incident waves were also plotted on different scales for comparison obvious responses of the surge heave and pitch motions have been excited by the incident waves in the wave frequency range the pronounced slow drift components were observed in the spectrum for the surge motions which were believed to be caused by the second order difference frequency wave loads pinkster 1980 in contrast the heave motions of the platform were located in the wave frequency range slow drift pitch motions were found to be relatively small the slow drift pitch motions were believed to be a very significant feature regarding to the run up and air gap responses of the semi submersible therefore the run up and air gap responses may be benefited from the restrained slow drift pitch the secondary spectral peaks of the heave and pitch motion responses were observed at frequencies of approximately 0 324 rad s and 0 234 rad s respectively which were associated with the natural frequencies obtained by the decay tests for each dof noting that for this type of platform the non significant slow drift pitch motion was observed while for some deep draft semi submersibles with very large displacement the natural period of the pitch motion may exceed 40 s resulting the prominent slow drift pitch motions 3 3 dynamics of the run up and air gap responses an air gap response is regarded as a critical design consideration in the design of floater stability topside decks and hull configurations a negative air gap may lead to violent lower deck impacts and deck equipment damage although increasing the freeboard can efficiently prevent the appearance of a negative air gap this situation can also markedly increase costs and uncertainties during the design stage currently it is still difficult to precisely predict wave run up and air gaps due to their complexity for which the nonlinear vertical motions and surface elevations should be properly considered therefore experimental studies are regarded to be of importance to the investigation of the wave run up and air gap responses in this study the wave run up was measured at four locations on the three column semi submersible under irregular waves along with the action of wind and current as shown in fig 4 see fig 5 the maximum wave run up appears at location 2 the standard deviation std values and the corresponding probabilistic distributions of the airgap responses at different locations are summarized in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the relative surface elevation at location 4 is clearly found to be much smaller than those at the other three locations as the incident waves are shielded by the column the relative surface elevations at the rear column are more severe than those at the front columns in addition higher wave run ups can be observed at the side face than at the front sides of the columns with circular cross sections the spectra of the relative surface elevation at four locations are presented in fig 8 the spectral peak energy found in the front of the rear column location 3 is higher than those measured at the other locations the high frequency components can be clearly seen from the response spectra at locations 1 3 which may be caused by the nonlinear wave structure interactions most response energy at location 4 is excited by the incident waves the spectral response for the high frequency range measured at location 4 is relatively small by comparing the two records measured on the front column it is found that the response energy at location 2 is significantly larger than that at location 1 throughout the frequency range from 0 05 rad s to 2 rad s the differences among the 4 locations are related not only to the vertical motions at each location but also to the phenomenon of the near trapped modes around the structures the near trapped modes are very close to the pure trapping the imaginary wavenumber equals zero which means little energy at this mode radiates out to infinity meylan and taylor 2009 therefore incident waves may be amplified at such modes and cause violent responses grice et al 2013 the near trapped modes are believed to be associated with the diffraction radiation problem which can also be reflected by the wiggles of the run up spectra as shown in fig 8 considering that the largest air gap response is always regarded as the most critical concern of the semi submersible we would like to look into the local responses of a segment of the time series near where the maximum air gap response appears around t 7298 1 s at location 2 the time frequency spectrum of such a time series from t 7259 4 s to t 7336 8 s can then be obtained by applying wavelet transform as shown in fig 9 every cycle contains different frequency components while very wide bandwidths of the wavelet spectrum can be found when the peak of the wave run up response appears this result indicates the broadband properties inside such extreme wave run ups to investigate the sources of the high frequency components in the peak of the relative surface elevation as shown in fig 9 a numerical tool called wavelet bicoherence was applied in this study this tool is capable of detecting phase coupling in a series of signals and reveals nonlinear iterations of the quadratic order van milligen et al 1995 the wavelet cross bispectrum between the two time series f t and g t is presented as 1 b f g ω a 1 a 2 t w f a τ w g a 1 τ w g a 2 τ d τ where t τ 0 τ τ 1 is the finite time interval of the integration w f a τ denotes the wavelet transform of a function f t a represents the scale length of f t and a 1 and a 2 represent the scale length of g t and satisfy the sum rule as 2 1 a 1 a 1 1 a 2 the scale lengths can be interpreted as the inverse frequencies if a mother wavelet is being utilized thus the wavelet cross bispectrum may be regarded as the coupling between the wave components of frequencies that satisfy ω ω 1 ω 2 by normalizing the squared cross bispectrum the squared wavelet cross bicoherence can be written as 3 b f g ω a 1 a 2 2 b f g ω a 1 a 2 2 t w g a 1 τ w g a 2 τ 2 d τ t w f a τ 2 d τ which attains values between 0 and 1 the wave run up responses under the deck are believed to be mainly related to two components the local wave elevation by the interaction between the incident waves and structures and the vertical motions contributed by the heave and pitch motions therefore in the present study the wavelet cross bispectrum and wavelet normalised squared cross bispectrum are used to study the inside relationship between these aspects and the extreme wave run up response the wavelet cross bispectrum reflects how coupling a particular pair of frequency components of the excitation contributes to the peak in the wave run up response the wavelet normalised squared cross bispectrum represents the intensity of the coupling interaction between two particular frequency components fig 10 fig 12 illustrate the wavelet cross bispectrum and wavelet normalised squared cross bispectrum between the wave run up response shown in fig 9 and its corresponding time series of incident waves heave motion and pitch motion as shown in fig 10 a the strongest quadratic phase coupling appears around the peak frequency of the incident waves say 0 41 rad s 0 41 rad s this result indicates that the quadratic phase coupling of the dominant frequency of the incident waves makes the greatest contribution to the second harmonic of the extreme wave run up however fig 10 b reveals that b f g ω reaches the maximum value at 0 88 rad s 0 53 rad s representing that the strongest nonlinear interactions exist at this frequency range due to the intense quadratic phase coupling fig 11 a shows that the maximum of the wavelet cross bispectrum between the extreme wave run up and the heave motions appears at the frequencies around 0 41 rad s 0 41 rad s strong quadratic phase coupling is found around the frequencies of 0 3 rad s 0 9 rad s 0 1 rad s 0 2 rad s as shown in fig 11 b considering the relatively small excitation of the heave motion at this frequency range the contributions made by the quadratic phase coupling for these frequency components are not reflected in the wavelet cross bispectrum although quadratic phase coupling among the frequencies 0 3 rad s 0 9 rad s 0 25 rad s 0 9 rad s is not as intensive its quadratic phase coupling can still be observed to play a significant role in the extreme wave run up due to the large heave motion responses similar behaviour can be found in fig 12 a and b specifically mismatching of the coupling frequency range appears between b f g ω and b f g ω for the pitch motion the wavelet based cross bicoherence provides an intuitive and reliable explanation regarding the source of the higher frequency components of the extreme wave run up response 4 conclusions a series of model tests in irregular waves were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of a three column semi submersible platform the 6 dof motions and the wave run up responses were tested with a scale 1 60 model numerical calculations in the frequency domain have been carried out to evaluate the motion responses in terms of the raos based on the results obtained in this work the following conclusions can be made experimental results show that extremely large slow drift surge motions occur under irregular waves which is regarded as an important feature for the design of mooring lines and risers for a floating platform the low frequency pitch motions are relatively small which were believed to be remarkable for the deep draft semi submersible due to the larger natural period considerable high frequency components were observed in the airgap response while much stronger responses for the extreme wave run up appear at the higher frequency range by employing the wavelet cross bicoherence analysis method such high frequency components in the extreme wave run up may come from the quadratic phase coupling between the dominant response

velocity in this study showed very good agreements with their prototypes the vertical profile of the current velocity was also modelled based on pre defined profiles as shown in fig 16 c deviations in the current velocity profiles can be observed through comparisons due to the limitations of the current generation however it was still acceptable for the model tests because the current velocities

configurations a negative air gap may lead to violent lower deck impacts and deck equipment damage although increasing the freeboard can efficiently prevent the appearance of a negative air gap this situation can also markedly increase costs and uncertainties during the design stage currently it is still difficult to precisely predict wave run up and air gaps due to their complexity for which the nonlinear vertical motions and surface elevations should be properly considered therefore experimental studies are regarded to be of importance to the investigation of the wave run up and air gap responses in this study the wave run up was measured at four locations on the three column semi submersible under irregular waves along with the action of wind and current as shown in fig 4 see fig 5 the maximum wave run up appears at location 2 the standard deviation std values and the corresponding probabilistic distributions of the airgap responses at different locations are summarized in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the relative surface elevation at location 4 is clearly found to be much smaller than those at the other three locations as the incident waves are shielded by the column the relative surface elevations at the rear column are more severe than those at the front columns in addition higher wave run ups can be observed at the side face than at the front sides of the columns with circular cross sections the spectra of the relative surface elevation at four locations are presented in fig 8 the spectral peak energy found in the front of the rear column location 3 is higher than those measured at the other locations the high frequency components can be clearly seen from the response spectra at locations 1 3 which may be caused by the nonlinear wave structure interactions most response energy at location 4 is excited by the incident waves the spectral response for the high frequency range measured at location 4 is relatively small by comparing the two records measured on the front column it is found that the response energy at location 2 is significantly larger than that at location 1 throughout the frequency range from 0 05 rad s to 2 rad s the differences among the 4 locations are related not only to the vertical motions at each location but also to the phenomenon of the near trapped modes around the structures the near trapped modes are very close to the pure trapping the imaginary wavenumber equals zero which means little energy at this mode radiates out to infinity meylan and taylor 2009 therefore incident waves may be amplified at such modes and cause violent responses grice et al 2013 the near trapped modes are believed to be associated with the diffraction radiation problem which can also be reflected by the wiggles of the run up spectra as shown in fig 8 considering that the largest air gap response is always regarded as the most critical concern of the semi submersible we would like to look into the local responses of a segment of the time series near where the maximum air gap response appears around t 7298 1 s at location 2 the time frequency spectrum of such a time series from t 7259 4 s to t 7336 8 s can then be obtained by applying wavelet transform as shown in fig 9 every cycle contains different frequency components while very wide bandwidths of the wavelet spectrum can be found when the peak of the wave run up response appears this result indicates the broadband properties inside such extreme wave run ups to investigate the sources of the high frequency components in the peak of the relative surface elevation as shown in fig 9 a numerical tool called wavelet bicoherence was applied in this study this tool is capable of detecting phase coupling in a series of signals and reveals nonlinear iterations of the quadratic order van milligen et al 1995 the wavelet cross bispectrum between the two time series f t and g t is presented as 1 b f g ω a 1 a 2 t w f a τ w g a 1 τ w g a 2 τ d τ where t τ 0 τ τ 1 is the finite time interval of the integration w f a τ denotes the wavelet transform of a function f t a represents the scale length of f t and a 1 and a 2 represent the scale length of g t and satisfy the sum rule as 2 1 a 1 a 1 1 a 2 the scale lengths can be interpreted as the inverse frequencies if a mother wavelet is being utilized thus the wavelet cross bispectrum may be regarded as the coupling between the wave components of frequencies that satisfy ω ω 1 ω 2 by normalizing the squared cross bispectrum the squared wavelet cross bicoherence can be written as 3 b f g ω a 1 a 2 2 b f g ω a 1 a 2 2 t w g a 1 τ w g a 2 τ 2 d τ t w f a τ 2 d τ which attains values between 0 and 1 the wave run up responses under the deck are believed to be mainly related to two components the local wave elevation by the interaction between the incident waves and structures and the vertical motions contributed by the heave and pitch motions therefore in the present study the wavelet cross bispectrum and wavelet normalised squared cross bispectrum are used to study the inside relationship between these aspects and the extreme wave run up response the wavelet cross bispectrum reflects how coupling a particular pair of frequency components of the excitation contributes to the peak in the wave run up response the wavelet normalised squared cross bispectrum represents the intensity of the coupling interaction between two particular frequency components fig 10 fig 12 illustrate the wavelet cross bispectrum and wavelet normalised squared cross bispectrum between the wave run up response shown in fig 9 and its corresponding time series of incident waves heave motion and pitch motion as shown in fig 10 a the strongest quadratic phase coupling appears around the peak frequency of the incident waves say 0 41 rad s 0 41 rad s this result indicates that the quadratic phase coupling of the dominant frequency of the incident waves makes the greatest contribution to the second harmonic of the extreme wave run up however fig 10 b reveals that b f g ω reaches the maximum value at 0 88 rad s 0 53 rad s representing that the strongest nonlinear interactions exist at this frequency range due to the intense quadratic phase coupling fig 11 a shows that the maximum of the wavelet cross bispectrum between the extreme wave run up and the heave motions appears at the frequencies around 0 41 rad s 0 41 rad s strong quadratic phase coupling is found around the frequencies of 0 3 rad s 0 9 rad s 0 1 rad s 0 2 rad s as shown in fig 11 b considering the relatively small excitation of the heave motion at this frequency range the contributions made by the quadratic phase coupling for these frequency components are not reflected in the wavelet cross bispectrum although quadratic phase coupling among the frequencies 0 3 rad s 0 9 rad s 0 25 rad s 0 9 rad s is not as intensive its quadratic phase coupling can still be observed to play a significant role in the extreme wave run up due to the large heave motion responses similar behaviour can be found in fig 12 a and b specifically mismatching of the coupling frequency range appears between b f g ω and b f g ω for the pitch motion the wavelet based cross bicoherence provides an intuitive and reliable explanation regarding the source of the higher frequency components of the extreme wave run up response 4 conclusions a series of model tests in irregular waves were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of a three column semi submersible platform the 6 dof motions and the wave run up responses were tested with a scale 1 60 model numerical calculations in the frequency domain have been carried out to evaluate the motion responses in terms of the raos based on the results obtained in this work the following conclusions can be made experimental results show that extremely large slow drift surge motions occur under irregular waves which is regarded as an important feature for the design of mooring lines and risers for a floating platform the low frequency pitch motions are relatively small which were believed to be remarkable for the deep draft semi submersible due to the larger natural period considerable high frequency components were observed in the airgap response while much stronger responses for the extreme wave run up appear at the higher frequency range by employing the wavelet cross bicoherence analysis method such high frequency components in the extreme wave run up may come from the quadratic phase coupling between the dominant response

21951,this paper presents an overview of recent developments of the dynamically installed anchor dia which is self installed through its gravitational energy example results from the dynamic installation process and holding capacity of the dia are highlighted including the hydrodynamic characteristics of the anchor during free fall in water anchor soil water interaction during dynamic installation in the seabed and the anchor mooring line soil interaction when the anchor is undergone uplift loading on the basis of the present overview simplified theoretical models are summarised to predict the entire installation process and holding capacity of the dia this paper describes design principles of the dia and the current physical and numerical techniques analysing the anchor mooring line soil water interaction moreover further development about the dia is highlighted and advanced physical and numerical techniques solving the anchor mooring line soil water interaction are stated keywords offshore anchoring system anchor dynamic installation hydrodynamic characteristics penetration depth holding capacity 1 introduction 1 1 dynamically installed anchors exploration of hydrocarbon resources in deep and ultra deep waters has placed increasing reliance on floating facilities which are secured in position with mooring systems and anchors the dynamically installed anchor dia which is a self installed anchor provides a cost effective and time efficient solution for deepwater floating systems three types of dias the torpedo anchor deep penetrating anchor dpa and omni max anchor see fig 1 have been applied to offshore practical engineering in brazil the north sea the gulf of mexico gom and the gulf of guinea gog brandão et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2009 lieng et al 2010 bhattacharjee et al 2014 recently the concept of hybrid dia which is comprised of a plate shaped anchor and a follower booster is proposed with the aim of increasing the final penetration depth within the seabed and thus improving the holding capacity the follower booster plays a role of installation tool during the dynamic installation process and is retrieved after installation typical hybrid dias depicted in fig 1 are the dynamically embedded plate anchor depla light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla and dpaiii o loughlin et al 2014 chow et al 2017a tong et al 2020 primary dimensions and weights of varied dias are summarised in table 1 1 2 entire installation process of dias the entire installation process of a dia is divided into three phases as shown in fig 2 therefore three pertinent aspects should be paid attention when designing a dia first the verticality and impact velocity of the anchor are two key factors affecting the dynamic penetration process of the anchor within the seabed hence it is with significant importance to illustrate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the dia including the directional stability drag coefficient and so forth second accurate estimation of the final penetration depth of the anchor within the seabed is pivotal to assess the holding capacity the difficulties in estimating the final penetration depth of the anchor are quantifying the undrained shear strength of the soil at high strain rate hardening and large strain softening together with hydrodynamic aspects including water and soil drag on the anchor and potential water entrainment along the anchor soil interface third after dynamic installation the mooring line is tensioned with pre designed uplift load and the dia resists the uplift load through its self weight and soil resistance for the omni max anchor shown in fig 2 the padeye is offset from the anchor s centre line hence the anchor is subject to an anti clockwise moment which forces the anchor to rotate also termed as keying within the seabed in order to predict the complex load displacement behaviour of the anchor it is valuable to clarify the anchor mooring line soil interaction during keying 1 3 scope of this paper it is not possible to cover all studies associated with dias within the scope of this paper and the focus herein is on special hydrodynamic and geotechnical issues of dias that differ from other types of anchors this paper starts with a brief summary of present model testing technologies and numerical simulation approaches for the three installation stages of dias before discussing primary hydrodynamic characteristics of dias dynamic contact between the anchor and soil and anchor mooring line soil interaction then design principles for dias are abstracted and theoretical frameworks assessing the impact velocity and final penetration depth of dias are summarised finally further studies on the dia and advanced physical and numerical technologies required in considering the anchor mooring line soil water interaction are highlighted 2 hydrodynamic characteristics of dias 2 1 overview in order to determine the verticality and impact velocity of a dia in water it is vital to expect insights into the anchor s hydrodynamic characteristics drag coefficient directional stability and so forth for a given drag coefficient the drag force f d can be calculated by 1 f d 1 2 c d ρ a f v 2 where c d is the drag coefficient which depends on the fluid properties geometry of the projectile and the reynolds number ρ is the density of the fluid a f is the frontal area of the projectile and v is the relative velocity between the projectile and the fluid the differential equation of motion characterising the free fall process of the dia in water can be described as 2 m a m a w a f d a w w a 1 2 c d a w ρ w a f v 2 where m a is the anchor mass m is the added mass a is the acceleration w a is the anchor submerged weight in water f d a w is the water drag c d a w is the water drag coefficient and ρ w is the density of water therefore the fall velocity of the dia can be estimated by eq 2 the directional stability of a projectile during free fall in water can be judged on the basis of locations of the gravity centre cg and hydrodynamic centre ch as diagrammed in fig 3 the hydrodynamic force on the projectile is comprised of two parts the tangential component parallel to the central line i e the drag force f d a w and the normal component perpendicular to the central line i e the transversal force f n a w the point ch refers to the location on the projectile where the normal component f n a w would act to create the total moment if the location of ch is lower than cg the restoration moment m r with respect to cg induced by the normal component f n a w forces the projectile to further tilt once the projectile is inclined however if the location of ch is higher than cg the restoration moment m r will force the projectile to inversely rotate to the initial vertical direction when the projectile is inclined it can be seen from fig 3 that if the position ch is higher than cg the signs of the tilt angle δ t from the central line of the projectile to the vertical direction and the restoration moment m r are opposite and the projectile is stable by conducting free fall tests or tow tank tests the drag coefficient of a projectile can be determined based on eq 1 moreover the hydrodynamic characteristics of a projectile can be estimated by carrying out numerical simulations based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach the projectile is allowed to fall freely in water or is fixed in the calculation domain allowing the fluid to attack the projectile with a constant speed thus the drag coefficient and directional stability of the anchor are estimated 2 2 drag coefficient of dias the relationship of the drag coefficient of a dia or projectile and the reynolds number is plotted in fig 4 the reynolds number re is defined as 3 re ρ w l charac v υ where l charac is the characteristic length which is selected as the length of the dia or projectile and υ is the dynamic viscosity of the water it can be seen from fig 4 that the drag coefficient depends on 1 the reynolds number and 2 the anchor shape for instance the drag coefficient of the 0 fin torpedo anchor decreases from 0 75 to 0 23 with the reynolds number increasing from 104 to 106 and almost maintains a constant with the further increase of the reynolds number richardson 2008 the total drag on a projectile can be divided into two parts the pressure drag and the frictional drag the pressure drag resulted from the pressure difference at the tip and rear of the projectile depends on the projectile shape while the frictional drag depends on the reynolds number and the surface area of the projectile as reported by lewis 1988 the frictional drag coefficient of a plate is expressed as 0 075 logre 2 2 thus the frictional drag coefficient decreases with increasing reynolds number it can be concluded that the frictional drag has limited contribution to the total drag at high reynolds numbers hence the total drag primarily depends on the pressure drag therefore the drag coefficient derived from the reduced scale model tests can be used to present that in prototype scale under the condition that the frictional drag can be ignored as shown in fig 4 the drag coefficient of the torpedo anchor and omni max anchor maintains constant with the reynolds number re 106 the drag coefficient is largely affected by the anchor shape as shown in fig 4 for a torpedo shaped penetrometer used to dispose the radioactive waste in offshore sediments the drag coefficient is relatively low and ranges 0 15 0 18 attributed to the streamlined geometry of the projectile freeman et al 1984 the contracted rear of the projectile plays an important role in reducing the drag force as it can confine the streamlines in a relatively narrow region hence to reduce the water vortex the drag coefficient is 0 23 for a 0 fin torpedo anchor and is 0 67 for a 4 fin dpa richardson 2008 o beirne et al 2017 indicating the drag coefficient mobilises an increase with a more complex shape of the anchor for the plate shaped omni max anchor the drag coefficient ranges 0 76 1 0 cenac 2011 liu et al 2018a 2019a which is higher than that of the dpa or torpedo anchor due to the relatively light weight and high drag coefficient the impact velocity of the omni max anchor is about 19 m s zimmerman et al 2009 which is lower than 24 m s for the torpedo anchor de araujo et al 2004 2 3 directional stability of dias in model tests the entire motion history of the dia can be captured by a six degree accelerometer and gyroscope based on the micro electromechanical systems mems technique for instance in liu et al 2018a the trajectory of the omni max anchor in 1 30 reduced scale measured by a six degree accelerometer and gyroscope is plotted in fig 5 a it can be seen that the normalised horizontal displacements s x h a and s y h a s x and s y are horizontal displacements of the anchor increase with the increase in the normalised vertical displacement s z h a s z is the vertical displacement of the anchor indicating the anchor gradually inclines during free fall in water the tilt angle of the anchor is defined as the included angle between the central line of the anchor and the vertical direction as shown in fig 5 b the tilt angle maintains zero when the vertical velocity v z is less than 2 0 m s or the normalised vertical displacement s z h a is less than 0 89 and then increases monotonously with further increase in v z and s z h a when the tilt angle δ t reaches 3 the corresponding vertical velocity and normalised vertical displacement are 4 17 m s and 6 3 respectively with δ t 3 the vertical velocity increases further indicating the anchor has not reached the terminal velocity the instability of the omni max anchor is resulted from 1 the asymmetric structure of the mooring arm and b the non optimised topological structures of the flukes in cfd simulations by allowing the fluid to attack the dia with varied attack angles the restoration moment m r on the dia is obtained and hence the location of the hydrodynamic centre is determined therefore the directional stability of the dia can be assessed based on the locations of the hydrodynamic centre and gravity centre the directional stability of four torpedo anchors with varied shaft and fin aspect ratios are investigated by cfd numerical simulations in silva 2010 and the results are plotted in fig 6 a when the signs of the restoration moment coefficient c mr and the attack angle δ t are opposite the restoration moment will force the anchor to rotate back towards the vertical direction once the anchor is tilt indicating the anchor is in stable region in silva 2010 the torpedo anchor torp0 is a model which is already used in offshore engineering the torp1 is a larger model whose height is increased from 15 m to 21 m the torp2 is a modification model of torp1 with the fin geometry unchanged and shaft length increasing to 22 m and the torp3 is a modification model of torp2 with the fin width doubled and fin length half reduced from fig 6 a it can be seen that the directional stability of torp3 is well attributed to optimised design of the fins the aspect ratio of the fin is defined as the ratio of the effective width to the effect length of the fin as indicated by triantafyllou and hover 2003 a large aspect ratio of the fin is beneficial in increasing the distance from the hydrodynamic centre relative to anchor tip and hence to improve the directional stability if the rear fins of the torpedo anchor is buckled i e torp1d shown in fig 6 a the restoration moment coefficient in the unstable region increases significantly this indicates the directional stability of the anchor is deteriorated as the distorted fin affects the symmetry of the anchor for the omni max anchor the cfd simulation by liu et al 2019a indicates the anchor is in unstable region with the attack angle ranging 15 15 which is consistent with the testing results in liu et al 2018a a booster is put forward by liu et al 2018b with the aim of improving the directional stability and impact velocity of the omni max anchor the booster is attached to the tail of the omni max anchor using a shear pin which ensures the connection between the anchor and booster during free fall in water and separation of the booster from the anchor after dynamic installation by enlarging the fin width or by connecting a ring at the rear of the booster the directional stability of the hybrid anchor i e omni max anchor booster is improved as depicted in fig 6 b when the ratio of the ring diameter d r to the fluke width w a is d r w a 3 the hybrid anchor is in stable region moreover the drag coefficient of the hybrid anchor shown in fig 6 b is 1 06 which is a little higher than 0 87 of the omni max anchor this means that the gravitational energy of the booster can transform to the kinetic energy of the hybrid anchor as much as possible 2 4 drag coefficient of mooring line before releasing the dia the mooring line is pre released to the seabed as diagrammed in fig 2 when the anchor falls freely in water a portion of mooring line and the installation line are dragged to move together with the anchor which will reduce the anchor velocity therefore it is necessary to investigate the drag coefficient of the mooring line three types of mooring lines including the chain wire rope and fibre rope are usually used in practical engineering the drag coefficient of the mooring line c d l w is summarised in table 2 the drag coefficient of the wire rope or fibre rope is approximately 0 01 while is about 0 02 for the chain due to the relatively complex geometry o beirne et al 2017 liu et al 2018a for a given drag coefficient the drag force f d l w on the mooring line can be expressed as 4 f d l w 1 2 c d l w a charac l ρ w v 2 where a charac l is the characteristic area of the mooring line which is expressed as a charac l πd charac l l l d charac l is the characteristic diameter of the mooring line which is equal to the diameter of a cylinder in unit length with the same volume as the mooring line in unit length and l l is the length of mooring line that moves together with the anchor 2 5 theoretical framework estimating the free fall process of dias the free fall process of a dia in water incorporating the effect of mooring line can be expressed by the following differential equation of motion 5 m a m l m a w a w l f d a w f d l w where m l and w l are the mass and submerged weight of the mooring line that moves together with the anchor it has been illustrated in liu et al 2018a that the added mass term is minor compared with the anchor mass hence the added mass usually can be ignored without considering the mooring line the estimated impact velocities of the omni max anchor and torpedo anchor t98 are summarised in table 3 with release heights of 30 m 40 m and 50 m the impact velocities of the omni max anchor are 17 11 m s 18 20 m s and 18 87 m s for the torpedo anchor the impact velocities are 25 98 m s 30 38 m s and 33 55 m s with release height increasing from 50 m to 75 m and 100 m an example herein is presented to investigate the effect of mooring line on the impact velocity of the dia the anchor model is the omni max anchor with dry weight w a 380 kn and frontal area a f 1 9 m2 the data are cited from zimmerman et al 2009 the mooring line is the fibre rope with varied diameters d r spanning from 0 1 m to 0 25 m it is assumed that the submerged unit weight of the fibre rope is equal to the unit weight of water and the length of the mooring line that moves together with the anchor is equal to the vertical fall distance of the anchor given the drag coefficients of the anchor and mooring line are 0 87 and 0 01 the anchor velocity and vertical fall distance can be estimated by eq 5 and the predicted results are shown in fig 7 it is concluded that with the same vertical fall distance the anchor velocity mobilises an increase with decreasing mooring line diameters d r moreover the anchor velocity will reversely reduce beyond peak with the further increase in the vertical fall distance therefore an optimised release height is not only beneficial to avoid the anchor from inclining but also helpful to achieve a higher impact velocity 2 6 summary except for the directional stability the verticality of the dia during free fall in water has been widely paid attention in practical engineering the verticality of the dia during free fall in water is disturbed by the underground current arrangement of the mooring line and many other factors therefore a control system with the ability of calibrating the verticality of dias may be a valuable issue in the future actually some attempts have been conducted to control the verticality of the dia for instance silva et al 2017 designed four stabilizers a smaller plate relative to the fins with their ends pivotally attached to the fins of the torpedo anchor once the torpedo anchor is tilt the stabilizer located at the tilt direction will rotate around the pivotal axis and subject to drag force which forces the torpedo anchor to rotate back towards the vertical direction further experimental tests and numerical simulations should be carried out to investigate the efficiency and validity of the control system using to calibrate the verticality of dias 3 dynamic installation of dias within seabed 3 1 overview the dynamic penetration of a dia in seabed is a complex anchor soil water interaction process the accuracy of the estimated final penetration depth is obscured by two aspects first it is necessary to quantify the undrained shear strength of the soil incorporating the strain rate and strain softening effects at very high shear strain rate and large deformation second it is necessary to consider the hydrodynamic aspects resulted from the water drag soil drag and water entrainment along the anchor soil interface for instance the water drag has a potential to decrease the final penetration depth of the anchor whereas the water entrainment has a potential to decrease the adhesion factor at the anchor soil interface and increase the final penetration depth the resistances on the dia include the bearing resistance f t which is the summary of bearing resistances on anchor tip f tt and on the base of fins f tf the frictional resistance f f the buoyant force f b and the drag force f d which is the summary of the soil drag f d a s and water drag f d a w as shown in fig 8 the differential equation of motion governing the dynamic penetration of the dia in the seabed can be expressed as 6 m a m a w a f t f f f d f b the bearing and frictional resistances are expressed as 7 f t n c a tip s u 8 f f α a frict s u where n c is the bearing capacity factor a tip is the anchor soil contact area in the plane perpendicular to the centre axis of the anchor α is the adhesion coefficient at the anchor soil interface a frict is the anchor side area that submerged in the soil and s u is the undrained shear strength incorporating the strain rate and strain softening effects the undrained shear strength s u is described as 9 s u r f s f s u0 where r f is the strain rate factor s f is the strain softening factor and s u0 is the undrained shear strength at the reference shear strain rate prior to any softening the reference shear strain rate γ ref is usually valued based on the in situ tests used to assess the undrained shear strength cone penetration test cpt together with penetration tests of full flow penetrometers including t bar and ball are widely used to assess the undrained shear strength of seabed soils randolph et al 2005 2012 low et al 2010 attention must be paid that it is inevitable to avoid the soil disturbance in situ tests hence the derived undrained shear strength at the reference shear strain rate is the one with the strain softening effect been incorporated the undrained shear strength at the reference strain rate is termed as s u ref which can be considerably expressed as s u ref s f s u0 the analyses above indicate that each resistance on the dia needs to be clarified in order to accurately assess the final penetration depth of the dia in physical modelling field tests and laboratory model tests including centrifuge tests and 1g model tests have been conducted to investigate the dynamic interaction between the anchor and the surrounding soil medeiros 2002 o loughlin et al 2014 zimmerman et al 2009 hossain et al 2015 liu et al 2016a o beirne et al 2017 chang et al 2019 han et al 2019 and many others in centrifuge tests also termed ng test where n is the magnification of acceleration in centrifuge the undrained shear strength is equal to that in prototype and hence the impact velocity in ng test is equal to that in prototype in 1g model test the undrained shear strength is reduced to 1 λ l λ l is the prototype to model scale ratio compared to that in prototype to ensure the same dimensionless overburden stress ratio s u γ s z γ s is the submerged unit weight of the soil with that in prototype as the flow mechanism of the soil in the vicinity of the anchor depends on the dimensionless ratio s u γ s z han et al 2019 therefore the impact velocity in 1g test should be reduced to 1 λ l 0 5 compared to that in prototype according to the similarity requirements more similarity relationships for dynamic penetration of projectiles in clayey seabed are summarised in han et al 2019 except for physical modelling the dynamic installation process of the dia is also simulated by large deformation numerical approaches raie and tassoulas 2009 kim and hossain 2015 liu et al 2016b sabetamal et al 2016 liu and zhang 2017 liu et al 2019b and many others two categories of large deformation methods are adopted including the large deformation finite element ldfe method and the cfd method based on the numerical simulations parametric studies can be carried out to investigate the effects of varied factors on the final penetration depth of the dia these factors include the impact velocity anchor weight and shape soil strength characterisation and the anchor soil contact properties 3 2 factors influencing the final penetration depth herein an example is presented to illustrate the velocity variation of the dia during dynamic penetration within the seabed the anchor model is a 1 50 scale omni max anchor mass m a m 0 438 kg the subscribe m represents model scale and the subscribe pro in the following represents prototype and the soil sample is the normally consolidated nc kaolin clay with reference undrained shear strength s u ref 2 4z kpa han et al 2019 the anchor impacts the soil with an impact velocity of v 0 m 2 69 m s 19 m s in prototype the variation of the velocity versus penetration depth which are integrated by the acceleration data measured by a mems accelerometer is depicted in fig 9 a the undrained shear strength with shallow embedment is relatively low in nc clay hence the velocity continuously increases as the anchor initially impacts the soil when the anchor penetrates into deeper soil with higher undrained shear strength the soil resistances acting on the anchor increase notably and the anchor starts to decelerate once the soil resistance is beyond the submerged weight of the anchor when the velocity reduces to zero the anchor is rest in the soil the final penetration depths of dias with varied impact velocities undrained shear strengths anchor weights and shapes are compared in fig 9 b with higher impact velocity and heavier weight the final penetration depth experiences an increase attributed to the increase in the kinetic and gravitational energies the final penetration depth of the dia is greatly affected by the undrained shear strength for instance the final penetration depth of the torpedo anchor is about 16 4 18 7 m in the calcareous silt with undrained shear strength s u ref 2 3z kpa while increases to 28 4 31 0 m in kaolin clay with s u ref 1 0 85z kpa hossain et al 2014 in addition the anchor shape also plays an important role on the final penetration depth for instance the omni max anchor weighs 80 2 t and the undrained shear strength of the calcareous silt is s u ref 3 3z kpa in gaudin et al 2013 and these conditions are similar to that in hossain et al 2015 the torpedo anchor weighs 107 t and the undrained shear strength s u ref 7 5 2 9z kpa the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor is 10 3 13 2 m which is much lower than 16 4 18 7 m of the torpedo anchor the surface area of the plate shaped omni max anchor is greater than the torpedo anchor which will result in a high frictional resistance and hence a shallow penetration depth most studies are concentrated to the dynamic penetration of the dia in clayey seabed as the dia is preliminarily applied to deep or ultra deep water regions with clayey sediments brandão et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2009 for the dynamic installation of the dia in sandy seabed associated results are quite limited the dynamic penetration depth of the 0 fin torpedo anchor in different soils was investigated by richardson 2008 and the results are plotted in fig 10 a the final penetration depth ratio z e h a of the anchor in silica flour mean particle size d 50 45 μm is only 0 36 with an impact velocity of 28 7 m s which is considerably lower than 2 1 2 8 in kaolin clay with impact velocities of 10 8 30 8 m s this can be largely attributed to the high resistance of the silica flour which becomes stronger when subjected to shear at a constant volume i e under undrained conditions the ratio z e h a of the anchor in calcareous sand is 0 6 1 5 with impact velocities of 0 29 8 m s due to the high compressibility of the calcareous sand the end bearing and frictional resistances on the anchor in calcareous sand is lower than that in silica flour it is acknowledged that for a cone penetrometer the friction ratio r f defined as the ratio of the sleeve friction to the cone resistance is relatively low in sand and relatively high in clay lunne et al 1997 therefore the end bearing resistance plays a more dominant role on the final penetration depth for the anchor in sand than that in clayey seabed chow et al 2017a designed a plate shaped dia i e dpaiii shown in fig 1 whose flukes are tapered to reduce the frontal area and hence to reduce the end bearing resistance which is efficient to increase the final penetration depth in sand a follower which can be retrieved after installation is connected at the anchor rear to increase the final penetration depth within the seabed centrifuge tests have been conducted to investigate the final penetration depth of the dpaiii in sand with different relative densities and the results are plotted in fig 10 b the soil resistance increases notably with increasing relative density d r which avoids the anchor from penetrating deeper into the seabed overall the dpaiii with small size may be an efficient alternative for small scale floating structures such as the offshore wind turbines net cages and wave and tidal energy converters in shallow waters the seabed sediments are more complex and spread with sand silt and clay hence more advanced anchor types should be proposed and more comprehensive studies should be carried out in the future 3 3 contact simulation between anchor and soil a key issue associated with the dynamic penetration of a dia in clayey seabed is how to simulate the adhesion friction at the anchor soil interface the adhesion friction means the frictional resistance along the anchor surface is not dependent on the normal stress but depends on the undrained shear strength i e eq 8 currently two three dimensional numerical tools have been used to simulate the dynamic geotechnical issues of a projectile the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach in the finite element package abaqus kim and hossain 2015 liu et al 2016b and the cfd software ansys cfx liu and zhang 2017 liu et al 2018b the two numerical models above cannot directly simulate the adhesion friction at the interface between the projectile and the surrounding soil in the cel analysis a coulomb friction formulation is adopted and a limited shear stress τ max can be specified in kim and hossain 2015 a very high coulomb friction coefficient is set to allow the limited shear stress to control the shear failure at the anchor soil interface in which the limited shear stress is specified as the product of the adhesion coefficient and the undrained shear strength at a depth the anchor can reach with frictionless contact in the cfd analysis the fluid is modelled as non newtonian eulerian fluid material and the shear stress of the fluid on the basis of fluid mechanics approach is the undrained shear strength in geotechnical mechanics framework the structure fluid interface is set as walls free slip walls with α 0 and no slip walls with α 1 0 to simulate the adhesion friction with varied adhesion coefficients a reduction factor is set for the one row fluid element just outside the structure hawlader et al 2015 liu et al 2019b hence the undrained shear strength just outside the structure is αs u in addition the soil in both cel and cfd analyses is modelled as undrained by the use of total stress analyses by performing cfd simulations the dynamic penetration process of an omni max anchor with a booster i e hybrid anchor with varied adhesion coefficients was investigated in liu et al 2019b and the results are plotted in fig 11 the mass ratio of booster to anchor is 1 1 and the undrained shear strength of the soil is s u0 2 4 3z kpa in cfd simulations the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor mobilised an increase from 14 4 m to 18 4 m with the adhesion coefficient decreasing from 1 0 to 0 1 the adhesion coefficient at the anchor soil interface depends on the surface roughness of the anchor the soil properties the water entrainment and many other factors therefore in practical engineering the geotechnical engineer should carefully consider the above factors and select a proper adhesion coefficient the dynamic penetration result of the omni max anchor from the cel analysis kim and hossain 2015 is also plotted in fig 11 for comparison with the same adhesion coefficient of α 0 33 the final penetration depths of the omni max anchor and hybrid anchor are 12 1 m and 16 4 m respectively indicating the booster can efficiently increase the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor in addition it should be noted that the water above the seabed is not simulated in the cel analysis and is considered in the cfd analysis hence the anchor initially accelerates in the cel analysis and decelerates monotonously in the cfd analysis due to the water drag more hydrodynamic aspects associated with the dynamic penetration process of a dia will be discussed later 3 4 strain rate and strain softening during dynamic installation the strain softening effect should be taken into consideration for large deformation geotechnical problems such as the in situ cyclic penetration of full flow penetrometers the trench development of steel catenary risers and the dynamic penetration of dias zhou and randolph 2009 dutta and hawlader 2019 liu et al 2019b the strain rate effect should be considered for dynamic geotechnical issues with very high strain rate such as the installation of pipelines free fall penetrometers and dias therefore both the strain rate and strain softening effects should be incorporated into the undrained shear strength for the dynamic installation of dias the strain softening and strain rate factors in eq 9 are expressed as 10 s f δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 11 r f 1 λ γ γ ref semi logarithmic model a r f γ γ ref β power law model b r f 1 λ arcsinh γ γ ref inverse hyperbolic sine model c r f 1 η γ γ ref β 1 η herschel bulkley model d where δ rem is the remoulded strength ratio of the fully remoulded shear strength to the undisturbed shear strength ξ is the accumulated plastic shear strain ξ 95 is the accumulated plastic shear strain for the soil to undergo 95 remoulding γ is the shear strain rate γ ref is the reference shear strain rate which is calculated as the ratio of the penetration rate to the diameter of the penetrometer for cone t bar and ball penetration tests low et al 2010 and λ β λ η and β are parameters charactering the strain rate effects four different models shown in eq 11 can be used to characterise the strain rate effect of the soil for example if the strain rate factor λ 0 2 in the semi logarithmic model i e eq 11a it means that the undrained shear strength exhibits an increase by up to 20 with a ten fold increase in the shear strain rate in numerical simulations the strain rate and strain softening of the soil is indicative of the soil disturbance caused by the dynamic penetration of dias in cel a user defined subroutine vusdfld by fortran in abaqus has been used to incorporate the strain rate and strain softening effects into the undrained shear strength dassault systémes 2014 in each step the incremental shear strain of the soil is obtained and hence the shear strain rate and accumulated plastic shear strain are obtained in cfx a dynamic viscosity is defined using cfx command language ccl expression in which the strain rate and strain softening effects are included the accumulated plastic shear strain is obtained by solving the transport equation in cfx and the shear strain rate is calculated based on the rate of deformation tensor zakeri and hawlader 2013 the evolution of the undrained shear strength surrounding the omni max anchor during dynamic installation is plotted in fig 12 a together with the instantaneous velocity vectors plotted in fig 12 b the ratio s u s u0 in fig 12 a represents the ratio of the undrained shear strength incorporating the strain rate and strain softening effects to that prior to any strain softening at the reference shear strain rate it can be seen that for the soil around the anchor tip the ratio s u s u0 1 indicating the undrained shear strength is enhanced due to the very high shear strain if the shear strain of the soil is macroscopically defined as the ratio of the anchor velocity to the fluke thickness the shear strain is in the magnitude of 102 s 1 which is three orders higher of the reference shear strain rate 10 1 s 1 low et al 2010 the ratio s u s u0 is less than unit for the soil in the vicinity of the anchor side indicating the strain softening due to large deformation plays a dominant role on the undrained shear strength the undrained shear strength of the soil surrounding the loading arm has even experienced a half remoulding as shown in fig 12 a therefore both the strain rate and strain softening effects of the soil should be considered in order to accurately estimate the final penetration depth of the dia previous studies associated with cpt have indicated that the strain rate effect r f shaft for the shaft resistance is higher than the strain rate effect r f tip for the tip resistance which are summarised in table 4 the thickness of the shear band in the vicinity of the cone shaft is very thin hence the strain rate effect of the shaft resistance is more notable for the omni max anchor the back analysed results in han et al 2019 suggest the relationship between the strain rate effect r f2 for the frictional resistance and the strain rate effect r f1 for the tip resistance is r f2 1 4r f1 by adopting r f2 1 4r f1 the theoretical predicting results using the differential equation of motion i e eq 6 are well consistent with the model testing results measured by the mems accelerometer as shown in fig 13 3 5 hydrodynamic aspects during dynamic penetration the water drag has a potential to reduce the final penetration depth of the dia whereas the water entrainment along the anchor soil interface has a potential to reduce the frictional resistance and hence to increase the final penetration depth to investigate the water entrainment along the anchor soil interface the omni max anchor is released twice from air and from water respectively han et al 2019 and the results are plotted in fig 13 with the same impact velocity the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor which is released in water is deeper than that released in air indicating the effect of water entrainment effect on the final penetration depth overweighs the water drag effect based the differential equation of motion shown in eq 6 the besting fitting results are obtained by using α 0 21 to consider the potential reduction of the adhesion coefficient at the anchor soil interface due to the water entrainment effect which is lower than α 0 33 inverse of the sensitivity of kaolin clay used in model test without the water entrainment effect though the water entrainment effect is prone to increase the final penetration depth of the dia the trapped water along the anchor soil interface is detrimental to the holding capacity of the anchor moreover the excess pore water pressure developed due to the dynamic installation of the anchor will reduce the effective stress of the soil which will also reduce the holding capacity of the anchor sabetamal et al 2016 investigated the dynamic penetration of a 0 fin torpedo anchor in which effective stress analysis is achieved by using the modified cam clay mcc model to capture the generation and dissipation of the pore water pressure in the soil surrounding the anchor due to the symmetry of the 0 fin anchor the axi symmetric model was used the final penetration depth of the anchor is 13 8d a d a is the diameter of the shaft as shown in fig 14 a the dissipation curves of the excess pore water pressure δu for the soil elements located at a depth of 13 4d a and different radial distances from the anchor are also depicted in fig 14 a the initial pore water pressure δu i t 0 decreases with increasing radial distances from the anchor indicating the degree of the soil disturbance reduces with increasing radial distances from the anchor when the radial distance is 4d a the initial pore water pressure is minor hence the soil can be considered as non disturbed the normalised pore water pressure δu δu i versus dissipation time is shown in fig 14 b due to the large gradient of the pore water pressure near the anchor drainage from the anchor high pore water pressure to the zone radially low pore water pressure occurs hence the dissipation rate of the pore water pressure for the soil element near the anchor is faster the ratio of δu δu i is reduced to 0 5 0 3 and 0 1 with the dissipation time of 2 days 7 days and 60 days therefore about 2 mouths is required for the soil around the torpedo anchor to achieve a dissipation degree of 90 in essence the dissipation time of the pore water pressure depends primarily on the soil permeability the soil rigidity and the geometry of the structure sully et al 1999 hence an appropriate dissipation time should be reserved based on the above factors 3 6 theoretical framework estimating the final penetration depth by using the differential equation of motion shown in eq 6 the dynamic penetration process and the final penetration depth of the dia can be predicted for instance the dynamic penetration process of the omni max anchor is predicted by eq 6 and the results are plotted in fig 13 based on the differential equation of motion the effects of the anchor geometry the soil strength considering the strain rate effect and the hydrodynamic aspects on the final penetration depth of the dia are considered the theoretical model based on the differential equation of motion has also been applied to estimate the undrained shear strength of the soil based on the variation of acceleration of a free fall penetrometer during dynamic penetration in the seabed true 1976 morton et al 2015 stark et al 2017 chow et al 2017b another theoretical model to predict the final penetration depth of the dia is based on the anchor total energy o loughlin et al 2013 established the relationship between the final penetration depth of the torpedo anchor and the total energy which can be expressed as 12 z e d eff e total k d eff 4 1 p where d eff 4a f π 0 5 is the effective diameter of the anchor e total is the total energy of the anchor including the kinetic energy at the mudline and the gravitational energy relative to the final penetration depth and k is the strength gradient of the soil the best fit between the testing data in kaolin clay and eq 12 is obtained using p 3 as shown in fig 15 a compared with p 3 24 to fit the testing data in calcareous silt the strain rate parameter of the calcareous silt is higher than that of the kaolin clay hence the final penetration depth of the anchor in calcareous silt is shallower due to the more significantly enhancement of the strain rate effect for the plate shaped omni max anchor the percentage of the frictional resistance in total resistance is higher compared with that of the torpedo anchor hence kim and hossain 2015 modified eq 12 as 13 z e d eff q e total k e a s d eff 2 1 p where a s is the surface area of the omni max anchor and k e is the equivalent soil strength gradient s um kz e z e on the basis of eq 13 liu et al 2019b proposed a more comprehensive equation which can be expressed as 14 z e d eff a e total α c k eff a s d eff 2 b where 15 k eff k e 1 λ log v 0 d eff γ ref δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ a ξ 95 where ξ a is the average accumulated plastic shear strain the soil element is undergone during the dynamic penetration of the dia within the soil the value ξ a is suggested as 2 4 for the omni max anchor in liu et al 2019b by using eq 14 the effects of the adhesion coefficient strain rate and strain softening of the soil on the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor can be considered as shown in fig 15 b the best fit between the testing and numerical simulation data and eq 14 is obtained using a 2 48 b 0 36 and c 0 28 for the prediction of the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor in addition eq 14 can also be applied to predict the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor with a booster as shown in fig 15 b an example is presented herein to obtain the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor based on the energy based theoretical model i e eq 14 the strain rate and strain softening parameters of the soil are strain rate parameter λ 0 15 reference strain rate γ ref 0 1 s 1 remoulded strength ratio δ rem 0 33 accumulated plastic shear strain at 95 remoulding ξ 95 20 adhesion coefficient α 0 33 it can be concluded from section 2 5 that the maximum velocity the omni max anchor can reach is 18 36 m s during free fall in water with a rope 0 15 m in diameter given the impact velocity of the omni max anchor is 18 36 m s the anchor will achieve a final penetration of 13 61 21 24 m in the soil with strength gradient ranging 3 3 1 1 kpa m as shown in table 5 3 7 summary it is not difficult to obtain the final penetration depth of the dia within the seabed whereas there are still some aspects that are ambiguous including the relationship of the strain rate effect between the tip resistance and the frictional resistance the appropriate selection of an adhesion coefficient the soil flow mechanism surrounding the anchor during dynamic installation at very high velocity and so forth therefore further studies are needed with the aim of illuminating the anchor soil water interaction and accurately estimating the final penetration depth of the anchor challenges for simulating the dynamic penetration process of the dia by numerical models are how to simulate the anchor soil interaction with moving boundary though a reduction factor is adopted in cfx to model the effect of adhesion coefficient on the final penetration depth of the anchor the soil failure at the anchor soil interface cannot be simulated therefore more advanced numerical models should be developed to capture the anchor soil interaction properties with moving boundaries large deformations and very high shear strain rates 4 anchor mooring line soil interaction and holding capacity of dias 4 1 overview for dias the padeye is usually embedded within the seabed hence a portion of mooring line is embedded in the seabed which exhibits an inverse catenary profile due to the soil resistance acting on the mooring line neubecker and randolph 1995 as shown in fig 16 a the mooring line becomes steeper from the dip down point ddp to the padeye indicating the loading angle at the padeye β a is higher than the loading angle at the ddp mudline β 0 see fig 16 b the angle β a is a pivotal role affecting the holding capacity of the anchor tian et al 2015 liu et al 2016c 2017 which is usually unknown due to the intransparency of natural soils therefore it is necessary to illuminate the anchor mooring line soil interaction in order to accurately estimate the holding capacity of the anchor especially for the omni max anchor with complex motion trajectory and failure mode as shown in fig 16 b except for the loading angle the holding capacity of the anchor is affected by the initial embedment depth the consolidation of the soil around the anchor undergone cyclic loading and many other factors merifield et al 2003 yu et al 2011 han and liu 2017 moreover the trenching issue of the mooring line is paid more and more attention recently bhattacharjee et al 2014 colliat et al 2018 4 2 anchor mooring line soil interaction as mentioned above it is important to investigate the inverse catenary profile of the mooring line embedded within the seabed as the loading angle at the padeye is a key factor affecting the failure mode of the anchor the inverse catenary profile of the embedded mooring line can be expressed by 16 f a 1 μ 2 e μ β z β 0 cos β 0 μ sin β 0 cos β z μ sin β z 0 z f n d z where f a is the uplift load at the padeye μ is the ratio between the sliding resistance and the normal resistance of the soil on the mooring line β z is the loading angle at the depth of z and f n is the soil normal resistance on the mooring line eq 16 is termed as the chain equation which is established by neubecker and randolph 1995 from the ratio μ one can predict the motion mode of the mooring line if the mooring line cuts through the soil the soil resistance on the mooring line is primarily the normal resistance resulting in a low value of μ if the mooring line slides in the soil the percentage of the sliding resistance increases resulting in a high value of μ many experimental investigations indicated that the ratio μ is not a constant and has correlations with the motion mode of the mooring line degenkamp and dutta 1989 frankenmolen et al 2016 han and liu 2017 for instance the model testing results in han and liu 2017 indicate the ratio μ varies dramatically during the keying process of the omni max anchor as shown in fig 17 a from point 0 to point 1 the anchor is stable in the soil and the mooring line cuts through the soil gradually which results in an increase of the normal resistance and a decrease of the ratio μ from point 1 to point 2 the anchor is pulled upwards and forced to rotated simultaneously in the soil during which the mooring line is prone to slide in the soil and hence to increase the ratio μ from point 2 to point 3 the anchor dives deeper into the seabed and the motion mode of the mooring line transforms from sliding motion mode to normal motion mode which results in a gradual decrease of the ratio μ from point 3 to point 4 the anchor steadily dives deeper into the soil and the ratio μ approximately maintains a constant more discussion about the keying process of the omni max anchor will be find in section 4 5 the soil resistances mobilised along the mooring line can be presented by a yield envelope han and liu 2017 sun et al 2019 on the basis of model tests han and liu 2017 proposed global yield envelopes for the chain and rope respectively the yield points on the yield envelope are determined based on the measured uplift loads and loading angles at the mudline and at the padeye as shown in fig 17 b c the yield envelop of the mooring line can be expressed as 17 f n n f nmax n s f s n f smax n r 1 where f n n and f s n are normalised normal and tangential resistances on the mooring line and f nmax n and f smax n are the maximum normalised normal and tangential resistances for the chain the best fit is obtained by s 2 01 and r 2 31 for the rope the best fit is obtained by s 1 06 and r 2 75 given a proper value of μ the prediction accuracy of the inverse catenary profile of the mooring can be improved by using eq 16 4 3 time effect on the holding capacity of torpedo anchor a period of consolidation time is reserved after the dynamic penetration of the dia to allow dissipation of the excess pore water pressure which helps the re increase of the undrained shear strength and hence the improvement of the holding capacity the centrifuge tests by richardson 2008 indicated that the vertical holding capacity f v of the dpa mobilises an increase with increasing consolidation time as shown in fig 18 for instance with the consolidation time increasing from 27 days to 12 7 years the peak dimensionless vertical capacity f v peak w a increases from 1 64 to 3 55 in practical application it is impossible to allow the dissipation of excess pore water pressure to last for years and the dissipation degree of the excess pore water pressure should be estimated based on the soil consolidation coefficient stress history and the embedment depth of the anchor except for the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure the thixotropy of natural seabed sediments which refers to time dependent strength gain in soil at constant water content after remoulding mitchell 1960 yang and andersen 2016 al janabi and aubeny 2019 may also a positive factor to improve the holding capacity of the anchor however the dependence of the anchor holding capacity on the soil thixotropy has not systematically investigated in model tests to the authors knowledge there is no code or standard for calculating the holding capacity of dias hence more analyses should be conducted to calculate the anchor holding capacity considering the time effect including soil consolidation and thixotropy the effect of initial embedment depth on the vertical holding capacity of the dpa is also plotted in fig 18 as nc and over consolidated oc soils are characterised by increasing strength with depth a deeper embedment depth will result in a higher holding capacity of the anchor for instance as the initial embedment depth ratio z e h a increases from 1 55 to 2 55 the peak dimensionless vertical capacity experiences an increase from 2 47 to 4 06 o beirne et al 2015 4 4 capacity of torpedo anchor under combined loading condition when the torpedo anchor is pulled vertically the holding capacity is primarily provided by the frictional resistance along the anchor soil interface and the self weight of the anchor nevertheless when the anchor is inclined loaded the failure mode of the soil is changed the soil is subject to both normal force and sliding force i e combined loading condition if the loading angle at the padeye reduces to zero the anchor is pulled horizontally and is considered to rotate about a point near the tip and the holding capacity can be obtained by calculating the lateral soil resistance at each section of the anchor fu et al 2017 the normalised holding capacity at the padeye f a w a against the loading angle at the padeye β a is plotted in fig 19 a it can be seen that the variation of f a w a with the angle β a is limited except the results in kim and hossain 2016 indicating the holding capacity of the torpedo anchor is not largely affected by the loading angle at the padeye in kim and hossain 2016 the anchor is pulled out with a given loading angle after dynamic installation which is simulated by the cel analysis the calculation in the lagrangian phase is conducted with an explicit integration scheme and the material interface and boundaries are approximately tracked by defining the volume fractions of each material in the element therefore the simulation of the contact between the anchor and soil may be defective which results in the relative low capacity when the torpedo anchor is pulled up vertically the normalised vertical component f a v w a and horizontal component f a h w a of the holding capacity for the torpedo anchor is plotted in fig 19 b it should be noted that the anchor is wished in place in the ldfe analysis in o beirne et al 2015 hence the soil is not disturbed and the holding capacity of the anchor is higher the results derived from o beirne et al 2015 can be considered as the holding capacity after the fully dissipation of the excess pore water pressure 4 5 motion trajectory and capacity mobilisation of omni max anchor 4 5 1 methods to obtain the load displacement behaviour of the omni max anchor the complex trajectory and capacity mobilisation of the omni max anchor can be investigated by model tests ldfe analysis and plasticity analysis shelton 2007 reported that the anchor exhibits diving property under certain conditions based on the testing results in transparent soils but no details have been presented gaudin et al 2013 conducted centrifuge tests to investigate the keying process of the omni max anchor in nc kaolin clay and calcareous silt the keying process was stopped three times during one test such that the anchor embedment depth could be assessed by probing the soil at 1g liu et al 2019c proposed a testing method with the ability of directly obtaining the anchor trajectory a half anchor model is used and allowed to move against the glass of the testing box such that the anchor trajectory is captured by a digital camera set in front of the testing box as for ldfe numerical simulations the motion trajectory of the anchor was first studied by liu et al 2014 using the remeshing and interpolation technique with small strain ritss technique and the results indicate that the anchor exhibits diving property during keying more analyses about the anchor keying process are subsequently investigated using cel approach zhao et al 2016 kim and hossain 2017 and the chain equation i e eq 16 can be implemented in cel to consider the effect of mooring line on the anchor trajectory the plasticity analysis based on a yield envelope is a macro element force resultant model which can efficiently predict the load displacement behaviour of the anchor cassidy et al 2012 liu et al 2016c tian et al 2018 the yield envelope defines the allowable combination of loads on the anchor which is expressed as 18 n n n nmax s n m n mmax q n s n smax r 1 p 1 0 where n n n m and n s are the dimensionless normal rotational and sliding bearing capacity factors and n nmax n mmax and n smax are the ultimate dimensionless normal rotational and sliding bearing capacity factors the components p q r s in eq 18 determine the shape of the yield envelope which depend on the anchor geometry and the anchor embedment depth based on the yield envelope and the associated flow rule the motion trajectory and capacity mobilisation of the omni max anchor can be efficiently predicted 4 5 2 anchor trajectory and soil flow mechanism during keying typical motion trajectory of the omni max anchor derived from ldfe analysis by liu et al 2014 is plotted in fig 20 a together with the soil flow mechanism shown in fig 20 b the mooring line is first tensioned and the anchor is stable in the soil when the uplift load at the padeye is beyond the initial holding capacity of the anchor the anchor start to move upwards point 1 to point 2 the upward displacement dz c of the anchor centroid in the vertical direction is termed as the embedment loss which may jeopardize the holding capacity at the same time the anchor is forced to rotate due to the moment applied to the anchor by the uplift load at the padeye f a with the increase in the rotation angle α in the projected area of the anchor perpendicular to the uplift load at the padeye gradually increases which is positive to improve the holding capacity from fig 20 b it can be seen that the flow direction of the soil surrounding the anchor transforms from sliding failure mode to normal failure mode from point 1 to point 2 which is beneficial in improving the anchor holding capacity see fig 20 a attributed to the padeye offset e s and eccentricity e n relative to the load reference point lrp the anchor can dive deeper into the seabed from point 2 to point 3 the lrp is defined as the point where the moment is zero when the anchor is subject to pure normal or sliding resistance based on the flow direction of the soil shown in fig 20 b it can be concluded both normal and sliding resistances are acting on the anchor point 3 the sliding resistance which is emerged due to the padeye offset is disadvantageous to the anchor holding capacity however the padeye offset is a key factor to allow the anchor to dive which is beneficial in improving the anchor holding capacity due to the complementary effects of the padeye offset the pullout force at the padeye exhibits a little decrease from point 2 to point 3 with the anchor diving deeper from point 3 to point 4 the rotation angle maintains a constant the flow mechanism of the soil surrounding the anchor is similar to that of point 3 with the anchor diving deeper into stronger soils with higher undrained shear strength the pullout force at the padeye exhibits an increase to some extent it must be borne in mind that the loading angle at the padeye β a is not a constant when the mooring line is taken into consideration and increases gradually as the anchor dives deeper into the seabed with stronger strength therefore the anchor cannot dive indefinitely as shown in fig 21 the entire keying process of the omni max anchor is estimated by plasticity analysis han et al 2018 with the anchor diving deeper into the seabed it is more and more difficult for the mooring line to cut through the soil which will increase the loading angle at the padeye see fig 21 a the increase of the loading angle at the padeye will decrease the diving gradient of the anchor as shown in fig 21 b when the loading angle at the padeye is not varied with any further pull distance the anchor reaches the ultimate embedment depth after that the anchor moves horizontally in the soil and does not rotate any more the anchor capacity factor n a is defined as 19 n a f a s u c a p where s u c is the undrained shear strength of the soil at the anchor centroid and a p is the anchor projected area in the plane that is coplanar with the central line of the anchor and perpendicular to the loading arm the variation of the capacity factor with the angle α in β a is plotted in fig 21 c with the angle α in β a increasing from negative to zero the projected area a p increases gradually and the loading mode of the soil has transformed from sliding to normal mode which results in an increase in the capacity factor however due to the padeye offset the capacity factor reduces slightly with the angle α in β a continuously increasing to positive 4 5 3 key factors affecting the anchor diving property in essence the diving property of an anchor depends on the padeye offset cassidy et al 2012 tian et al 2015 liu et al 2016c 2017 herein the padeye offset angle θ p is used to represent the padeye offset which is described as 20 θ p tan 1 e s e n in addition it can be concluded from fig 21 that the loading angle of the mooring line plays an important role on the diving potential of the anchor han et al 2018 investigated effects of padeye offset angle θ p and loading angle at the mudline β 0 on the ultimate embedment depth of the omni max anchor using plasticity analysis and the results are plotted in fig 22 a it can be seen that the ultimate embedment depth ratio z c ult h a of the anchor centroid is relatively deep with the padeye offset angle ranging 15 25 and low loading angles at the mudline apparently the anchor with deep ultimate embedment depth will result in a high capacity as shown in fig 22 b numerous studies have suggested the optimised padeye offset angles for suction embedded plate anchors sepla and omni max anchors and the optimised values are listed in table 6 the summarised results in table 6 indicate the optimised padeye offset angle is about 20 which can provide some reference on the design of other types of anchors 4 6 prediction of the anchor holding capacity the holding capacity of the anchor is associated with the strength of the soil surrounding the anchor the embedment loss must be taken into consideration when predicting the holding capacity of the omni max anchor as indicated in section 3 6 the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor in the soil with s u 2 4 2 2z kpa is 16 04 m thus the embedment depth of the anchor centroid is z e c 11 14 m with the padeye offset angle θ p 25 the maximum capacity factor of the omni max anchor is n a 11 55 fig 21 c as shown in table 7 the capacity to weight ratio decreases from 11 42 to 9 61 as the loss of embedment increases from 1 m to 3 m 4 7 summary the holding capacity of a dia is time dependent which is associated with the thixotropy of the soil the cyclic loading history and the potential of soil consolidation a long term design approach considering the cyclic loading should be developed to extend the application of the dia from short term mooring systems to long term mooring systems in addition the potential of chain trenching should be deliberately taken into consideration for the long term capacity design of dias it is concluded from the above discussion that the plasticity analysis provides an efficient tool for the simulation of the anchor mooring line soil interaction however consideration must be given to the fact that the size of the yield envelop of the anchor in the current plasticity model is not varied and expands with the embedment depth of the anchor the bearing capacity factors n nmax n mmax and n smax of the anchor depend on the embedment depth and orientation of the anchor within the seabed hence it is necessary to develop more advanced plasticity models which can consider the variation of the yield envelop during the keying process of the anchor 5 conclusions this paper reviews the recent development of dias together with the dynamic installation and holding capacity of the anchors typical results from physical and numerical modelling are introduced including the hydrodynamic characteristics of the anchor the anchor soil water interaction during dynamic penetration and the holding capacity of the anchor on the basis of these investigations theoretical frameworks are summarised to predict the anchor free fall process in water and dynamic penetration process within the seabed due to the time efficient and cost effective properties of the dia it has been increasingly attracted by offshore wind turbines floating net cages wave and tidal energy converters and many other floating systems in order to improve the reliability of the dia further studies are drawn as following first further physical modelling should be carried out to illustrate the effects of mooring line and underground current on the verticality of the dia during free fall in water in addition a control system using to calibrate the anchor tilt during free fall in water may be an efficient tool in the future to improve the reliability of installing dias second novelty anchor types are urgently required to satisfy more complex soil conditions including sand silt and sandwiched seabed consequently advanced numerical models are needed to simulate the moving boundary between the anchor and the surrounding soil third the holding capacity of a dia is time dependent which is associated with the thixotropy of the soil the cyclic loading history and the potential of soil consolidation a long term design approach is needed to be developed to extend the application of the dia from short term mooring systems to long term mooring systems moreover more advanced numerical techniques are required to address more and more sophisticated offshore geotechnical problems the installation process of a dia includes very sophisticated issues associated with moving boundaries soil water structure interaction strain rate hardening and strain softening of the soil therefore more sophisticated large deformation numerical techniques are required to address the issues listed above and at the same time more subtle physical modelling should also be developed to validate the numerical model the keying process of the anchor within the seabed involves large displacement movement and rotation of the anchor hence further plasticity analysis with the ability considering the variation of the anchor yield envelope should be developed to predict the load displacement behaviour of the anchor within the seabed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

21951,this paper presents an overview of recent developments of the dynamically installed anchor dia which is self installed through its gravitational energy example results from the dynamic installation process and holding capacity of the dia are highlighted including the hydrodynamic characteristics of the anchor during free fall in water anchor soil water interaction during dynamic installation in the seabed and the anchor mooring line soil interaction when the anchor is undergone uplift loading on the basis of the present overview simplified theoretical models are summarised to

keywords offshore anchoring system anchor dynamic installation hydrodynamic characteristics penetration depth holding capacity 1 introduction 1 1 dynamically installed anchors exploration of hydrocarbon resources in deep and ultra deep waters has placed increasing reliance on floating facilities which are secured in position with mooring systems and anchors the dynamically installed anchor dia which is a self installed anchor provides a cost effective and time efficient solution for deepwater floating systems three types of dias the torpedo anchor deep penetrating anchor dpa and omni max anchor see fig 1 have been applied to offshore practical engineering in brazil the north sea the gulf of mexico gom and the gulf of guinea gog brandão et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2009 lieng et al 2010 bhattacharjee et al 2014 recently the concept of hybrid dia which is comprised of a plate shaped anchor and a follower booster is proposed with the aim of increasing the final penetration depth within the seabed and thus improving the holding capacity the follower booster plays a role of installation tool during the dynamic installation process and is retrieved after installation typical hybrid dias depicted in fig 1 are the dynamically embedded plate anchor depla light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla and dpaiii o loughlin et al 2014 chow et al 2017a tong et al 2020 primary dimensions and weights of varied dias are summarised in table 1 1 2 entire installation process of dias the entire installation process of a dia is divided into three phases as shown in fig 2 therefore three pertinent aspects should be paid attention when designing a dia first the verticality and impact velocity of the anchor are two key factors affecting the dynamic penetration process of the anchor within the seabed hence it is with significant importance to illustrate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the dia including the directional stability drag coefficient and so forth second accurate estimation of the final penetration depth of the anchor within the seabed is pivotal to assess the holding capacity the difficulties in estimating the final penetration depth of the anchor are quantifying the undrained shear strength of the soil at high strain rate hardening and large strain softening together with hydrodynamic aspects including water and soil drag on the anchor and potential water entrainment along the anchor soil interface third after dynamic installation the mooring line is tensioned with pre designed uplift load and the dia resists the uplift load through its self weight and soil resistance for the omni max anchor shown in fig 2 the padeye is offset from the anchor s centre line hence the anchor is subject to an anti clockwise moment which forces the anchor to rotate also termed as keying within the seabed in order to predict the complex load displacement behaviour of the anchor it is valuable to clarify the anchor mooring line soil interaction during keying 1 3 scope of this paper it is not possible to cover all studies associated with dias within the scope of this paper and the focus herein is on special hydrodynamic and geotechnical issues of dias that differ from other types of anchors this paper starts with a brief summary of present model testing technologies and numerical simulation approaches for the three installation stages of dias before discussing primary hydrodynamic characteristics of dias dynamic contact between the anchor and soil and anchor mooring line soil interaction then design principles for dias are abstracted and theoretical frameworks assessing the impact velocity and final penetration depth of dias are summarised finally further studies on the dia and advanced physical and numerical technologies required in considering the anchor mooring line soil water interaction are highlighted 2 hydrodynamic characteristics of dias 2 1 overview in order to determine the verticality and impact velocity of a dia in water it is vital to expect insights into the anchor s hydrodynamic characteristics drag coefficient directional stability and so forth for a given drag coefficient the drag force f d can be calculated by 1 f d 1 2 c d ρ a f v 2 where c d is the drag coefficient which depends on the fluid properties geometry of the projectile and the reynolds number ρ is the density of the fluid a f is the frontal area of the projectile and v is the relative velocity between the projectile and the fluid the differential equation of motion characterising the free fall process of the dia in water can be described as 2 m a m a w a f d a w w a 1 2 c d a w ρ w a f v 2 where m a is the anchor mass m is the added mass a is the acceleration w a is the anchor submerged weight in water f d a w is the water drag c d a w is the water drag coefficient and ρ w is the density of water therefore the fall velocity of the dia can be estimated by eq 2 the directional stability of a projectile during free fall in water can be judged on the basis of locations of the gravity centre cg and hydrodynamic centre ch as diagrammed in fig 3 the hydrodynamic force on the projectile is comprised of two parts the tangential component parallel to the central line i e the drag force f d a w and the normal component perpendicular to the central line i e the transversal force f n a w the point ch refers to the location on the projectile where the normal component f n a w would act to create the total moment if the location of ch is lower than cg the restoration moment m r with respect to cg induced by the normal component f n a w forces the projectile to further tilt once the projectile is inclined however if the location of ch is higher than cg the restoration moment m r will force the projectile to inversely rotate to the initial vertical direction when the projectile is inclined it can be seen from fig 3 that if the position ch is higher than cg the signs of the tilt angle δ t from the central line of the projectile to the vertical direction and the restoration moment m r are opposite and the projectile is stable by conducting free fall tests or tow tank tests the drag coefficient of a projectile can be determined based on eq 1 moreover the hydrodynamic characteristics of a projectile can be estimated by carrying out numerical simulations based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach the projectile is allowed to fall freely in water or is fixed in the calculation domain allowing the fluid to attack the projectile with a constant speed thus the drag coefficient and directional stability of the anchor are estimated 2 2 drag coefficient of dias the relationship of the drag coefficient of a dia or projectile and the reynolds number is plotted in fig 4 the reynolds number re is defined as 3 re ρ w l charac v υ where l charac is the characteristic length which is selected as the length of the dia or projectile and υ is the dynamic viscosity of the water it can be seen from fig 4 that the drag coefficient depends on 1 the reynolds number and 2 the anchor shape for instance the drag coefficient of the 0 fin torpedo anchor decreases from 0 75 to 0 23 with the reynolds number increasing from 104 to 106 and almost maintains a constant with the further increase of the reynolds number richardson 2008 the total drag on a projectile can be divided into two parts the pressure drag and the frictional drag the pressure drag resulted from the pressure difference at the tip and rear of the projectile depends on the projectile shape while the frictional drag depends on the reynolds number and the surface area of the projectile as reported by lewis 1988 the frictional drag coefficient of a plate is expressed as 0 075 logre 2 2 thus the frictional drag coefficient decreases with increasing reynolds number it can be concluded that the frictional drag has limited contribution to the total drag at high reynolds numbers hence the total drag primarily depends on the pressure drag therefore the drag coefficient derived from the reduced scale model tests can be used to present that in prototype scale under the condition that the frictional drag can be ignored as shown in fig 4 the drag coefficient of the torpedo anchor and omni max anchor maintains constant with the reynolds number re 106 the drag coefficient is largely affected by the anchor shape as shown in fig 4 for a torpedo shaped penetrometer used to dispose the radioactive waste in offshore sediments the drag coefficient is relatively low and ranges 0 15 0 18 attributed to the streamlined geometry of the projectile freeman et al 1984 the contracted rear of the projectile plays an important role in reducing the drag force as it can confine the streamlines in a relatively narrow region hence to reduce the water vortex the drag coefficient is 0 23 for a 0 fin torpedo anchor and is 0 67 for a 4 fin dpa richardson 2008 o beirne et al 2017 indicating the drag coefficient mobilises an increase with a more complex shape of the anchor for the plate shaped omni max anchor the drag coefficient ranges 0 76 1 0 cenac 2011 liu et al 2018a 2019a which is higher than that of the dpa or torpedo anchor due to the relatively light weight and high drag coefficient the impact velocity of the omni max anchor is about 19 m s zimmerman et al 2009 which is lower than 24 m s for the torpedo anchor de araujo et al 2004 2 3 directional stability of dias in model tests the entire motion history of the dia can be captured by a six degree accelerometer and gyroscope based on the micro electromechanical systems mems technique for instance in liu et al 2018a the trajectory of the omni max anchor in 1 30 reduced scale measured by a six degree accelerometer and gyroscope is plotted in fig 5 a it can be seen that the normalised horizontal displacements s x h a and s y h a s x and s y are horizontal displacements of the anchor increase with the increase in the normalised vertical displacement s z h a s z is the vertical displacement of the anchor indicating the anchor gradually inclines during free fall in water the tilt angle of the anchor is defined as the included angle between the central line of the anchor and the vertical direction as shown in fig 5 b the tilt angle maintains zero when the vertical velocity v z is less than 2 0 m s or the normalised vertical displacement s z h a is less than 0 89 and then increases monotonously with further increase in v z and s z h a when the tilt angle δ t reaches 3 the corresponding vertical velocity and normalised vertical displacement are 4 17 m s and 6 3 respectively with δ t 3 the vertical velocity increases further indicating the anchor has not reached the terminal velocity the instability of the omni max anchor is resulted from 1 the asymmetric structure of the mooring arm and b the non optimised topological structures of the flukes in cfd simulations by allowing the fluid to attack the dia with varied attack angles the restoration moment m r on the dia is obtained and hence the location of the hydrodynamic centre is determined therefore the directional stability of the dia can be assessed based on the locations of the hydrodynamic centre and gravity centre the directional stability of four torpedo anchors with varied shaft and fin aspect ratios are investigated by cfd numerical simulations in silva 2010 and the results are plotted in fig 6 a when the signs of the restoration moment coefficient c mr and the attack angle δ t are opposite the restoration moment will force the anchor to rotate back towards the vertical direction once the anchor is tilt indicating the anchor is in stable region in silva 2010 the torpedo anchor torp0 is a model which is already used in offshore engineering the torp1 is a larger model whose height is increased from 15 m to 21 m the torp2 is a modification model of torp1 with the fin geometry unchanged and shaft length increasing to 22 m and the torp3 is a modification model of torp2 with the fin width doubled and fin length half reduced from fig 6 a it can be seen that the directional stability of torp3 is well attributed to optimised design of the fins the aspect ratio of the fin is defined as the ratio of the effective width to the effect length of the fin as indicated by triantafyllou and hover 2003 a large aspect ratio of the fin is beneficial in increasing the distance from the hydrodynamic centre relative to anchor tip and hence to improve the directional stability if the rear fins of the torpedo anchor is buckled i e torp1d shown in fig 6 a the restoration moment coefficient in the unstable region increases significantly this indicates the directional stability of the anchor is deteriorated as the distorted fin affects the symmetry of the anchor for the omni max anchor the cfd simulation by liu et al 2019a indicates the anchor is in unstable region with the attack angle ranging 15 15 which is consistent with the testing results in liu et al 2018a a booster is put forward by liu et al 2018b with the aim of improving the directional stability and impact velocity of the omni max anchor the booster is attached to the tail of the omni max anchor using a shear pin which ensures the connection between the anchor and booster during free fall in water and separation of the booster from the anchor after dynamic installation by enlarging the fin width or by connecting a ring at the rear of the booster the directional stability of the hybrid anchor i e omni max anchor booster is improved as depicted in fig 6 b when the ratio of the ring diameter d r to the fluke width w a is d r w a 3 the hybrid anchor is in stable region moreover the drag coefficient of the hybrid anchor shown in fig 6 b is 1 06 which is a little higher than 0 87 of the omni max anchor this means that the gravitational energy of the booster can transform to the kinetic energy of the hybrid anchor as much as possible 2 4 drag coefficient of mooring line before releasing the dia the mooring line is pre released to the seabed as diagrammed in fig 2 when the anchor falls freely in water a portion of mooring line and the installation line are dragged to move together with the anchor which will reduce the anchor velocity therefore it is necessary to investigate the drag coefficient of the mooring line three types of mooring lines including the chain wire rope and fibre rope are usually used in practical engineering the drag coefficient of the mooring line c d l w is summarised in table 2 the drag coefficient of the wire rope or fibre rope is approximately 0 01 while is about 0 02 for the chain due to the relatively complex geometry o beirne et al 2017 liu et al 2018a for a given drag coefficient the drag force f d l w on the mooring line can be expressed as 4 f d l w 1 2 c d l w a charac l ρ w v 2 where a charac l is the characteristic area of the mooring line which is expressed as a charac l πd charac l l l d charac l is the characteristic diameter of the mooring line which is equal to the diameter of a cylinder in unit length with the same volume as the mooring line in unit length and l l is the length of mooring line that moves together with the anchor 2 5 theoretical framework estimating the free fall process of dias the free fall process of a dia in water incorporating the effect of mooring line can be expressed by the following differential equation of motion 5 m a m l m a w a w l f d a w f d l w where m l and w l are the mass and submerged weight of the mooring line that moves together with the anchor it has been illustrated in liu et al 2018a that the added mass term is minor compared with the anchor mass hence the added mass usually can be ignored without considering the mooring line the estimated impact velocities of the omni max anchor and torpedo anchor t98 are summarised in table 3 with release heights of 30 m 40 m and 50 m the impact velocities of the omni max anchor are 17 11 m s 18 20 m s and 18 87 m s for the torpedo anchor the impact velocities are 25 98 m s 30 38 m s and 33 55 m s with release height increasing from 50 m to 75 m and 100 m an example herein is presented to investigate the effect of mooring line on the impact velocity of the dia the anchor model is the omni max anchor with dry weight w a 380 kn and frontal area a f 1 9 m2 the data are cited from zimmerman et al 2009 the mooring line is the fibre rope with varied diameters d r spanning from 0 1 m to 0 25 m it is assumed that the submerged unit weight of the fibre rope is equal to the unit weight of water and the length of the mooring line that moves together with the anchor is equal to the vertical fall distance of the anchor given the drag coefficients of the anchor and mooring line are 0 87 and 0 01 the anchor velocity and vertical fall distance can be estimated by eq 5 and the predicted results are shown in fig 7 it is concluded that with the same vertical fall distance the anchor velocity mobilises an increase with decreasing mooring line diameters d r moreover the anchor velocity will reversely reduce beyond peak with the further increase in the vertical fall distance therefore an optimised release height is not only beneficial to avoid the anchor from inclining but also helpful to achieve a higher impact velocity 2 6 summary except for the directional stability the verticality of the dia during free fall in water has been widely paid attention in practical engineering the verticality of the dia during free fall in water is disturbed by the underground current arrangement of the mooring line and many other factors therefore a control system with the ability of calibrating the verticality of dias may be a valuable issue in the future actually some attempts have been conducted to control the verticality of the dia for instance silva et al 2017 designed four stabilizers a smaller plate relative to the fins with their ends pivotally attached to the fins of the torpedo anchor once the torpedo anchor is tilt the stabilizer located at the tilt direction will rotate around the pivotal axis and subject to drag force which forces the torpedo anchor to rotate back towards the vertical direction further experimental tests and numerical simulations should be carried out to investigate the efficiency and validity of the control system using to calibrate the verticality of dias 3 dynamic installation of dias within seabed 3 1 overview the dynamic penetration of a dia in seabed is a complex anchor soil water interaction process the accuracy of the estimated final penetration depth is obscured by two aspects first it is necessary to quantify the undrained shear strength of the soil incorporating the strain rate and strain softening effects at very high shear strain rate and large deformation second it is necessary to consider the hydrodynamic aspects resulted from the water drag soil drag and water entrainment along the anchor soil interface for instance the water drag has a potential to decrease the final penetration depth of the anchor whereas the water entrainment has a potential to decrease the adhesion factor at the anchor soil interface and increase the final penetration depth the resistances on the dia include the bearing resistance f t which is the summary of bearing resistances on anchor tip f tt and on the base of fins f tf the frictional resistance f f the buoyant force f b and the drag force f d which is the summary of the soil drag f d a s and water drag f d a w as shown in fig 8 the differential equation of motion governing the dynamic penetration of the dia in the seabed can be expressed as 6 m a m a w a f t f f f d f b the bearing and frictional resistances are expressed as 7 f t n c a tip s u 8 f f α a frict s u where n c is the bearing capacity factor a tip is the anchor soil contact area in the plane perpendicular to the centre axis of the anchor α is the adhesion coefficient at the anchor soil interface a frict is the anchor side area that submerged in the soil and s u is the undrained shear strength incorporating the strain rate and strain softening effects the undrained shear strength s u is described as 9 s u r f s f s u0 where r f is the strain rate factor s f is the strain softening factor and s u0 is the undrained shear strength at the reference shear strain rate prior to any softening the reference shear strain rate γ ref is usually valued based on the in situ tests used to assess the undrained shear strength cone penetration test cpt together with penetration tests of full flow penetrometers including t bar and ball are widely used to assess the undrained shear strength of seabed soils randolph et al 2005 2012 low et al 2010 attention must be paid that it is inevitable to avoid the soil disturbance in situ tests hence the derived undrained shear strength at the reference shear strain rate is the one with the strain softening effect been incorporated the undrained shear strength at the reference strain rate is termed as s u ref which can be considerably expressed as s u ref s f s u0 the analyses above indicate that each resistance on the dia needs to be clarified in order to accurately assess the final penetration depth of the dia in physical modelling field tests and laboratory model tests including centrifuge tests and 1g model tests have been conducted to investigate the dynamic interaction between the anchor and the surrounding soil medeiros 2002 o loughlin et al 2014 zimmerman et al 2009 hossain et al 2015 liu et al 2016a o beirne et al 2017 chang et al 2019 han et al 2019 and many others in centrifuge tests also termed ng test where n is the magnification of acceleration in centrifuge the undrained shear strength is equal to that in prototype and hence the impact velocity in ng test is equal to that in prototype in 1g model test the undrained shear strength is reduced to 1 λ l λ l is the prototype to model scale ratio compared to that in prototype to ensure the same dimensionless overburden stress ratio s u γ s z γ s is the submerged unit weight of the soil with that in prototype as the flow mechanism of the soil in the vicinity of the anchor depends on the dimensionless ratio s u γ s z han et al 2019 therefore the impact velocity in 1g test should be reduced to 1 λ l 0 5 compared to that in prototype according to the similarity requirements more similarity relationships for dynamic penetration of projectiles in clayey seabed are summarised in han et al 2019 except for physical modelling the dynamic installation process of the dia is also simulated by large deformation numerical approaches raie and tassoulas 2009 kim and hossain 2015 liu et al 2016b sabetamal et al 2016 liu and zhang 2017 liu et al 2019b and many others two categories of large deformation methods are adopted including the large deformation finite element ldfe method and the cfd method based on the numerical simulations parametric studies can be carried out to investigate the effects of varied factors on the final penetration depth of the dia these factors include the impact velocity anchor weight and shape soil strength characterisation and the anchor soil contact properties 3 2 factors influencing the final penetration depth herein an example is presented to illustrate the velocity variation of the dia during dynamic penetration within the seabed the anchor model is a 1 50 scale omni max anchor mass m a m 0 438 kg the subscribe m represents model scale and the subscribe pro in the following represents prototype and the soil sample is the normally consolidated nc kaolin clay with reference undrained shear strength s u ref 2 4z kpa han et al 2019 the anchor impacts the soil with an impact velocity of v 0 m 2 69 m s 19 m s in prototype the variation of the velocity versus penetration depth which are integrated by the acceleration data measured by a mems accelerometer is depicted in fig 9 a the undrained shear strength with shallow embedment is relatively low in nc clay hence the velocity continuously increases as the anchor initially impacts the soil when the anchor penetrates into deeper soil with higher undrained shear strength the soil resistances acting on the anchor increase notably and the anchor starts to decelerate once the soil resistance is beyond the submerged weight of the anchor when the velocity reduces to zero the anchor is rest in the soil the final penetration depths of dias with varied impact velocities undrained shear strengths anchor weights and shapes are compared in fig 9 b with higher impact velocity and heavier weight the final penetration depth experiences an increase attributed to the increase in the kinetic and gravitational energies the final penetration depth of the dia is greatly affected by the undrained shear strength for instance the final penetration depth of the torpedo anchor is about 16 4 18 7 m in the calcareous silt with undrained shear strength s u ref 2 3z kpa while increases to 28 4 31 0 m in kaolin clay with s u ref 1 0 85z kpa hossain et al 2014 in addition the anchor shape also plays an important role on the final penetration depth for instance the omni max anchor weighs 80 2 t and the undrained shear strength of the calcareous silt is s u ref 3 3z kpa in gaudin et al 2013 and these conditions are similar to that in hossain et al 2015 the torpedo anchor weighs 107 t and the undrained shear strength s u ref 7 5 2 9z kpa the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor is 10 3 13 2 m which is much lower than 16 4 18 7 m of the torpedo anchor the surface area of the plate shaped omni max anchor is greater than the torpedo anchor which will result in a high frictional resistance and hence a shallow penetration depth most studies are concentrated to the dynamic penetration of the dia in clayey seabed as the dia is preliminarily applied to deep or ultra deep water regions with clayey sediments brandão et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2009 for the dynamic installation of the dia in sandy seabed associated results are quite limited the dynamic penetration depth of the 0 fin torpedo anchor in different soils was investigated by richardson 2008 and the results are plotted in fig 10 a the final penetration depth ratio z e h a of the anchor in silica flour mean particle size d 50 45 μm is only 0 36 with an impact velocity of 28 7 m s which is considerably lower than 2 1 2 8 in kaolin clay with impact velocities of 10 8 30 8 m s this can be largely attributed to the high resistance of the silica flour which becomes stronger when subjected to shear at a constant volume i e under undrained conditions the ratio z e h a of the anchor in calcareous sand is 0 6 1 5 with impact velocities of 0 29 8 m s due to the high compressibility of the calcareous sand the end bearing and frictional resistances on the anchor in calcareous sand is lower than that in silica flour it is acknowledged that for a cone penetrometer the friction ratio r f defined as the ratio of the sleeve friction to the cone resistance is relatively low in sand and relatively high in clay lunne et al 1997 therefore the end bearing resistance plays a more dominant role on the final penetration depth for the anchor in sand than that in clayey seabed chow et al 2017a designed a plate shaped dia i e dpaiii shown in fig 1 whose flukes are tapered to reduce the frontal area and hence to reduce the end bearing resistance which is efficient to increase the final penetration depth in sand a follower which can be retrieved after installation is connected at the anchor rear to increase the final penetration depth within the seabed centrifuge tests have been conducted to investigate the final penetration depth of the dpaiii in sand with different relative densities and the results are plotted in fig 10 b the soil resistance increases notably with increasing relative density d r which avoids the anchor from penetrating deeper into the seabed overall the dpaiii with small size may be an efficient alternative for small scale floating structures such as the offshore wind turbines net cages and wave and tidal energy converters in shallow waters the seabed sediments are more complex and spread with sand silt and clay hence more advanced anchor types should be proposed and more comprehensive studies should be carried out in the future 3 3 contact simulation between anchor and soil a key issue associated with the dynamic penetration of a dia in clayey seabed is how to simulate the adhesion friction at the anchor soil interface the adhesion friction means the frictional resistance along the anchor surface is not dependent on the normal stress but depends on the undrained shear strength i e eq 8 currently two three dimensional numerical tools have been used to simulate the dynamic geotechnical issues of a projectile the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel approach in the finite element package abaqus kim and hossain 2015 liu et al 2016b and the cfd software ansys cfx liu and zhang 2017 liu et al 2018b the two numerical models above cannot directly simulate the adhesion friction at the interface between the projectile and the surrounding soil in the cel analysis a coulomb friction formulation is adopted and a limited shear stress τ max can be specified in kim and hossain 2015 a very high coulomb friction coefficient is set to allow the limited shear stress to control the shear failure at the anchor soil interface in which the limited shear stress is specified as the product of the adhesion coefficient and the undrained shear strength at a depth the anchor can reach with frictionless contact in the cfd analysis the fluid is modelled as non newtonian eulerian fluid material and the shear stress of the fluid on the basis of fluid mechanics approach is the undrained shear strength in geotechnical mechanics framework the structure fluid interface is set as walls free slip walls with α 0 and no slip walls with α 1 0 to simulate the adhesion friction with varied adhesion coefficients a reduction factor is set for the one row fluid element just outside the structure hawlader et al 2015 liu et al 2019b hence the undrained shear strength just outside the structure is αs u in addition the soil in both cel and cfd analyses is modelled as undrained by the use of total stress analyses by performing cfd simulations the dynamic penetration process of an omni max anchor with a booster i e hybrid anchor with varied adhesion coefficients was investigated in liu et al 2019b and the results are plotted in fig 11 the mass ratio of booster to anchor is 1 1 and the undrained shear strength of the soil is s u0 2 4 3z kpa in cfd simulations the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor mobilised an increase from 14 4 m to 18 4 m with the adhesion coefficient decreasing from 1 0 to 0 1 the adhesion coefficient at the anchor soil interface depends on the surface roughness of the anchor the soil properties the water entrainment and many other factors therefore in practical engineering the geotechnical engineer should carefully consider the above factors and select a proper adhesion coefficient the dynamic penetration result of the omni max anchor from the cel analysis kim and hossain 2015 is also plotted in fig 11 for comparison with the same adhesion coefficient of α 0 33 the final penetration depths of the omni max anchor and hybrid anchor are 12 1 m and 16 4 m respectively indicating the booster can efficiently increase the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor in addition it should be noted that the water above the seabed is not simulated in the cel analysis and is considered in the cfd analysis hence the anchor initially accelerates in the cel analysis and decelerates monotonously in the cfd analysis due to the water drag more hydrodynamic aspects associated with the dynamic penetration process of a dia will be discussed later 3 4 strain rate and strain softening during dynamic installation the strain softening effect should be taken into consideration for large deformation geotechnical problems such as the in situ cyclic penetration of full flow penetrometers the trench development of steel catenary risers and the dynamic penetration of dias zhou and randolph 2009 dutta and hawlader 2019 liu et al 2019b the strain rate effect should be considered for dynamic geotechnical issues with very high strain rate such as the installation of pipelines free fall penetrometers and dias therefore both the strain rate and strain softening effects should be incorporated into the undrained shear strength for the dynamic installation of dias the strain softening and strain rate factors in eq 9 are expressed as 10 s f δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ ξ 95 11 r f 1 λ γ γ ref semi logarithmic model a r f γ γ ref β power law model b r f 1 λ arcsinh γ γ ref inverse hyperbolic sine model c r f 1 η γ γ ref β 1 η herschel bulkley model d where δ rem is the remoulded strength ratio of the fully remoulded shear strength to the undisturbed shear strength ξ is the accumulated plastic shear strain ξ 95 is the accumulated plastic shear strain for the soil to undergo 95 remoulding γ is the shear strain rate γ ref is the reference shear strain rate which is calculated as the ratio of the penetration rate to the diameter of the penetrometer for cone t bar and ball penetration tests low et al 2010 and λ β λ η and β are parameters charactering the strain rate effects four different models shown in eq 11 can be used to characterise the strain rate effect of the soil for example if the strain rate factor λ 0 2 in the semi logarithmic model i e eq 11a it means that the undrained shear strength exhibits an increase by up to 20 with a ten fold increase in the shear strain rate in numerical simulations the strain rate and strain softening of the soil is indicative of the soil disturbance caused by the dynamic penetration of dias in cel a user defined subroutine vusdfld by fortran in abaqus has been used to incorporate the strain rate and strain softening effects into the undrained shear strength dassault systémes 2014 in each step the incremental shear strain of the soil is obtained and hence the shear strain rate and accumulated plastic shear strain are obtained in cfx a dynamic viscosity is defined using cfx command language ccl expression in which the strain rate and strain softening effects are included the accumulated plastic shear strain is obtained by solving the transport equation in cfx and the shear strain rate is calculated based on the rate of deformation tensor zakeri and hawlader 2013 the evolution of the undrained shear strength surrounding the omni max anchor during dynamic installation is plotted in fig 12 a together with the instantaneous velocity vectors plotted in fig 12 b the ratio s u s u0 in fig 12 a represents the ratio of the undrained shear strength incorporating the strain rate and strain softening effects to that prior to any strain softening at the reference shear strain rate it can be seen that for the soil around the anchor tip the ratio s u s u0 1 indicating the undrained shear strength is enhanced due to the very high shear strain if the shear strain of the soil is macroscopically defined as the ratio of the anchor velocity to the fluke thickness the shear strain is in the magnitude of 102 s 1 which is three orders higher of the reference shear strain rate 10 1 s 1 low et al 2010 the ratio s u s u0 is less than unit for the soil in the vicinity of the anchor side indicating the strain softening due to large deformation plays a dominant role on the undrained shear strength the undrained shear strength of the soil surrounding the loading arm has even experienced a half remoulding as shown in fig 12 a therefore both the strain rate and strain softening effects of the soil should be considered in order to accurately estimate the final penetration depth of the dia previous studies associated with cpt have indicated that the strain rate effect r f shaft for the shaft resistance is higher than the strain rate effect r f tip for the tip resistance which are summarised in table 4 the thickness of the shear band in the vicinity of the cone shaft is very thin hence the strain rate effect of the shaft resistance is more notable for the omni max anchor the back analysed results in han et al 2019 suggest the relationship between the strain rate effect r f2 for the frictional resistance and the strain rate effect r f1 for the tip resistance is r f2 1 4r f1 by adopting r f2 1 4r f1 the theoretical predicting results using the differential equation of motion i e eq 6 are well consistent with the model testing results measured by the mems accelerometer as shown in fig 13 3 5 hydrodynamic aspects during dynamic penetration the water drag has a potential to reduce the final penetration depth of the dia whereas the water entrainment along the anchor soil interface has a potential to reduce the frictional resistance and hence to increase the final penetration depth to investigate the water entrainment along the anchor soil interface the omni max anchor is released twice from air and from water respectively han et al 2019 and the results are plotted in fig 13 with the same impact velocity the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor which is released in water is deeper than that released in air indicating the effect of water entrainment effect on the final penetration depth overweighs the water drag effect based the differential equation of motion shown in eq 6 the besting fitting results are obtained by using α 0 21 to consider the potential reduction of the adhesion coefficient at the anchor soil interface due to the water entrainment effect which is lower than α 0 33 inverse of the sensitivity of kaolin clay used in model test without the water entrainment effect though the water entrainment effect is prone to increase the final penetration depth of the dia the trapped water along the anchor soil interface is detrimental to the holding capacity of the anchor moreover the excess pore water pressure developed due to the dynamic installation of the anchor will reduce the effective stress of the soil which will also reduce the holding capacity of the anchor sabetamal et al 2016 investigated the dynamic penetration of a 0 fin torpedo anchor in which effective stress analysis is achieved by using the modified cam clay mcc model to capture the generation and dissipation of the pore water pressure in the soil surrounding the anchor due to the symmetry of the 0 fin anchor the axi symmetric model was used the final penetration depth of the anchor is 13 8d a d a is the diameter of the shaft as shown in fig 14 a the dissipation curves of the excess pore water pressure δu for the soil elements located at a depth of 13 4d a and different radial distances from the anchor are also depicted in fig 14 a the initial pore water pressure δu i t 0 decreases with increasing radial distances from the anchor indicating the degree of the soil disturbance reduces with increasing radial distances from the anchor when the radial distance is 4d a the initial pore water pressure is minor hence the soil can be considered as non disturbed the normalised pore water pressure δu δu i versus dissipation time is shown in fig 14 b due to the large gradient of the pore water pressure near the anchor drainage from the anchor high pore water pressure to the zone radially low pore water pressure occurs hence the dissipation rate of the pore water pressure for the soil element near the anchor is faster the ratio of δu δu i is reduced to 0 5 0 3 and 0 1 with the dissipation time of 2 days 7 days and 60 days therefore about 2 mouths is required for the soil around the torpedo anchor to achieve a dissipation degree of 90 in essence the dissipation time of the pore water pressure depends primarily on the soil permeability the soil rigidity and the geometry of the structure sully et al 1999 hence an appropriate dissipation time should be reserved based on the above factors 3 6 theoretical framework estimating the final penetration depth by using the differential equation of motion shown in eq 6 the dynamic penetration process and the final penetration depth of the dia can be predicted for instance the dynamic penetration process of the omni max anchor is predicted by eq 6 and the results are plotted in fig 13 based on the differential equation of motion the effects of the anchor geometry the soil strength considering the strain rate effect and the hydrodynamic aspects on the final penetration depth of the dia are considered the theoretical model based on the differential equation of motion has also been applied to estimate the undrained shear strength of the soil based on the variation of acceleration of a free fall penetrometer during dynamic penetration in the seabed true 1976 morton et al 2015 stark et al 2017 chow et al 2017b another theoretical model to predict the final penetration depth of the dia is based on the anchor total energy o loughlin et al 2013 established the relationship between the final penetration depth of the torpedo anchor and the total energy which can be expressed as 12 z e d eff e total k d eff 4 1 p where d eff 4a f π 0 5 is the effective diameter of the anchor e total is the total energy of the anchor including the kinetic energy at the mudline and the gravitational energy relative to the final penetration depth and k is the strength gradient of the soil the best fit between the testing data in kaolin clay and eq 12 is obtained using p 3 as shown in fig 15 a compared with p 3 24 to fit the testing data in calcareous silt the strain rate parameter of the calcareous silt is higher than that of the kaolin clay hence the final penetration depth of the anchor in calcareous silt is shallower due to the more significantly enhancement of the strain rate effect for the plate shaped omni max anchor the percentage of the frictional resistance in total resistance is higher compared with that of the torpedo anchor hence kim and hossain 2015 modified eq 12 as 13 z e d eff q e total k e a s d eff 2 1 p where a s is the surface area of the omni max anchor and k e is the equivalent soil strength gradient s um kz e z e on the basis of eq 13 liu et al 2019b proposed a more comprehensive equation which can be expressed as 14 z e d eff a e total α c k eff a s d eff 2 b where 15 k eff k e 1 λ log v 0 d eff γ ref δ rem 1 δ rem e 3 ξ a ξ 95 where ξ a is the average accumulated plastic shear strain the soil element is undergone during the dynamic penetration of the dia within the soil the value ξ a is suggested as 2 4 for the omni max anchor in liu et al 2019b by using eq 14 the effects of the adhesion coefficient strain rate and strain softening of the soil on the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor can be considered as shown in fig 15 b the best fit between the testing and numerical simulation data and eq 14 is obtained using a 2 48 b 0 36 and c 0 28 for the prediction of the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor in addition eq 14 can also be applied to predict the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor with a booster as shown in fig 15 b an example is presented herein to obtain the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor based on the energy based theoretical model i e eq 14 the strain rate and strain softening parameters of the soil are strain rate parameter λ 0 15 reference strain rate γ ref 0 1 s 1 remoulded strength ratio δ rem 0 33 accumulated plastic shear strain at 95 remoulding ξ 95 20 adhesion coefficient α 0 33 it can be concluded from section 2 5 that the maximum velocity the omni max anchor can reach is 18 36 m s during free fall in water with a rope 0 15 m in diameter given the impact velocity of the omni max anchor is 18 36 m s the anchor will achieve a final penetration of 13 61 21 24 m in the soil with strength gradient ranging 3 3 1 1 kpa m as shown in table 5 3 7 summary it is not difficult to obtain the final penetration depth of the dia within the seabed whereas there are still some aspects that are ambiguous including the relationship of the strain rate effect between the tip resistance and the frictional resistance the appropriate selection of an adhesion coefficient the soil flow mechanism surrounding the anchor during dynamic installation at very high velocity and so forth therefore further studies are needed with the aim of illuminating the anchor soil water interaction and accurately estimating the final penetration depth of the anchor challenges for simulating the dynamic penetration process of the dia by numerical models are how to simulate the anchor soil interaction with moving boundary though a reduction factor is adopted in cfx to model the effect of adhesion coefficient on the final penetration depth of the anchor the soil failure at the anchor soil interface cannot be simulated therefore more advanced numerical models should be developed to capture the anchor soil interaction properties with moving boundaries large deformations and very high shear strain rates 4 anchor mooring line soil interaction and holding capacity of dias 4 1 overview for dias the padeye is usually embedded within the seabed hence a portion of mooring line is embedded in the seabed which exhibits an inverse catenary profile due to the soil resistance acting on the mooring line neubecker and randolph 1995 as shown in fig 16 a the mooring line becomes steeper from the dip down point ddp to the padeye indicating the loading angle at the padeye β a is higher than the loading angle at the ddp mudline β 0 see fig 16 b the angle β a is a pivotal role affecting the holding capacity of the anchor tian et al 2015 liu et al 2016c 2017 which is usually unknown due to the intransparency of natural soils therefore it is necessary to illuminate the anchor mooring line soil interaction in order to accurately estimate the holding capacity of the anchor especially for the omni max anchor with complex motion trajectory and failure mode as shown in fig 16 b except for the loading angle the holding capacity of the anchor is affected by the initial embedment depth the consolidation of the soil around the anchor undergone cyclic loading and many other factors merifield et al 2003 yu et al 2011 han and liu 2017 moreover the trenching issue of the mooring line is paid more and more attention recently bhattacharjee et al 2014 colliat et al 2018 4 2 anchor mooring line soil interaction as mentioned above it is important to investigate the inverse catenary profile of the mooring line embedded within the seabed as the loading angle at the padeye is a key factor affecting the failure mode of the anchor the inverse catenary profile of the embedded mooring line can be expressed by 16 f a 1 μ 2 e μ β z β 0 cos β 0 μ sin β 0 cos β z μ sin β z 0 z f n d z where f a is the uplift load at the padeye μ is the ratio between the sliding resistance and the normal resistance of the soil on the mooring line β z is the loading angle at the depth of z and f n is the soil normal resistance on the mooring line eq 16 is termed as the chain equation which is established by neubecker and randolph 1995 from the ratio μ one can predict the motion mode of the mooring line if the mooring line cuts through the soil the soil resistance on the mooring line is primarily the normal resistance resulting in a low value of μ if the mooring line slides in the soil the percentage of the sliding resistance increases resulting in a high value of μ many experimental investigations indicated that the ratio μ is not a constant and has correlations with the motion mode of the mooring line degenkamp and dutta 1989 frankenmolen et al 2016 han and liu 2017 for instance the model testing results in han and liu 2017 indicate the ratio μ varies dramatically during the keying process of the omni max anchor as shown in fig 17 a from point 0 to point 1 the anchor is stable in the soil and the mooring line cuts through the soil gradually which results in an increase of the normal resistance and a decrease of the ratio μ from point 1 to point 2 the anchor is pulled upwards and forced to rotated simultaneously in the soil during which the mooring line is prone to slide in the soil and hence to increase the ratio μ from point 2 to point 3 the anchor dives deeper into the seabed and the motion mode of the mooring line transforms from sliding motion mode to normal motion mode which results in a gradual decrease of the ratio μ from point 3 to point 4 the anchor steadily dives deeper into the soil and the ratio μ approximately maintains a constant more discussion about the keying process of the omni max anchor will be find in section 4 5 the soil resistances mobilised along the mooring line can be presented by a yield envelope han and liu 2017 sun et al 2019 on the basis of model tests han and liu 2017 proposed global yield envelopes for the chain and rope respectively the yield points on the yield envelope are determined based on the measured uplift loads and loading angles at the mudline and at the padeye as shown in fig 17 b c the yield envelop of the mooring line can be expressed as 17 f n n f nmax n s f s n f smax n r 1 where f n n and f s n are normalised normal and tangential resistances on the mooring line and f nmax n and f smax n are the maximum normalised normal and tangential resistances for the chain the best fit is obtained by s 2 01 and r 2 31 for the rope the best fit is obtained by s 1 06 and r 2 75 given a proper value of μ the prediction accuracy of the inverse catenary profile of the mooring can be improved by using eq 16 4 3 time effect on the holding capacity of torpedo anchor a period of consolidation time is reserved after the dynamic penetration of the dia to allow dissipation of the excess pore water pressure which helps the re increase of the undrained shear strength and hence the improvement of the holding capacity the centrifuge tests by richardson 2008 indicated that the vertical holding capacity f v of the dpa mobilises an increase with increasing consolidation time as shown in fig 18 for instance with the consolidation time increasing from 27 days to 12 7 years the peak dimensionless vertical capacity f v peak w a increases from 1 64 to 3 55 in practical application it is impossible to allow the dissipation of excess pore water pressure to last for years and the dissipation degree of the excess pore water pressure should be estimated based on the soil consolidation coefficient stress history and the embedment depth of the anchor except for the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure the thixotropy of natural seabed sediments which refers to time dependent strength gain in soil at constant water content after remoulding mitchell 1960 yang and andersen 2016 al janabi and aubeny 2019 may also a positive factor to improve the holding capacity of the anchor however the dependence of the anchor holding capacity on the soil thixotropy has not systematically investigated in model tests to the authors knowledge there is no code or standard for calculating the holding capacity of dias hence more analyses should be conducted to calculate the anchor holding capacity considering the time effect including soil consolidation and thixotropy the effect of initial embedment depth on the vertical holding capacity of the dpa is also plotted in fig 18 as nc and over consolidated oc soils are characterised by increasing strength with depth a deeper embedment depth will result in a higher holding capacity of the anchor for instance as the initial embedment depth ratio z e h a increases from 1 55 to 2 55 the peak dimensionless vertical capacity experiences an increase from 2 47 to 4 06 o beirne et al 2015 4 4 capacity of torpedo anchor under combined loading condition when the torpedo anchor is pulled vertically the holding capacity is primarily provided by the frictional resistance along the anchor soil interface and the self weight of the anchor nevertheless when the anchor is inclined loaded the failure mode of the soil is changed the soil is subject to both normal force and sliding force i e combined loading condition if the loading angle at the padeye reduces to zero the anchor is pulled horizontally and is considered to rotate about a point near the tip and the holding capacity can be obtained by calculating the lateral soil resistance at each section of the anchor fu et al 2017 the normalised holding capacity at the padeye f a w a against the loading angle at the padeye β a is plotted in fig 19 a it can be seen that the variation of f a w a with the angle β a is limited except the results in kim and hossain 2016 indicating the holding capacity of the torpedo anchor is not largely affected by the loading angle at the padeye in kim and hossain 2016 the anchor is pulled out with a given loading angle after dynamic installation which is simulated by the cel analysis the calculation in the lagrangian phase is conducted with an explicit integration scheme and the material interface and boundaries are approximately tracked by defining the volume fractions of each material in the element therefore the simulation of the contact between the anchor and soil may be defective which results in the relative low capacity when the torpedo anchor is pulled up vertically the normalised vertical component f a v w a and horizontal component f a h w a of the holding capacity for the torpedo anchor is plotted in fig 19 b it should be noted that the anchor is wished in place in the ldfe analysis in o beirne et al 2015 hence the soil is not disturbed and the holding capacity of the anchor is higher the results derived from o beirne et al 2015 can be considered as the holding capacity after the fully dissipation of the excess pore water pressure 4 5 motion trajectory and capacity mobilisation of omni max anchor 4 5 1 methods to obtain the load displacement behaviour of the omni max anchor the complex trajectory and capacity mobilisation of the omni max anchor can be investigated by model tests ldfe analysis and plasticity analysis shelton 2007 reported that the anchor exhibits diving property under certain conditions based on the testing results in transparent soils but no details have been presented gaudin et al 2013 conducted centrifuge tests to investigate the keying process of the omni max anchor in nc kaolin clay and calcareous silt the keying process was stopped three times during one test such that the anchor embedment depth could be assessed by probing the soil at 1g liu et al 2019c proposed a testing method with the ability of directly obtaining the anchor trajectory a half anchor model is used and allowed to move against the glass of the testing box such that the anchor trajectory is captured by a digital camera set in front of the testing box as for ldfe numerical simulations the motion trajectory of the anchor was first studied by liu et al 2014 using the remeshing and interpolation technique with small strain ritss technique and the results indicate that the anchor exhibits diving property during keying more analyses about the anchor keying process are subsequently investigated using cel approach zhao et al 2016 kim and hossain 2017 and the chain equation i e eq 16 can be implemented in cel to consider the effect of mooring line on the anchor trajectory the plasticity analysis based on a yield envelope is a macro element force resultant model which can efficiently predict the load displacement behaviour of the anchor cassidy et al 2012 liu et al 2016c tian et al 2018 the yield envelope defines the allowable combination of loads on the anchor which is expressed as 18 n n n nmax s n m n mmax q n s n smax r 1 p 1 0 where n n n m and n s are the dimensionless normal rotational and sliding bearing capacity factors and n nmax n mmax and n smax are the ultimate dimensionless normal rotational and sliding bearing capacity factors the components p q r s in eq 18 determine the shape of the yield envelope which depend on the anchor geometry and the anchor embedment depth based on the yield envelope and the associated flow rule the motion trajectory and capacity mobilisation of the omni max anchor can be efficiently predicted 4 5 2 anchor trajectory and soil flow mechanism during keying typical motion trajectory of the omni max anchor derived from ldfe analysis by liu et al 2014 is plotted in fig 20 a together with the soil flow mechanism shown in fig 20 b the mooring line is first tensioned and the anchor is stable in the soil when the uplift load at the padeye is beyond the initial holding capacity of the anchor the anchor start to move upwards point 1 to point 2 the upward displacement dz c of the anchor centroid in the vertical direction is termed as the embedment loss which may jeopardize the holding capacity at the same time the anchor is forced to rotate due to the moment applied to the anchor by the uplift load at the padeye f a with the increase in the rotation angle α in the projected area of the anchor perpendicular to the uplift load at the padeye gradually increases which is positive to improve the holding capacity from fig 20 b it can be seen that the flow direction of the soil surrounding the anchor transforms from sliding failure mode to normal failure mode from point 1 to point 2 which is beneficial in improving the anchor holding capacity see fig 20 a attributed to the padeye offset e s and eccentricity e n relative to the load reference point lrp the anchor can dive deeper into the seabed from point 2 to point 3 the lrp is defined as the point where the moment is zero when the anchor is subject to pure normal or sliding resistance based on the flow direction of the soil shown in fig 20 b it can be concluded both normal and sliding resistances are acting on the anchor point 3 the sliding resistance which is emerged due to the padeye offset is disadvantageous to the anchor holding capacity however the padeye offset is a key factor to allow the anchor to dive which is beneficial in improving the anchor holding capacity due to the complementary effects of the padeye offset the pullout force at the padeye exhibits a little decrease from point 2 to point 3 with the anchor diving deeper from point 3 to point 4 the rotation angle maintains a constant the flow mechanism of the soil surrounding the anchor is similar to that of point 3 with the anchor diving deeper into stronger soils with higher undrained shear strength the pullout force at the padeye exhibits an increase to some extent it must be borne in mind that the loading angle at the padeye β a is not a constant when the mooring line is taken into consideration and increases gradually as the anchor dives deeper into the seabed with stronger strength therefore the anchor cannot dive indefinitely as shown in fig 21 the entire keying process of the omni max anchor is estimated by plasticity analysis han et al 2018 with the anchor diving deeper into the seabed it is more and more difficult for the mooring line to cut through the soil which will increase the loading angle at the padeye see fig 21 a the increase of the loading angle at the padeye will decrease the diving gradient of the anchor as shown in fig 21 b when the loading angle at the padeye is not varied with any further pull distance the anchor reaches the ultimate embedment depth after that the anchor moves horizontally in the soil and does not rotate any more the anchor capacity factor n a is defined as 19 n a f a s u c a p where s u c is the undrained shear strength of the soil at the anchor centroid and a p is the anchor projected area in the plane that is coplanar with the central line of the anchor and perpendicular to the loading arm the variation of the capacity factor with the angle α in β a is plotted in fig 21 c with the angle α in β a increasing from negative to zero the projected area a p increases gradually and the loading mode of the soil has transformed from sliding to normal mode which results in an increase in the capacity factor however due to the padeye offset the capacity factor reduces slightly with the angle α in β a continuously increasing to positive 4 5 3 key factors affecting the anchor diving property in essence the diving property of an anchor depends on the padeye offset cassidy et al 2012 tian et al 2015 liu et al 2016c 2017 herein the padeye offset angle θ p is used to represent the padeye offset which is described as 20 θ p tan 1 e s e n in addition it can be concluded from fig 21 that the loading angle of the mooring line plays an important role on the diving potential of the anchor han et al 2018 investigated effects of padeye offset angle θ p and loading angle at the mudline β 0 on the ultimate embedment depth of the omni max anchor using plasticity analysis and the results are plotted in fig 22 a it can be seen that the ultimate embedment depth ratio z c ult h a of the anchor centroid is relatively deep with the padeye offset angle ranging 15 25 and low loading angles at the mudline apparently the anchor with deep ultimate embedment depth will result in a high capacity as shown in fig 22 b numerous studies have suggested the optimised padeye offset angles for suction embedded plate anchors sepla and omni max anchors and the optimised values are listed in table 6 the summarised results in table 6 indicate the optimised padeye offset angle is about 20 which can provide some reference on the design of other types of anchors 4 6 prediction of the anchor holding capacity the holding capacity of the anchor is associated with the strength of the soil surrounding the anchor the embedment loss must be taken into consideration when predicting the holding capacity of the omni max anchor as indicated in section 3 6 the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor in the soil with s u 2 4 2 2z kpa is 16 04 m thus the embedment depth of the anchor centroid is z e c 11 14 m with the padeye offset angle θ p 25 the maximum capacity factor of the omni max anchor is n a 11 55 fig 21 c as shown in table 7 the capacity to weight ratio decreases from 11 42 to 9 61 as the loss of embedment increases from 1 m to 3 m 4 7 summary the holding capacity of a dia is time dependent which is associated with the thixotropy of the soil the cyclic loading history and the potential of soil consolidation a long term design approach considering the cyclic loading should be developed to extend the application of the dia from short term mooring systems to long term mooring systems in addition the potential of chain trenching should be deliberately taken into consideration for the long term capacity design of dias it is concluded from the above discussion that the plasticity analysis provides an efficient tool for the simulation of the anchor mooring line soil interaction however consideration must be given to the fact that the size of the yield envelop of the anchor in the current plasticity model is not varied and expands with the embedment depth of the anchor the bearing capacity factors n nmax n mmax and n smax of the anchor depend on the embedment depth and orientation of the anchor within the seabed hence it is necessary to develop more advanced plasticity models which can consider the variation of the yield envelop during the keying process of the anchor 5 conclusions this paper reviews the recent development of dias together with the dynamic installation and holding capacity of the anchors typical results from physical and numerical modelling are introduced including the hydrodynamic characteristics of the anchor the anchor soil water interaction during dynamic penetration and the holding capacity of the anchor on the basis of these investigations theoretical frameworks are summarised to predict the anchor free fall process in water and dynamic penetration process within the seabed due to the time efficient and cost effective properties of the dia it has been increasingly attracted by offshore wind turbines floating net cages wave and tidal energy converters and many other floating systems in order to improve the reliability of the dia further studies are drawn as following first further physical modelling should be carried out to illustrate the effects of mooring line and underground current on the verticality of the dia during free fall in water in addition a control system using to calibrate the anchor tilt during free fall in water may be an efficient tool in the future to improve the reliability of installing dias second novelty anchor types are urgently required to satisfy more complex soil conditions including sand silt and sandwiched seabed consequently advanced numerical models are needed to simulate the moving boundary between the anchor and the surrounding soil third the holding capacity of a dia is time dependent which is associated with the thixotropy of the soil the cyclic loading history and the potential of soil consolidation a long term design approach is needed to be developed to extend the application of the dia from short term mooring systems to long term mooring systems moreover more advanced numerical techniques are required to address more and more sophisticated offshore geotechnical problems the installation process of a dia includes very sophisticated issues associated with moving boundaries soil water structure interaction strain rate hardening and strain softening of the soil therefore more sophisticated large deformation numerical techniques are required to address the issues listed above and at the same time more subtle physical modelling should also be developed to validate the numerical model the keying process of the anchor within the seabed involves large displacement movement and rotation of the anchor hence further plasticity analysis with the ability considering the variation of the anchor yield envelope should be developed to predict the load displacement behaviour of the anchor within the seabed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

21952,this paper addresses a state of the art navigation system aided by an intelligent velocity model for autonomous underwater vehicle auv it s critical to obtain a precise navigation for the safety and effectiveness of auv missions the reliability of auv navigation related sensors becomes particularly important while the accuracy of sensors especially the doppler velocity log dvl which is easy to be interfered affects navigation accuracy directly however standard auv does not have redundant velocity sensors once dvl is invalid caused by fish movement sound scattering or dvl overrange it will have a catastrophic effect on auv missions to improve navigation robustness and avoid the effects of dvl dropouts an intelligent velocity model is proposed to assist navigation by using optimally pruned extreme learning machine the performance of model aided navigation system is evaluated on data from our research platform sailfish 210 auv during sea trials on the high seas of yellow sea which achieve 0 5 navigation accuracy in addition the intelligent velocity model without modifying the model parameters is more flexible in model acquisition than the traditional vehicle dynamic model when auv sensor distribution and auv mass change results show that it is possible to improve accuracy and robustness of navigation as a redundant velocity information for standard auv graphical abstract to improve navigation robustness and avoid the effects of dvl dropouts an intelligent velocity model is proposed to assist navigation by using optimally pruned extreme learning machine for standard auv without redundant velocity sensors as output variables bottom relative velocity of auv can be calculated by the water relative velocity of auv obtained by the auv dynamic vehicle model and the current velocity the input variables including the propeller rotation rate rudder elevator heading pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and depth are determined we train the data set including input and output variables when dvl is valid to get a reliable velocity when the dvl is detected dropouts or failures the velocity from proposed intelligent velocity model instead of dvl is used to assist navigation without increasing hardware cost a sensor function software is provided for auv underwater navigation to a certain extent high precision navigation results can be obtained and the robustness of the system is enhanced image 1 keywords standard auv underwater navigation intelligent velocity model redundant sensor 1 introduction auv an important equipment for human submarine exploration and development plays vital role in ocean development as artificial satellite does in space exploration improvements on sensor technology and navigation algorithms are crucial for the development and application of auv kinsey et al 2006 paull et al 2014 auvs are generally divided into three types leonard and bahr 2016 one is the low cost auv equipped with an attitude and heading reference system ahrs to provide angle acceleration angular velocity and a flow meter to obtain a measurement of their forward speed another is the standard auv equipped with a doppler velocity log dvl compared to the low cost auv when the dvl is able to obtain bottom tracking an accurate vehicle referenced velocity is available and the navigation accuracy improves by an order of magnitude the third is the high end auv equipped with a fiber optic gyro fog sensor instead of a simple magnetic compass when the dvl can obtain a bottom relative velocity high end auv is able to improve the navigation accuracy by two orders of magnitude otherwise vehicle s velocity is able to be obtained by linear acceleration sensors which cause a decrease of navigation accuracy miller et al 2010 the reliability of auv s navigation related sensors becomes particularly important since dvl is easy to be interfered by fish movement sound scattering and dvl overrange when dvl fails or inaccurate measurement results are obtained a navigation method that can effectively reduce drift is required for position correction a simple way is to isolate the dvl velocity and navigate with the velocity value of the previous moment but this will lead to the accumulation error of position another method is to use the velocity provided by the dynamic model nouri et al 2018 nouri and valadi 2017 featherstone 2014 prestero 2001 evans and nahon 2004 to assist navigation but this model can only provide the water relative velocity and the solution to hydrodynamic coefficients in the model is complex the idea of dynamic model aided navigation was originally proposed by koifman and bar itzhack koifman and bar itzhack 1999 in 1999 simulations proved that it is feasible based on the kalman filter kf using the aircraft dynamics model to correct the output of the low cost inertial navigation system ins vasconcelos et al presented and simulated navigation based on helicopter dynamic model in 2006 and results verified the feasibility of model assisted navigation vasconcelos et al 2006 although these studies are aimed at air navigation it is a useful exploration for model assisted navigation m morgado et al introduced the dynamic model into underwater vehicle navigation in 2007 morgado et al 2007 their results showed that vehicle dynamic aiding low cost inertial navigation method had a significant improvement on the navigation system kongsberg began its research on the use of dynamic model assisted navigation for the hugin auv in 2007 firstly they established a dynamic model of single degree of freedom and three degrees of freedom for hugin 4500 based on sea trial data in 2007 hegrenaes et al 2007 then they used the dynamic model for inertial navigation assistance in 2007 and 2008 results showed that the linear velocity of the model output was almost the same as dvl velocity hegrenæs et al 2007 hegrenas et al 2008 finally they evaluated model aided navigation with actual sea trial data in 2011 after estimating and compensating for the ocean current velocity results showed that the dynamic model can significantly suppress the ins navigation error hegrenaes and hallingstad 2011 kinsey et al reported single degrees of freedom nonlinear dynamic model based state estimators for the navigation and results showed superior performance of proposed method kinsey et al 2014 arnold utilized information from the vehicle model during dvl drop outs and data denial validated the method for dvl dropouts arnold and medagoda 2018 from these existing studies the key to auv dynamic model aided navigation is the accuracy of the model however the dynamic model of auv is quite complicated which is generally an ordinary differential equation with parameters established according to the motion state under certain hypothetical situations there are many unknown parameters and they are difficult to solve precisely especially some of the hydrodynamic parameters moreover when the payload of auv varies or their shapes changes the corresponding model parameters also need to be updated so it is necessary to re solve the model parameters when using the dynamic vehicle model to assist navigation it is generally assumed that the direction and size of current velocity remain unchanged in a short time the current velocity is superimposed on the water relative velocity using dynamic model in view of the complex parameters to be solved for the dynamic model the need to recalculate these parameters when the auv changes slightly humphreys and watkinson 1978 blevins 1979 sahoo et al 2020 and the current velocity does not take into account the influencing factors other than angle we propose the intelligent velocity model shown in fig 1 according to the dynamic model we can get the water relative velocity and extract the variables that affect the water relative velocity as part of the input add the variables that affect the current velocity together as the input and take the bottom relative velocity of dvl as the output variable op elm miche et al 2010 is presented by miche y et al compared with support vector machine svm suykens and vandewalle 1999 smola and schölkopf 2004 os elm lim et al 2013 and elm huang et al 2006 ding et al 2015 op elm is more suitable to generate the intelligent velocity module for auv in this paper then we train the data set including input and output variable to get a reliable velocity model during dvl is valid the model velocity is used to assist navigation during dvl dropouts this paper is organized as follows we continue in the next section with a review of our research platform sailfish 210 auv then we present the intelligent velocity model in section 3 the sea trial results and analysis are given in section 4 to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed algorithm finally in section 5 we come to the conclusion 2 the research platform sailfish 210 auv our research platform is mainly divided into deck unit and auv onboard shown in fig 2 the deck unit is mainly used for deck personnel to control the auv and auv consists of four cabins navigation sensor cabin main control cabin battery cabin and power cabin the mainly sensors we used in this paper contain attitude and heading reference systems ahrs doppler velocity log dvl intelligent pressure sensors ips global positioning system gps rudder elevator and propeller the specifications of the auv are displayed in table 1 the functions of auv system mainly include sensor data acquisition autonomous navigation and path planning auv motion and attitude control communication between auv and deck unit then three parts about sailfish 210 auv are as follows notation and coordinate system onboard sensors and navigation methodology 2 1 notation and coordinate system all of the coordinate systems used in this paper belong to cartesian reference coordinate system which is an orthogonal right handed coordinate system shown in fig 3 let b denotes vehicle coordinate system whose origin is body fixed at the gravity center of auv and axes coincide with the principal axes of auv o x i points to the forward of auv o y i points to the starboard axis of auv and o z i points down let n denotes navigation coordinate system or local geographic coordinate system whose origin is fixed in the center of the vehicle and axes coincide with the principal axes of auv o z i points to the center of the earth o x i points to the geographical north pole and o y i points to the geographical east pole this coordinate system is usually called the coordinate system of the north east down ned due to the installation characteristics of dvl it s coordinate system and the auv coordinate system have an rotation angular which needs to be rotated to the auv coordinate system shown in fig 4 the coordinate system between dvl and auv has the same z axis orientation and x o y plane but the x and y axes rotate 45 relative to the auv s axis for reducing the effect of attitude angle and increasing the dvl effective velocity range the conversion relationship is as shown in the following equation 2 1 v x b v y b v z b 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 1 v x d v l v y d v l v z d v l where v x b v y b and v z b are triaxial velocity in body coordinate system v x d v l v y d v l and v z d v l are triaxial velocity in dvl sensor coordinate system after the conversion from the sensor coordinate system to vehicle coordinate system we convert information from vehicle coordinate system to navigation coordinate system 2 2 r cos ξ y cos ξ z cos ξ y sin ξ

y where zf ξ x lk ξ y and ghkl ξ z represent roll pitch and yaw respectively r represents the rotation from vehicle coordinate system to navigation coordinate system we use r to convert velocity and acceleration from b to n in saifish 210 auv 2 3 v x n v y n v z n r v x b v y b v z b a x n a y n a z n r a x b a y b a z b where v x n v y n v z n a x n a y n and a z n represent triaxial velocity and acceleration in navigation coordinate system respectively v x b v y b v z b a x b a y b and a z b represent three axis velocity and acceleration in vehicle coordinate system respectively 2 2 onboard sensors for sailfish 210 auv control architecture of sailfish 210 auv is shown in fig 5 limited by power consumption cost and space the sailfish 210 auv is equipped with four onboard navigation sensors ahrs dvl ips and gps whose location is shown in fig 2 ahrs can provide acceleration angular velocity and orientation triaxial orientation consists of roll pitch and heading whose calculation is based not only on the magnetic field data obtained by the magnetometer but also on the angular velocity and acceleration obtained by the gyroscope and accelerometer gps is used to provide current position communicating with all available satellite positioning systems ips provides pressure and depth at current position according to the voltage change and the seawater density dvl an active sonar is used to measure bottom relative velocities derived from the doppler shift between seafloor echo and emitted acoustic waves several parameters of dvl are shown in table 2 due to the acoustic characteristics of the dvl the measured values are prone to inaccuracy or failure if the sound waves of dvl hit the moving fish dvl data may have a large error moreover if auv passes through a sea floor gully or a sea area where the water depth changes significantly dvl cannot obtain valid velocity data due to the distance between dvl and seafloor exceeds the dvl sensor range shown in fig 6 the above situation will cause the dvl data to be inaccurate or even invalid and bring uncorrectable error to auv localization 2 3 navigation methodology for sailfish 210 auv there are two types of localization information one is the direct position provided by gps when there are enough satellites available and the other is the calculated position generated by the data of dvl and ahrs using extend kalman filter welch et al 1995 the flowchart of auv navigation is shown in fig 7 when auv sails on the surface as long as gps data is valid we can get the corrected position information by integrating the gps information into the calculated position when auv sails underwater the gps signal is attenuated quickly without gps position assistance we can only calculate position information through ahrs and dvl since the dvl is susceptible to be interfered and there is no redundant velocity sensor in standard auv system the response becomes very important during dvl dropouts if gps is valid on the surface auv can also navigate according to the position provided by gps otherwise methods of acquiring speed to provide speed for navigation are needed the conventional solution is usually that the velocity continues to use the dvl data of the previous moment however we have no idea about the failure duration of dvl so it may lead to large positioning errors during long fault time of dvl another solution is to use a dynamic model which uses water relative velocity to navigate for auv referring to the dynamic vehicle model we propose an intelligent velocity model for auv to assist navigation during dvl dropouts or failures 3 the intelligent vehicle model for auv due to the complexity of dynamic parameters solving and the difficulty of dynamic equations gertler and hagen 1967a feldman 1979 modifying caused by the changes of auv weight and gravity center when there is different load in auv we propose an intelligent velocity model based on dynamic vehicle model as a software to assist navigation which is intelligent and simple to modify the parameters when we change the shape or mass of auv the intelligent velocity model we proposed can be trained in real time during the dvl is valid and the bottom relativre velocity can be obtained to navigate by model output during the dvl is invalid 3 1 input and output variables of the intelligent velocity model as output variables bottom relative velocity is the final purpose of proposed intelligent velocity model bottom relative velocity of auv can be calculated by the water relative velocity of auv obtained by the typical dynamic vehicle model and the current velocity martinez et al 2015 measured by acoustic doppler current profilers adcp or calculated manually since the sailfish auv is not equipped with adcp to output the current velocity we choose to calculate the current speed from the data obtained 3 1 1 input variables for water relative velocity as shown in fig 4 the main hull of auv is a body of streamlined revolution the tail fin is cruciform the left and right sides are symmetrical and the upper and lower sides are approximately symmetrical for the convenience of modeling we consider auv as a rigid body featherstone 2014 but the model of underwater vehicle is still fairly sophisticated and there are many unknown parameters to be solved we plan to give a 3 dof dynamic model to describe submarine motion in surge rocking and yawing before the model we set some assumptions that 1 auv is considered as a rigid body 2 current is irrotational and two dimensional 3 the fluid is unbounded and uniform the equation gertler and hagen 1967b of motion eom is usually represented as the following vector form 3 1 m r b v c r b v v τ r b where v u v r is the decomposition of the velocity vector in vehicle coordinate system u and v are the x forward and y starboard speeds of the auv respectively and r is the angular velocity of the rotation around the normal v u v r is the derivative of velocity v u and v are the x forward and y starboard acceleration of the auv respectively and r is the angular velocity τ r b x y n is external forces and moments x and y are axial force and lateral force on auv respectively and n is yawing external moment m r b and c r b represent the inertia matrix of rigid body system and the corresponding matrix of coriolis centripetal 3 2 m r b m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 i z c r b 0 0 m v 0 0 m u m v m u 0 where m is the mass of auv in liquid and i z is the rigid body moment of inertia generated around the z axis the right hand side of equation 3 1 can be written as 3 3 x x u u x u x u u u u y v v y r r r x δ δ u u δ r t 2 δ r b 2 δ e p 2 δ e s 2 u 2 x v r v r x v v v 2 x r r r 2 b w s i n ξ y x n u n 1 w u x b x n n n n y y v v y r r y v y v v v v y r y r r r x

buoyancy of auv in the same liquid n w the propeller rotation rate and the wake fraction number x y z hydrodynamic coefficients 3 dof dynamic model for sailfish 210 auv is calculated after bringing equation 3 2 and equation 3 3 to equation 3 1 after solved the unknown parameters named hydrodynamic coefficients we can use the above mentioned vehicle model to obtain the unknown variables such as forward and starboard water relative velocities according to the known variables of rudder elevator pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and propeller rotation rate so input variables for water relative velocity are the propeller rotation rate pitch roll the rudder angle and the elevator angle 3 1 2 input variables for current velocity when calculating the current velocity we apply the following assumptions that 1 auv is considered as a rigid body with constant mass 2 auv is immersed in unbounded fluid 3 the fluid is uniform and incompressible 4 the current velocity is irrotational and direction and size of current velocity remain unchanged in a short time we decompose the original current velocity into the ned coordinate system and then rotate it to the vehicle coordinate system 3 4 v x c b v y c b c o s ξ z s i n ξ z s i n ξ z c o s ξ z v x c n v y c n 3 5 v x c n v y c n cos σ sin σ v c r a w where σ and v c r a w denote the angle to north and size of current velocity v x c n and v y c n represent north and east velocity in ned coordinate system v x c b and v y c b are the x forward and y starboard velocity in vehicle coordinate system and ξ z is heading since we assume that the current velocity is constant irrotational at the same depth we choose depth as the input variable rather than the size and direction of the flow velocity so input variables for current velocity are heading and depth in conclusion the input and output variables of proposed intelligent velocity have been determined the propeller rotation rate rudder elevator heading pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and depth are input variables and the output variables are x forward and y starboard bottom relative velocity in vehicle coordinate system 3 2 methodology for intelligent velocity model according to the input and output variables determined above a velocity model is constructed which is trained using the op elm algorithm 3 2 1 review of training methods although the result of extreme learning machine elm is the unique smallest norm solution in the least square solutions which can reach the minimum training error problems arise when there are unrelated or correlated variables in the training data set to solve this problem an algorithm for reducing the sensitivity and improving the robustness through effectively pruning potentially useless neurons in single hidden layer feed forward network slfn is proposed three steps of op elm algorithm are shown in fig 8 the main idea of elm algorithm belonging to slfn is the random initialization of slfn weights and biases rather than the traditional learning of these weights through back propagation which reduces the computational time by several orders of magnitude consider a set of m distinct samples x i y i where x i r n and y i r m a mathematically model of standard slfn with n hidden neurons is described as 3 6 f n x i 1 n β i g w i x j b i 1 j m where β i r m represents the output weights connecting the ith hidden neurons and output neurons w i r m represents the input weights connecting the ith hidden neurons and input neurons and b i represents the threshold of the ith hidden neuron the standard slfn with n hidden nodes and it s activation function g x can approximate these n samples with zero error which means that there exist β i w i and b i so that 3 7 i 1 n β i g w i x j b i y j 1 j m equation 3 7 can be written compactly as h β y where 3 8 h w 1 w n b 1 b n x 1 x m g w 1 x 1 b 1 g w n x 1 b n g w 1 x m b 1 g w n x m b n m n 3 9 β b 1 t b n t n m a n d y y 1 t y m t m m where h is the hidden layer output matrix of the neural network and the ith column of h is the output of the ith hidden node about the input if the activation function g x is infinitely differentiable the number of hidden nodes n is required to be less than or equal to the number of sample m huang et al 2006 after obtain the hidden layer output matrix h output weight β is calculated by moore penrose inverse of h matrix h prasad and bapat 1992 and target value y 3 10 β ˆ h y where β ˆ is the unique smallest norm solution in the least square solutions which can reach the minimum training error multiresponse sparse regression mrsr similä and tikka 2005 is an extension of the least angle regression lars algorithm we denote x x 1 x m the n m regressor matrix after mrsr a model y ˆ k x w k is obtained by adding each column of x one by one where y ˆ k y ˆ 1 k y ˆ p k represents the target approximation of the model and w k represents the weight matrix which has k nonzero rows at kth step of mrsr for each update there will be a new non zero row and a new regression matrix column added to the model after ranking the hidden layer neurons by mrsr the optimal pruning of neurons is carried out by loo verification method so that the model is trained with the optimal number of neurons in order to reduce the time consuming of loo in data sets with a large number of samples the prediction sum of squares press statistics were used by providing the following formula for the error calculation of loo 3 11 ε p r e s s y i h i b i 1 h i p h i t where p is denoted as p h t h 1 and h is the hidden layer matrix finally through evaluating the error of loo and the number of hidden layer neurons used the final number of neurons used in the model is determined 3 2 2 intelligent velocity model for auv the intelligent velocity model we proposed is shown in fig 9 which combines the current velocity and the water relative velocity as follows input variables contain the propeller rotation rate rudder elevator heading pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and depth the output variables are x forward and starboard bottom relative velocity in vehicle coordinate system we train the data set including input and output variables when dvl is valid to get a reliable velocity and the bottom velocity can be obtained by model output to assist navigation during dvl dropouts the training process is roughly as follows 1 using elm algorithm to construct a single hidden layer network 2 ranking the importance of hidden layer nodes based on multiresponse sparse regression 3 determining the number of hidden layer neurons by pruning the low importance hidden layer nodes during the underwater sailing of the auv the training set can be continuously expanded as long as the dvl does not detect the fault data finally when the dvl is detected dropouts or failures the velocity from proposed intelligent velocity model instead of dvl is used to assist navigation without increasing hardware cost a sensor function software is provided for auv underwater navigation to a certain extent high precision navigation results can be obtained and the robustness of the system is enhanced 4 experimental results and analysis in order to evaluate the performance and validation of the proposed algorithm the intelligent velocity model has been applied to sailfish auv and a set of sea trials were performed during the yellow sea mission the overview of experimental setup including research platform and data process is given in section 4 1 the selection process of our vehicle model method is presented in section 4 2 the experimental results of navigation with and without model assistance are described in section 4 3 4 1 experimental setup as our research platform sailfish 210 auv equipped with many sections including navigation module control module emergency module and battery module shown in fig 5 the navigation module including dvl ahrs ips and gps four sensors conforms to the configuration of standard auv leonard and bahr 2016 whose location is shown in fig 2 once dvl is invalid or dvl data failure there is a catastrophic effect on auv missions in order to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed velocity model sea trials were carried out on the high seas of the yellow sea in august and september 2016 shown in fig 10 auv is required to sail for several minutes at different pitch roll heading rudder angle elevator angle depth and propeller rotation rate before a formal mission begins during the underwater sailing of auv the experimental dataset samples obtained by the above onboard sensors can be added to the training set for intelligent velocity model training as long as dvl data is valid the input variables determined in chapter 3 2 are input into the intelligent velocity model during dvl dropouts and the output velocity of the model is used as the final velocity to replace the dvl data for navigation 4 2 the selection process of our vehicle model in order to get the optimal intelligent velocity model this section performs the regression algorithm selection of the velocity model yoan miche et al miche et al 2010 conducted experimental comparisons on 11 different open source datasets using two thirds of the whole set for training and one thirds of the whole set for test comparing with support vector machine multilayer perceptron gardner and dorling 1998 tang et al 2015 gaussian process quiñonero candela and rasmussen 2005 op elm and elm on these regression data base on the computational times and mean square error of test results we can see that elm based algorithm has advantages in running time which can ensure the real time processing of auv data during operation we intend to select the most suitable regression algorithm for our sea trials data from svm elm os elm and op elm we use the information obtained by the sailfish auv during the high seas voyage in the yellow sea to make data sets we select variables such as propeller rotation rate rudder elevator heading pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and depth as input the forward and the starboard bottom relative velocity as output one half of the whole data set is used as training set and the other half of the whole data set is used as test set mean and standard deviation after 50 times of the training time test time and two output values are compared by elm svm os elm op elm with different activation functions since the output of os elm svm and elm can only select a single variable their training time is the sum training times of the two outputs which is the same as test time moreover we use different activation function for three elm based algorithms for convenience we only show the best results of two activation functions for them we use mean and standard deviation to measure whether the regression algorithms are suitable for our sea trials mean value is used to indicate the central position of the data and standard deviation is a measure of the average dispersion of a set of data a larger standard deviation represents a large difference between most values and their average values and a smaller standard deviation means that these values are closer to the average value mean and standard deviation after 50 times of the training time and test time with different neurons are shown in table 3 we can see that with the increase of the neurons number the mean of train time increases and time of elm is the shortest in addition the performance of svm is similar to that of oselm when the neurons number is 50 mean and standard deviations of root mean square error after 50 times of forward and starboard velocity with different neurons are shown in table 4 we can see that the results are minimally affected by the number of neurons the rmse mean of elm and os elm is particularly larger than that of op elm and so is the standard deviation when the number of neurons is 20 the accuracy and stability of the three algorithms are the best so we will mainly analyze the model output when the number of neurons is 20 comparison of forward and starboard velocity in different regression methods with 20 neurons are shown in fig 11 a and b are the forward velocity c and d are the starboard velocity we can see that the velocity trend of the svm and op elm is consistent with that of the dvl velocity and the later works better but both elm and os elm have large errors and the maximum error up to 5 m s detailed information of velocity will be showed later fig 12 shows one step error of velocity in different regression methods with 20 neurons where a and b are the one step error of forward velocity c and d are one step error of the starboard velocity as can be seen from the figure op elm has the smallest one step error in which the fitting error of forward velocity is 0 2 m s and that of starboard velocity is 0 1 m s svm performs similarly to op elm in starboard velocity but fitting error of forward velocity up to 0 4 m s the error trend of os elm and elm behave similar the maximum error of forward speed is 4 8 m s and the maximum error of starboard speed is up to 5 7 m s root mean square error of velocity in different regression methods with 20 neurons is shown in fig 13 where a and b are the rmse of forward velocity c and d are the rmse of the starboard velocity according the figure op elm has the smallest rmse in which the fitting rmse of forward velocity is between 0 8 and 0 14 m s and that of starboard velocity is between 0 04 and 0 08 m s followed by svm the error trend of os elm and elm is the same where the rmse of forward velocity is between 1 and 1 8 m s and that of starboard velocity is between 1 5 and 2 4 m s figs 11 13 are obtained from the same set of sea trial data which is a square of 12 000 data for testing the black solid line represents the measured value of dvl the blue line represents the data of the elm using the activation function sig the red pecked line represents the data of the elm using the activation function sin the green dashed line represents the data of the os elm using the activation function sig the yellow line represents the data of the os elm using the activation function sin the magenta solid line represents the data of the op elm using the activation function g the cyan solid line represents the data of the op elm using the activation function lg and the blue black solid line represents the data of svm considering the training time test time velocity fitting results one step speed error and rmse op elm is more suitable for the regression of our sea trial data set followed by svm so we intend to select op elm algorithm as our regression algorithm of the intelligent velocity model to train the velocity model with 20 hidden layer neurons 4 3 experimental results this section evaluates the performance of the intelligent velocity model and dvl the comparison between trajectories obtained by the velocity using intelligent velocity model and trajectory generated by the dvl velocity are shown in fig 14 we assume that the trajectory generated by the dvl velocity is used as ground truth a shows the trajectory of auv using intelligent velocity model and dvl b and c show one step error and rmse between trajectory generated by intelligent velocity model and ground truth respectively d is the accuracy of intelligent velocity model relative to the ground truth from fig 14 a we can see that the trajectory obtained by velocity of the op elm is much closer to the trajectory obtained by dvl than svm and the trajectory is about 3600 m from the figure of one step error and rmse we can see that the largest one step error is 35 m and the largest rmse is 15 m in op elm however the largest one step error is 190 m and the largest rmse is 75 m in svm combined with the above performance we finally choose op elm as the method of intelligent velocity model the value of accuracy is large before 2000 steps due to the small value of the distance finally the trajectory accuracy of intelligent velocity model can achieve 0 5 when the fault data of dvl is detected proposed intelligent speed model can be used to obtain a reasonable velocity according to the information of the auv instead of the dvl velocity for robust navigation 5 conclusions and future work with the rapid development of auvs human beings are increasingly exploring and understanding the ocean precise navigation is still a major challenge for underwater platforms therefore research on high precision and high robustness navigation methods are the key to improving auv performance the proposed intelligent vehicle model which provides speed when dvl data is detected to be invalid or faulty is more flexible than traditional vehicle dynamic model without increasing hardware cost it provides a redundant velocity software to enhance the robustness of navigation system the results of sea trials demonstrate the

21952,this paper addresses a state of the art navigation system aided by an intelligent velocity model for autonomous underwater vehicle auv it s critical to obtain a precise navigation for the safety and effectiveness of auv missions the reliability of auv navigation related sensors becomes particularly important while the accuracy of sensors especially the doppler velocity log dvl which is easy to be interfered affects navigation accuracy directly however standard auv does not have redundant velocity sensors once dvl is invalid caused by fish movement sound scattering or dvl overrange it will have a catastrophic effect on auv missions to improve navigation robustness and avoid the effects of dvl dropouts an intelligent velocity model is proposed to assist navigation by using optimally pruned extreme learning machine the performance of model aided navigation system is evaluated on data from our research platform sailfish 210 auv during sea trials on the high seas of yellow sea which achieve 0 5 navigation accuracy in addition the intelligent velocity model without modifying the model parameters is more flexible in model acquisition than the traditional vehicle dynamic model when auv sensor distribution and auv mass change results show that it is possible to improve accuracy and robustness of navigation as a redundant velocity information for standard auv graphical abstract to improve navigation robustness and avoid the effects of dvl dropouts an intelligent velocity model is proposed to assist navigation by using optimally pruned extreme learning machine for standard auv without redundant velocity sensors as output variables bottom relative velocity of auv can be calculated by the water relative velocity of auv obtained by the auv dynamic vehicle model and the current velocity the input variables including the propeller rotation rate rudder elevator heading pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and depth are determined we train the data set including input and

navigation without increasing hardware cost a sensor function software is provided for auv underwater navigation to a certain extent high precision navigation results can be obtained and the robustness of the system is enhanced image 1 keywords standard auv underwater navigation intelligent velocity model redundant sensor 1 introduction auv an important equipment for human submarine exploration and development plays vital role in ocean development as artificial satellite does in space exploration improvements on sensor technology and navigation algorithms are crucial for the development and application of auv kinsey et al 2006 paull et al 2014 auvs are generally divided into three types leonard and bahr 2016 one is the low cost auv equipped with an attitude and heading reference system ahrs to provide angle acceleration angular velocity and a flow meter to obtain a measurement of their forward speed another is the standard auv equipped with a doppler velocity log dvl compared to the low cost auv when the dvl is able to obtain bottom tracking an accurate vehicle referenced velocity is available and the navigation accuracy improves by an order of magnitude the third is the high end auv equipped with a fiber optic gyro fog sensor instead of a simple magnetic compass when the dvl can obtain a bottom relative velocity high end auv is able to improve the navigation accuracy by two orders of magnitude otherwise vehicle s velocity is able to be obtained by linear acceleration sensors which cause a decrease of navigation accuracy miller et al 2010 the reliability of auv s navigation related sensors becomes particularly important since dvl is easy to be interfered by fish movement sound scattering and dvl overrange when dvl fails or inaccurate measurement results are obtained a navigation method that can effectively reduce drift is required for position correction a simple way is to isolate the dvl velocity and navigate with the velocity value of the previous moment but this will lead to the accumulation error of position another method is to use the velocity provided by the dynamic model nouri et al 2018 nouri and valadi 2017 featherstone 2014 prestero 2001 evans and nahon 2004 to assist navigation but this model can only provide the water relative velocity and the solution to hydrodynamic coefficients in the model is complex the idea of dynamic model aided navigation was originally proposed by koifman and bar itzhack koifman and bar itzhack 1999 in 1999 simulations proved that it is feasible based on the kalman filter kf using the aircraft dynamics model to correct the output of the low cost inertial navigation system ins vasconcelos et al presented and simulated navigation based on helicopter dynamic model in 2006 and results verified the feasibility of model assisted navigation vasconcelos et al 2006 although these studies are aimed at air navigation it is a useful exploration for model assisted navigation m morgado et al introduced the dynamic model into underwater vehicle navigation in 2007 morgado et al 2007 their results showed that vehicle dynamic aiding low cost inertial navigation method had a significant improvement on the navigation system kongsberg began its research on the use of dynamic model assisted navigation for the hugin auv in 2007 firstly they established a dynamic model of single degree of freedom and three degrees of freedom for hugin 4500 based on sea trial data in 2007 hegrenaes et al 2007 then they used the dynamic model for inertial navigation assistance in 2007 and 2008 results showed that the linear velocity of the model output was almost the same as dvl velocity hegrenæs et al 2007 hegrenas et al 2008 finally they evaluated model aided navigation with actual sea trial data in 2011 after estimating and compensating for the ocean current velocity results showed that the dynamic model can significantly suppress the ins navigation error hegrenaes and hallingstad 2011 kinsey et al reported single degrees of freedom nonlinear dynamic model based state estimators for the navigation and results showed superior performance of proposed method kinsey et al 2014 arnold utilized information from the vehicle model during dvl drop outs and data denial validated the method for dvl dropouts arnold and medagoda 2018 from these existing studies the key to auv dynamic model aided navigation is the accuracy of the model however the dynamic model of auv is quite complicated which is generally an ordinary differential equation with parameters established according to the motion state under certain hypothetical situations there are many unknown parameters and they are difficult to solve precisely especially some of the hydrodynamic parameters moreover when the payload of auv varies or their shapes changes the corresponding model parameters also need to be updated so it is necessary to re solve the model parameters when using the dynamic vehicle model to assist navigation it is generally assumed that the direction and size of current velocity remain unchanged in a short time the current velocity is superimposed on the water relative velocity using dynamic model in view of the complex parameters to be solved for the dynamic model the need to recalculate these parameters when the auv changes slightly humphreys and watkinson 1978 blevins 1979 sahoo et al 2020 and the current velocity does not take into account the influencing factors other than angle we propose the intelligent velocity model shown in fig 1 according to the dynamic model we can get the water relative velocity and extract the variables that affect the water relative velocity as part of the input add the variables that affect the current velocity together as the input and take the bottom relative velocity of dvl as the output variable op elm miche et al 2010 is presented by miche y et al compared with support vector machine svm suykens and vandewalle 1999 smola and schölkopf 2004 os elm lim et al 2013 and elm huang et al 2006 ding et al 2015 op elm is more suitable to generate the intelligent velocity module for auv in this paper then we train the data set including input and output variable to get a reliable velocity model during dvl is valid the model velocity is used to assist navigation during dvl dropouts this paper is organized as follows we continue in the next section with a review of our research platform sailfish 210 auv then we present the intelligent velocity model in section 3 the sea trial results and analysis are given in section 4 to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed algorithm finally in section 5 we come to the conclusion 2 the research platform sailfish 210 auv our research platform is mainly divided into deck unit and auv onboard shown in fig 2 the deck unit is mainly used for deck personnel to control the auv and auv consists of four cabins navigation sensor cabin main control cabin battery cabin and power cabin the mainly sensors we used in this paper contain attitude and heading reference systems ahrs doppler velocity log dvl intelligent pressure sensors ips global positioning system gps rudder elevator and propeller the specifications of the auv are displayed in table 1 the functions of auv system mainly include sensor data acquisition autonomous navigation and path planning auv motion and attitude control communication between auv and deck unit then three parts about sailfish 210 auv are as follows notation and coordinate system onboard sensors and navigation methodology 2 1 notation and coordinate system all of the coordinate systems used in this paper belong to cartesian reference coordinate system which is an orthogonal right handed coordinate system shown in fig 3 let b denotes vehicle coordinate system whose origin is body fixed at the gravity center of auv and axes coincide with the principal axes of auv o x i points to the forward of auv o y i points to the starboard axis of auv and o z i points down let n denotes navigation coordinate system or local geographic coordinate system whose origin is fixed in the center of the vehicle and axes coincide with the principal axes of auv o z i points to the center of the earth o x i points to the geographical north pole and o y i points to the geographical east pole this coordinate system is usually called the coordinate system of the north east down ned due to the installation characteristics of dvl it s coordinate system and the auv coordinate system have an rotation angular which needs to be rotated to the auv coordinate system shown in fig 4 the coordinate system between dvl and auv has the same z axis orientation and x o y plane but the x and y axes rotate 45 relative to the auv s axis for reducing the effect of attitude angle and increasing the dvl effective velocity range the conversion relationship is as shown in the following equation 2 1 v x b v y b v z b 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 1 v x d v l v y d v l v z d v l where v x b v y b and v z b are triaxial velocity in body coordinate system v x d v l v y d v l and v z d v l are triaxial velocity in dvl sensor coordinate system after the conversion from the sensor coordinate system to vehicle coordinate system we convert information from vehicle coordinate system to navigation coordinate system 2 2 r cos ξ y cos ξ z cos ξ y sin ξ

y where zf ξ x lk ξ y and ghkl ξ z represent roll pitch and yaw respectively r represents the rotation from vehicle coordinate system to navigation coordinate system we use r to convert velocity and acceleration from b to n in saifish 210 auv 2 3 v x n v y n v z n r v x b v y b v z b a x n a y n a z n r a x b a y b a z b where v x n v y n v z n a x n a y n and a z n represent triaxial velocity and acceleration in navigation coordinate system respectively v x b v y b v z b a x b a y b and a z b represent three axis velocity and acceleration in vehicle coordinate system respectively 2 2 onboard sensors for sailfish 210 auv control architecture of sailfish 210 auv is shown in fig 5 limited by power consumption cost and space the sailfish 210 auv is equipped with four onboard navigation sensors ahrs dvl ips and gps whose location is shown in fig 2 ahrs can provide acceleration angular velocity and orientation triaxial orientation consists of roll pitch and heading whose calculation is based not only on the magnetic field data obtained by the magnetometer but also on the angular velocity and acceleration obtained by the gyroscope and accelerometer gps is used to provide current position communicating with all available satellite positioning systems ips provides pressure and depth at current position according to the voltage change and the seawater density dvl an active sonar is used to measure bottom relative velocities derived from the doppler shift between seafloor echo and emitted acoustic waves several parameters of dvl are shown in table 2 due to the acoustic characteristics of the dvl the measured values are prone to inaccuracy or failure if the sound waves of dvl hit the moving fish dvl data may have a large error moreover if auv passes through a sea floor gully or a sea area where the water depth changes significantly dvl cannot obtain valid velocity data due to the distance between dvl and seafloor exceeds the dvl sensor range shown in fig 6 the above situation will cause the dvl data to be inaccurate or even invalid and bring uncorrectable error to auv localization 2 3 navigation methodology for sailfish 210 auv there are two types of localization information one is the direct position provided by gps when there are enough satellites available and the other is the calculated position generated by the data of dvl and ahrs using extend kalman filter welch et al 1995 the flowchart of auv navigation is shown in fig 7 when auv sails on the surface as long as gps data is valid we can get the corrected position information by integrating the gps information into the calculated position when auv sails underwater the gps signal is attenuated quickly without gps position assistance we can only calculate position information through ahrs and dvl since the dvl is susceptible to be interfered and there is no redundant velocity sensor in standard auv system the response becomes very important during dvl dropouts if gps is valid on the surface auv can also navigate according to the position provided by gps otherwise methods of acquiring speed to provide speed for navigation are needed the conventional solution is usually that the velocity continues to use the dvl data of the previous moment however we have no idea about the failure duration of dvl so it may lead to large positioning errors during long fault time of dvl another solution is to use a dynamic model which uses water relative velocity to navigate for auv referring to the dynamic vehicle model we propose an intelligent velocity model for auv to assist navigation during dvl dropouts or failures 3 the intelligent vehicle model for auv due to the complexity of dynamic parameters solving and the difficulty of dynamic equations gertler and hagen 1967a feldman 1979 modifying caused by the changes of auv weight and gravity center when there is different load in auv we propose an intelligent velocity model based on dynamic vehicle model as a software to assist navigation which is intelligent and simple to modify the parameters when we change the shape or mass of auv the intelligent velocity model we proposed can be trained in real time during the dvl is valid and the bottom relativre velocity can be obtained to navigate by model output during the dvl is invalid 3 1 input and output variables of the intelligent velocity model as output variables bottom relative velocity is the final purpose of proposed intelligent velocity model bottom relative velocity of auv can be calculated by the water relative velocity of auv obtained by the typical dynamic vehicle model and the current velocity martinez et al 2015 measured by acoustic doppler current profilers adcp or calculated manually since the sailfish auv is not equipped with adcp to output the current velocity we choose to calculate the current speed from the data obtained 3 1 1 input variables for water relative velocity as shown in fig 4 the main hull of auv is a body of streamlined revolution the tail fin is cruciform the left and right sides are symmetrical and the upper and lower sides are approximately symmetrical for the convenience of modeling we consider auv as a rigid body featherstone 2014 but the model of underwater vehicle is still fairly sophisticated and there are many unknown parameters to be solved we plan to give a 3 dof dynamic model to describe submarine motion in surge rocking and yawing before the model we set some assumptions that 1 auv is considered as a rigid body 2 current is irrotational and two dimensional 3 the fluid is unbounded and uniform the equation gertler and hagen 1967b of motion eom is usually represented as the following vector form 3 1 m r b v c r b v v τ r b where v u v r is the decomposition of the velocity vector in vehicle coordinate system u and v are the x forward and y starboard speeds of the auv respectively and r is the angular velocity of the rotation around the normal v u v r is the derivative of velocity v u and v are the x forward and y starboard acceleration of the auv respectively and r is the angular velocity τ r b x y n is external forces and moments x and y are axial force and lateral force on auv respectively and n is yawing external moment m r b and c r b represent the inertia matrix of rigid body system and the corresponding matrix of coriolis centripetal 3 2 m r b m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 i z c r b 0 0 m v 0 0 m u m v m u 0 where m is the mass of auv in liquid and i z is the rigid body moment of inertia generated around the z axis the right hand side of equation 3 1 can be written as 3 3 x x u u x u x u u u u y v v y r r r x δ δ u u δ r t 2 δ r b 2 δ e p 2 δ e s 2 u 2 x v r v r x v v v 2 x r r r 2 b w s i n ξ y x n u n 1 w u x b x n n n n y y v v y r r y v y v v v v y r y r r r x

buoyancy of auv in the same liquid n w the propeller rotation rate and the wake fraction number x y z hydrodynamic coefficients 3 dof dynamic model for sailfish 210 auv is calculated after bringing equation 3 2 and equation 3 3 to equation 3 1 after solved the unknown parameters named hydrodynamic coefficients we can use the above mentioned vehicle model to obtain the unknown variables such as forward and starboard water relative velocities according to the known variables of rudder elevator pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and propeller rotation rate so input variables for water relative velocity are the propeller rotation rate pitch roll the rudder angle and the elevator angle 3 1 2 input variables for current velocity when calculating the current velocity we apply the following assumptions that 1 auv is considered as a rigid body with constant mass 2 auv is immersed in unbounded fluid 3 the fluid is uniform and incompressible 4 the current velocity is irrotational and direction and size of current velocity remain unchanged in a short time we decompose the original current velocity into the ned coordinate system and then rotate it to the vehicle coordinate system 3 4 v x c b v y c b c o s ξ z s i n ξ z s i n ξ z c o s ξ z v x c n v y c n 3 5 v x c n v y c n cos σ sin σ v c r a w where σ and v c r a w denote the angle to north and size of current velocity v x c n and v y c n represent north and east velocity in ned coordinate system v x c b and v y c b are the x forward and y starboard velocity in vehicle coordinate system and ξ z is heading since we assume that the current velocity is constant irrotational at the same depth we choose depth as the input variable rather than the size and direction of the flow velocity so input variables for current velocity are heading and depth in conclusion the input and output variables of proposed intelligent velocity have been determined the propeller rotation rate rudder elevator heading pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and depth are input variables and the output variables are x forward and y starboard bottom relative velocity in vehicle coordinate system 3 2 methodology for intelligent velocity model according to the input and output variables determined above a velocity model is constructed which is trained using the op elm algorithm 3 2 1 review of training methods although the result of extreme learning machine elm is the unique smallest norm solution in the least square solutions which can reach the minimum training error problems arise when there are unrelated or correlated variables in the training data set to solve this problem an algorithm for reducing the sensitivity and improving the robustness through effectively pruning potentially useless neurons in single hidden layer feed forward network slfn is proposed three steps of op elm algorithm are shown in fig 8 the main idea of elm algorithm belonging to slfn is the random initialization of slfn weights and biases rather than the traditional learning of these weights through back propagation which reduces the computational time by several orders of magnitude consider a set of m distinct samples x i y i where x i r n and y i r m a mathematically model of standard slfn with n hidden neurons is described as 3 6 f n x i 1 n β i g w i x j b i 1 j m where β i r m represents the output weights connecting the ith hidden neurons and output neurons w i r m represents the input weights connecting the ith hidden neurons and input neurons and b i represents the threshold of the ith hidden neuron the standard slfn with n hidden nodes and it s activation function g x can approximate these n samples with zero error which means that there exist β i w i and b i so that 3 7 i 1 n β i g w i x j b i y j 1 j m equation 3 7 can be written compactly as h β y where 3 8 h w 1 w n b 1 b n x 1 x m g w 1 x 1 b 1 g w n x 1 b n g w 1 x m b 1 g w n x m b n m n 3 9 β b 1 t b n t n m a n d y y 1 t y m t m m where h is the hidden layer output matrix of the neural network and the ith column of h is the output of the ith hidden node about the input if the activation function g x is infinitely differentiable the number of hidden nodes n is required to be less than or equal to the number of sample m huang et al 2006 after obtain the hidden layer output matrix h output weight β is calculated by moore penrose inverse of h matrix h prasad and bapat 1992 and target value y 3 10 β ˆ h y where β ˆ is the unique smallest norm solution in the least square solutions which can reach the minimum training error multiresponse sparse regression mrsr similä and tikka 2005 is an extension of the least angle regression lars algorithm we denote x x 1 x m the n m regressor matrix after mrsr a model y ˆ k x w k is obtained by adding each column of x one by one where y ˆ k y ˆ 1 k y ˆ p k represents the target approximation of the model and w k represents the weight matrix which has k nonzero rows at kth step of mrsr for each update there will be a new non zero row and a new regression matrix column added to the model after ranking the hidden layer neurons by mrsr the optimal pruning of neurons is carried out by loo verification method so that the model is trained with the optimal number of neurons in order to reduce the time consuming of loo in data sets with a large number of samples the prediction sum of squares press statistics were used by providing the following formula for the error calculation of loo 3 11 ε p r e s s y i h i b i 1 h i p h i t where p is denoted as p h t h 1 and h is the hidden layer matrix finally through evaluating the error of loo and the number of hidden layer neurons used the final number of neurons used in the model is determined 3 2 2 intelligent velocity model for auv the intelligent velocity model we proposed is shown in fig 9 which combines the current velocity and the water relative velocity as follows input variables contain the propeller rotation rate rudder elevator heading pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and depth the output variables are x forward and starboard bottom relative velocity in vehicle coordinate system we train the data set including input and output variables when dvl is valid to get a reliable velocity and the bottom velocity can be obtained by model output to assist navigation during dvl dropouts the training process is roughly as follows 1 using elm algorithm to construct a single hidden layer network 2 ranking the importance of hidden layer nodes based on multiresponse sparse regression 3 determining the number of hidden layer neurons by pruning the low importance hidden layer nodes during the underwater sailing of the auv the training set can be continuously expanded as long as the dvl does not detect the fault data finally when the dvl is detected dropouts or failures the velocity from proposed intelligent velocity model instead of dvl is used to assist navigation without increasing hardware cost a sensor function software is provided for auv underwater navigation to a certain extent high precision navigation results can be obtained and the robustness of the system is enhanced 4 experimental results and analysis in order to evaluate the performance and validation of the proposed algorithm the intelligent velocity model has been applied to sailfish auv and a set of sea trials were performed during the yellow sea mission the overview of experimental setup including research platform and data process is given in section 4 1 the selection process of our vehicle model method is presented in section 4 2 the experimental results of navigation with and without model assistance are described in section 4 3 4 1 experimental setup as our research platform sailfish 210 auv equipped with many sections including navigation module control module emergency module and battery module shown in fig 5 the navigation module including dvl ahrs ips and gps four sensors conforms to the configuration of standard auv leonard and bahr 2016 whose location is shown in fig 2 once dvl is invalid or dvl data failure there is a catastrophic effect on auv missions in order to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed velocity model sea trials were carried out on the high seas of the yellow sea in august and september 2016 shown in fig 10 auv is required to sail for several minutes at different pitch roll heading rudder angle elevator angle depth and propeller rotation rate before a formal mission begins during the underwater sailing of auv the experimental dataset samples obtained by the above onboard sensors can be added to the training set for intelligent velocity model training as long as dvl data is valid the input variables determined in chapter 3 2 are input into the intelligent velocity model during dvl dropouts and the output velocity of the model is used as the final velocity to replace the dvl data for navigation 4 2 the selection process of our vehicle model in order to get the optimal intelligent velocity model this section performs the regression algorithm selection of the velocity model yoan miche et al miche et al 2010 conducted experimental comparisons on 11 different open source datasets using two thirds of the whole set for training and one thirds of the whole set for test comparing with support vector machine multilayer perceptron gardner and dorling 1998 tang et al 2015 gaussian process quiñonero candela and rasmussen 2005 op elm and elm on these regression data base on the computational times and mean square error of test results we can see that elm based algorithm has advantages in running time which can ensure the real time processing of auv data during operation we intend to select the most suitable regression algorithm for our sea trials data from svm elm os elm and op elm we use the information obtained by the sailfish auv during the high seas voyage in the yellow sea to make data sets we select variables such as propeller rotation rate rudder elevator heading pitch roll acceleration angular velocity and depth as input the forward and the starboard bottom relative velocity as output one half of the whole data set is used as training set and the other half of the whole data set is used as test set mean and standard deviation after 50 times of the training time test time and two output values are compared by elm svm os elm op elm with different activation functions since the output of os elm svm and elm can only select a single variable their training time is the sum training times of the two outputs which is the same as test time moreover we use different activation function for three elm based algorithms for convenience we only show the best results of two activation functions for them we use mean and standard deviation to measure whether the regression algorithms are suitable for our sea trials mean value is used to indicate the central position of the data and standard deviation is a measure of the average dispersion of a set of data a larger standard deviation represents a large difference between most values and their average values and a smaller standard deviation means that these values are closer to the average value mean and standard deviation after 50 times of the training time and test time with different neurons are shown in table 3 we can see that with the increase of the neurons number the mean of train time increases and time of elm is the shortest in addition the performance of svm is similar to that of oselm when the neurons number is 50 mean and standard deviations of root mean square error after 50 times of forward and starboard velocity with different neurons are shown in table 4 we can see that the results are minimally affected by the number of neurons the rmse mean of elm and os elm is particularly larger than that of op elm and so is the standard deviation when the number of neurons is 20 the accuracy and stability of the three algorithms are the best so we will mainly analyze the model output when the number of neurons is 20 comparison of forward and starboard velocity in different regression methods with 20 neurons are shown in fig 11 a and b are the forward velocity c and d are the starboard velocity we can see that the velocity trend of the svm and op elm is consistent with that of the dvl velocity and the later works better but both elm and os elm have large errors and the maximum error up to 5 m s detailed information of velocity will be showed later fig 12 shows one step error of velocity in different regression methods with 20 neurons where a and b are the one step error of forward velocity c and d are one step error of the starboard velocity as can be seen from the figure op elm has the smallest one step error in which the fitting error of forward velocity is 0 2 m s and that of starboard velocity is 0 1 m s svm performs similarly to op elm in starboard velocity but fitting error of forward velocity up to 0 4 m s the error trend of os elm and elm behave similar the maximum error of forward speed is 4 8 m s and the maximum error of starboard speed is up to 5 7 m s root mean square error of velocity in different regression methods with 20 neurons is shown in fig 13 where a and b are the rmse of forward velocity c and d are the rmse of the starboard velocity according the figure op elm has the smallest rmse in which the fitting rmse of forward velocity is between 0 8 and 0 14 m s and that of starboard velocity is between 0 04 and 0 08 m s followed by svm the error trend of os elm and elm is the same where the rmse of forward velocity is between 1 and 1 8 m s and that of starboard velocity is between 1 5 and 2 4 m s figs 11 13 are obtained from the same set of sea trial data which is a square of 12 000 data for testing the black solid line represents the measured value of dvl the blue line represents the data of the elm using the activation function sig the red pecked line represents the data of the elm using the activation function sin the green dashed line represents the data of the os elm using the activation function sig the yellow line represents the data of the os elm using the activation function sin the magenta solid line represents the data of the op elm using the activation function g the cyan solid line represents the data of the op elm using the activation function lg and the blue black solid line represents the data of svm considering the training time test time velocity fitting results one step speed error and rmse op elm is more suitable for the regression of our sea trial data set followed by svm so we intend to select op elm algorithm as our regression algorithm of the intelligent velocity model to train the velocity model with 20 hidden layer neurons 4 3 experimental results this section evaluates the performance of the intelligent velocity model and dvl the comparison between trajectories obtained by the velocity using intelligent velocity model and trajectory generated by the dvl velocity are shown in fig 14 we assume that the trajectory generated by the dvl velocity is used as ground truth a shows the trajectory of auv using intelligent velocity model and dvl b and c show one step error and rmse between trajectory generated by intelligent velocity model and ground truth respectively d is the accuracy of intelligent velocity model relative to the ground truth from fig 14 a we can see that the trajectory obtained by velocity of the op elm is much closer to the trajectory obtained by dvl than svm and the trajectory is about 3600 m from the figure of one step error and rmse we can see that the largest one step error is 35 m and the largest rmse is 15 m in op elm however the largest one step error is 190 m and the largest rmse is 75 m in svm combined with the above performance we finally choose op elm as the method of intelligent velocity model the value of accuracy is large before 2000 steps due to the small value of the distance finally the trajectory accuracy of intelligent velocity model can achieve 0 5 when the fault data of dvl is detected proposed intelligent speed model can be used to obtain a reasonable velocity according to the information of the auv instead of the dvl velocity for robust navigation 5 conclusions and future work with the rapid development of auvs human beings are increasingly exploring and understanding the ocean precise navigation is still a major challenge for underwater platforms therefore research on high precision and high robustness navigation methods are the key to improving auv performance the proposed intelligent vehicle model which provides speed when dvl data is detected to be invalid or faulty is more flexible than

review following two paragraphs review the studies conducted on the ljf of chs joints and the studies performed on the plate strengthened connections 2 1 ljf of chs connections fessler et al 1986 experimentally studied the f ljf of 27 t y models under tensile out of plane bending opb and ipb loads also they derived formulas for determine the f ljf det norske veritas 1977 and underwater engineering group 1985 provided design guidance to predict the f ljf also they established some parametric equations for calculating the f ljf efthymiou 1985 proposed a total of equations t y connections subjected to ipb and opb loads chen et al 1990 derived some formulas for calculating the f ljf in k connections golafshani et al 2013 proposed a fe model for investigating the f ljf gao et al 2013 2014 and gao and biao 2015 studied the f ljf of overlapped chs connections subjected to lap axial opb and ipb loads wang et al 2017a proposed a simplified model to analyze the dynamic behavior of a tubular structure with ljf asgarian et al 2015 derived a new ljf element based on flexibility matrix ahmadi and ziaei nejad 2017 numerically investigated the ljf of unreinforced two planar tubular dk joints wang et al 2017b showed that the β and γ have considerable influence on the ljf 2 2 collar plate strengthened tubular connections nassiraei 2019a investigated the influence of the collar plate on f ljf of chs x connections under compression van der vegte et al 2005 and choo et al 2005 showed that the influence of the strengthening plate on the strength of t connections is considerable nassiraei et al 2016a investigated the ultimate strength of the strengthened t y connections their results proved that the plate can remarkably enhance the capacity of the connections shao 2016 experimentally and numerically investigated the effect of the collar plate on the static behavior of the tubular t joints under tension and compression results showed that the length and the thickness of the collar plate have remarkable effect on improving the static capacity cai et al 2011 experimentally investigated the collar plate reinforced chs t joints under compressive load they showed the collar plate can considerably increase the ultimate capacity their results showed that the failure mode and the failure position are both changed due to the reinforcement of the collar plate and the collar plate improves the static capacity of the t joints significantly shao et al 2009 numerically investigated the influence of the joint the collar geometries and the material property on the static strength of the tubular joints nassiraei et al 2019 investigated the structural behavior of x joints under compression they investigated the failure modes initial stiffness and ultimate capacity of the joints nassiraei 2019c studied the ultimate strength initial stiffness and failure mechanism of t y joints at elevated temperatures a parametric is proposed for determining the ultimate capacity choo et al 2004a 2004b numerically studied collar plate reinforced x joints under compression ipb and opb load the results showed that the collar plate reinforced joint fail with relatively large plastic zones formed near the brace chord intersection gao et al 2015 indicated that the plate is a good alternative for strengthening connections at elevated temperatures nassiraei et al 2017 2018 experimental and numerically investigated the ultimate capacity of the plate strengthened x connections cai and shao 2011 studies on the stress concatenation factor of chs connections indicated that the plates can result in the considerable reduction of the scf 2 3 concluding remarks there are several research programs on the chs connections strengthened with collar plates they studied the hysteresis performance ultimate strength and fatigue behavior results indicated that the plate can be a good choice for enhancing the hysteresis performance ultimate capacity and fatigue life however there is not any research work or equation on the f ljf of the strengthened t y connections in addition f ljf is a critical problem in the evaluating of the dynamic performance and global static behavior of offshore chs structures therefore the parametric investigation on the f ljf of t y connections strengthened with the collar plate is urgent also a design equation should be derived to determine the f ljf of these types of connections 3 determination of the f ljf the ljf of chs connections defines as the displacement attributed to the local chord deformation caused by a unit load to calculate the ljf at the connection intersection the rotation of the connection because of the overall displacement must be eliminated from the total measured rotation in an fe model the local rotation at the connection can be directly measured without taking the beam movement it determines the distortion of the circular section which is oval shape subjected to ipb load gao et al 2014 the ljf defines by the local deformation due to ipb load at the crown toe and heel of the connection as shown in eq 1 1 l j f ϕ i p b m i p b where ϕ ipb is the connection local rotation expressed in eq 2 m ipb is the brace ipb moment 2 ϕ i p b δ 2 δ 2 δ 1 δ 1 d t sin θ the d and t are the brace diameter and thickness respectively the θ is the angle between brace and chord δ 1 and δ 2 are the respective displacement at the crown toe and heel measured perpendicular to the chord axis as indicated in fig 2 δ 1 and δ 2 are the displacement at the bottom of chord corresponding to δ 1 and δ 2 respectively to relate the ljf to joint geometry a non dimensional factor called the f ljf is introduced for the connections under ipb load the f ljf can be determined using the following equation 3 f l j f ϕ i p b m i p b e d 3 where d and e and are the chord diameter and young s modulus respectively 4 fe strategy the welds were generated in each fe model the welds connecting collar brace and collar chord were modeled according to the american welding society aws 2015 the solid element 186 was applied for meshing the chord plates brace and welds the mesh generated in the connection intersection is depicted in fig 2 also the linear static analysis is appropriate for the prediction of ljf in chs connections gao et al 2013 2014 augmented lagrange technique was used for solving the interaction between the plates and chord member contact was detected on gauss positions bottom faces of the strengthening plates were taken as target faces outer faces of the chord wall were taken as contact faces nassiraei et al 2017 swanson analysis systems inc 2009 both chord ends were only allowed to rotate furthermore due to symmetry in the loading conditions and the geometry of the connections only one fourth of the whole t connection and one half of the y connections were modeled see fig 3 5 verification of the fe model the precision of fe results should be verified as per the authors knowledge no experimental theoretical fe database of f ljf for chs t y connections strengthened with the plate is available in the literature in view of this issue following research works are used to validate the fe model four unreinforced and collar plate reinforced t joints under compressive and tensile load carried out by shao 2016 three experimental y connections under ipb load conducted by fessler et al 1986 eight y connections under ipb load extracted from the formula proposed by fessler et al 1986 and an experimental x connection strengthened with the collar plate conducted by the present author nassiraei et al 2017 the details of the connections have been presented in table 1 fig 4 shows that local joint flexibility results for the unreinforced y joints under ipb load as it can be observed an enough agreement is between the results of the present fe model and the experimental data and the extracted data from the available equations fig 5 compares the load deformation diagrams of the fe model with the experimental data provided by shao 2016 and the present author in nassiraei et al 2017 it shows that the present fe model can predict the behavior of the tubular joint reinforced with collar plate with good accuracy results show the that the initial stiffness of the collar plate reinforced joints predicted by the present fe model and experimental tests are very close in other hand the present study of f ljf for the connections is within the elastic range therefore the modeling of the collar plate reinforced joints in the current fe model is accepted it can be concluded that the generated fe model can be considered to be accurate and safe enough to provide reliable results 6 geometrical influence on the f ljf 6 1 details of the parametric investigation a set of 168 fe models were generated in ansys software package to investigate the effect of the connection geometry the angle between brace and chord and the plate size on the f ljf of the strengthened t y connections under ipb load the parameters include the proportion of the radius to wall thickness of the chord γ the diameter proportion between brace and chord β the angle between brace and chord θ the proportion of the thickness of the brace to chord τ the plate length coefficient η δ c d and the plate thickness coefficient τ c t c t the fe models table 2 include four different θ θ 45 60 75 and 90 three different γ proportions γ 12 18 24 three different β proportions β 0 4 0 5 0 6 three different τ proportions τ 0 55 0 7 1 0 four different η proportions η 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and five different τ c proportions τ c 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 2 0 to compare the f ljf of the collar plate strengthened connections with the corresponding un strengthened connections a new parameter λ f ljf c f ljf u is introduced 6 2 the influence of the γ on the fljf in this research program the influence of the γ and the strengthening plate size η and τ c on the f ljf c and λ λ f ljf c f ljf u is investigated the f ljf c is the f ljf of the reinforced connection the f ljf u is the f ljf of the un strengthened connection fig 6 shows the f ljf of the un reinforced and the reinforced connections with different γ proportions γ 12 and 24 η proportions η 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 and τ c proportions τ c 1 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 the comparison results show that the f ljf of the reinforced connections are considerably smaller than the corresponding un reinforced connections since in the reinforced connections the strengthening plate enhances the chord thickness in the vicinity of the connection intersection the increase of the chord thickness leads to the reduction of the deformation therefore the utilization of the strengthening plate results in the reduction of the f ljf for example in the connections with γ 12 β 0 6 θ 45 and τ 1 0 the f ljf of the un strengthened and the corresponding strengthened connection η 0 75 τ c 1 75 are equal to 445 2 and 184 4 respectively furthermore the results show that the increase of the collar plate size leads to the reduction of the f ljf for instance in the reinforced joints with γ 12 β 0 6 θ 45 τ 1 0 and η 1 the f ljf of the strengthened connections with τ c 1 and τ c 2 are equal to 232 4 and 148 5 respectively therefore the utilization of the plates with large size can significantly improve the f ljf in addition fig 6 shows that the f ljf of the strengthened connections with smaller γ is smaller for instance in the connections with β 0 6 τ 1 η 0 75 and τ c 1 5 the f ljf values are 199 1 and 670 for the connections with γ 12 and 24 respectively because the plate thickness and the chord wall thickness of the connections with γ 12 are twice of the plate thickness and the chord wall thickness of the connections with γ 24 respectively fig 6c and d show the proportion of the f ljf of the strengthened connections to the corresponding un strengthened connection λ as it can be observed the plate can remarkably reduce the f ljf of the tubular connections under ipb load to give an example in the connections with γ 24 β 0 6 θ 45 and τ 1 0 the f ljf of the strengthened with the strengthening plate can be down to 43 of the f ljf of the corresponding un strengthened connection moreover it can be observed that the increment of the γ results in the increment of the λ on the contrary the increment of the plate thickness and length leads to the remarkable reduction of the λ hence the collar plate strengthening method is a good choice for the strengthening of the joints to reduce of the f ljf comparison between the present study results and the fessler et al 1986 equations for the un strengthened y connections under ipb load shows that the results of both methods are close for the connections with γ 12 β 0 6 θ 45 τ 1 0 the f ljf obtained from the present fe model and the equation are 445 2 and 429 2 respectively therefore the proportion of the f ljf of the present fe model to the f ljf of the equation is equal to 1 04 also in the connections with γ 24 β 0 6 θ 45 τ 1 0 the f ljf obtained from the present fe model and the equations are 1235 and 1423 7 respectively hence the proportion of the f ljf of the fe model to the f ljf of the formula is equal to 87 6 3 influence of the θ on the fljf fig 7 shows that effect of the θ on the λ is not remarkable but the effect of the η and τ c on the λ is remarkable also the enhancement of the η and τ c leads to the considerable reduction of the λ to give an example for the connections with θ 60 γ 18 β 0 5 τ 0 55 fig 7a the use of the plate with τ c 2 0 and η 1 result in the reduction of 71 of the f ljf as a result the collar plate a good method for decreasing the f ljf of y connections under ipb load 6 4 the influence of the β on the fljf of the connections with large γ this section investigates the effect of the β and the plate size η and τ c on the f ljf of the strengthened connections with large values of the γ fig 8 shows the f ljf of the connections with different β η and τ c results illustrate that the f ljf of the reinforced connections are considerably smaller than the f ljf of the corresponding un reinforced connections for instance in the connections with β 0 6 γ 24 θ 45 and τ 0 7 the f ljf of the un strengthened and corresponding strengthened connection η 0 5 τ c 2 are equal to 1371 0 and 689 8 respectively furthermore the results show that the increment of the η and τ c results in the reduction of the f ljf because the increment of the τ c results in the increment of the t t d in the near of the connection intersection in addition the increment of the η leads to the enhancement of the more area of the chord wall near the connection intersection the enhance of the connection intersection leads to the reduction of the deformation in the connection intersection therefore the f ljf will be decreased by increasing the plate length and thickness as an example for the strengthened joints with τ c 1 β 0 5 γ 24 θ 45 and τ 0 7 the increment of the η from 0 25 to 1 0 results in the reduction of the f ljf from 1414 5 to 1207 6 consequently the utilization of the plates with larger the η and τ c can lead to a more reduction of the f ljf in addition fig 8a and b show that the f ljf of the strengthened connections with larger β is smaller as an example for connections with γ 24 τ 0 7 η 1 and τ c 1 5 the change of the β from 0 5 to 0 6 leads to the reduction of the f ljf from 982 8 to 706 8 because the brace diameter and the plate length of the connections with β 0 6 are larger than the brace diameter and the plate length of the connections with β 0 5 respectively fig 8c and d show that the increment of the β results in the slight increment of the λ on the contrary the increment of the plate size leads to the considerable reduction of the λ the comparison between the results of this paper and the fessler et al 1986 equations indicates that the results of the two methods are close for the connections with γ 24 β 0 5 θ 45 τ 0 7 the f ljf predicted from the present fe model and the fessler et al 1986 equation are 2025 7 and 2237 respectively hence the proportion of the f ljf of the fe model to the f ljf of the fessler et al 1986 formula is equal to 91 also for the joints with β 0 6 γ 24 θ 45 τ 0 7 the f ljf predicted from the present fe model and the fessler et al 1986 equation are 1371 and 1423 respectively therefore the proportion of the f ljf of the fe model to the f ljf of the fessler et al 1986 equation is equal to 96 6 5 the influence of the β on the fljf of the connections with small γ comparison fig 9 a and b indicate that the increment of the β results in the slight increment of the λ on the contrary the increment of the η and τ c leads to the notable reduction of the λ it means that increase of both the η and τ c results in considerable decrease of the displacement at the connection intersection therefore this is a good alternative for strengthening the connection for example in fig 9a for the connection with a small plate τ c 1 and η 0 25 the f ljf proportion of strengthened to the corresponding un strengthened connections is equal to 65 however for the corresponding connection with large plate τ c 1 75 and η 1 this parameter is equal to 37 6 6 influence of the τ on the fljf figs 6b and 8b show that by increasing the τ from 0 7 to 1 0 the f ljf of strengthened joints is slowly but figs 6d and 8d show that by increasing the τ the f ljf proportion of reinforced to the corresponding un reinforced joints are not changed 7 parametric equation for the prediction of the f ljf values so far no formula has been derived for determining the f ljf of chs t y connections strengthened with collar plate under ipb load hence by using the data of the current 168 fe analyses and the software package spss v22 a new equation formula was derived for this matter 4 f ljf c f ljf u 23 77η 0 026 τ c 0 01 β 0 003 γ 0 008 θ 0 02 0 025θ 6 6 β 0 14 311 16η 0 0023 334 84 r2 0 952 where f ljf c is the f ljf of the strengthened t y connections under ipb load f ljf u is the f ljf of the un strengthened t y connections subject under ipb load r 2 is the determination factor its value is acceptable and good the valid ranges for the application of eq 4 are as follows 5 12 γ 24 0 4 β 0 6 0 55 τ 1 0 45 θ 90 0 25 η 1 0 1 0 τ c 2 0 in fig 10 the f ljf proportions λ f ljf c f ljf u predicted by the proposed equation are compared with the corresponding values obtained from fe analysis it can be seen from the value of r 2 r 2 0 953 that the proposed formula can be considered to be accurate enough to generate reliable results the uk department of energy 1983 suggests the following evaluation standard these standards are established on the applicability of the formula in the following evaluation standard p e is the proportion of the predicted value to the empirical value for the given dataset if p e 1 0 25 and p e 0 8 5 then the formula is accepted if furthermore p e 1 5 50 then the equation is commonly conservative if 25 p e 1 0 30 and or 5 p e 0 8 7 5 then the equation is boundary and engineering judgment should be used for more assessment otherwise the equation is unacceptable bomel consulting engineers 1994 suggested that the requirement for p e 1 0 25 can be eliminate in the evaluating of the equations since for a mean fit equation there is always a lot of percentage of under prediction evaluating the proposed formula according to the uk department of energy 1983 standard are tabulated in table 3 as can be observed in this table the derived equation satisfies the standard suggested by the uk doe 8 conclusions altogether 168 finite element models were created to investigate the influence of the strengthening plate size and the connection geometry of the strengthened t y connections on the local joint flexibility factor f ljf subjected to ipb load the following conclusions can be drawn validation of the fe results against experimental results and available equations indicates that the current fe model can well determine the f ljf of un strengthened and the strengthened t y connections under ipb load the f ljf of a collar plate strengthened t y connection can be down to 29 of the f ljf of the corresponding un strengthened connection the enhancement of the plate thickness and length leads to the remarkable reduction of the f ljf and the λ λ the f ljf proportion of the strengthened to corresponding un strengthened connections because the strengthening plate considerably enhances the chord wall thickness in the near of the connection intersection in the strengthened connections the increment of the γ leads to the increment of the f ljf and the λ but the change of the θ cannot lead to the change of the λ in the strengthened connections the increase of the β leads to the reduction of the f ljf on the contrary the increment of the β leads to the increment of the λ the increment of the τ leads to the slight reduction of the f ljf of the un strengthened and the strengthened connections also the effect of τ on the λ can be ignored a design formula is proposed for predicting the f ljf of the chs t y connections strengthened with collar plate under to ipb load the derived equation having high coefficients of determination r 2 0 953 was evaluated based on the acceptance standard suggested by the uk doe and can be reliably applied for the fabrication and reinforcing of chs connections in structures credit authorship contribution statement hossein nassiraei

of a tubular structure with ljf asgarian et al 2015 derived a new ljf element based on flexibility matrix ahmadi and ziaei nejad 2017 numerically investigated the ljf of unreinforced two planar tubular dk joints wang et al 2017b showed that the β and γ have considerable influence on the ljf 2 2 collar plate strengthened tubular connections nassiraei 2019a investigated the influence of the collar plate on f ljf of chs x connections under compression van der vegte et al 2005 and choo et al 2005 showed that the influence of the strengthening plate on the strength of t connections is considerable nassiraei et al 2016a investigated the ultimate strength of the strengthened t y connections their results proved that the plate can remarkably enhance the capacity of the connections shao 2016 experimentally and numerically investigated the effect of the collar plate on the static behavior of the tubular t joints under tension and compression results showed that the length and the thickness of the collar plate have remarkable effect on improving the static capacity cai et al 2011 experimentally investigated the collar plate reinforced chs t joints under compressive load they showed the collar plate can considerably increase the ultimate capacity their results showed that the failure mode and the failure position are both changed due to the reinforcement of the collar plate and the collar plate improves the static capacity of the t joints significantly shao et al 2009 numerically investigated the influence of the joint the collar geometries and the material property on the static strength of the tubular joints nassiraei et al 2019 investigated the structural behavior of x joints under compression they investigated the failure modes initial stiffness and ultimate capacity of the joints nassiraei 2019c studied the ultimate strength initial stiffness and failure mechanism of t y joints at elevated temperatures a parametric is proposed for determining the ultimate capacity choo et al 2004a 2004b numerically studied collar plate reinforced x joints under compression ipb and opb load the results showed that the collar plate reinforced joint fail with relatively large plastic zones formed near the brace chord intersection gao et al 2015 indicated that the plate is a good alternative for strengthening connections at elevated temperatures nassiraei et al 2017 2018 experimental and numerically investigated the ultimate capacity of the plate strengthened x connections cai and shao 2011 studies on the stress concatenation factor of chs connections indicated that the plates can result in the considerable reduction of the scf 2 3 concluding remarks there are several research programs on the chs connections strengthened with collar plates they studied the hysteresis performance ultimate strength and fatigue behavior results indicated that the plate can be a good choice for enhancing the hysteresis performance ultimate capacity and fatigue life however there is not any research work or equation on the f ljf of the strengthened t y connections in addition f ljf is a critical problem in the evaluating of the dynamic performance and global static behavior of offshore chs structures therefore the parametric investigation on the f ljf of t y connections strengthened with the collar plate is urgent also a design equation should be derived to determine the f ljf of these types of connections 3 determination of the f ljf the ljf of chs connections defines as the displacement attributed to the local chord deformation caused by a unit load to calculate the ljf at the connection intersection the rotation of the connection because of the overall displacement must be eliminated from the total measured rotation in an fe model the local rotation at the connection can be directly measured without taking the beam movement it determines the distortion of the circular section which is oval shape subjected to ipb load gao et al 2014 the ljf defines by the local deformation due to ipb load at the crown toe and heel of the connection as shown in eq 1 1 l j f ϕ i p b m i p b where ϕ ipb is the connection local rotation expressed in eq 2 m ipb is the brace ipb moment 2 ϕ i p b δ 2 δ 2 δ 1 δ 1 d t sin θ the d and t are the brace diameter and thickness respectively the θ is the angle between brace and chord δ 1 and δ 2 are the respective displacement at the crown toe and heel measured perpendicular to the chord axis as indicated in fig 2 δ 1 and δ 2 are the displacement at the bottom of chord corresponding to δ 1 and δ 2 respectively to relate the ljf to joint geometry a non dimensional factor called the f ljf is introduced for the connections under ipb load the f ljf can be determined using the following equation 3 f l j f ϕ i p b m i p b e d 3 where d and e and are the chord diameter and young s modulus respectively 4 fe strategy the welds were generated in each fe model the welds connecting collar brace and collar chord were modeled according to the american welding society aws 2015 the solid element 186 was applied for meshing the chord plates brace and welds the mesh generated in the connection intersection is depicted in fig 2 also the linear static analysis is appropriate for the prediction of ljf in chs connections gao et al 2013 2014 augmented lagrange technique was used for solving the interaction between the plates and chord member contact was detected on gauss positions bottom faces of the strengthening plates were taken as target faces outer faces of the chord wall were taken as contact faces nassiraei et al 2017 swanson analysis systems inc 2009 both chord ends were only allowed to rotate furthermore due to symmetry in the loading conditions and the geometry of the connections only one fourth of the whole t connection and one half of the y connections were modeled see fig 3 5 verification of the fe model the precision of fe results should be verified as per the authors knowledge no experimental theoretical fe database of f ljf for chs t y connections strengthened with the plate is available in the literature in view of this issue following research works are used to validate the fe model four unreinforced and collar plate reinforced t joints under compressive and tensile load carried out by shao 2016 three experimental y connections under ipb load conducted by fessler et al 1986 eight y connections under ipb load extracted from the formula proposed by fessler et al 1986 and an experimental x connection strengthened with the collar plate conducted by the present author nassiraei et al 2017 the details of the connections have been presented in table 1 fig 4 shows that local joint flexibility results for the unreinforced y joints under ipb load as it can be observed an enough agreement is between the results of the present fe model and the experimental data and the extracted data from the available equations fig 5 compares the load deformation diagrams of the fe model with the experimental data provided by shao 2016 and the present author in nassiraei et al 2017 it shows that the present fe model can predict the behavior of the tubular joint reinforced with collar plate with good accuracy results show the that the initial stiffness of the collar plate reinforced joints predicted by the present fe model and experimental tests are very close in other hand the present study of f ljf for the connections is within the elastic range therefore the modeling of the collar plate reinforced joints in the current fe model is accepted it can be concluded that the generated fe model can be considered to be accurate and safe enough to provide reliable results 6 geometrical influence on the f ljf 6 1 details of the parametric investigation a set of 168 fe models were generated in ansys software package to investigate the effect of the connection geometry the angle between brace and chord and the plate size on the f ljf of the strengthened t y connections under ipb load the parameters include the proportion of the radius to wall thickness of the chord γ the diameter proportion between brace and chord β the angle between brace and chord θ the proportion of the thickness of the brace to chord τ the plate length coefficient η δ c d and the plate thickness coefficient τ c t c t the fe models table 2 include four different θ θ 45 60 75 and 90 three different γ proportions γ 12 18 24 three different β proportions β 0 4 0 5 0 6 three different τ proportions τ 0 55 0 7 1 0 four different η proportions η 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 0 and five different τ c proportions τ c 1 0 1 25 1 5 1 75 2 0 to compare the f ljf of the collar plate strengthened connections with the corresponding un strengthened connections a new parameter λ f ljf c f ljf u is introduced 6 2 the influence of the γ on the fljf in this research program the influence of the γ and the strengthening plate size η and τ c on the f ljf c and λ λ f ljf c f ljf u is investigated the f ljf c is the f ljf of the reinforced connection the f ljf u is the f ljf of the un strengthened connection fig 6 shows the f ljf of the un reinforced and the reinforced connections with different γ proportions γ 12 and 24 η proportions η 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 and τ c proportions τ c 1 1 25 1 5 1 75 and 2 the comparison results show that the f ljf of the reinforced connections are considerably smaller than the corresponding un reinforced connections since in the reinforced connections the strengthening plate enhances the chord thickness in the vicinity of the connection intersection the increase of the chord thickness leads to the reduction of the deformation therefore the utilization of the strengthening plate results in the reduction of the f ljf for example in the connections with γ 12 β 0 6 θ 45 and τ 1 0 the f ljf of the un strengthened and the corresponding strengthened connection η 0 75 τ c 1 75 are equal to 445 2 and 184 4 respectively furthermore the results show that the increase of the collar plate size leads to the reduction of the f ljf for instance in the reinforced joints with γ 12 β 0 6 θ 45 τ 1 0 and η 1 the f ljf of the strengthened connections with τ c 1 and τ c 2 are equal to 232 4 and 148 5 respectively therefore the utilization of the plates with large size can significantly improve the f ljf in addition fig 6 shows that the f ljf of the strengthened connections with smaller γ is smaller for instance in the connections with β 0 6 τ 1 η 0 75 and τ c 1 5 the f ljf values are 199 1 and 670 for the connections with γ 12 and 24 respectively because the plate thickness and the chord wall thickness of the connections with γ 12 are twice of the plate thickness and the chord wall thickness of the connections with γ 24 respectively fig 6c and d show the proportion of the f ljf of the strengthened connections to the corresponding un strengthened connection λ as it can be observed the plate can remarkably reduce the f ljf of the tubular connections under ipb load to give an example in the connections with γ 24 β 0 6 θ 45 and τ 1 0 the f ljf of the strengthened with the strengthening plate can be down to 43 of the f ljf of the corresponding un strengthened connection moreover it can be observed that the increment of the γ results in the increment of the λ on the contrary the increment of the plate thickness and length leads to the remarkable reduction of the λ hence the collar plate strengthening method is a good choice for the strengthening of the joints to reduce of the f ljf comparison between the present study results and the fessler et al 1986 equations for the un strengthened y connections under ipb load shows that the results of both methods are close for the connections with γ 12 β 0 6 θ 45 τ 1 0 the f ljf obtained from the present fe model and the equation are 445 2 and 429 2 respectively therefore the proportion of the f ljf of the present fe model to the f ljf of the equation is equal to 1 04 also in the connections with γ 24 β 0 6 θ 45 τ 1 0 the f ljf obtained from the present fe model and the equations are 1235 and 1423 7 respectively hence the proportion of the f ljf of the fe model to the f ljf of the formula is equal to 87 6 3 influence of the θ on the fljf fig 7 shows that effect of the θ on the λ is not remarkable but the effect of the η and τ c on the λ is remarkable also the enhancement of the η and τ c leads to the considerable reduction of the λ to give an example for the connections with θ 60 γ 18 β 0 5 τ 0 55 fig 7a the use of the plate with τ c 2 0 and η 1 result in the reduction of 71 of the f ljf as a result the collar plate a good method for decreasing the f ljf of y connections under ipb load 6 4 the influence of the β on the fljf of the connections with large γ this section investigates the effect of the β and the plate size η and τ c on the f ljf of the strengthened connections with large values of the γ fig 8 shows the f ljf of the connections with different β η and τ c results illustrate that the f ljf of the reinforced connections are considerably smaller than the f ljf of the corresponding un reinforced connections for instance in the connections with β 0 6 γ 24 θ 45 and τ 0 7 the f ljf of the un strengthened and corresponding strengthened connection η 0 5 τ c 2 are equal to 1371 0 and 689 8 respectively furthermore the results show that the increment of the η and τ c results in the reduction of the f ljf because the increment of the τ c results in the increment of the t t d in the near of the connection intersection in addition the increment of the η leads to the enhancement of the more area of the chord wall near the connection intersection the enhance of the connection intersection leads to the reduction of the deformation in the connection intersection therefore the f ljf will be decreased by increasing the plate length and thickness as an example for the strengthened joints with τ c 1 β 0 5 γ 24 θ 45 and τ 0 7 the increment of the η from 0 25 to 1 0 results in the reduction of the f ljf from 1414 5 to 1207 6 consequently the utilization of the plates with larger the η and τ c can lead to a more reduction of the f ljf in addition fig 8a and b show that the f ljf of the strengthened connections with larger β is smaller as an example for connections with γ 24 τ 0 7 η 1 and τ c 1 5 the change of the β from 0 5 to 0 6 leads to the reduction of the f ljf from 982 8 to 706 8 because the brace diameter and the plate length of the connections with β 0 6 are larger than the brace diameter and the plate length of the connections with β 0 5 respectively fig 8c and d show that the increment of the β results in the slight increment of the λ on the contrary the increment of the plate size leads to the considerable reduction of the λ the comparison between the results of this paper and the fessler et al 1986 equations indicates that the results of the two methods are close for the connections with γ 24 β 0 5 θ 45 τ 0 7 the f ljf predicted from the present fe model and the fessler et al 1986 equation are 2025 7 and 2237 respectively hence the proportion of the f ljf of the fe model to the f ljf of the fessler et al 1986 formula is equal to 91 also for the joints with β 0 6 γ 24 θ 45 τ 0 7 the f ljf predicted from the present fe model and the fessler et al 1986 equation are 1371 and 1423 respectively therefore the proportion of the f ljf of the fe model to the f ljf of the fessler et al 1986 equation is equal to 96 6 5 the influence of the β on the fljf of the connections with small γ comparison fig 9 a and b indicate that the increment of the β results in the slight increment of the λ on the contrary the increment of the η and τ c leads to the notable reduction of the λ it means that increase of both the η and τ c results in considerable decrease of the displacement at the connection intersection therefore this is a good alternative for strengthening the connection for example in fig 9a for the connection with a small plate τ c 1 and η 0 25 the f ljf proportion of strengthened to the corresponding un strengthened connections is equal to 65 however for the corresponding connection with large plate τ c 1 75 and η 1 this parameter is equal to 37 6 6 influence of the τ on the fljf figs 6b and 8b show that by increasing the τ from 0 7 to 1 0 the f ljf of strengthened joints is slowly but figs 6d and 8d show that by increasing the τ the f ljf proportion of reinforced to the corresponding un reinforced joints are not changed 7 parametric equation for the prediction of the f ljf values so far no formula has been derived for determining the f ljf of chs t y connections strengthened with collar plate under ipb load hence by using the data of the current 168 fe analyses and the software package spss v22 a new equation formula was derived for this matter 4 f ljf c f ljf u 23 77η 0 026 τ c 0 01 β 0 003 γ 0 008 θ 0 02 0 025θ 6 6 β 0 14 311 16η 0 0023 334 84 r2 0 952 where f ljf c is the f ljf of the strengthened t y connections under ipb load f ljf u is the f ljf of the un strengthened t y connections subject under ipb load r 2 is the determination factor its value is acceptable and good the valid ranges for the application of eq 4 are as follows 5 12 γ 24 0 4 β 0 6 0 55 τ 1 0 45 θ 90 0 25 η 1 0 1 0 τ c 2 0 in fig 10 the f ljf proportions λ f ljf c f ljf u predicted by the proposed equation are compared with the corresponding values obtained from fe analysis it can be seen from the value of r 2 r 2 0 953 that the proposed formula can be considered to be accurate enough to generate reliable results the uk department of energy 1983 suggests the following evaluation standard these standards are established on the applicability of the formula in the following evaluation standard p e is the proportion of the predicted value to the empirical value for the given dataset if p e 1 0 25 and p e 0 8 5 then the formula is accepted if furthermore p e 1 5 50 then the equation is commonly conservative if 25 p e 1 0 30 and or 5 p e 0 8 7 5 then the equation is boundary and engineering judgment should be used for more assessment otherwise the equation is unacceptable bomel consulting engineers 1994 suggested that the requirement for p e 1 0 25 can be eliminate in the evaluating of the equations since for a mean fit equation there is always a lot of percentage of under prediction evaluating the proposed formula according to the uk department of energy 1983 standard are tabulated in table 3 as can be observed in this table the derived equation satisfies the standard suggested by the uk doe 8 conclusions altogether 168 finite element models were created to investigate the influence of the strengthening plate size and the connection geometry of the strengthened t y connections on the local joint flexibility factor f ljf subjected to ipb load the following conclusions can be drawn validation of the fe results against experimental results and available equations indicates that the current fe model can well determine the f ljf of un strengthened and the strengthened t y connections under ipb load the f ljf of a collar plate strengthened t y connection can be down to 29 of the f ljf of the corresponding un strengthened connection the enhancement of the plate thickness and length leads to the remarkable reduction of the f ljf and the λ λ the f ljf proportion of the strengthened to corresponding un strengthened connections because the strengthening plate considerably enhances the chord wall thickness in the near of the connection intersection in the strengthened connections the increment of the γ leads to the increment of the f ljf and the λ but the change of the θ cannot lead to the change of the λ in the strengthened connections the increase of the β leads to the reduction of the f ljf on the contrary the increment of the β leads to the increment of the λ the increment of the τ leads to the slight reduction of the f ljf of the un strengthened and the strengthened connections also the effect of τ on the λ can be ignored a design formula is proposed for predicting the f ljf of the chs t y connections strengthened with collar plate under to ipb load the derived equation having high coefficients of determination r 2 0 953 was evaluated based on the acceptance standard suggested by the uk doe and can be reliably applied for the fabrication and reinforcing of chs connections in structures credit authorship contribution statement hossein nassiraei

21954,ship domain is crucial for traffic risk assessment and safe navigation at sea especially in high density traffic this study proposes a fuzzy rule based model to create an asymmetrical polygonal ship domain for both restricted waters and open waters the model takes into consideration various navigational factors which are determined as a result of expert interviews a c application based on fuzzy inference system fis with mamdani model has been implemented to create the size and shape of the domain finally a few experimental tests and comparative implementations with other ship domains have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed system the proposed ship domain will undoubtedly contribute to the ship traffic engineering and is considerably utilized in collision risk assessment and traffic design keywords ship domain collision risk assessment knowledge based model fis 1 introduction the determination of safe area surrounding a ship is considerably important and has a crucial role for safety of navigation at sea wang and chin 2016 the free area which is called ship safety domain hereinafter referred as ship domain is a beneficial concept in ship traffic engineering and is considerably used in collision risk assessment traffic design vts operations and other applications jingsong et al 1993 especially for traffic risk assessment the concept is a popular safety criterion together with the method based on traffic flow theory and the method based on the distance at the closest point of approach dcpa and the remaining time to the closest point of approach tcpa which is principally equivalent to the application of a circular ship domain whose radius is the smallest admissible distance between the ships szlapczynski 2006 xu and wang 2014 the concept ship domain has various definitions depending on a purpose of developing a domain model despite various definitions introduced by particular scholars they basically refer to the same meaning the most prevalent and adopted ones were proposed by fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 and coldwell 1983 the first definition was made in the early seventies by fujii and tanaka 1971 as the domain around a vessel underway which most navigators of following vessels would avoid entering goodwin 1975 immediately thereafter furthered the existence of the ship domain and developed a model for open water navigation in this initiative the concept was defined as the effective area around a ship which a navigator would like to keep free with respect to other ships and stationary objects in the middle of eighties coldwell 1983 improved the fujii and tanaka 1971 and goodwin 1975 models for restricted waters considering the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colreg where the ship domain is defined as the effective area around a vessel which a typical navigator actually keeps free considering the other vessel all definitions jointly emphasize the ship domain as a water area surrounding a ship to ensure the safety of navigation and to eliminate the collision risk jingsong et al 1993 on the other hand the definitions are close to each other but researchers may interpret it in various ways causing different safety measures to be applied in their research utilizing a ship domain in case of an encounter situations can be practically implemented with one of the four safety measures mentioned below as illustrated in fig 1 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 i a target ship ts should not violate the own ship s os domain ii os should not violate a ts s domain iii neither of them should be violated iv ship domain should not overlap the areas should remain outside each other szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 has asserted that the last one labelled as iv in fig 1 of these four criteria is the strongest and safest and it does not fully comply with the definitions of any domain names given above the authors have also conducted an analysis using the coldwell s domain whose model is shown in fig 2 to clearly follow the differences of these four criteria in practice various types of encounter situations including head on crossing and overtaking have been analysed to correspond the differences the results of the analysis have shown that the first criterion comprises a comparatively small area in particular for head on situation approaching from starboard bow the small area in case of the ts on port side a give way ship according to colreg can be problematic and if the ts does not manoeuvre the os should perform an avoiding action to ensure a larger area the second criterion is similar to the first one but provides a slightly larger area in case of a head on situation especially the ts approaching from starboard bow the third criterion shows a reasonable area for all encounters and the fourth one frankly provides the largest area between ships the authors have concluded that the third criterion is the only one that provides both safe and completely compatible with the domain s traditional definitions after these initial studies that shed light on the field many researchers have proposed various ship domain models with different approaches up to the present based on the literature in the field it can be stated that the method to generate a ship domain is roughly divided into three categories empirical ship domain knowledge based ship domain and analytical ship domain liu et al 2016 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and magaj 2017 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 in addition to these methods there is also a method with probabilistic structure zhang and meng 2019 therefore the probabilistic ship domain should be added to this classification as a result methods in the literature can be categorized as follows empirical ship domain knowledge based ship domain analytical ship domain and probabilistic ship domain on the other hand it should be pointed out that there is also a method that has emerged with the combination of these methods e g dinh and im 2016 in this paper a knowledge based model structure has been introduced to create an asymmetrical polygonal ship domain for both restricted waters and open waters a c application based on fuzzy inference system fis with mamdani model has been implemented to create the size and shape of the domain the study considers how this method can be implemented to enhance navigational safety within such waters the initial version of the method has been presented by the authors yardimci et al 2019 as a conference paper as a result of the feedback obtained at the end of the conference minor revisions were conducted to the model the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows section 2 presents a review and summary of past and current models of a ship domain followed by section 3 which gives an information about the methodology and the model explanation of the proposed method section 4 provides experimental test results and section 5 presents a discussion and comparison with other models introduced by various researchers followed by the conclusions including final evaluation of the results and recommendations for further studies in section 6 2 literature review there are several papers in ship domain field and their authors introduced a brief analysis of what has been conducted so far on the other hand summaries of related papers have also been made by various authors to provide a systematic and critical review baran et al 2018 tam et al 2009 xu and wang 2014 and to make a comparison of current ship domain models szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 the most comprehensive one which is fully devoted to reviewing ship domain models has been prepared by szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 the authors have conducted an in depth review of the contemporary ship domain methods and have summed up current trends of its development they have also discussed about the ship domain concepts in terms of definition safety criteria research methodology and factors taken into account since its establishment the theory of ship domain has been continuously developed and subjected to many modifications in the following years many researchers thought over the ship domain and conducted various studies xu and wang 2014 in the past decades particularly various ship domains with different dimensions and shapes have been introduced by many researchers wang 2013 the approaches of determining a ship domain may be distinguished into four groups empirical statistical analytical knowledge based and probabilistic detailed information for these approaches has been provided in the following sections it should be stated that these four groups are not completely separated from each other and models combination of at least two approaches are possible a summary of ship domains proposed by various authors and factors taken into consideration in several domain methods are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively the classification in table 2 extends from the classification made by szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 2 1 empirical statistical ship domains empirical domain methods are determined empirically based on the ship positions and trajectories data obtained from radar automatic identification system ais or marine traffic investigation the methods have been initially and traditionally used for developing the shape and size of the ship domain but most of them have not been well calibrated wang and chin 2016 the earliest empirical based ship domain has been prepared by fujii and tanaka 1971 using ship movements data obtained from radar to contribute the safe navigation at japan waters fujii and tanaka s domain depends primarily on the ship length regardless of other factors such as manoeuvrability sailing speed etc another empirical based model which statistically analyses radar data like fujii and tanaka s approach has been introduced by goodwin 1975 goodwin s domain is a circular type model represented by three disparate segments according to the arcs of a ship s side and stern lights shown in fig 3 with different but constant radius 0 85 nm 0 7 nm 0 45 nm which is not changed depending on sailing speed and ship length the domain has been criticized by some researchers davis et al 1980 liu et al 2016 because of lacking of smooth curve with sudden change between segments level and discontinuity in segments transition the main difference between the fujii and tanaka s model and goodwin s models is that their survey areas for restricted waters and for open waters respectively are different the operational difference between the two models can be mentioned by noting that the radius of the fujii and tanaka s domain is usually larger than that of the goodwin s domain which of these models is appropriate depends on the objective of the analysis if safe navigation and water capacity are the primary aims the fujii and tanaka s model is appropriate however if a critical danger factor is of aim the goodwin s model can be more appropriate coldwell 1983 after almost a decade coldwell 1983 furthered these two models for narrow fairways and confined waters regarding the colreg rules as an another empirical based model which is based on processing of radar data coldwell s domain whose borders are shown in fig 2 indicates the different aspect value for each encounter situation meeting and overtaking the meeting domain which refers head on and crossing for example has not the aft sector which is highlighted as a shaded area in fig 2 this domain type has been criticized by szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 with the thought that it may pose a problem in particular for crossing situation in the contemporary empirical models ais data has been used instead of radar data to determine a ship domain the model introduced by hansen et al 2013 can be exemplified as the first model with an empirical structure processing of ais data the authors have tried to estimate the minimum ship domain dimensions using ais data of ships sailing in danish waters during four year period 2006 2010 the results of the study revealed that the domain has a length of 8 ship lengths l and a breadth of 3 2l which is similar to dimensions of fujii and tanaka s domain following this initial study other models pietrzykowski and magaj 2017 rawson et al 2014 wang and chin 2016 successfully using ais data have emerged and contributed to the field the most current one has been proposed by pietrzykowski and magaj 2017 they have examined ship domains in traffic separation schemes tss using ais data of ships sailing on the baltic sea the study has shown that the domain dimensions have a length of 19 8l and a breadth of 8 2l almost 2 5 times larger than hansen s domain 2 2 analytical ship domains analytical methods for determining the boundaries limit of a ship domain are based on a mathematical description and theories from various disciplines pietrzykowski 2008 compared with the other domain methods especially statistical based analytical methods determine the size and shape of the ship domain by considering properties and characteristics e g positions speeds directions of the ship however they sometimes may fail to meet the need of ship domains in complex environments because of ignoring the impact of human factors and the environment liu et al 2016 the ship domain model proposed by wang 2010 is exactly an analytical domain in this study quaternion ship domain qsd concept has been introduced illustrated in fig 4 where the size of the domain is designated by the quaternion containing four radii i e fore aft starboard and port parameters such as manoeuvrability speed course etc factors influencing the domain have been taken into consideration on the other hand the domain shape which might be represented as quadrangle or combined ellipse is formed by another parameter termed as k which makes the domain more flexible and practicable the concept has been furthered by the author wang 2013 in order to obtain principal subjectivity and objectivity of ship domains this new model called dynamic quaternion ship domain dqsd has a dynamic structure unlike the previous one krata and montewka 2015 have also proposed an analytical concept but this concept creates an atypical ship domain called critical area the authors argue that the area determines the no go area around the os that should not be violated by other ships if any violation occurs collision may not be avoided by the action of os alone another analytical approach which includes also an empirical structure has been proposed by dinh and im 2016 the approach provides an atypical ship domain like concept of critical area the authors use two definitions blocking area and action area so as to refer the area that should not be violated by any object the last two models mentioned above are principally more similar to the arena concept introduced by davis et al 1980 along with the paper by dinh and im 2016 the most recent ship domain study with analytical structure has been introduced by liu et al 2016 illustrated in fig 5 to analyse capacity of channel of tianjin port china the ship domain with dynamic characteristic has been developed from the fujii and tanaka 1971 s model considering navigable area ship behaviours ship types and navigators skills in an integrated manner 2 3 knowledge based ship domains difficulties and complexities in analytical description of the ship domain have led to the need for seeking other methods of representation artificial intelligence ai tools especially artificial neural networks ann and fuzzy logic are one of these methods which enable using criteria principally applied by navigators the determination of the ship domain using these type of methods is called as knowledge based ship domain the knowledge and skills of navigators related to the navigational situations are the basis for creating it çiçek 2019 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 zhang and meng 2019 the model prepared by jingsong et al 1993 can be referenced as a pioneer knowledge based model the authors have created a circular type static ship domain using the theory of fuzzy logic for open waters similarly kao et al 2007 and su et al 2012 have also proposed fuzzy logic based models for determining a ship domain the former one is specialized to provide an alert system for vts using ship domain to predict the position and time of all potential collisions the latter one similarly aims to provide an alert system for vts but unlike the former one the domain surrounds the potential collision point rather than ships ann is another tool to create a knowledge based ship domain model lisowski et al 2000 have used for instance the neural classifier which has a form of a multilayer feed forward network of a perceptronic nature for determining the ship domain zhu et al 2001 have also introduced a knowledge based ship domain utilizing the neural networks that takes into account visibility and manoeuvrability in this study a subjective domain and an objective domain concept have been defined for the first time the authors have made the definitions of the subjective domain and the objective domain as the subjective domain is the waters that a navigator really wants to be kept safe usually used for risk assessment by the navigator while the objective domain is the facts that a navigator has to accept some researchers have proposed knowledge based models using these two tools fuzzy logic and ann together pietrzykowski 2008 and pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 have introduced for example knowledge based ship domain models combining the neural network and fuzzy logic for narrow fairways and open waters respectively pietrzykowski 2008 has firstly investigated concept of ship domains and models found in the related field thereafter a model of navigational safety assessment utilizing the fuzzy ship domain has been introduced for ships in narrow fairways pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 have also implemented the similar concept for ships in open waters 2 4 probabilistic ship domains probabilistic ship domains are basically similar to empirical ship domains because they use navigational data obtained from ais arpa radar etc the concept of probabilistic domain has been initially introduced by gucma and marcjan 2012 with the following hypothesis probabilistic domain can be built based on data from the distribution of the passing ships cpa the study provides a model to determine a ship domain shape based on the minimum passing distance of ships in the baltic sea using the ais data processing another probabilistic ship domain model has been recently proposed by zhang and meng 2019 the authors have developed an effective big ais data driven approach to create a probabilistic ship domain named α domain for confined waters case studies have been conducted at the singapore strait to compare the proposed domain with three empirical domains fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 hansen et al 2013 and to demonstrate the application of the proposed domain in collision risk assessment the results of the case studies have showed that α domain almost matches fujii and tanaka s domain on the port and starboard sides and matches goodwin s domain on the aft side 3 methodology in this study a mamdani type fis using c programming language has been introduced to create an asymmetrical polygonal ship domain mamdani type fis method is one of the most accepted method in fuzzy logic methodology the method has advantages in terms of being suitable for human input and having learning and intuitive properties mathworks 2019 sivanandam et al 2007 fuzzy rules in the system have been generated with multiple input single output miso if then rules triangular and trapezoidal membership functions as a fuzzification method sum method as an aggregation method wabl weighted averaging based on levels method introduced by nasibov 2002 as a defuzzification method have been used to generate the structure of the fis a number of factors as shown in table 2 such as type of navigation area size and type of vessels weather conditions human factors absolutely affect the size and shape of the ship domain however we have consulted with a total of 12 experts who are captains and officers via interview method one of the first hand data collection methods to make sure which factors affect the ship domain in practice during the interviews the factors affecting the ship domain have been asked and they have been determined as ship length l ship speed v manoeuvrability m traffic state t navigator experience n day time daylight or night d weather condition w visibility i and relative bearing rb of the ts e n 9 s h l v m t n d w i e which are input variables of the fis affecting size s and shape h of the ship domain consequently the fis has been defined by nine linguistic input variables and two linguistic output variables inputs l v m t n d w i induce the size of the domain while input e induces the shape of it the shape value is determined depending on the angle of the vector of each node of the ship domain v e c t o r a n g l e and the e value the function called as t s r b n o r m is calculated by equation 1 1 t s r b n o r m 180 e v e c t o r

empirical analysis carried out by goodwin 1975 the distance between ships ought to be at least 0 9 nm in this reason values generated from fis are normalized in the interval of 0 9 5 assuming the highest value of the domain is 5 nm the highest value for ship domain has been also determined as a result of expert interviews the question what should be the maximum size of the ship safety area has been asked to define the maximum value among the answers given to the question the value 5 nm was the most frequent one eventually to determine the ship domain dimensions vector lengths vl are specified by determining x i y i position of each node of the ship domain the shape and size values of the ship domain are determined as a result of fis equation 2 and equation 3 are used for the

follows for size for example ri if l is short and v is slow then s is short for shape for example ri if tsrbnorm is straight then h is verylong as a result a total of 238 fuzzy rules have been generated from the combination of the value of these linguistic variables 4 experimental test results situations meeting on reciprocal courses and approaching from the beam are the most prevalence encounter types taking place at sea the situation approaching from the stern however also occurs frequently the experiments conducted in this study comprise of various cases including head on meeting on reciprocal courses crossing ts is approaching from the beam of the os and overtaking ts is approaching from the stern of the os encounter situations the aim of the experimental test is to show and demonstrate the performance of the proposed system the different parameter settings shown in table 3 have been run for each encounter situation to reveal how the system works for different cases the computational process has been implemented with a pc characteristic with an intel core i7 7700 2 80 ghz processor 16 gb ram 64 bit windows 10 pro the fuzzy system which is controlled via c based user interface illustrated in fig 8 can generate a ship domain having from 8 nodes to 360 nodes in the experiments it is assumed that arpa radar and ais provide the navigational data of the ships to the fuzzy system in case 1 meeting on reciprocal courses have been experienced the output of the 8 nodes and 16 nodes approximations of the fuzzy ship domain for this case are illustrated in fig 9 a and fig 9 b and value of each node is shown in fig 12 a and fig 12 b with diamond shape respectively when the length of os l is 200 m speed of os v is 15 knots manoeuvrability of os m is high traffic state in the navigation area t consists of 8 ships navigator experience who is on watch n is 7 years day time d is daylight weather condition in navigation area w is 3 force visibility in the navigation area i is about 8 nm and relative bearing of the ts tsrb is 003 in case 2 ts is approaching from the beam of the os the output of the 8 nodes and 16 nodes approximations of the fuzzy ship domain for this case are illustrated in fig 10 a and fig 10 b and value of each node is shown in fig 12 a and fig 12 b with circle shape respectively when the length of os l is 150 m speed of os v is 11 knots manoeuvrability of os m is medium traffic state in the navigation area t consists of 5 ships navigator experience who is on watch n is 2 years day time d is night weather condition in navigation area w is 8 force visibility in the navigation area i is about 4 nm and tsrb is 075 in case 3 os is approaching from the stern of the ts the outputs of the 8 nodes and 16 nodes approximations of the fuzzy ship domain for this case are illustrated in fig 11 a and fig 11 b and value of each node is shown in fig 12 a and fig 12 b with triangle shape respectively when the length of os l is 220 m speed of os v is 13 knots manoeuvrability of os m is high traffic state in the navigation area t consists of 3 ships navigator experience who is on watch n is 9 years day time d is night weather condition in navigation area w is 6 force visibility in the navigation area is about i 7 nm and tsrb is 000 5 discussion in this section it is aimed to compare the proposed ship domain approach with the results of the current ship domains in the literature the ship domain model introduced in this study and selected current models are taken into consideration for comparison various encounter situations i e head on and crossing are organized to show the performance of the proposed system pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 s model and wang and chin 2016 s model a knowledge based and an empirical method respectively are used for comparative studies with different parameter settings listed in table 4 length and speed input values of the os are assigned same as in these studies but others are defined to produce the smallest ship domain 5 1 comparison with knowledge based ship domain pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 proposed a knowledge based ship domain model using the learning process of a neural network regarding both length and speed of the os for open waters the model uses fuzzy function to correspond the level of navigational safety where 0 represents the safe situation while 1 represents the dangerous situation which may result in a collision γ 0 1 to implement a comparison head on and two types of crossing encounter tsrb values are 15 and 45 respectively situations have been organized with the ship parameters as listed in table 4 four levels of navigational safety in the pietrzykowski and uriasz s model have been selected represented by γ 0 4 0 5 0 8 0 9 γ 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 9 γ 0 2 0 3 0 5 0 9 for head on and crossing encounters respectively the comparison of the outputs of the proposed model and pietrzykowski and uriasz s model is shown in fig 13 for the three situations on the other hand fig 14 also shows the comparison of dimensions of ship domains scaled regarding loa between proposed model and pietrzykowski and uriasz s model in head on and crossing situations pietrzykowski and uriasz s model for the γ 0 1 safety level is more conservative than proposed model for crossing situation from 15 as shown in fig 13 b it should be also noted that for crossing encounter from 45 illustrated in fig 13 c pietrzykowski and uriasz s model is longer than proposed model for fore side but not for port and starboard sides the proposed model seems to be similar to pietrzykowski and uriasz s model for the crossing cases with γ 0 2 safety level particularly on the aft port and starboard sides for the fore side for crossing from 45 pietrzykowski and uriasz s model is considerably longer than that of the proposed model approximately 0 5 nm as a result these two models are generally similar especially for the crossing encounters however we cannot say the same for the head on situation in the head on situation aft side of the proposed model is significantly longer than that of pietrzykowski and uriasz s model for all levels of navigational safety 5 2 comparison with empirical ship domain wang and chin 2016 has introduced an empirical ship domain for confined waters which is dynamically enlarged with ship speed in the study ship traffic data in singapore port and singapore strait was collected from the vessel traffic information system vtis database operated by the maritime and port authority of singapore mpa to implement a comparison head on and crossing encounter tsrb 15 situations have been formed with the ship parameters listed in table 4 the comparison of the outputs of the proposed model and wang and chin s model is shown in fig 15 for various situations on the other hand fig 16 also shows the comparison of dimensions of ship domains scaled regarding loa between proposed model and wang and chin s model in a head on and crossing situations respectively the proposed model is rather more conservative than that of wang and chin s model especially for fore port and starboard sides it is clearly seen in fig 15 that wang and chin s model is considerably precautionary to ships approaching from the fore and aft than those approaching from the port and starboard sides 6 conclusions in this paper a knowledge based model structure has been introduced to create an asymmetrical polygonal ship domain for both restricted waters and open waters a c application based on fuzzy inference system fis with mamdani model has been implemented to determine the size and shape of the domain unlike some other forms of ship domain the proposed model has an asymmetrical and polygonal feature several experimental tests with various encounter situations and comparative implementations with other ship domains have been conducted to show the performance of the proposed system experimental test results show that the proposed model has advantage due to being more conservative than others the proposed method provides contribution to ship collision avoidance process automation of ship motion control and ship traffic engineering the proposed model can also be utilized to the ship collision avoidance methods or safe trajectory estimations for further studies credit authorship contribution statement remzi fiskin

21954,ship domain is crucial for traffic risk assessment and safe navigation at sea especially in high density traffic this study proposes a fuzzy rule based model to create an asymmetrical polygonal ship domain for both restricted waters and open waters the model takes into consideration various navigational factors which are determined as a result of expert interviews a c application based on fuzzy inference system fis with mamdani model has been implemented to create the size and shape of the domain finally a few experimental tests and comparative implementations with other ship domains have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed system the proposed ship domain will undoubtedly contribute to the ship traffic engineering and is considerably utilized in collision risk assessment and traffic design keywords ship domain collision risk assessment knowledge based model fis 1 introduction the determination of safe area surrounding a ship is considerably important and has a crucial role for safety of navigation at sea wang and chin 2016 the free area which is called ship safety domain hereinafter referred as ship domain is a beneficial concept in ship traffic engineering and is considerably used in collision risk assessment traffic design vts operations and other applications jingsong et al 1993 especially for traffic risk assessment the concept is a popular safety criterion together with the method based on traffic flow theory and the method based on the distance at the closest point of approach dcpa and the remaining time to the closest point of approach tcpa which is principally equivalent to the application of a circular ship domain whose radius is the smallest admissible distance between the ships szlapczynski 2006 xu and wang 2014 the concept ship domain has various definitions depending on a purpose of developing a domain model despite various definitions introduced by particular scholars they basically refer to the same meaning the most prevalent and adopted ones were proposed by fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 and coldwell 1983 the first definition was made in the early seventies by fujii and tanaka 1971 as the domain around a vessel underway which most navigators of following vessels would avoid entering goodwin 1975 immediately thereafter furthered the existence of the ship domain and developed a model for open water navigation in this initiative the concept was defined as the effective area around a ship which a navigator would like to keep free with respect to other ships and stationary objects in the middle of eighties coldwell 1983 improved the fujii and tanaka 1971 and goodwin 1975 models for restricted waters considering the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colreg where the ship domain is defined as the effective area around a vessel which a typical navigator actually keeps free considering the other vessel all definitions jointly emphasize the ship domain as a water area surrounding a ship to ensure the safety of navigation and to eliminate the collision risk jingsong et al 1993 on the other hand the definitions are close to each other but researchers may interpret it in various ways causing different safety measures to be applied in their research utilizing a ship domain in case of an encounter situations can be practically implemented with one of the four safety measures mentioned below as illustrated in fig 1 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 i a target ship ts should not violate the own ship s os domain ii os should not violate a ts s domain iii neither of them should be violated iv ship domain should not overlap the areas should remain outside each other szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 has asserted that the last one labelled as iv in fig 1 of these four criteria is the strongest and safest and it does not fully comply with the definitions of any domain names given above the authors have also conducted an analysis using the coldwell s domain whose model is shown in fig 2 to clearly follow the differences of these four criteria in practice various types of encounter situations including head on crossing and overtaking have been analysed to correspond the differences the results of the analysis have shown that the first criterion comprises a comparatively small area in particular for head on situation approaching from starboard bow the small area in case of the ts on port side a give way ship according to colreg can be problematic and if the ts does not manoeuvre the os should perform an avoiding action to ensure a larger area the second criterion is similar to the first one but provides a slightly larger area in case of a head on situation especially the ts approaching from starboard bow the third criterion shows a reasonable area for all encounters and the fourth one frankly provides the largest area between ships the authors have concluded that the third criterion is the only one that provides both safe and completely compatible with the domain s traditional definitions after these initial studies that shed light on the field many researchers have proposed various ship domain models with different approaches up to the present based on the literature in the field it can be stated that the method to generate a ship domain is roughly divided into three categories empirical ship domain knowledge based ship domain and analytical ship domain liu et al 2016 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and magaj 2017 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 in addition to these methods there is also a method with probabilistic structure zhang and meng 2019 therefore the probabilistic ship domain should be added to this classification as a result methods in the literature can be categorized as follows empirical ship domain knowledge based ship domain analytical ship domain and probabilistic ship domain on the other hand it should be pointed out that there is also a method that has emerged with the combination of these methods e g dinh and im 2016 in this paper a knowledge based model structure has been introduced to create an asymmetrical polygonal ship domain for both restricted waters and open waters a c application based on fuzzy inference system fis with mamdani model has been implemented to create the size and shape of the domain the study considers how this method can be implemented to enhance navigational safety within such waters the initial version of the method has been presented by the authors yardimci et al 2019 as a conference paper as a result of the feedback obtained at the end of the conference minor revisions were conducted to the model the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows section 2 presents a review and summary of past and current models of a ship domain followed by section 3 which gives an information about the methodology and the model explanation of the proposed method section 4 provides experimental test results and section 5 presents a discussion and comparison with other models introduced by various researchers followed by the conclusions including final evaluation of the results and recommendations for further studies in section 6 2 literature review there are several papers in ship domain field and their authors introduced a brief analysis of what has been conducted so far on the other hand summaries of related papers have also been made by various authors to provide a systematic and critical review baran et al 2018 tam et al 2009 xu and wang 2014 and to make a comparison of current ship domain models szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2015 the most comprehensive one which is fully devoted to reviewing ship domain models has been prepared by szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 the authors have conducted an in depth review of the contemporary ship domain methods and have summed up current trends of its development they have also discussed about the ship domain concepts in terms of definition safety criteria research methodology and factors taken into account since its establishment the theory of ship domain has been continuously developed and subjected to many modifications in the following years many researchers thought over the ship domain and conducted various studies xu and wang 2014 in the past decades particularly various ship domains with different dimensions and shapes have been introduced by many researchers wang 2013 the approaches of determining a ship domain may be distinguished into four groups empirical statistical analytical knowledge based and probabilistic detailed information for these approaches has been provided in the following sections it should be stated that these four groups are not completely separated from each other and models combination of at least two approaches are possible a summary of ship domains proposed by various authors and factors taken into consideration in several domain methods are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively the classification in table 2 extends from the classification made by szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 2 1 empirical statistical ship domains empirical domain methods are determined empirically based on the ship positions and trajectories data obtained from radar automatic identification system ais or marine traffic investigation the methods have been initially and traditionally used for developing the shape and size of the ship domain but most of them have not been well calibrated wang and chin 2016 the earliest empirical based ship domain has been prepared by fujii and tanaka 1971 using ship movements data obtained from radar to contribute the safe navigation at japan waters fujii and tanaka s domain depends primarily on the ship length regardless of other factors such as manoeuvrability sailing speed etc another empirical based model which statistically analyses radar data like fujii and tanaka s approach has been introduced by goodwin 1975 goodwin s domain is a circular type model represented by three disparate segments according to the arcs of a ship s side and stern lights shown in fig 3 with different but constant radius 0 85 nm 0 7 nm 0 45 nm which is not changed depending on sailing speed and ship length the domain has been criticized by some researchers davis et al 1980 liu et al 2016 because of lacking of smooth curve with sudden change between segments level and discontinuity in segments transition the main difference between the fujii and tanaka s model and goodwin s models is that their survey areas for restricted waters and for open waters respectively are different the operational difference between the two models can be mentioned by noting that the radius of the fujii and tanaka s domain is usually larger than that of the goodwin s domain which of these models is appropriate depends on the objective of the analysis if safe navigation and water capacity are the primary aims the fujii and tanaka s model is appropriate however if a critical danger factor is of aim the goodwin s model can be more appropriate coldwell 1983 after almost a decade coldwell 1983 furthered these two models for narrow fairways and confined waters regarding the colreg rules as an another empirical based model which is based on processing of radar data coldwell s domain whose borders are shown in fig 2 indicates the different aspect value for each encounter situation meeting and overtaking the meeting domain which refers head on and crossing for example has not the aft sector which is highlighted as a shaded area in fig 2 this domain type has been criticized by szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 with the thought that it may pose a problem in particular for crossing situation in the contemporary empirical models ais data has been used instead of radar data to determine a ship domain the model introduced by hansen et al 2013 can be exemplified as the first model with an empirical structure processing of ais data the authors have tried to estimate the minimum ship domain dimensions using ais data of ships sailing in danish waters during four year period 2006 2010 the results of the study revealed that the domain has a length of 8 ship lengths l and a breadth of 3 2l which is similar to dimensions of fujii and tanaka s domain following this initial study other models pietrzykowski and magaj 2017 rawson et al 2014 wang and chin 2016 successfully using ais data have emerged and contributed to the field the most current one has been proposed by pietrzykowski and magaj 2017 they have examined ship domains in traffic separation schemes tss using ais data of ships sailing on the baltic sea the study has shown that the domain dimensions have a length of 19 8l and a breadth of 8 2l almost 2 5 times larger than hansen s domain 2 2 analytical ship domains analytical methods for determining the boundaries limit of a ship domain are based on a mathematical description and theories from various disciplines pietrzykowski 2008 compared with the other domain methods especially statistical based analytical methods determine the size and shape of the ship domain by considering properties and characteristics e g positions speeds directions of the ship however they sometimes may fail to meet the need of ship domains in complex environments because of ignoring the impact of human factors and the environment liu et al 2016 the ship domain model proposed by wang 2010 is exactly an analytical domain in this study quaternion ship domain qsd concept has been introduced illustrated in fig 4 where the size of the domain is designated by the quaternion containing four radii i e fore aft starboard and port parameters such as manoeuvrability speed course etc factors influencing the domain have been taken into consideration on the other hand the domain shape which might be represented as quadrangle or combined ellipse is formed by another parameter termed as k which makes the domain more flexible and practicable the concept has been furthered by the author wang 2013 in order to obtain principal subjectivity and objectivity of ship domains this new model called dynamic quaternion ship domain dqsd has a dynamic structure unlike the previous one krata and montewka 2015 have also proposed an analytical concept but this concept creates an atypical ship domain called critical area the authors argue that the area determines the no go area around the os that should not be violated by other ships if any violation occurs collision may not be avoided by the action of os alone another analytical approach which includes also an empirical structure has been proposed by dinh and im 2016 the approach provides an atypical ship domain like concept of critical area the authors use two definitions blocking area and action area so as to refer the area that should not be violated by any object the last two models mentioned above are principally more similar to the arena concept introduced by davis et al 1980 along with the paper by dinh and im 2016 the most recent ship domain study with analytical structure has been introduced by liu et al 2016 illustrated in fig 5 to analyse capacity of channel of tianjin port china the ship domain with dynamic characteristic has been developed from the fujii and tanaka 1971 s model considering navigable area ship behaviours ship types and navigators skills in an integrated manner 2 3 knowledge based ship domains difficulties and complexities in analytical description of the ship domain have led to the need for seeking other methods of representation artificial intelligence ai tools especially artificial neural networks ann and fuzzy logic are one of these methods which enable using criteria principally applied by navigators the determination of the ship domain using these type of methods is called as knowledge based ship domain the knowledge and skills of navigators related to the navigational situations are the basis for creating it çiçek 2019 pietrzykowski 2008 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 zhang and meng 2019 the model prepared by jingsong et al 1993 can be referenced as a pioneer knowledge based model the authors have created a circular type static ship domain using the theory of fuzzy logic for open waters similarly kao et al 2007 and su et al 2012 have also proposed fuzzy logic based models for determining a ship domain the former one is specialized to provide an alert system for vts using ship domain to predict the position and time of all potential collisions the latter one similarly aims to provide an alert system for vts but unlike the former one the domain surrounds the potential collision point rather than ships ann is another tool to create a knowledge based ship domain model lisowski et al 2000 have used for instance the neural classifier which has a form of a multilayer feed forward network of a perceptronic nature for determining the ship domain zhu et al 2001 have also introduced a knowledge based ship domain utilizing the neural networks that takes into account visibility and manoeuvrability in this study a subjective domain and an objective domain concept have been defined for the first time the authors have made the definitions of the subjective domain and the objective domain as the subjective domain is the waters that a navigator really wants to be kept safe usually used for risk assessment by the navigator while the objective domain is the facts that a navigator has to accept some researchers have proposed knowledge based models using these two tools fuzzy logic and ann together pietrzykowski 2008 and pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 have introduced for example knowledge based ship domain models combining the neural network and fuzzy logic for narrow fairways and open waters respectively pietrzykowski 2008 has firstly investigated concept of ship domains and models found in the related field thereafter a model of navigational safety assessment utilizing the fuzzy ship domain has been introduced for ships in narrow fairways pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 have also implemented the similar concept for ships in open waters 2 4 probabilistic ship domains probabilistic ship domains are basically similar to empirical ship domains because they use navigational data obtained from ais arpa radar etc the concept of probabilistic domain has been initially introduced by gucma and marcjan 2012 with the following hypothesis probabilistic domain can be built based on data from the distribution of the passing ships cpa the study provides a model to determine a ship domain shape based on the minimum passing distance of ships in the baltic sea using the ais data processing another probabilistic ship domain model has been recently proposed by zhang and meng 2019 the authors have developed an effective big ais data driven approach to create a probabilistic ship domain named α domain for confined waters case studies have been conducted at the singapore strait to compare the proposed domain with three empirical domains fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 hansen et al 2013 and to demonstrate the application of the proposed domain in collision risk assessment the results of the case studies have showed that α domain almost matches fujii and tanaka s domain on the port and starboard sides and matches goodwin s domain on the aft side 3 methodology in this study a mamdani type fis using c programming language has been introduced to create an asymmetrical polygonal ship domain mamdani type fis method is one of the most accepted method in fuzzy logic methodology the method has advantages in terms of being suitable for human input and having learning and intuitive properties mathworks 2019 sivanandam et al 2007 fuzzy rules in the system have been generated with multiple input single output miso if then rules triangular and trapezoidal membership functions as a fuzzification method sum method as an aggregation method wabl weighted averaging based on levels method introduced by nasibov 2002 as a defuzzification method have been used to generate the structure of the fis a number of factors as shown in table 2 such as type of navigation area size and type of vessels weather conditions human factors absolutely affect the size and shape of the ship domain however we have consulted with a total of 12 experts who are captains and officers via interview method one of the first hand data collection methods to make sure which factors affect the ship domain in practice during the interviews the factors affecting the ship domain have been asked and they have been determined as ship length l ship speed v manoeuvrability m traffic state t navigator experience n day time daylight or night d weather condition w visibility i and relative bearing rb of the ts e n 9 s h l v m t n d w i e which are input variables of the fis affecting size s and shape h of the ship domain consequently the fis has been defined by nine linguistic input variables and two linguistic output variables inputs l v m t n d w i induce the size of the domain while input e induces the shape of it the shape value is determined depending on the angle of the vector of each node of the ship domain v e c t o r a n g l e and the e value the function called as t s r b n o r m is calculated by equation 1 1 t s r b n o r m 180 e v e c t o r

empirical analysis carried out by goodwin 1975 the distance between ships ought to be at least 0 9 nm in this reason values generated from fis are normalized in the interval of 0 9 5 assuming the highest value of the domain is 5 nm the highest value for ship domain has been also determined as a result of expert interviews the question what should be the maximum size of the ship safety area has been asked to define the maximum value among the answers given to the question the value 5 nm was the most frequent one eventually to determine the ship domain dimensions vector lengths vl are specified by determining x i y i position of each node of the ship domain the shape and size values of the ship domain are determined as a result of fis equation 2 and equation 3 are used for the

relationship between linguistic input and output variables fuzzy based terms are used a total of nine linguistic input variables l v m t n d w i e affect the fuzzy system whose rules r are formed as follows for size for example ri if l is short and v is slow then s is short for shape for example ri if tsrbnorm is straight then h is verylong as a result a total of 238 fuzzy rules have been generated from the combination of the value of these linguistic variables 4 experimental test results situations meeting on reciprocal courses and approaching from the beam are the most prevalence encounter types taking place at sea the situation approaching from the stern however also occurs frequently the experiments conducted in this study comprise of various cases including head on meeting on reciprocal courses crossing ts is approaching from the beam of the os and overtaking ts is approaching from the stern of the os encounter situations the aim of the experimental test is to show and demonstrate the performance of the proposed system the different parameter settings shown in table 3 have been run for each encounter situation to reveal how the system works for different cases the computational process has been implemented with a pc characteristic with an intel core i7 7700 2 80 ghz processor 16 gb ram 64 bit windows 10 pro the fuzzy system which is controlled via c based user interface illustrated in fig 8 can generate a ship domain having from 8 nodes to 360 nodes in the experiments it is assumed that arpa radar and ais provide the navigational data of the ships to the fuzzy system in case 1 meeting on reciprocal courses have been experienced the output of the 8 nodes and 16 nodes approximations of the fuzzy ship domain for this case are illustrated in fig 9 a and fig 9 b and value of each node is shown in fig 12 a and fig 12 b with diamond shape respectively when the length of os l is 200 m speed of os v is 15 knots manoeuvrability of os m is high traffic state in the navigation area t consists of 8 ships navigator experience who is on watch n is 7 years day time d is daylight weather condition in navigation area w is 3 force visibility in the navigation area i is about 8 nm and relative bearing of the ts tsrb is 003 in case 2 ts is approaching from the beam of the os the output of the 8 nodes and 16 nodes approximations of the fuzzy ship domain for this case are illustrated in fig 10 a and fig 10 b and value of each node is shown in fig 12 a and fig 12 b with circle shape respectively when the length of os l is 150 m speed of os v is 11 knots manoeuvrability of os m is medium traffic state in the navigation area t consists of 5 ships navigator experience who is on watch n is 2 years day time d is night weather condition in navigation area w is 8 force visibility in the navigation area i is about 4 nm and tsrb is 075 in case 3 os is approaching from the stern of the ts the outputs of the 8 nodes and 16 nodes approximations of the fuzzy ship domain for this case are illustrated in fig 11 a and fig 11 b and value of each node is shown in fig 12 a and fig 12 b with triangle shape respectively when the length of os l is 220 m speed of os v is 13 knots manoeuvrability of os m is high traffic state in the navigation area t consists of 3 ships navigator experience who is on watch n is 9 years day time d is night weather condition in navigation area w is 6 force visibility in the navigation area is about i 7 nm and tsrb is 000 5 discussion in this section it is aimed to compare the proposed ship domain approach with the results of the current ship domains in the literature the ship domain model introduced in this study and selected current models are taken into consideration for comparison various encounter situations i e head on and crossing are organized to show the performance of the proposed system pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 s model and wang and chin 2016 s model a knowledge based and an empirical method respectively are used for comparative studies with different parameter settings listed in table 4 length and speed input values of the os are assigned same as in these studies but others are defined to produce the smallest ship domain 5 1 comparison with knowledge based ship domain pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 proposed a knowledge based ship domain model using the learning process of a neural network regarding both length and speed of the os for open waters the model uses fuzzy function to correspond the level of navigational safety where 0 represents the safe situation while 1 represents the dangerous situation which may result in a collision γ 0 1 to implement a comparison head on and two types of crossing encounter tsrb values are 15 and 45 respectively situations have been organized with the ship parameters as listed in table 4 four levels of navigational safety in the pietrzykowski and uriasz s model have been selected represented by γ 0 4 0 5 0 8 0 9 γ 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 9 γ 0 2 0 3 0 5 0 9 for head on and crossing encounters respectively the comparison of the outputs of the proposed model and pietrzykowski and uriasz s model is shown in fig 13 for the three situations on the other hand fig 14 also shows the comparison of dimensions of ship domains scaled regarding loa between proposed model and pietrzykowski and uriasz s model in head on and crossing situations pietrzykowski and uriasz s model for the γ 0 1 safety level is more conservative than proposed model for crossing situation from 15 as shown in fig 13 b it should be also noted that for crossing encounter from 45 illustrated in fig 13 c pietrzykowski and uriasz s model is longer than proposed model for fore side but not for port and starboard sides the proposed model seems to be similar to pietrzykowski and uriasz s model for the crossing cases with γ 0 2 safety level particularly on the aft port and starboard sides for the fore side for crossing from 45 pietrzykowski and uriasz s model is considerably longer than that of the proposed model approximately 0 5 nm as a result these two models are generally similar especially for the crossing encounters however we cannot say the same for the head on situation in the head on situation aft side of the proposed model is significantly longer than that of pietrzykowski and uriasz s model for all levels of navigational safety 5 2 comparison with empirical ship domain wang and chin 2016 has introduced an empirical ship domain for confined waters which is dynamically enlarged with ship speed in the study ship traffic data in singapore port and singapore strait was collected from the vessel traffic information system vtis database operated by the maritime and port authority of singapore mpa to implement a comparison head on and crossing encounter tsrb 15 situations have been formed with the ship parameters listed in table 4 the comparison of the outputs of the proposed model and wang and chin s model is shown in fig 15 for various situations on the other hand fig 16 also shows the comparison of dimensions of ship domains scaled regarding loa between proposed model and wang and chin s model in a head on and crossing situations respectively the proposed model is rather more conservative than that of wang and chin s model especially for fore port and starboard sides it is clearly seen in fig 15 that wang and chin s model is considerably precautionary to ships approaching from the fore and aft than those approaching from the port and starboard sides 6 conclusions in this paper a knowledge based model structure has been introduced to create an asymmetrical polygonal ship domain for both restricted waters and open waters a c application based on fuzzy inference system fis with mamdani model has been implemented to determine the size and shape of the domain unlike some other forms of ship domain the proposed model has an asymmetrical and polygonal feature several experimental tests with various encounter situations and comparative implementations with other ship domains have been conducted to show the performance of the proposed system experimental test results show that the proposed model has advantage due to being more conservative than others the proposed method provides contribution to ship collision avoidance process automation of ship motion control and ship traffic engineering the proposed model can also be utilized to the ship collision avoidance methods or safe trajectory estimations for further studies credit authorship contribution statement remzi fiskin
