3075,globally widespread biocrusts form a living skin on most dryland soils helping govern fundamental ecosystem functions particularly hydrological processes however the underlying mechanisms of biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and evaporation are still controversial biocrusts possibly regulate infiltration and evaporation due to their unique physicochemical properties and influence on surface soil moisture θ and these assumptions were verified in this study conducted on the loess plateau of china the differences in vertical soil moisture distribution and flow patterns of infiltration water between moss dominated biocrusts and bare soil were investigated through dye tracing experiments the evaporation characteristics of biocrusts and bare soil were also obtained by weighing micro lysimeters in both simulated and in situ experiments results showed that biocrusts retarded deep soil water infiltration below 15 cm and significantly f 48 15 p 0 001 decreased the stained area ratio percentage of stained area to total area at the same soil depth by 16 in contrast to bare soil because the infiltrated water was mostly retained in shallow soil 0 15 cm in biocrust covered soil their ratios of low interaction flow stained path width 20 mm and high interaction flow 20 mm stained path width 200 mm were significantly higher f 7 82 p 0 007 than those of bare soil after the dye tracing experiments the biocrusts modestly increased θ by 17 throughout the soil profile 0 50 cm but they remarkably increased θ by 33 78 in the top 20 cm of soil additionally the biocrusts increased soil daily evaporation rate e by 27 39 with only the exception of the beginning and the cumulative evaporation amount by 14 in contrast to bare soil over an 8 day field measurement more importantly the biocrust affected soil properties such as the contents of fine particles and organic matter as well as saturated water content and field capacity were closely correlated with e ρ 0 52 p 0 08 consequently it was concluded that biocrusts restrict the depth of rainwater infiltration and increase surface θ which may greatly enhance surface soil evaporation in the chinese loess plateau keywords biological soil crust micro lysimeter soil moisture water flow pattern soil field capacity loess plateau 1 introduction soil evaporation is one of the most critical components of the water and energy balances in drylands around the world where precipitation is limited and ecosystems are fragile balugani et al 2018 water evaporation in these terrestrial ecosystems accounts for 20 40 of global evapotranspiration and 65 of these water losses come from soil rather than water body surfaces tugwell wootton et al 2020 due to intense evaporation and limited rainfall soil water availability is one of the vital limiting factors in shaping ecosystem structural and functional attributes in drylands such as the distribution pattern and survival of vegetation chamizo et al 2013b kidron and tal 2012 generally the factors that influence soil evaporation are classified into three groups i soil properties such as texture porosity and organic matter content ii hydrological conditions such as water dynamics and hydraulic conductivity and iii atmospheric conditions including air temperature solar radiation wind speed and vapor pressure hillel 2003 li and xiao 2022 the soil evaporation rate e is especially dependent on soil texture one of the soil properties that usually shows a great deal of difference among various surface covers xiao et al 2010 biocrusts are a particularly influential surface soil cover in drylands potentially dominating the cover of open ground surface and affecting soil hydrological geomorphologic biological and ecological processes belnap et al 2005 bowker et al 2013 importantly for surface soil water balance biocrusts are assumed to have a strong influence on surface soil evaporation in dryland ecosystems kidron and tal 2012 xiao et al 2010 biocrusts are communities of cyanobacteria lichens mosses fungi archaea and other organisms that are commonly distributed on surface soil throughout the world especially in arid and semiarid climate regions belnap 2006 bowker et al 2013 although biocrusts occupy only a minor proportion a few millimeters or centimeters of the soil profile xiao et al 2019b they act as ecosystem engineers and strongly influence soil properties such as surface soil texture roughness soil structure and porosity aggregation and stability and micro and macro porosity chamizo et al 2012b kakeh et al 2018 li et al 2021a menon et al 2011 moreover biocrusts are capable of improving soil fertility by fixing carbon and nitrogen and transporting them to the soil underneath belnap et al 2005 additionally another important role of biocrusts is that they affect soil water movements soil moisture status soil water holding capacity and water availability eldridge et al 2020 sun et al 2021 this is especially true for rainwater infiltration and evaporation which dominate the hydrological processes of drylands eldridge et al 2020 lending biocrusts a pervasive and potentially strong influence on surface soil water balances in drylands chamizo et al 2013a eldridge et al 2020 rainwater is the important water source for soil evaporation biocrust effects on rainwater infiltration can moderate surface water flows and distribution and eventually regulate soil evaporation in drylands belnap 2006 kidron and benenson 2014 although there are already several studies about biocrust impacts on rainwater infiltration and runoff these results vary widely eldridge et al 2020 kidron 2019 yang et al 2016 for instance several of the biocrust mediated changes in surface soil properties such as decreasing soil bulk density increasing contents of fine particles and organic matter and increasing water repellency may contribute to strongly impeding rainwater infiltration wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b in contrast biocrusts may also enhance rainwater infiltration by increasing surface microtopography and macro porosity thus lowering runoff chamizo et al 2012a eldridge et al 2010 additionally according to some researchers the infiltrability of biocrusts was assumed to decrease due to the higher repellency or to increase due to the biocrust role in improving soil aggregate stability and porosity in sandy soils coppola et al 2011 xiao et al 2019a all of these possible influences of biocrusts on infiltration would likely change the very limited soil water conditions in drylands although the importance of biocrusts in regulating soil infiltration is widely recognized studies of the effects of biocrusts on soil evaporation also produce conflicting results chamizo et al 2013a kidron and tal 2012 li and xiao 2022 wang et al 2011 biocrusts may affect soil evaporation directly e g on the coverage and composition of biocrusts kidron and tal 2012 or indirectly through their effects on soil roughness stability porosity and hydrophobicity chamizo et al 2016 integration of both direct and indirect influences will ultimately determine the biocrust role in evaporation processes chamizo et al 2013a these effects are variously documented in the literature for example biocrusts may reduce e by capping the soil surface and clogging pores due to the swelling of organisms inhabiting soil particles belnap et al 2005 fischer et al 2010 or by modifying surface soil cracks during drying verrecchia et al 1995 both of which decrease the available water vapor pathways to the atmosphere in contrast biocrusts retain more water and increase soil temperature which can result in a higher e than that of bare soil kidron and tal 2012 zhang et al 2008 nevertheless studies illustrate that it is difficult to define biocrust effects on evaporation in a binary way increase or decrease because the soil water conditions rainfall intensity and even biocrust types clearly affect soil evaporation in sometimes opposing ways chamizo et al 2013a xiao et al 2010 therefore the role of biocrusts in influencing evaporation is still controversial and further studies are required to improve understanding of how biocrusts influence the water balance in drylands apart from infiltration and evaporation soil moisture θ and its vertical distribution are both indispensable factors in regulating soil evaporation kidron and tal 2012 xiao et al 2016 owing to the contrary viewpoints and conflicting case studies of biocrust effects on infiltration and evaporation the potential combined effects of biocrusts on θ and water availability for vascular plants are not universally understood chamizo et al 2016 kidron 2014 xiao and hu 2017 due to the higher water retention capacity of soils with prominent biocrusts θ would be higher in biocrust covered soil than in bare soil at a shallow depth usually 10 cm where θ changes dramatically with rainfall in drylands xiao et al 2016 additionally the higher θ of biocrusts would further influence soil thermal properties e g thermal conductivity and heat capacity and soil temperature dynamics which consequently change the soil evaporation process li et al 2022b xiao et al 2019b recently the brilliant blue dye tracer has emerged as an efficient method to observe water flow patterns throughout the soil profile and evaluate water infiltration and distribution in a short period weiler and flühler 2004 yi et al 2020 this dye is chosen because it is a good compromise between distinguishability mobility and toxicity for visualizing flow pathways in soils allaire et al 2009 weiler and flühler 2004 furthermore the brilliant blue dye tracer method is convenient and helpful in classifying infiltrated water flow types through analyzing the stained area from pictures obtained with digital camera weiler and flühler 2004 yi et al 2020 but it is rarely used in biocrust studies consequently it is suitable to quantify θ and the water flows of biocrust covered soil for the purposes of investigating the relationships between θ and e in this study a comprehensive picture of moss dominated biocrust effects on the water balance in a semiarid region ecosystem was sought by integrating the measurement of infiltration θ and e this type of integration has been very rare in the biocrust literature chamizo et al 2016 xiao et al 2010 a series of water infiltration and evaporation experiments were conducted on moss dominated biocrusts and bare soil in the chinese loess plateau this study aimed to i determine biocrust effects on rainwater infiltration vertical flows and water distribution and their contribution to subsequent soil evaporation ii clarify the θ differences between biocrusts and bare soil and to explain biocrust influences on evaporation by analyzing their effects on θ and iii compare the evaporation characteristics between biocrusts and bare soil and to explain biocrust effects on evaporation via their influences on surface soil properties and θ this approach was helpful for a more complete understanding of the role of biocrusts in maintaining soil water balances in drylands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in the liudaogou watershed 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n fig 1 a b in shenmu county on the northern loess plateau of china this area is a typical semiarid region and covers 6 9 km2 with a typical semiarid continental monsoon climate and a mean altitude of 1180 m li et al 2021b li et al 2022b the average annual precipitation and potential evaporation are 409 mm and 1337 mm respectively the mean annual temperature is 8 4 which ranges from 9 7 in winter to 23 7 in summer furthermore 80 of precipitation occurs in summer june to september xiao et al 2019c the soils correspond to psamments an aeolian sandy soil according to the usda soil taxonomy li et al 2021a at the study site water was one of the limiting resources in ecological restoration and agricultural production li et al 2021b xiao et al 2016 the soil was susceptible to both water and wind erosion before the implementation of the grain for green program which curtailed this problem through planting a great deal of native shrubs and shifting land use from farmlands to forest or grasslands in the past two decades li et al 2021a biocrusts widely and spontaneously develop on stabilized soil surfaces with cover generally 30 now and sometimes as much as 70 80 xiao et al 2019a the biocrusts are composed of cyanobacteria and mosses with mosses being the dominant autotrophs the dominant mosses are didymodon vinealis brid zander and bryum arcticum r brown b s g with comparison species of b caespiticium hedw b argenteum hedw d nigrescens mitt saito and barbula perobtusa broth chen li et al 2022b xiao et al 2019a 2 2 experimental design all sampling and measurements were conducted on a flat area of 1000 m2 slope 5 to constrain variation in conditions such as biocrust characteristics soil texture slope gradient and aspect and coverage and type of shrubs see fig 1b two treatments with six replicates were considered including biocrusts naturally developed moss dominated biocrusts not artificially planted biocrusts see fig 1c and fig s1 and bare soil aeolian sand without biocrusts not scalped biocrusts see fig 1d the coverage almost fully covered and spatial pattern of all biocrusted plots were largely similar see fig s1 for each of the two treatments three types of measurements were carried out i soil properties and hydraulic parameters ii infiltrated water flow patterns and water distribution using dye tracing and iii soil evaporation rate using weighing micro lysimeters all measurements were implemented from july to october 2019 2 3 measurements of water flow patterns and θ 2 3 1 dye tracer experiments dye tracer experiments were conducted to quantify the infiltrated water flow patterns of bare soil and biocrust covered soil n 6 fig 1e for each treatment six plots 100 cm 100 cm with similar biocrust cover or lack of biocrusts were demarcated to conduct dye tracing each plot was 5 m apart and the very sparse vascular vegetation was cut away carefully leaving roots in place then a four sided metal frame 100 cm 100 cm 50 cm was inserted 20 cm into the soil and the air gap between the frame and soil was sealed with wet soil to prevent preferential flow janssen and lennartz 2008 these experiments were conducted only on clear days to reduce the influences of rainfall brilliant blue was mixed with distilled water and used as the dye tracer solution in this study due to its low toxicity high visibility and high mobility weiler and flühler 2004 yi et al 2020 although rainfall is mostly 20 mm d 1 in this region rainstorms 50 mm d 1 also occur occasionally fig s2 additionally most studies supplied sufficient water usually 50 mm to obtain distinct vertical water flow patterns for clear observations as they are usually inconspicuous under slight rainfall janssen and lennartz 2008 weiler and flühler 2004 yi et al 2020 therefore we applied 50 mm 50 l of water of dye tracer solution 5 g l 1 to each plot in this study to obtain clearer differences in vertical water flow patterns between biocrusts and bare soil all tracer solutions were sprayed by a rainfall simulator uniformly within 1 h and paused when necessary to avoid water ponding or runoff due to the intensive soil evaporation on clear days the top of frame was covered with an opaque plastic film shortly after spraying to minimize soil heating by sunshine and unnecessary water evaporation from the plots the frame and plastic film were moved away carefully one day after spraying and soil profiles were dug and photographed in the following procedures fig 2 b usually in dye tracer experiments the vertical profiles obviously and directly illustrate the depth of infiltrated water flow pathways from topsoil to subsoil and a couple of vertical and horizontal profiles can enable a three dimensional understanding of water flow patterns janssen and lennartz 2008 yi et al 2020 therefore both the vertical and horizontal directions were excavated and photographed to further analyze the water flow patterns as shown in fig 2a half of each experimental plot was excavated in 6 vertical profiles 100 cm in width and 50 cm in depth in interval of 10 cm and the other half was excavated in 7 horizontal profiles at 0 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 cm depths no stained area below a depth of 40 cm was observed so no deeper samples were collected all the soil profiles were carefully prepared with a spatula and then photographed under daylight conditions beneath a whitish opaque foil light tent to diffuse the light and avoid direct radiation additionally all photos were taken with a canon eos 5d camera mark iv a resolution of 4368 2912 pixels and a rectangular wooden frame with scale was placed around the profiles to obtain the actual length and width fig 2b a grayscale kodak 8 10 in was attached to the soil profiles for later color adjustment as the dye tracer experiment only provided snapshots of water flow patterns at 24 h after the simulated rainfall event the initial water flow paths could have been obscured by a later downward movement of the infiltration wetting front janssen and lennartz 2008 weiler and flühler 2004 however due to the homogeneous soil particles and porosity the probability of this case was relatively low and it was assumed that these snapshots were a viable basis for characterizing infiltrated water flow patterns and water distribution 2 3 2 measurements of soil water distribution and dynamics in the field two types of θ measurements were conducted to obtain the characteristics of soil water distribution and dynamics a snapshot θ measurement throughout the entire soil profile and a continuous θ measurement over time at a single depth during the dye tracer experiments θ was measured at each profile by a gs3 soil moisture sensor meter group inc in usa specifically after taking photographs of the soil vertical profile the profile was divided into 50 square grid cells 10 cm 10 cm fig 2b and the soil moisture sensor was inserted horizontally into the soil to measure θ for each grid cell at each grid cell θ was measured 3 times at the same time and at different positions to obtain a mean θ value and all data were stored in a procheck data logger meter group inc in usa θ was only measured at depth of 0 50 cm because no stained areas were observed deeper than 40 cm in all plots therefore 50 values of θ were obtained for each profile and 300 values for each plot in total fig 2b θ was also continuously measured for 4 months at a depth of 5 cm in situ using a 5te sensor meter group inc in usa for biocrusts and bare soil in 6 replicates all moisture sensors were located on the same flat ground near the dye tracing plots to ensure the same type of soil and rainfall distribution fig 1b the biocrust layer and excavated soil 5 cm 10 cm 10 cm was moved and then sensors were installed horizontally at 5 cm depth at the undisturbed side and backfilled carefully the biocrust layer was put back to cover the soil surface θ was recorded every 10 min and the data were stored in em50 data loggers meter group inc in usa all soil moisture sensors were installed in april 2019 and the period of θ measurements of biocrusts and bare soil used in this study was from july to october when the soil surface was almost stable and biocrusts were mostly restored to undisturbed conditions 2 4 image processing and water flow pattern classification 2 4 1 image processing rigorous and repeatable methods of image processing was applied to determine the water flow patterns in imagej wayne rasband national institutes of health using the following procedures first all the photos were geometrically corrected by establishing a relationship between the location of pixels in the image and the corresponding coordinates on the soil surface i e points with known coordinates on the wood frame the plotting scale was set as 1 mm 5 pixels which was not only accurate but also convenient for obtaining the stained area later fig 2c second all photos were adjusted in contrast and brightness based on the grayscale image to intensify the stained area noise was reduced carefully fig 2c and a detailed description of this procedure can be found in weiler and flühler 2004 third a color threshold was set between stained and unstained areas based on red green and blue values and we used this to create a binary classification of the soil due to the heterogeneous background color distribution in the soil caused by material transitions or plant roots a manual correction for the stained area was also performed by visual check of images these corrections erased naturally dark but unstained areas within the soil that were errantly classified as stained using our threshold and the outer 5 cm of the stained profiles were excluded from the analysis to avoid including air gap between the frame and soil last a binary picture was obtained and each binarized image was analyzed with r software version 4 0 3 to quantify the characteristics of infiltrated water flow patterns 2 4 2 water flow patterns classification the stained area ratio s r in was used to describe the water flow patterns which was defined as the percentage of stained area to the profile area at the same soil depth for vertical profiles a resolution of 1 cm in the vertical direction was set to calculate the s r from 0 40 cm depth for horizontal profiles the whole stained area in each photograph was obtained to calculate the s r overall the s r in both vertical and horizontal profiles was calculated through eq 1 1 s r a s a t 100 where a s is the stained area in mm2 a t is the total profile area at the same soil depth which is 1 0 104 mm2 in vertical profiles and 5 0 105 mm2 in horizontal profiles due to the variations in water infiltration and redistribution the stained path width s w in mm at each depth is another important informative option to categorize stained patterns weiler and flühler 2004 a simplified categorization of s w based on weiler and flühler 2004 of three flow types was used i low interaction flow where continuously stained pixels were 100 s w 20 mm fig s3a and the water flow was confined to a relatively narrow pathway through the soil matrix ii high interaction flow where 100 continuously stained pixels 1000 actual length is 20 s w 200 mm fig s3b and the water flow interacted with a larger proportion of the soil matrix and iii homogeneous matrix flow where continuously stained pixels were 1000 s w 200 mm fig s3c and the water flow was not confined to preferential flow paths the stained path width ratio s wr in was calculated through eq 2 2 s wr a 20 a t 100 s w 20 a 20 200 a t 100 20 s w 200 a 200 a t 100 s w 200 where a 20 a 20 200 and a 200 are the stained areas of low interaction flow high interaction flow and homogeneous matrix flow respectively in mm2 2 5 measurements of soil evaporation processes soil evaporation measurements were conducted by weighing cylindrical pvc micro lysimeters similar to previous studies chamizo et al 2013b li and xiao 2022 xiao et al 2010 in this experiment the micro lysimeter was 10 5 cm in inner diameter and 10 0 cm in height during sampling all micro lysimeters were pushed vertically into the soil to collect intact soil at a depth of 0 10 cm the bottom of the micro lysimeters was sealed with a 300 mesh nylon net n 6 a larger pvc cylinder 15 5 cm in inner diameter and 11 cm in height see fig s4 was installed for each micro lysimeter and removed the soil within it then the micro lysimeters were placed within the larger pvc cylinders and the interspace between the micro lysimeters and larger pvc cylinder was filled with polystyrene to diminish possible thermal convection fig s4 therefore the soil in micro lysimeter was only lit by direct sunlight striking the surface resulting in a thermal regime similar to that of natural soil li et al 2021b to maintain soil and atmospheric conditions similar to those of undisturbed soils all micro lysimeters were installed 15 days in the field before measurements to allow soil stabilization a simulated and an in situ evaporation experiment was established to obtain the evaporation characteristics for the former 50 mm rainfall was simulated on the micro lysimeters at sunset and then covered the micro lysimeters with a plastic sheet to delay evaporation as excess water was drained until 6 00 of the next day all the samples were kept in an open unvegetated area and weighed with an electronic balance 0 01 g to obtain the evaporation amount generally the soil evaporation rate e changes intensively at first few days but gradually become stable at later days li and xiao 2022 in order to obtain the whole evaporation processes from saturation to dry all micro lysimeters were weighed at 2 h intervals from 6 00 to 18 00 for the first 4 days and then weighed only at sunrise 6 00 and sunset 18 00 for the last 4 days the measurements were performed for 8 days in total and they were terminated when the daily evaporation amount of all treatments was 3 g equal to 0 3 mm of water after these simulations all samples were placed in the field site after natural rainfall on june 28 and continuously weighed at sunrise and sunset to obtain the daily evaporation rate which was referred to as the in situ evaporation experiments all measurements were performed only on clear days and were stopped if rainfall events occurred finally the soil evaporation rate e and cumulative evaporation amount e c were both expressed as mm of water to quantify the evaporation characteristics of both treatments 2 6 soil sampling and measurement of properties after the dye tracer experiments soil samples of each treatment were taken near the plots 5 m for measuring biocrust characteristics and soil properties n 6 the upper 2 cm of biocrusts was taken using petri dishes 9 cm in diameter and 2 cm in height to measure biocrust thickness and total biomass the soil surface roughness was measured by the chain method li et al 2021b soil cores 5 cm in height and 100 cm3 in volume were used to collect the topsoil 0 5 cm depth of each treatment to measure the soil bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity k s saturated water content θ s field capacity θ f and particle size distribution in the laboratory the thickness of the biocrust layer was measured by using a digital vernier caliper li et al 2022a and moss plants were separated from the soil with water through a 2 mm sieve and dried at 65 c for 24 h for the measurement of moss biomass li et al 2021b xiao et al 2019b the soil bulk density and θ s were measured after oven drying at 105 c for 24 h and θ f was measured by pressure plates at 33 kpa of soil water potential xiao et al 2019b k s was measured using the constant head method yi et al 2020 the soil particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern england and the soil organic matter content was measured by the dichromate redox titration method li et al 2021a 2 7 data analysis the biocrust effects on soil properties e and θ were determined by the relative differences δ between biocrusts and bare soil which were defined as eq 3 3 δ biocrusts bare soil bare soil 100 the differences between the biocrusts and bare soil in soil properties hydraulic parameters and simulated e were tested using one way anova α 0 05 a two way manova α 0 05 test was employed to evaluate the interactions of soil cover biocrusts and bare soil and soil depth on θ and s r which were measured after dye tracing experiments furthermore a two way anova α 0 05 followed by tukey s hsd post hoc test was employed to evaluate the interactions of soil cover biocrusts and bare soil and soil depth on s wr repeated measures anova was performed to test the differences in θ and e between the two treatments α 0 05 with each of the days during the measurement period serving as repeated measures relationships between e and soil properties were analyzed by spearman s correlation analysis both within biocrust and bare soil plots and within the two plot types pooled the representation and graphical fits of the dye tracer experimental data were obtained using originpro 2019 originlab corporation in usa and the distribution of θ measured after dye tracer experiments was obtained using a gaussian three dimensional regression model by using sigmaplot 14 5 systat software inc in usa the final results reflect the mean values of the 6 replicates expressed as the mean value standard deviation unless otherwise noted statistical analyses were conducted using r software version 4 0 3 3 results 3 1 biocrust effects on surface soil properties and hydraulic parameters the biocrusts significantly modified every physical soil environmental property and hydraulic parameter measured at 0 5 cm depth as well as surface roughness fig 3 and table 1 compared with the bare soil the bulk density of the biocrusts was 21 2 lower the organic matter content of the biocrusts was 28 5 g kg 1 which was 3 5 fold higher than that of the bare soil moreover the biocrusts had 7 5 9 9 vs 2 4 table 1 higher amounts of fines than the bare soil perhaps due to these physical changes the biocrusts also pronouncedly decreased k s in comparison to the bare soil by 79 6 3 4 vs 16 7 cm h 1 fig 3a furthermore the biocrusts had significantly higher θ s by 26 6 fig 3b and θ f by 139 6 fig 3c than the bare soil f 107 10 p 0 001 finally the surface roughness of the biocrusts was 1 9 times 5 3 vs 2 8 table 1 higher than that of the bare soil 3 2 influences of biocrusts on stained area and water flow patterns the s r significantly f 48 15 p 0 001 decreased with increasing soil depth and the biocrusts greatly decreased s r below 15 cm depth in contrast to the bare soil fig 4 and table s1 generally the s r reached nearly 100 at 0 15 cm depth but it rapidly decreased to 0 at 40 cm depth as evident in both vertical and horizontal profiles fig 4a and 4c in our vertical profiles the s r of biocrusts was only slightly different from that of the bare soil at 0 15 cm depth and the soil cover bare soil and biocrusts showed insignificant f 0 88 p 0 36 table s1 effects on s r however the biocrusts decreased s r 31 9 vs 37 1 fig 4a at 15 40 cm depth in congruence with this finding the horizontal s r of biocrusts was significantly decreased 48 4 vs 54 9 fig 4c in comparison to the bare soil at 15 40 cm depth in addition the stained area of bare soil was more homogeneous while the biocrust covered soil displayed more deeper wetting fronts at 20 30 cm depth fig 4b the biocrusts significantly changed the water flow patterns f 7 82 p 0 007 table 2 increasing the ratios of low interaction flow and high interaction flow but decreasing the ratio of homogeneous matrix flow the ratio of low interaction flow accounted for only a small percentage 2 6 of the total stained area for the two treatments and the biocrusts increased the ratio of low interaction flow by 45 5 on average compared with bare soil at 0 40 cm depth especially at 10 30 cm depth the ratio of low interaction flow of biocrusts was 1 2 2 0 times higher than that of bare soil table 3 correspondingly the ratio of high interaction flow of biocrusts was approximately 1 5 fold 9 8 vs 6 4 higher than that of the bare soil at 0 40 cm depth fig 5 which was also increased by 29 3 132 2 compared with bare soil at 10 30 cm depth table 3 conversely the biocrusts strongly decreased the ratio of homogeneous matrix flow by 21 1 in comparison to bare soil fig 5 3 3 biocrust effects on θ and soil water distribution after the dye tracer experiments there was a statistically significant interaction effect between soil cover and depth on θ and s r f 4 24 p 0 002 table s2 and the θ of biocrusts was higher by 16 5 or equal to that of the bare soil across all depths fig 6 the θ of bare soil clearly increased with increasing soil depth while the θ of biocrust covered soil did not vary with depth fig 6 biocrust enhancement of θ was more pronounced closer to the surface at 0 10 cm depth where θ of the biocrusts was 1 7 times higher 0 16 vs 0 09 cm3 cm 3 however the differences in θ between biocrusts and bare soil were minor deeper than 30 cm depth fig 7 because there was almost no stained area at 40 cm depth the differences in water distribution at 0 40 cm reflected the biocrust effects on soil infiltration the in situ measurements demonstrated consistently higher θ in biocrusts than in bare soil f 76 88 p 0 001 fig 7b at 5 cm depth during the whole period biocrusts had 9 3 higher θ on average than bare soils θ increased rapidly after rainfall and the differences between biocrusts and bare soil were enlarged immediately after rainfall events fig 7b for instance the biocrusts increased θ by 90 9 0 21 vs 0 11 cm3 cm 3 at 5 cm depth in contrast to bare soil after the rainfall event on july 29 fig 7b although θ decreased swiftly after the rain event ceased the biocrust covered soil retained a higher θ than the bare soil for instance after the rain event on august 11 θ averaged 1 7 fold higher from august 12 to 22 in the biocrusts 0 10 vs 0 06 cm3 cm 3 on average fig 7b 3 4 characteristics of soil evaporation and their correlations with soil properties as shown in fig 8 and table 4 the biocrusts significantly increased e and e c compared with the bare soil in simulated rainfall experiments specifically the e changed dramatically on days 1 4 for both biocrusts and bare soil and then it became steady with very low e on days 5 8 fig 8a on day 1 the e was the highest 11 33 mm d 1 and at this point e in biocrusts was lower 10 87 vs 11 82 mm d 1 than that of the bare soil from days 2 4 the e decreased rapidly 1 02 mm d 1 and the biocrusts increased e by 39 3 3 96 vs 2 84 mm d 1 in comparison to the bare soil notably although the e was very low 0 5 mm d 1 on days 5 8 the biocrusts still had significantly higher e than that of the bare soil 0 45 vs 0 32 mm d 1 f 3 78 p 0 003 table 4 additionally the e c of biocrusts was greater by 13 6 24 2 vs 21 3 mm fig 8c than that of the bare soil the in situ experiments confirmed similar patterns as the e of biocrusts was significantly higher than that of the bare soil f 4 85 p 0 029 fig 7c and 9 the e of biocrusts was 1 4 mm d 1 on average during the experimental period which was 27 2 higher than that of the bare soil 1 1 mm d 1 fig 9 confirming previous observations the e of bare soil and biocrusts increased distinctly and immediately after rainfall events yet the biocrusts clearly had higher e after rainfall fig 7c as an example the e of biocrusts was 13 2 6 02 vs 5 32 mm d 1 higher than that of the bare soil on july 30 fig 7c spearman s correlation analysis showed that the e bare soil biocrusts was well ρ 0 52 p 0 08 table 5 correlated with the soil properties for the most part similarly signed but somewhat weaker correlations were observed within the two sample types separately θ s and θ f were especially strongly and positively correlated ρ 0 84 p 0 04 table 5 with e while bulk density was strongly and negatively correlated with e ρ 0 83 p 0 04 surface roughness was the weakest correlate with e and it took on a negative sign in biocrust samples and a positive sign in bare samples 4 discussion 4 1 biocrust effects on soil properties and their connections with evaporation in this study we found that biocrusts had a much higher e 27 2 than bare soil and this increased e was partly attributed to biocrust effects on soil physicochemical properties and hydraulic parameters such as the contents of clay particles and organic matter surface roughness and soil water conditions chamizo et al 2012a kidron and tal 2012 xiao et al 2010 although biocrusts are only a few millimeters to centimeters thick at most they can engineer profound changes in surface soils in general biocrusts trap and retain fine sediments silt and clay and change the particle size distribution on the surface soil even over only a short time kakeh et al 2018 because they fix atmospheric carbon they also increase the organic matter content of soils chamizo et al 2013b in our study it was very strong table 1 both of these changes would be expected to affect the bulk density as finer soils are generally denser than coarser soils and organic matter is less dense than minerals and promotes soil structure chamizo et al 2013b in our case these likely opposing forces produced a net decrease in bulk density perhaps suggesting that organic enrichment exerted a stronger effect than the enrichment of fines decreasing bulk density often signifies changes in porosity and pore size distribution both of which are influential on the movement and storage of water eldridge et al 2010 sun et al 2021 biocrusts are also known to increase aggregate stability and improve the soil physical structure which also increase the percentage of micropores chamizo et al 2012b felde et al 2016 currently biocrust effects on soil thermal properties and temperature attract attention due to their great influences on physical properties some studies also concluded that biocrusts may increase soil temperature because of their changed thermal properties belnap 2006 li et al 2022b xiao et al 2019b in addition biocrusts also decreased surface albedo due to their darker surface color which resulted in a much higher surface soil temperature than that of bare soil li et al 2022b xiao and bowker 2020 although we did not measure soil thermal properties or surface albedo in this study previous data obtained in the same study area showed that biocrusts significantly increased soil temperature and decreased surface albedo see li et al 2022b xiao and bowker 2020 all these effects suggest that biocrusted surfaces present a different physical environment than surfaces lacking biocrusts and these differences are likely to produce different evaporation and hydraulic properties and hydrological patterns partly because of their effect on physical changes in bulk density porosity and pore size distribution biocrusts change most soil hydraulic parameters which regulate the e in concert with the contents of fine particles and organic matter coppola et al 2011 gao et al 2010 both θ s and θ f of biocrust covered soil were elevated in comparison to bare soil in our study fig 3 a higher θ s signifies a greater pore volume and a higher θ f is often strongly related to the prevalence of micro and mesopores li et al 2022a sun et al 2021 extracellular polymeric substances in biocrusts further change the soil hydraulic properties adessi et al 2018 gypser et al 2016 for instance extracellular polymeric substances can drastically increase their volume upon water absorption up to 50 times chenu 1993 which reduce macropores impedes infiltration and increases the water holding capacity adessi et al 2018 verrecchia et al 1995 xiao et al 2019b because of the biocrust transformation of hydraulic properties especially in raising θ f biocrusts maintain a larger quantity of water than bare soil at least near the surface an observation that has been made in multiple locations eldridge et al 2020 kidron 2014 shi et al 2018 additionally likely due to the differences in water holding capacity between biocrusts and bare soil e changed dramatically with time in the 8 day simulation experiment specifically both biocrusts and bare soil had a high initial θ on days 1 2 and the e of both treatments was at its peak and was limited primarily by weather conditions tugwell wootton et al 2020 this pattern reverses beginning on day 2 as e declines rapidly on bare soil compared to biocrusts unlike bare soils biocrusted soils may have clogged surface pores owing to swelling of the organisms and their organic exudates and residues 40 of the access pores verrecchia et al 1995 under high θ conditions which restricting evaporation pathways from the soil to the atmosphere however the higher e on the first day and lower water holding capacity of bare soil resulted in water loss rapidly and a dry layer formed quickly at its surface which intensely slowed subsequent water vapor transport from the soil balugani et al 2018 li and xiao 2022 correspondingly the e of biocrusted soils was lower than that of bare soil on days 1 2 fig 8 because a dry layer formed at the bare soil surface breaking the tension that allows capillary water movement to the surface thus cutting off the resupply of water to the surface e g days 2 4 in our study fig 8b balugani et al 2018 li et al 2016 conversely biocrusts can maintain more water owing to their higher water holding capacity delaying the formation of a dry soil layer and thereby lifting more water to the surface soil from the subsoil during days 2 4 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 finally θ of both treatments was extremely low by day 5 and afterward which directly led to a minor value of e and minimal differences between the two surface types fig 8a 4 2 biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and their influences on evaporation our study showed that biocrusts not only strongly decreased k s but also reduced rainwater infiltration depth figs 3 and 4 it has been suggested that biocrusts can yield lower soil infiltration by i increasing fine particle content thus improving the water holding capacity of surface soil sun et al 2021 xiao et al 2019b ii capping the soil surface and clogging soil pores because of swelling of organisms or extracellular polymeric substances in biocrusts as well as increasing water repellency of surface soil chamizo et al 2012b gypser et al 2016 and iii decreasing pore diameter and reducing macropore percentage sealing the soil surface as well menon et al 2011 soliman et al 2010 regardless of the prevailing mechanisms the results from this study site were consistent with previous results which demonstrate both lower k s and infiltrability xiao et al 2019b thus retarding seepage to deeper soil and altering its water flow patterns almog and yair 2007 li et al 2002 although s r and s wr do not completely illustrate the differences in soil infiltrability between biocrusts and bare soil these vertical and horizontal water flow patterns were the most powerful evidence to exhibit the water flow paths and water distribution after rainfall under natural conditions especially in studies of macropore flow or preferential flow wang and zhang 2011 weiler and flühler 2004 the wetting fronts displayed higher ratios of low and high interaction flows compared with bare soil which was more homogeneous fig 5 and table 3 this may be because under the same rainfall intensity the cracks and macropores in biocrust layer are the preferential flow channels fig s5 chamizo et al 2016 eldridge et al 2010 it should be noted that we simulated a heavy rainfall event in dye tracer experiments in this case the amount of infiltrated water between biocrusted and bare soils was different due to the retarding effects of biocrusts gao et al 2010 li et al 2004 and the differences in water flow patterns were easily obtained in contrast rainwater would be arrested at the surface soil under slight rainfall due to the high θ f of biocrusts which would result in a shallower distribution of infiltrated water and a heterogeneous wetting front li et al 2021b therefore the high θ f of biocrusts means that more water was held at surface soil resulting in less water infiltrating to deeper soil which not only increased surface θ but also improved the risk of more water loss through evaporation li et al 2022a the slower infiltration rate and enhanced θ f in soil underlying biocrusts would logically lead to a strong difference in water distribution throughout soil profile figs 4 and 6 we believe that these differences resulted in our observation that θ of biocrust covered soil was significantly higher at shallow depths but not in deep soils fig 6 this is especially true for moss dominated biocrusts compared to other types of biocrusts because the physicochemical properties may be significantly altered not only within the biocrust layer but also centimeters below the biocrusts chamizo et al 2013a li et al 2022b the higher near surface θ plays a cardinal role in affecting the e of biocrusted soil li et al 2016 generally a continuous supply of water from the interior of soil to its surface is one of the fundamental conditions in soil evaporation tugwell wootton et al 2020 biocrusts appear to enhance this water supply and they cause a concentration of that water supply nearer to the surface we would expect near surface moisture to be even more likely to evaporate because of warm temperatures experienced near the soil surface and shorter pathways for vapor flux to the atmosphere in drylands hillel 2003 4 3 implications of biocrust effects on surface soil water balance water is the vital resource in drylands and any changes in the soil water regime may deeply influence the water balance chamizo et al 2016 as inhabitants of the soil atmosphere boundary biocrusts may have major impacts on soil hydrological processes and surface soil water conditions in drylands bowker et al 2010 eldridge et al 2020 our results indicated that biocrusts significantly increased surface θ by retarding rainwater infiltration to deep soil but later increased the e of surface soil figs 6 and 9 these findings differ from others that also sought to integrate biocrust effects on water inputs and outputs some studies pointed out that biocrusts increased infiltration during light rainfall but decreased infiltration during heavy rainfall chamizo et al 2016 li et al 2016 in contrast others found that biocrusts were effective in intercepting infiltration during low intensity rainfall events but had no significant effect during high intensity rainfall events kidron 2014 in our study biocrusts not only had higher θ f and lower k s but also decreased s r at 15 40 cm depth and increased the ratios of low interaction flow and high interaction flow in contrast to bare soil under a high intensity rainfall event figs 4 and 5 therefore it would be rational to hypothesize that most of the rainwater would be retarded at shallow depths regardless of slight or heavy rainfall although we have not measured it here since our data documented a decrease in water inputs into deep soil by slowing infiltration and an increase in water outputs of surface soil through higher e it seems that biocrusts have a negative influence on the soil water balance however throughout our study we also observed that biocrust covered soil contained as much or more θ as bare soils at all observed depths even deeper soil figs 3 6 and 7b thus the equal or greater θ in biocrusts throughout the soil profile needs alternative elucidation some studies have shown that biocrusts provide extraordinarily positive contributions to surface soil water balances by increasing non rainfall water i e dew fog vapor deposition amounts li et al 2021b zhang et al 2014 in the same study site and measurement period as this study we documented that the presence of moss dominated biocrusts strongly enhanced vapor condensation from both deep soil and especially from the atmosphere li et al 2021a although the daily amount of non rainfall water intercepted or condensed on biocrusts is small and nearly negligible in comparison to infiltration li et al 2021b pan et al 2010 the cumulative amount of this type of water input may in turn modify surface reflective properties and recharge soil moisture levels li et al 2021a consequently biocrusts have additional water inputs which may help reconcile our findings here and should be accounted for in future studies of biocrust effects on water balance recently a meta analysis of the influences of biocrusts on water in the world s drylands by eldridge et al 2020 observed somewhat paradoxically that biocrusts decreased infiltration rates on average across the published literatures did not clearly enhance runoff and increased θ the explanation put forward was that biocrusts can allow water to enter the soil rather than run off but intercept it in shallow soil by slowing deeper infiltration similar conclusions were also reached by li et al 2002 almog and yair 2007 gao et al 2010 and xiao and hu 2017 our results seem to confirm this interception hypothesis however it is still challenging to evaluate the biocrust effects on infiltration and evaporation as well as their roles in the water balance in dryland ecosystems accordingly we further reviewed the different studies of biocrust effects on infiltration and evaporation around the world in table 6 the effects of biocrusts on water input and output are diverse in different regions and are often contingent on site conditions such as rainfall intensity soil water conditions biocrust types soil texture and other factors for example biocrust effects on infiltration range from negative wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b to neutral kidron 2014 to positive eldridge et al 2010 furthermore for both infiltration and e even within roughly the same geographic regions e g in the mu us sand land li et al 2016 yang et al 2015 and the tengger desert jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 of china different types of biocrusts had opposite effects on e e g moss biocrusts are more likely to increase e than cyanobacteria or lichen biocrusts kidron and tal 2012 li et al 2016 perhaps the most important message of table 6 is that infiltration a key soil water input and e a key soil water output are seldom measured in the same study it seems that if we are going to attain a more general understanding of biocrust effects on soil water balance we must combine these distinct measurements across multiple biocrust types and different climatic and edaphic environments additionally a productive way to move beyond conflicting case studies would be a greater reliance on international multisite collaborations using the same methodologies 5 summary and conclusions we analyzed the differences in water infiltration flow patterns θ and e between moss dominated biocrusts and bare soil in a semiarid climate region on the chinese loess plateau our results indicated that biocrusts retarded water infiltration and increased the surface θ by 9 in contrast to bare soil furthermore biocrusts retarded deep soil water infiltration below 15 cm and significantly decreased the s r by 16 in comparison to bare soil moreover biocrusts greatly increased the e by 27 both in simulated and in situ measurements all these changes were attributed to the biocrust effects on surface soil properties and hydraulic parameters especially the increasing contents of fine particles and organic matter of biocrusts as well as their increased θ f and decreased k s our findings supported by the measurements of soil water flow patterns θ and e indicated that biocrusts strongly retard rainwater infiltration to deep soil and thus retain more water at the surface which consequently prolongs water retention after wetting and increases the possibility of surface water loss through intensive soil evaporation in the chinese loess plateau credit authorship

3075,globally widespread biocrusts form a living skin on most dryland soils helping govern fundamental ecosystem functions particularly hydrological processes however the underlying mechanisms of biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and evaporation are still controversial biocrusts possibly regulate infiltration and evaporation due to their unique physicochemical properties and influence on surface soil moisture θ and these assumptions were verified in this study conducted on the loess plateau of china the differences in vertical soil moisture distribution and flow patterns of infiltration water between moss dominated biocrusts and bare soil were investigated through dye tracing experiments the evaporation characteristics of biocrusts and bare soil were also obtained by weighing micro lysimeters in both simulated and in situ experiments results showed that biocrusts retarded deep soil water infiltration below 15 cm and significantly f 48 15 p 0 001 decreased the stained area ratio percentage of stained area to total area at the same soil depth by 16 in contrast to bare soil because the infiltrated water was mostly retained in shallow soil 0 15 cm in biocrust covered soil their ratios of low interaction flow stained path width 20 mm and high interaction flow 20 mm stained path width 200 mm were significantly higher f 7 82 p 0 007 than those of bare soil after the dye tracing experiments the biocrusts modestly increased θ by 17 throughout the soil profile 0 50 cm but they remarkably increased θ by 33 78 in the top 20 cm of soil additionally the biocrusts increased soil daily evaporation rate e by 27 39 with only the exception of the beginning and the cumulative evaporation amount by 14 in contrast to bare soil over an 8 day field measurement more importantly the biocrust affected soil properties such as the contents of fine particles and organic matter as well as saturated water content and field capacity were closely correlated with e ρ 0 52 p 0 08 consequently it was concluded that biocrusts restrict the depth of rainwater infiltration and increase surface θ which may greatly enhance surface soil evaporation in the chinese loess plateau keywords biological soil crust micro lysimeter soil moisture water flow pattern soil field capacity loess plateau 1 introduction soil evaporation is one of the most critical components of the water and energy balances in drylands around the world where precipitation is limited and ecosystems are fragile balugani et al 2018 water evaporation in these terrestrial ecosystems accounts for 20 40 of global evapotranspiration and 65 of these water losses come from soil rather than water body surfaces tugwell wootton et al 2020 due to intense evaporation and limited rainfall soil water availability is one of the vital limiting factors in shaping ecosystem structural and functional attributes in drylands such as the distribution pattern and survival of vegetation chamizo et al 2013b kidron and tal 2012 generally the factors that influence soil evaporation are classified into three groups i soil properties such as texture porosity and organic matter content ii hydrological conditions such as water dynamics and hydraulic conductivity and iii atmospheric conditions including air temperature solar radiation wind speed and vapor pressure hillel 2003 li and xiao 2022 the soil evaporation rate e is especially dependent on soil texture one of the soil properties that usually shows a great deal of difference among various surface covers xiao et al 2010 biocrusts are a particularly influential surface soil cover in drylands potentially dominating the cover of open ground surface and affecting soil hydrological geomorphologic biological and ecological processes belnap et al 2005 bowker et al 2013 importantly for surface soil water balance biocrusts are assumed to have a strong influence on surface soil evaporation in dryland ecosystems kidron and tal 2012 xiao et al 2010 biocrusts are communities of cyanobacteria lichens mosses fungi archaea and other organisms that are commonly distributed on surface soil throughout the world especially in arid and semiarid climate regions belnap 2006 bowker et al 2013 although biocrusts occupy only a minor proportion a few millimeters or centimeters of the soil profile xiao et al 2019b they act as ecosystem engineers and strongly influence soil properties such as surface soil texture roughness soil structure and porosity aggregation and stability and micro and macro porosity chamizo et al 2012b kakeh et al 2018 li et al 2021a menon et al 2011 moreover biocrusts are capable of improving soil fertility by fixing carbon and nitrogen and transporting them to the soil underneath belnap et al 2005 additionally another important role of biocrusts is that they affect soil water movements soil moisture status soil water holding capacity and water availability eldridge et al 2020 sun et al 2021 this is especially true for rainwater infiltration and evaporation which dominate the hydrological processes of drylands eldridge et al 2020 lending biocrusts a pervasive and potentially strong influence on surface soil water balances in drylands chamizo et al 2013a eldridge et al 2020 rainwater is the important water source for soil evaporation biocrust effects on rainwater infiltration can moderate surface water flows and distribution and eventually regulate soil evaporation in drylands belnap 2006 kidron and benenson 2014 although there are already several studies about biocrust impacts on rainwater infiltration and runoff these results vary widely eldridge et al 2020 kidron 2019 yang et al 2016 for instance several of the biocrust mediated changes in surface soil properties such as decreasing soil bulk density increasing contents of fine particles and organic matter and increasing water repellency may contribute to strongly impeding rainwater infiltration wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b in contrast biocrusts may also enhance rainwater infiltration by increasing surface microtopography and macro porosity thus lowering runoff chamizo et al 2012a eldridge et al 2010 additionally according to some researchers the infiltrability of biocrusts was assumed to decrease due to the higher repellency or to increase due to the biocrust role in improving soil aggregate stability and porosity in sandy soils coppola et al 2011 xiao et al 2019a all of these possible influences of biocrusts on infiltration would likely change the very limited soil water conditions in drylands although the importance of biocrusts in regulating soil infiltration is widely recognized studies of the effects of biocrusts on soil evaporation also produce conflicting results chamizo et al 2013a kidron and tal 2012 li and xiao 2022 wang et al 2011 biocrusts may affect soil evaporation directly e g on the coverage and composition of biocrusts kidron and tal 2012 or indirectly through their effects on soil roughness stability porosity and hydrophobicity chamizo et al 2016 integration of both direct and indirect influences will ultimately determine the biocrust role in evaporation processes chamizo et al 2013a these effects are variously documented in the literature for example biocrusts may reduce e by capping the soil surface and clogging pores due to the swelling of organisms inhabiting soil particles belnap et al 2005 fischer et al 2010 or by modifying surface soil cracks during drying verrecchia et al 1995 both of which decrease the available water vapor pathways to the atmosphere in contrast biocrusts retain more water and increase soil temperature which can result in a higher e than that of bare soil kidron and tal 2012 zhang et al 2008 nevertheless studies illustrate that it is difficult to define biocrust effects on evaporation in a binary way increase or decrease because the soil water conditions rainfall intensity and even biocrust types clearly affect soil evaporation in sometimes opposing ways chamizo et al 2013a xiao et al 2010 therefore the role of biocrusts in influencing evaporation is still controversial and further studies are required to improve understanding of how biocrusts influence the water balance in drylands apart from infiltration and evaporation soil moisture θ and its vertical distribution are both indispensable factors in regulating soil evaporation kidron and tal 2012 xiao et al 2016 owing to the contrary viewpoints and conflicting case studies of biocrust effects on infiltration and evaporation the potential combined effects of biocrusts on θ and water availability for vascular plants are not universally understood chamizo et al 2016 kidron 2014 xiao and hu 2017 due to the higher water retention capacity of soils with prominent biocrusts θ would be higher in biocrust covered soil than in bare soil at a shallow depth usually 10 cm where θ changes dramatically with rainfall in drylands xiao et al 2016 additionally the higher θ of biocrusts would further influence soil thermal properties e g thermal conductivity and heat capacity and soil temperature dynamics which consequently change the soil evaporation process li et al 2022b xiao et al 2019b recently the brilliant blue dye tracer has emerged as an efficient method to observe water flow patterns throughout the soil profile and evaluate water infiltration and distribution in a short period weiler and flühler 2004 yi et al 2020 this dye is chosen because it is a good compromise between distinguishability mobility and toxicity for visualizing flow pathways in soils allaire et al 2009 weiler and flühler 2004 furthermore the brilliant blue dye tracer method is convenient and helpful in classifying infiltrated water flow types through analyzing the stained area from pictures obtained with digital camera weiler and flühler 2004 yi et al 2020 but it is rarely used in biocrust studies consequently it is suitable to quantify θ and the water flows of biocrust covered soil for the purposes of investigating the relationships between θ and e in this study a comprehensive picture of moss dominated biocrust effects on the water balance in a semiarid region ecosystem was sought by integrating the measurement of infiltration θ and e this type of integration has been very rare in the biocrust literature chamizo et al 2016 xiao et al 2010 a series of water infiltration and evaporation experiments were conducted on moss dominated biocrusts and bare soil in the chinese loess plateau this study aimed to i determine biocrust effects on rainwater infiltration vertical flows and water distribution and their contribution to subsequent soil evaporation ii clarify the θ differences between biocrusts and bare soil and to explain biocrust influences on evaporation by analyzing their effects on θ and iii compare the evaporation characteristics between biocrusts and bare soil and to explain biocrust effects on evaporation via their influences on surface soil properties and θ this approach was helpful for a more complete understanding of the role of biocrusts in maintaining soil water balances in drylands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study was conducted in the liudaogou watershed 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n fig 1 a b in shenmu county on the northern loess plateau of china this area is a typical semiarid region and covers 6 9 km2 with a typical semiarid continental monsoon climate and a mean altitude of 1180 m li et al 2021b li et al 2022b the average annual precipitation and potential evaporation are 409 mm and 1337 mm respectively the mean annual temperature is 8 4 which ranges from 9 7 in winter to 23 7 in summer furthermore 80 of precipitation occurs in summer june to september xiao et al 2019c the soils correspond to psamments an aeolian sandy soil according to the usda soil taxonomy li et al 2021a at the study site water was one of the limiting resources in ecological restoration and agricultural production li et al 2021b xiao et al 2016 the soil was susceptible to both water and wind erosion before the implementation of the grain for green program which curtailed this problem through planting a great deal of native shrubs and shifting land use from farmlands to forest or grasslands in the past two decades li et al 2021a biocrusts widely and spontaneously develop on stabilized soil surfaces with cover generally 30 now and sometimes as much as 70 80 xiao et al 2019a the biocrusts are composed of cyanobacteria and mosses with mosses being the dominant autotrophs the dominant mosses are didymodon vinealis brid zander and bryum arcticum r brown b s g with comparison species of b caespiticium hedw b argenteum hedw d nigrescens mitt saito and barbula perobtusa broth chen li et al 2022b xiao et al 2019a 2 2 experimental design all sampling and measurements were conducted on a flat area of 1000 m2 slope 5 to constrain variation in conditions such as biocrust characteristics soil texture slope gradient and aspect and coverage and type of shrubs see fig 1b two treatments with six replicates were considered including biocrusts naturally developed moss dominated biocrusts not artificially planted biocrusts see fig 1c and fig s1 and bare soil aeolian sand without biocrusts not scalped biocrusts see fig 1d the coverage almost fully covered and spatial pattern of all biocrusted plots were largely similar see fig s1 for each of the two treatments three types of measurements were carried out i soil properties and hydraulic parameters ii infiltrated water flow patterns and water distribution using dye tracing and iii soil evaporation rate using weighing micro lysimeters all measurements were implemented from july to october 2019 2 3 measurements of water flow patterns and θ 2 3 1 dye tracer experiments dye tracer experiments were conducted to quantify the infiltrated water flow patterns of bare soil and biocrust covered soil n 6 fig 1e for each treatment six plots 100 cm 100 cm with similar biocrust cover or lack of biocrusts were demarcated to conduct dye tracing each plot was 5 m apart and the very sparse vascular vegetation was cut away carefully leaving roots in place then a four sided metal frame 100 cm 100 cm 50 cm was inserted 20 cm into the soil and the air gap between the frame and soil was sealed with wet soil to prevent preferential flow janssen and lennartz 2008 these experiments were conducted only on clear days to reduce the influences of rainfall brilliant blue was mixed with distilled water and used as the dye tracer solution in this study due to its low toxicity high visibility and high mobility weiler and flühler 2004 yi et al 2020 although rainfall is mostly 20 mm d 1 in this region rainstorms 50 mm d 1 also occur occasionally fig s2 additionally most studies supplied sufficient water usually 50 mm to obtain distinct vertical water flow patterns for clear observations as they are usually inconspicuous under slight rainfall janssen and lennartz 2008 weiler and flühler 2004 yi et al 2020 therefore we applied 50 mm 50 l of water of dye tracer solution 5 g l 1 to each plot in this study to obtain clearer differences in vertical water flow patterns between biocrusts and bare soil all tracer solutions were sprayed by a rainfall simulator uniformly within 1 h and paused when necessary to avoid water ponding or runoff due to the intensive soil evaporation on clear days the top of frame was covered with an opaque plastic film shortly after spraying to minimize soil heating by sunshine and unnecessary water evaporation from the plots the frame and plastic film were moved away carefully one day after spraying and soil profiles were dug and photographed in the following procedures fig 2 b usually in dye tracer experiments the vertical profiles obviously and directly illustrate the depth of infiltrated water flow pathways from topsoil to subsoil and a couple of vertical and horizontal profiles can enable a three dimensional understanding of water flow patterns janssen and lennartz 2008 yi et al 2020 therefore both the vertical and horizontal directions were excavated and photographed to further analyze the water flow patterns as shown in fig 2a half of each experimental plot was excavated in 6 vertical profiles 100 cm in width and 50 cm in depth in interval of 10 cm and the other half was excavated in 7 horizontal profiles at 0 5 10 15 20 30 and 40 cm depths no stained area below a depth of 40 cm was observed so no deeper samples were collected all the soil profiles were carefully prepared with a spatula and then photographed under daylight conditions beneath a whitish opaque foil light tent to diffuse the light and avoid direct radiation additionally all photos were taken with a canon eos 5d camera mark iv a resolution of 4368 2912 pixels and a rectangular wooden frame with scale was placed around the profiles to obtain the actual length and width fig 2b a grayscale kodak 8 10 in was attached to the soil profiles for later color adjustment as the dye tracer experiment only provided snapshots of water flow patterns at 24 h after the simulated rainfall event the initial water flow paths could have been obscured by a later downward movement of the infiltration wetting front janssen and lennartz 2008 weiler and flühler 2004 however due to the homogeneous soil particles and porosity the probability of this case was relatively low and it was assumed that these snapshots were a viable basis for characterizing infiltrated water flow patterns and water distribution 2 3 2 measurements of soil water distribution and dynamics in the field two types of θ measurements were conducted to obtain the characteristics of soil water distribution and dynamics a snapshot θ measurement throughout the entire soil profile and a continuous θ measurement over time at a single depth during the dye tracer experiments θ was measured at each profile by a gs3 soil moisture sensor meter group inc in usa specifically after taking photographs of the soil vertical profile the profile was divided into 50 square grid cells 10 cm 10 cm fig 2b and the soil moisture sensor was inserted horizontally into the soil to measure θ for each grid cell at each grid cell θ was measured 3 times at the same time and at different positions to obtain a mean θ value and all data were stored in a procheck data logger meter group inc in usa θ was only measured at depth of 0 50 cm because no stained areas were observed deeper than 40 cm in all plots therefore 50 values of θ were obtained for each profile and 300 values for each plot in total fig 2b θ was also continuously measured for 4 months at a depth of 5 cm in situ using a 5te sensor meter group inc in usa for biocrusts and bare soil in 6 replicates all moisture sensors were located on the same flat ground near the dye tracing plots to ensure the same type of soil and rainfall distribution fig 1b the biocrust layer and excavated soil 5 cm 10 cm 10 cm was moved and then sensors were installed horizontally at 5 cm depth at the undisturbed side and backfilled carefully the biocrust layer was put back to cover the soil surface θ was recorded every 10 min and the data were stored in em50 data loggers meter group inc in usa all soil moisture sensors were installed in april 2019 and the period of θ measurements of biocrusts and bare soil used in this study was from july to october when the soil surface was almost stable and biocrusts were mostly restored to undisturbed conditions 2 4 image processing and water flow pattern classification 2 4 1 image processing rigorous and repeatable methods of image processing was applied to determine the water flow patterns in imagej wayne rasband national institutes of health using the following procedures first all the photos were geometrically corrected by establishing a relationship between the location of pixels in the image and the corresponding coordinates on the soil surface i e points with known coordinates on the wood frame the plotting scale was set as 1 mm 5 pixels which was not only accurate but also convenient for obtaining the stained area later fig 2c second all photos were adjusted in contrast and brightness based on the grayscale image to intensify the stained area noise was reduced carefully fig 2c and a detailed description of this procedure can be found in weiler and flühler 2004 third a color threshold was set between stained and unstained areas based on red green and blue values and we used this to create a binary classification of the soil due to the heterogeneous background color distribution in the soil caused by material transitions or plant roots a manual correction for the stained area was also performed by visual check of images these corrections erased naturally dark but unstained areas within the soil that were errantly classified as stained using our threshold and the outer 5 cm of the stained profiles were excluded from the analysis to avoid including air gap between the frame and soil last a binary picture was obtained and each binarized image was analyzed with r software version 4 0 3 to quantify the characteristics of infiltrated water flow patterns 2 4 2 water flow patterns classification the stained area ratio s r in was used to describe the water flow patterns which was defined as the percentage of stained area to the profile area at the same soil depth for vertical profiles a resolution of 1 cm in the vertical direction was set to calculate the s r from 0 40 cm depth for horizontal profiles the whole stained area in each photograph was obtained to calculate the s r overall the s r in both vertical and horizontal profiles was calculated through eq 1 1 s r a s a t 100 where a s is the stained area in mm2 a t is the total profile area at the same soil depth which is 1 0 104 mm2 in vertical profiles and 5 0 105 mm2 in horizontal profiles due to the variations in water infiltration and redistribution the stained path width s w in mm at each depth is another important informative option to categorize stained patterns weiler and flühler 2004 a simplified categorization of s w based on weiler and flühler 2004 of three flow types was used i low interaction flow where continuously stained pixels were 100 s w 20 mm fig s3a and the water flow was confined to a relatively narrow pathway through the soil matrix ii high interaction flow where 100 continuously stained pixels 1000 actual length is 20 s w 200 mm fig s3b and the water flow interacted with a larger proportion of the soil matrix and iii homogeneous matrix flow where continuously stained pixels were 1000 s w 200 mm fig s3c and the water flow was not confined to preferential flow paths the stained path width ratio s wr in was calculated through eq 2 2 s wr a 20 a t 100 s w 20 a 20 200 a t 100 20 s w 200 a 200 a t 100 s w 200 where a 20 a 20 200 and a 200 are the stained areas of low interaction flow high interaction flow and homogeneous matrix flow respectively in mm2 2 5 measurements of soil evaporation processes soil evaporation measurements were conducted by weighing cylindrical pvc micro lysimeters similar to previous studies chamizo et al 2013b li and xiao 2022 xiao et al 2010 in this experiment the micro lysimeter was 10 5 cm in inner diameter and 10 0 cm in height during sampling all micro lysimeters were pushed vertically into the soil to collect intact soil at a depth of 0 10 cm the bottom of the micro lysimeters was sealed with a 300 mesh nylon net n 6 a larger pvc cylinder 15 5 cm in inner diameter and 11 cm in height see fig s4 was installed for each micro lysimeter and removed the soil within it then the micro lysimeters were placed within the larger pvc cylinders and the interspace between the micro lysimeters and larger pvc cylinder was filled with polystyrene to diminish possible thermal convection fig s4 therefore the soil in micro lysimeter was only lit by direct sunlight striking the surface resulting in a thermal regime similar to that of natural soil li et al 2021b to maintain soil and atmospheric conditions similar to those of undisturbed soils all micro lysimeters were installed 15 days in the field before measurements to allow soil stabilization a simulated and an in situ evaporation experiment was established to obtain the evaporation characteristics for the former 50 mm rainfall was simulated on the micro lysimeters at sunset and then covered the micro lysimeters with a plastic sheet to delay evaporation as excess water was drained until 6 00 of the next day all the samples were kept in an open unvegetated area and weighed with an electronic balance 0 01 g to obtain the evaporation amount generally the soil evaporation rate e changes intensively at first few days but gradually become stable at later days li and xiao 2022 in order to obtain the whole evaporation processes from saturation to dry all micro lysimeters were weighed at 2 h intervals from 6 00 to 18 00 for the first 4 days and then weighed only at sunrise 6 00 and sunset 18 00 for the last 4 days the measurements were performed for 8 days in total and they were terminated when the daily evaporation amount of all treatments was 3 g equal to 0 3 mm of water after these simulations all samples were placed in the field site after natural rainfall on june 28 and continuously weighed at sunrise and sunset to obtain the daily evaporation rate which was referred to as the in situ evaporation experiments all measurements were performed only on clear days and were stopped if rainfall events occurred finally the soil evaporation rate e and cumulative evaporation amount e c were both expressed as mm of water to quantify the evaporation characteristics of both treatments 2 6 soil sampling and measurement of properties after the dye tracer experiments soil samples of each treatment were taken near the plots 5 m for measuring biocrust characteristics and soil properties n 6 the upper 2 cm of biocrusts was taken using petri dishes 9 cm in diameter and 2 cm in height to measure biocrust thickness and total biomass the soil surface roughness was measured by the chain method li et al 2021b soil cores 5 cm in height and 100 cm3 in volume were used to collect the topsoil 0 5 cm depth of each treatment to measure the soil bulk density saturated hydraulic conductivity k s saturated water content θ s field capacity θ f and particle size distribution in the laboratory the thickness of the biocrust layer was measured by using a digital vernier caliper li et al 2022a and moss plants were separated from the soil with water through a 2 mm sieve and dried at 65 c for 24 h for the measurement of moss biomass li et al 2021b xiao et al 2019b the soil bulk density and θ s were measured after oven drying at 105 c for 24 h and θ f was measured by pressure plates at 33 kpa of soil water potential xiao et al 2019b k s was measured using the constant head method yi et al 2020 the soil particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern england and the soil organic matter content was measured by the dichromate redox titration method li et al 2021a 2 7 data analysis the biocrust effects on soil properties e and θ were determined by the relative differences δ between biocrusts and bare soil which were defined as eq 3 3 δ biocrusts bare soil bare soil 100 the differences between the biocrusts and bare soil in soil properties hydraulic parameters and simulated e were tested using one way anova α 0 05 a two way manova α 0 05 test was employed to evaluate the interactions of soil cover biocrusts and bare soil and soil depth on θ and s r which were measured after dye tracing experiments furthermore a two way anova α 0 05 followed by tukey s hsd post hoc test was employed to evaluate the interactions of soil cover biocrusts and bare soil and soil depth on s wr repeated measures anova was performed to test the differences in θ and e between the two treatments α 0 05 with each of the days during the measurement period serving as repeated measures relationships between e and soil properties were analyzed by spearman s correlation analysis both within biocrust and bare soil plots and within the two plot types pooled the representation and graphical fits of the dye tracer experimental data were obtained using originpro 2019 originlab corporation in usa and the distribution of θ measured after dye tracer experiments was obtained using a gaussian three dimensional regression model by using sigmaplot 14 5 systat software inc in usa the final results reflect the mean values of the 6 replicates expressed as the mean value standard deviation unless otherwise noted statistical analyses were conducted using r software version 4 0 3 3 results 3 1 biocrust effects on surface soil properties and hydraulic parameters the biocrusts significantly modified every physical soil environmental property and hydraulic parameter measured at 0 5 cm depth as well as surface roughness fig 3 and table 1 compared with the bare soil the bulk density of the biocrusts was 21 2 lower the organic matter content of the biocrusts was 28 5 g kg 1 which was 3 5 fold higher than that of the bare soil moreover the biocrusts had 7 5 9 9 vs 2 4 table 1 higher amounts of fines than the bare soil perhaps due to these physical changes the biocrusts also pronouncedly decreased k s in comparison to the bare soil by 79 6 3 4 vs 16 7 cm h 1 fig 3a furthermore the biocrusts had significantly higher θ s by 26 6 fig 3b and θ f by 139 6 fig 3c than the bare soil f 107 10 p 0 001 finally the surface roughness of the biocrusts was 1 9 times 5 3 vs 2 8 table 1 higher than that of the bare soil 3 2 influences of biocrusts on stained area and water flow patterns the s r significantly f 48 15 p 0 001 decreased with increasing soil depth and the biocrusts greatly decreased s r below 15 cm depth in contrast to the bare soil fig 4 and table s1 generally the s r reached nearly 100 at 0 15 cm depth but it rapidly decreased to 0 at 40 cm depth as evident in both vertical and horizontal profiles fig 4a and 4c in our vertical profiles the s r of biocrusts was only slightly different from that of the bare soil at 0 15 cm depth and the soil cover bare soil and biocrusts showed insignificant f 0 88 p 0 36 table s1 effects on s r however the biocrusts decreased s r 31 9 vs 37 1 fig 4a at 15 40 cm depth in congruence with this finding the horizontal s r of biocrusts was significantly decreased 48 4 vs 54 9 fig 4c in comparison to the bare soil at 15 40 cm depth in addition the stained area of bare soil was more homogeneous while the biocrust covered soil displayed more deeper wetting fronts at 20 30 cm depth fig 4b the biocrusts significantly changed the water flow patterns f 7 82 p 0 007 table 2 increasing the ratios of low interaction flow and high interaction flow but decreasing the ratio of homogeneous matrix flow the ratio of low interaction flow accounted for only a small percentage 2 6 of the total stained area for the two treatments and the biocrusts increased the ratio of low interaction flow by 45 5 on average compared with bare soil at 0 40 cm depth especially at 10 30 cm depth the ratio of low interaction flow of biocrusts was 1 2 2 0 times higher than that of bare soil table 3 correspondingly the ratio of high interaction flow of biocrusts was approximately 1 5 fold 9 8 vs 6 4 higher than that of the bare soil at 0 40 cm depth fig 5 which was also increased by 29 3 132 2 compared with bare soil at 10 30 cm depth table 3 conversely the biocrusts strongly decreased the ratio of homogeneous matrix flow by 21 1 in comparison to bare soil fig 5 3 3 biocrust effects on θ and soil water distribution after the dye tracer experiments there was a statistically significant interaction effect between soil cover and depth on θ and s r f 4 24 p 0 002 table s2 and the θ of biocrusts was higher by 16 5 or equal to that of the bare soil across all depths fig 6 the θ of bare soil clearly increased with increasing soil depth while the θ of biocrust covered soil did not vary with depth fig 6 biocrust enhancement of θ was more pronounced closer to the surface at 0 10 cm depth where θ of the biocrusts was 1 7 times higher 0 16 vs 0 09 cm3 cm 3 however the differences in θ between biocrusts and bare soil were minor deeper than 30 cm depth fig 7 because there was almost no stained area at 40 cm depth the differences in water distribution at 0 40 cm reflected the biocrust effects on soil infiltration the in situ measurements demonstrated consistently higher θ in biocrusts than in bare soil f 76 88 p 0 001 fig 7b at 5 cm depth during the whole period biocrusts had 9 3 higher θ on average than bare soils θ increased rapidly after rainfall and the differences between biocrusts and bare soil were enlarged immediately after rainfall events fig 7b for instance the biocrusts increased θ by 90 9 0 21 vs 0 11 cm3 cm 3 at 5 cm depth in contrast to bare soil after the rainfall event on july 29 fig 7b although θ decreased swiftly after the rain event ceased the biocrust covered soil retained a higher θ than the bare soil for instance after the rain event on august 11 θ averaged 1 7 fold higher from august 12 to 22 in the biocrusts 0 10 vs 0 06 cm3 cm 3 on average fig 7b 3 4 characteristics of soil evaporation and their correlations with soil properties as shown in fig 8 and table 4 the biocrusts significantly increased e and e c compared with the bare soil in simulated rainfall experiments specifically the e changed dramatically on days 1 4 for both biocrusts and bare soil and then it became steady with very low e on days 5 8 fig 8a on day 1 the e was the highest 11 33 mm d 1 and at this point e in biocrusts was lower 10 87 vs 11 82 mm d 1 than that of the bare soil from days 2 4 the e decreased rapidly 1 02 mm d 1 and the biocrusts increased e by 39 3 3 96 vs 2 84 mm d 1 in comparison to the bare soil notably although the e was very low 0 5 mm d 1 on days 5 8 the biocrusts still had significantly higher e than that of the bare soil 0 45 vs 0 32 mm d 1 f 3 78 p 0 003 table 4 additionally the e c of biocrusts was greater by 13 6 24 2 vs 21 3 mm fig 8c than that of the bare soil the in situ experiments confirmed similar patterns as the e of biocrusts was significantly higher than that of the bare soil f 4 85 p 0 029 fig 7c and 9 the e of biocrusts was 1 4 mm d 1 on average during the experimental period which was 27 2 higher than that of the bare soil 1 1 mm d 1 fig 9 confirming previous observations the e of bare soil and biocrusts increased distinctly and immediately after rainfall events yet the biocrusts clearly had higher e after rainfall fig 7c as an example the e of biocrusts was 13 2 6 02 vs 5 32 mm d 1 higher than that of the bare soil on july 30 fig 7c spearman s correlation analysis showed that the e bare soil biocrusts was well ρ 0 52 p 0 08 table 5 correlated with the soil properties for the most part similarly signed but somewhat weaker correlations were observed within the two sample types separately θ s and θ f were especially strongly and positively correlated ρ 0 84 p 0 04 table 5 with e while bulk density was strongly and negatively correlated with e ρ 0 83 p 0 04 surface roughness was the weakest correlate with e and it took on a negative sign in biocrust samples and a positive sign in bare samples 4 discussion 4 1 biocrust effects on soil properties and their connections with evaporation in this study we found that biocrusts had a much higher e 27 2 than bare soil and this increased e was partly attributed to biocrust effects on soil physicochemical properties and hydraulic parameters such as the contents of clay particles and organic matter surface roughness and soil water conditions chamizo et al 2012a kidron and tal 2012 xiao et al 2010 although biocrusts are only a few millimeters to centimeters thick at most they can engineer profound changes in surface soils in general biocrusts trap and retain fine sediments silt and clay and change the particle size distribution on the surface soil even over only a short time kakeh et al 2018 because they fix atmospheric carbon they also increase the organic matter content of soils chamizo et al 2013b in our study it was very strong table 1 both of these changes would be expected to affect the bulk density as finer soils are generally denser than coarser soils and organic matter is less dense than minerals and promotes soil structure chamizo et al 2013b in our case these likely opposing forces produced a net decrease in bulk density perhaps suggesting that organic enrichment exerted a stronger effect than the enrichment of fines decreasing bulk density often signifies changes in porosity and pore size distribution both of which are influential on the movement and storage of water eldridge et al 2010 sun et al 2021 biocrusts are also known to increase aggregate stability and improve the soil physical structure which also increase the percentage of micropores chamizo et al 2012b felde et al 2016 currently biocrust effects on soil thermal properties and temperature attract attention due to their great influences on physical properties some studies also concluded that biocrusts may increase soil temperature because of their changed thermal properties belnap 2006 li et al 2022b xiao et al 2019b in addition biocrusts also decreased surface albedo due to their darker surface color which resulted in a much higher surface soil temperature than that of bare soil li et al 2022b xiao and bowker 2020 although we did not measure soil thermal properties or surface albedo in this study previous data obtained in the same study area showed that biocrusts significantly increased soil temperature and decreased surface albedo see li et al 2022b xiao and bowker 2020 all these effects suggest that biocrusted surfaces present a different physical environment than surfaces lacking biocrusts and these differences are likely to produce different evaporation and hydraulic properties and hydrological patterns partly because of their effect on physical changes in bulk density porosity and pore size distribution biocrusts change most soil hydraulic parameters which regulate the e in concert with the contents of fine particles and organic matter coppola et al 2011 gao et al 2010 both θ s and θ f of biocrust covered soil were elevated in comparison to bare soil in our study fig 3 a higher θ s signifies a greater pore volume and a higher θ f is often strongly related to the prevalence of micro and mesopores li et al 2022a sun et al 2021 extracellular polymeric substances in biocrusts further change the soil hydraulic properties adessi et al 2018 gypser et al 2016 for instance extracellular polymeric substances can drastically increase their volume upon water absorption up to 50 times chenu 1993 which reduce macropores impedes infiltration and increases the water holding capacity adessi et al 2018 verrecchia et al 1995 xiao et al 2019b because of the biocrust transformation of hydraulic properties especially in raising θ f biocrusts maintain a larger quantity of water than bare soil at least near the surface an observation that has been made in multiple locations eldridge et al 2020 kidron 2014 shi et al 2018 additionally likely due to the differences in water holding capacity between biocrusts and bare soil e changed dramatically with time in the 8 day simulation experiment specifically both biocrusts and bare soil had a high initial θ on days 1 2 and the e of both treatments was at its peak and was limited primarily by weather conditions tugwell wootton et al 2020 this pattern reverses beginning on day 2 as e declines rapidly on bare soil compared to biocrusts unlike bare soils biocrusted soils may have clogged surface pores owing to swelling of the organisms and their organic exudates and residues 40 of the access pores verrecchia et al 1995 under high θ conditions which restricting evaporation pathways from the soil to the atmosphere however the higher e on the first day and lower water holding capacity of bare soil resulted in water loss rapidly and a dry layer formed quickly at its surface which intensely slowed subsequent water vapor transport from the soil balugani et al 2018 li and xiao 2022 correspondingly the e of biocrusted soils was lower than that of bare soil on days 1 2 fig 8 because a dry layer formed at the bare soil surface breaking the tension that allows capillary water movement to the surface thus cutting off the resupply of water to the surface e g days 2 4 in our study fig 8b balugani et al 2018 li et al 2016 conversely biocrusts can maintain more water owing to their higher water holding capacity delaying the formation of a dry soil layer and thereby lifting more water to the surface soil from the subsoil during days 2 4 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 finally θ of both treatments was extremely low by day 5 and afterward which directly led to a minor value of e and minimal differences between the two surface types fig 8a 4 2 biocrust effects on soil water infiltration and their influences on evaporation our study showed that biocrusts not only strongly decreased k s but also reduced rainwater infiltration depth figs 3 and 4 it has been suggested that biocrusts can yield lower soil infiltration by i increasing fine particle content thus improving the water holding capacity of surface soil sun et al 2021 xiao et al 2019b ii capping the soil surface and clogging soil pores because of swelling of organisms or extracellular polymeric substances in biocrusts as well as increasing water repellency of surface soil chamizo et al 2012b gypser et al 2016 and iii decreasing pore diameter and reducing macropore percentage sealing the soil surface as well menon et al 2011 soliman et al 2010 regardless of the prevailing mechanisms the results from this study site were consistent with previous results which demonstrate both lower k s and infiltrability xiao et al 2019b thus retarding seepage to deeper soil and altering its water flow patterns almog and yair 2007 li et al 2002 although s r and s wr do not completely illustrate the differences in soil infiltrability between biocrusts and bare soil these vertical and horizontal water flow patterns were the most powerful evidence to exhibit the water flow paths and water distribution after rainfall under natural conditions especially in studies of macropore flow or preferential flow wang and zhang 2011 weiler and flühler 2004 the wetting fronts displayed higher ratios of low and high interaction flows compared with bare soil which was more homogeneous fig 5 and table 3 this may be because under the same rainfall intensity the cracks and macropores in biocrust layer are the preferential flow channels fig s5 chamizo et al 2016 eldridge et al 2010 it should be noted that we simulated a heavy rainfall event in dye tracer experiments in this case the amount of infiltrated water between biocrusted and bare soils was different due to the retarding effects of biocrusts gao et al 2010 li et al 2004 and the differences in water flow patterns were easily obtained in contrast rainwater would be arrested at the surface soil under slight rainfall due to the high θ f of biocrusts which would result in a shallower distribution of infiltrated water and a heterogeneous wetting front li et al 2021b therefore the high θ f of biocrusts means that more water was held at surface soil resulting in less water infiltrating to deeper soil which not only increased surface θ but also improved the risk of more water loss through evaporation li et al 2022a the slower infiltration rate and enhanced θ f in soil underlying biocrusts would logically lead to a strong difference in water distribution throughout soil profile figs 4 and 6 we believe that these differences resulted in our observation that θ of biocrust covered soil was significantly higher at shallow depths but not in deep soils fig 6 this is especially true for moss dominated biocrusts compared to other types of biocrusts because the physicochemical properties may be significantly altered not only within the biocrust layer but also centimeters below the biocrusts chamizo et al 2013a li et al 2022b the higher near surface θ plays a cardinal role in affecting the e of biocrusted soil li et al 2016 generally a continuous supply of water from the interior of soil to its surface is one of the fundamental conditions in soil evaporation tugwell wootton et al 2020 biocrusts appear to enhance this water supply and they cause a concentration of that water supply nearer to the surface we would expect near surface moisture to be even more likely to evaporate because of warm temperatures experienced near the soil surface and shorter pathways for vapor flux to the atmosphere in drylands hillel 2003 4 3 implications of biocrust effects on surface soil water balance water is the vital resource in drylands and any changes in the soil water regime may deeply influence the water balance chamizo et al 2016 as inhabitants of the soil atmosphere boundary biocrusts may have major impacts on soil hydrological processes and surface soil water conditions in drylands bowker et al 2010 eldridge et al 2020 our results indicated that biocrusts significantly increased surface θ by retarding rainwater infiltration to deep soil but later increased the e of surface soil figs 6 and 9 these findings differ from others that also sought to integrate biocrust effects on water inputs and outputs some studies pointed out that biocrusts increased infiltration during light rainfall but decreased infiltration during heavy rainfall chamizo et al 2016 li et al 2016 in contrast others found that biocrusts were effective in intercepting infiltration during low intensity rainfall events but had no significant effect during high intensity rainfall events kidron 2014 in our study biocrusts not only had higher θ f and lower k s but also decreased s r at 15 40 cm depth and increased the ratios of low interaction flow and high interaction flow in contrast to bare soil under a high intensity rainfall event figs 4 and 5 therefore it would be rational to hypothesize that most of the rainwater would be retarded at shallow depths regardless of slight or heavy rainfall although we have not measured it here since our data documented a decrease in water inputs into deep soil by slowing infiltration and an increase in water outputs of surface soil through higher e it seems that biocrusts have a negative influence on the soil water balance however throughout our study we also observed that biocrust covered soil contained as much or more θ as bare soils at all observed depths even deeper soil figs 3 6 and 7b thus the equal or greater θ in biocrusts throughout the soil profile needs alternative elucidation some studies have shown that biocrusts provide extraordinarily positive contributions to surface soil water balances by increasing non rainfall water i e dew fog vapor deposition amounts li et al 2021b zhang et al 2014 in the same study site and measurement period as this study we documented that the presence of moss dominated biocrusts strongly enhanced vapor condensation from both deep soil and especially from the atmosphere li et al 2021a although the daily amount of non rainfall water intercepted or condensed on biocrusts is small and nearly negligible in comparison to infiltration li et al 2021b pan et al 2010 the cumulative amount of this type of water input may in turn modify surface reflective properties and recharge soil moisture levels li et al 2021a consequently biocrusts have additional water inputs which may help reconcile our findings here and should be accounted for in future studies of biocrust effects on water balance recently a meta analysis of the influences of biocrusts on water in the world s drylands by eldridge et al 2020 observed somewhat paradoxically that biocrusts decreased infiltration rates on average across the published literatures did not clearly enhance runoff and increased θ the explanation put forward was that biocrusts can allow water to enter the soil rather than run off but intercept it in shallow soil by slowing deeper infiltration similar conclusions were also reached by li et al 2002 almog and yair 2007 gao et al 2010 and xiao and hu 2017 our results seem to confirm this interception hypothesis however it is still challenging to evaluate the biocrust effects on infiltration and evaporation as well as their roles in the water balance in dryland ecosystems accordingly we further reviewed the different studies of biocrust effects on infiltration and evaporation around the world in table 6 the effects of biocrusts on water input and output are diverse in different regions and are often contingent on site conditions such as rainfall intensity soil water conditions biocrust types soil texture and other factors for example biocrust effects on infiltration range from negative wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2019b to neutral kidron 2014 to positive eldridge et al 2010 furthermore for both infiltration and e even within roughly the same geographic regions e g in the mu us sand land li et al 2016 yang et al 2015 and the tengger desert jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 of china different types of biocrusts had opposite effects on e e g moss biocrusts are more likely to increase e than cyanobacteria or lichen biocrusts kidron and tal 2012 li et al 2016 perhaps the most important message of table 6 is that infiltration a key soil water input and e a key soil water output are seldom measured in the same study it seems that if we are going to attain a more general understanding of biocrust effects on soil water balance we must combine these distinct measurements across multiple biocrust types and different climatic and edaphic environments additionally a productive way to move beyond conflicting case studies would be a greater reliance on international multisite collaborations using the same methodologies 5 summary and conclusions we analyzed the differences in water infiltration flow patterns θ and e between moss dominated biocrusts and bare soil in a semiarid climate region on the chinese loess plateau our results indicated that biocrusts retarded water infiltration and increased the surface θ by 9 in contrast to bare soil furthermore biocrusts retarded deep soil water infiltration below 15 cm and significantly decreased the s r by 16 in comparison to bare soil moreover biocrusts greatly increased the e by 27 both in simulated and in situ measurements all these changes were attributed to the biocrust effects on surface soil properties and hydraulic parameters especially the increasing contents of fine particles and organic matter of biocrusts as well as their increased θ f and decreased k s our findings supported by the measurements of soil water flow patterns θ and e indicated that biocrusts strongly retard rainwater infiltration to deep soil and thus retain more water at the surface which consequently prolongs water retention after wetting and increases the possibility of surface water loss through intensive soil evaporation in the chinese loess plateau credit authorship

the multitask neural network provides an effective solution with minimal weights and biases works as an end to end operator that directly approximates the inverse function multiple sharing mechanisms enable the multitasking approach to outperform single task models by 10 accuracy application to synthetic experiments shows that the quality of inverted maps relies on the complexity level of heterogeneity in the hydraulic fields mapping accuracy also depends on the data coverage but being resistant to data noise due to the featuring mechanism in the convolutional network adopted comparison with conventional inversion method reveals that the deep learning approach provides better generalization in the inversion while performing each inference on the order of milliseconds without further calibration from users keywords neural network multi task groundwater inversion transmissivity storativity data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction understanding flow and contaminant transport mechanisms in water reservoirs requires reliable assessments of the spatial patterns of hydrogeologic properties including hydraulic transmissivity and specific storage coefficient fitts 2012 şen 2015 methods for evaluating these parameters include hydraulic tomography which involves the acquisition and analysis of multiple piezometric responses associated with multiple pumping tests conducted sequentially hydraulic tomography analysis often involves a joint interpretation of all hydraulic head measurements in which the inversion approach is used to find the best transmissivity and storativity fields in terms of numerical fitting of the hydraulic measurements e g berg and illman 2015 castagna et al 2011 franssen et al 1999 the inverse problem is by nature ill posed and requires additional so called a priori information about the properties of the unknown hydraulic parameters to narrow the field of possibilities and arrive at a solution that satisfies both the measured data and a priori data criteria this ill posed problem is mainly due to the fact that the measured piezometric data are not sufficient to identify all heterogeneities of the environment tarantola 2005 yeh 1986 among the approaches used to constrain the inverse problem is the geostatistical approach in which the statistical properties mean and covariance of the target field are included in the optimization process as known parameters to regulate probability distributions of transmissivity and storativity tarantola 2005 in optimization deterministic algorithms such as gauss newton or conjugate gradient are usually applied to access a local minimum in handling the hydraulic tomography inversion the algorithms can incorporate a large dimension by computing the sensitivity of all measured values with respect to a small parameter variation at each unknown transmissivity and storativity parameter assigned to the discretized cell of the study area this computation can be effectively performed using an adjoint state formulation sun and yeh 1990 where an adjoint partial differential equation system further needs to solve for each observation point however in the transient mode the inversion of hydraulic tomography becomes more complex as the optimization aims to determine the spatial variabilities of both the transmissivity and storativity variables from a time recorded hydraulic head data set under these conditions the number of parameters increases making the problem more ill posed and underdetermined in practice tarantola 2005 mclaughlin and townley 1996 in this study we develop a deep learning algorithm based on the concept of convolutional neural networks to directly approximate the inverse function a function that performs an end to end operator to interpret the input hydraulic data as an image into multiple output hydraulic tomographies the transmissivity and the storativity a neural network uses multiple linear and nonlinear operators executed sequentially on hidden layers involving multiple multidimensional coefficients this high dimensional parameter system allows us to efficiently reconstruct the highly nonlinear inverse operator in our problem hornik et al 1989 the coefficients are derived via an optimization process known as the learning task this learning task consists of determining the coefficients that process the input maps to match the corresponding output maps both of which are stored in the database recent advances in learning algorithms have helped facilitate this optimization while most of the effort has been devoted to building a generalized database schmidt et al 2019 wani et al 2019 since the hydraulic tomography database can only be built based on a theoretical approach in this approach we generate thousands of transmissivity and storativity fields that are used to numerically generate the piezometric responses related to the pumping tests the entire dataset is thus used to build a network linking the piezometric responses and the hydraulic properties fields such deep learning algorithms are becoming an essential modeling tool in many fields including the geosciences thanks to the development of new networks such as convolutional neural networks the introduction of convolutional neural networks cnns has offered an efficient alternative to solve complex image processing problems such as tomography which are common in geophysical hydrogeological or remote sensing applications their effectiveness lies in convolutional computation which consists in extracting the main feature of the input images by scanning them with a small shared filter to reconstruct the output image processing only the main feature with small filters makes the computation more flexible and facilitates learning in the training phase cnns are typically formed as a multi layer architecture with interconnection schemes to make the network more efficient in handling complex tasks albawi et al 2017 among them the encoder decoder networks such as segnet badrinarayanan et al 2017 and unet ronneberger et al 2015 have been effectively applied in various tomography tasks in geosciences in seismic studies cnn networks have been used to reconstruct the spatial velocity of geological structures by inputting seismogram images into the networks zhao 2018 zhang and lin 2020 yang and ma 2019 moseley et al 2020 they were also adopted to perform 2d or 3d imaging of the subsurface by processing the apparent resistivity data recorded during the electrical resistivity tomography investigations liu et al 2020 vu and jardani 2021 in hydrology the cnn with encoder decoder has been effectively adapted to hydraulic tomography to process hydraulic data associated with pumping tests in reconstructing the transmissivity field in porous aquifers and in delineating the fracture structure in fractured aquifers jardani et al 2022 vu and jardani 2022 within the framework of this topic other cnn architectures were also tested such as the generative adversarial network gan to image hydraulic parameters in 2d or 3d binary models from the inversion of hydraulic data laloy et al 2017 2018 sun 2018 proposed by badrinarayanan et al 2017 for segmentation tasks segnet architecture has been quickly adopted in several applications in geosciences such as the classification of seismic facies hydraulic tomography in the reconstruction of hydraulic transmissivity detection of geochannels and mapping of 3d electrical resistivity pham et al 2018 mukhopadhyay and mallick 2019 vu and jardani 2021 while these works focus in single task networks the architecture proposed in this study attempts to deal with multiple tasks in a joint manner when dealing with a multivariate problem consisting of multiple output variables such as hydraulic tomography where both transmissivity and storativity fields are determined the interpretation of each field can be made independently using a single task neural network in this case each network is trained separately to derive the corresponding single field which can be cumbersome however the issue can be addressed jointly in a single neural network a multi task algorithm multi task learning mtl involves designing a network that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously in which each task benefits from the others through mutual learning the network interconnection can be established at hierarchical levels through which the extracted features are mutually transferred acting as data augmentation during the training process by exploiting the similarity and contrast between mutual features mtl based strategy promotes the generalization efficiency and accuracy of each task zhang and yang 2017 ruder 2017 the effectiveness of mtl networks has been recently studied especially in image processing and text translation zhang and yang 2017 liu et al 2016 however their application in geosciences is still limited and at an early stage of development in the field of seismic exploration siahsar et al 2017 developed a multi task algorithm to reduce the effects of random noise on seismic data wu et al 2019 suggested a unet based algorithm to detect faults seismic images and seismic normal vectors from training images of synthetic 3d seismic map li et al 2020 used a multitasking neural network to improve the resolution of seismic tomography by pairing an encoder decoder with a dense skip connection structure in this work we develop a multi task architecture to perform hydraulic transimissivity and storativity field reconstructions by analyzing hydraulic head data acquired in pumping experiments which has rarely been discussed and used for inversion problems in hydrogeology the proposed neural network consists of two encoder decoder structures both of which map transmissivity or storativity fields from temporal measurements of piezometric level related to pumping tests both architectures are based on segnet which is known for its ability to identify objects learned from images through segmentations with low computational cost compared to other autoencoders badrinarayanan et al 2017 in order to enhance the performance of multi task modeling each task element is previously optimized and then interconnected at multiple hierarchical levels this study which focuses on the ability of developing an mtl network to perform inversion tasks mapping hydraulic properties of aquifers from hydraulic data will be organized into 4 sections section 2 is dedicated to describing the theoretical background including groundwater modeling solving the inversion problem with the multitask network and its application to a synthetic case section 3 focuses on evaluating the performance of the trained network and the impact of various probable conditions including the quality and quantity of the trained data section 4 provides a comparison with a conventional least square inversion method outlining the differences between the two methods and their impact on prediction accuracy finally we conclude the paper with the main results discussions and an outlook on future work 2 methodology in this section we begin by summarizing the theoretical concept of groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer often referred to as the forward problem to numerically simulate hydraulic responses to pumping tests in this approach the forward problem is applied to form the training data that will be used to train the multi task networks that will be described later 2 1 forward problem groundwater modelling the horizontal groundwater flow in a 2d confined aquifer is governed by bear 1972 1a s h t t h q δ x subjected to the following boundary conditions 1b h h d a t γ d where h m is the hydraulic head t m2 s is the transmissivity s is the storage coefficient q m2 s is a sink source at the well location x and a constant hydraulic head hd is imposed as a boundary condition on the far away boundary γd solving the forward problem with heterogeneous distributions of hydraulic parameters can be done only by a numerical method such as the finite element method the solution involves in determining the spatio temporal distribution of the hydraulic load related to a water withdrawal imposed on the borehole by introducing the hydraulic properties of the aquifer and the boundary conditions solving the flow equations in this work is carried out using comsol software comsol multiphysics to create a database for training the neural network in fact the database consists of thousands of t and s fields randomly generated with characteristics regularized by a priori information such an a priori model usually constrains the inverse problem to avoid non uniqueness in optimization is recalled here in the machine learning algorithm to form the generation of training database as geostatistical constraint is one of the most common methods in the inversion of hydraulic tomography it is employed here to generate the fields of hydraulic properties while the corresponding hydrological responses are obtained from computing the forward problem 2 2 inversion problem hydraulic tomography from gw level measurements the forward problem from the previous section can be reformulated as follows 2 h f s t where h represents the hydraulic head data f denotes the forward operator and s t are the storativity and transmissivity fields in practice however the goal of a hydrogeological investigation is usually to map the parameter field from the observed data 3 s t f 1 h to estimate the parameter fields s t from a set of measurements a conventional inversion solver attempts to fit the given h by iteratively adjusting s t through an optimization process 4 s t a r g m i n h f s t g s t where s t denotes the estimated variable field s t in each step while g represents the regularization terms in this work however we design a neural network to directly approximate the operator inverse problem that linking the hydraulic head data and aquifer properties with the use of a training database then the approximation of this inverted function can be formulated as follows 5 f 1 ψ θ where ψ represents the neural network consisting of successive linear nonlinear operators the layers with a set of parameters θ thus ψ acts as an end to end function that directly reconstructs the storativity and transmissivity fields from a given measurement of h 6 s t f 1 h θ ψ h θ determination of network parameters θ implied in various linear and nonlinear operations in the networks is performed by a training process in which these parameters are chosen so that the network reproduces the models of the training data through optimizing the following loss function 7 θ a r g m i n s t i ψ h i θ where s t i denotes a model and its corresponding hydraulic head measurement h i obtained from solving the forward problem hydraulic parameter field reconstructions rely primarily on the training database building this database is hence the most critical task in this deep learning approach since a large database often promotes the accuracy of the network outcome the database contains a large number of models which requires a computational effort as a direct solution but also as a black box it is not involved in further computations of a sensitivity matrix as is the case with deterministic algorithms once trained however the neural network inverts the hydraulic parameters immediately and straightforwardly 2 3 multi task architecture in this work we develop a convolutional neural network based on the segnet architecture that can interpret the measurement of hydraulic head at the input into the mapping of storativity and transmissivity fields at the output segnet is a autoencoder neural network that has been proven to effectively capture the features embedded in live video under real world and complex circumstances originally segnet was designed for identifying trafict object but here the architecture is redimensioned and adapted into a network that maps two fields of hydraulic properties from temporal images of hydraulic heads captured during pumping tests the proposed multi task architecture then consists of two segnet based networks individually optimized for each task fig 1 each network consists of three encoder decoder pairs entailed with a regression layer at the output to map the corresponding field in each pair the encoder extracts and condenses the key features found in the input images and then transfers them to the next encoder while linking the indices to its decoder this decoder in turn extracts the features from the previous layer and compensates for the loss of resolution due to the condensation process in the encoders by using the indices to prepare the images to have the same resolution as the input images with the adoption of the gateway scheme the accuracy of the resulting reconstruction maps can be significantly improved which is an asset of this type of architectures this segnet network shares some topological similarities in its structure with other common encoder decoder networks such as vgg16 unet however by removing the fully connected layers from vgg16 segnet encoders are significantly smaller and easier to train in practice as the transfer of max pooling indices instead of values between encoders and decoders incurs only a fraction of the cost compared to unet siam et al 2018 thus segnet consists of a much smaller set of trainable parameters than competing architectures and can be determined using standard stochastic gradient descent in fact the total number of trainable parameters in this segnet based multi task architecture is 0 6 m which is significantly smaller than other recent architectures proposed in the literature gao et al 2019 misra et al 2016 therefore forming this small network requires less time and memory making it an ideal candidate for multitasking before building a multitasking network it is necessary to closely examine the structure of the single tasking network to understand how it works and to verify its limitations and advantages in segnet each encoder and its associated decoder are arranged symmetrically to keep the input and output maps the same size the encoding task is based on three operations such as convolution batch normalization and relu performed sequentially on the encoders the convolution calculation consists of scanning the input image with small filters to extract the features formed by the neighboring pixels the resulting maps are then passed and filtered through a batch normalization bn and a rectified linear unit relu before being reduced by a max pooling operation the encoders retain only the most important input information while reducing the dimensionality of the problem thereby lowering computational costs the condensation process at the encoder stage builds low level features and reduces the size of the parameters to be processed to better prevent the overfitting problem on the other hand the decoders unfold the condensed feature maps using an up sampling layer formed with transfer of poolling indices from the encoders then the resulting maps are processed by cn bn and relu to successively translate the features and resize the output to the same resolution as the input understanding the functionality of each part of the network helps in designing an efficient multitasking architecture by choosing the optimal position to ensure information transfer between tasks in the connected network the interest of multi task learning is the establishment of links between different networks performing different tasks during simultaneous learning each task can benefit from the others by sharing information mutual learning serves as a complement of data for the others reducing the risk of overfitting and achieving better generalization moreover both tasks are formalized with a single loss function that sumarizes the objective function of each task in this case each task sees the other as a regularization term ruder 2017 the regularization term acts as a numerical stabilizer in the optimization process that helps to better determine the parameters of the network however one of the main challenges in designing an efficient multi task architecture is determining how to share the features between tasks sharing at different layers often leads to a different feature distribution that can alter the efficiency of one or even all tasks misra et al 2016 multi task architectures usually have a shared trunk between tasks where all tasks have shared layers and task specific layers the first one retrieves the generic features in the shared part of the tasks while the latter handles the task specific features for optimal performance it is recommended to find a compromise between these two parts in an architecture in this aspect a multi task encoder decoder structure with a shared encoder and a task specific decoder seems promising while the encoder focuses on low level cross task feature learning the decoders perform high level feature interpretation to better learn task specific details in practice multi task architectures with an encoder decoder structure have been used in image processing kuga et al 2017 where the output variables share certain characteristics however this is not the case in our application where the two fields transmissivity and storativity are generated independently for this reason information transfer was only established at the decoder level by sharing low level features and the decoder processes very distinct features on the other hand if we assume that the two fields in the output have common characteristics the transfer can be performed both at the encoder and decoder kokkinos 2017 to connect the trunks misra et al 2016 proposed the use of trainable scalars to perform the weighted sum of the features of the two tasks at multiple feature levels by constructing the cross point units these units provide shared representations between the two tasks where their placements are decided in functioning of the dependencies between the tasks instead of trainable scalars gao et al 2019 suggested a fusible style scheme in which the feature maps of multiple tasks are concatenated and their dimensionalities are reduced by 1 1 convolutional layers following their work we use 1 1 convolutional layers to link hierarchical features in which the result of one task is added to another such additional layers are formed with learnable weights that are more flexible and require less memory than concatenation we retain the pooling index sharing mechanism in segnet which is computationally efficient and improves the accuracy of task specific reconstructions thus the new structure combines the linking and bridging mechanisms reduces the number of learned parameters to 0 6 million that can be trained efficiently from a standard gradient descent scheme the training phase aims at estimating the network parameters by optimizing the following objective function which is formulated as a sum of two objective functions for the two tasks 8 l l 1 l 2 9 l 1 j 0 h 1 k 0 w 1 m t j k m t j k and 10 l 2 j 0 h 1 k 0 w 1 m s j k m s j k where m t log 10 t and m t log 10 t with t and t denote for the true and predicted transmissivity h and w are the height and width of the output map m s log 10 s and m s log 10 s with s and s denote for the true and predicted storativity 2 4 hydrogeological model to construct a training database we randomly generate the transmissivity and storativity fields from geostatistical variograms using sgems in matlab remy et al 2009 two generations consist of 43 000 aquifer models where the distributions of log10t and log10s are independent and regulated by gaussian variograms whose mean range and sill parameters are randomly chosen with fixed intervals in detail both fields obey a variogram function γ u s 1 e x p u r but each field is generated independently with the sill s ranging from 0 1 to 1 and the range r varying from 10 to 30 m for the transmissivity field its mean value is randomly selected at each generation from 10 3 to 10 5 m2 s with transmissivity magnitudes ranging from 10 1 to 10 7 m2 s similarly the storativity mean ranges from 10 4 to 10 6 while storativity amplitudes range from 10 2 to 10 8 regarding to the degree of the heterogeneity both fields vary from 1 to 5 orders of magnitude with this method a database is created with different degrees of heterogeneity in a favorable generalization in this study no prior relationship is taken between transmissivity and storativity in the aquifers the parameterized fields of 32 32 cells are assigned to a 50 m 50 m aquifer on which 49 observation wells are regularly installed to measure variations in hydraulic head associated with water injection and extraction over time see fig 2 and table 1 in this study four injection pumping pairs are successively implemented with a flow rate of 10 l s two wells on opposite sides of the domain boundaries help to capture better the effects of aquifer heterogeneity on hydraulic head data in this theoretical study the hydraulic head data are numerically solved from the forward problem as described in section 2 the training database thus consists of transmissivity 32 32 1 and storativity 32 32 1 fields as the outputs and their hydraulic head responses collected with 49 wells at 10 timesteps in 2 min to construct an input of the same size as the output we use the nearest neighbor spatial interpolation algorithm to form piezometric variation maps with 32 32 cells for each timestep ultimately the input data for each model is organized as a multi channel matrix with 32 32 40 as the dimension where the depth 40 is derived from the number of injection pumping tests multiplied by the number of observations over time 3 results and discussion this section focuses on analyzing the results and some interferences that control the reconstruction quality with a multi task network such as the size of the training data the level of noise in the hydraulic head data and the characteristics of hydraulic property fields when generating the data for learning we also devote this section to include comparisons of the reconstruction accuracy from the proposed multi task network versus those from the simple networks and the classical gauss newton method 3 1 learning process and results to train the network we randomly select 30 000 models with the corresponding hydraulic data and another 3000 models for validation case c0 the training process is performed in matlab using the adam optimization algorithm with a constant learning rate of 0 001 and a batch size of 128 the training process is manually interrupted at epoch 227 to avoid overfitting and lasts 21 h on an nvidia quadro k2200 gpu in a dell precision tower 5810 the evolution of the objective function during the training is detailed in fig 3 to quantitively validate the resulting maps with the trained network we use the coefficient of determination and the root mean square deviation which are defined as follows 11a r t 2 1 ssr t sst t 11b r s 2 1 ssr s sst s 12a rmse t 1 n m t true m t pred 2 n 12b rmse s 1 n m s true m s pred 2 n where ssr t 1 n m t true m t pred 2 and sst t 1 n m t true m t true with m t true and m t pred are the true and predicted log10t while m t true is the mean of the true log10t field n denotes the number of pixel 32 32 similar definitions for the metrics related to the storativity field s to evaluate the effectiveness of the trained network we perform the test for 10 000 models that were not used in the learning phase in this test the network takes only 0 006 s to perform an interpretation of the simultaneous transmissivity and storativity tomography reconstructions of the entire test dataset yield average rmse and r2 values for the transmissivity models of 0 22 and 0 85 respectively while the corresponding values for the storativity models are 0 33 and 0 63 the network appears to reconstruct transmissivity more accurately than the storativity field this difference is due to the fact that storativity has less influence on the flow field in the aquifer especially at steady state during the pumping test to summarize the reconstruction accuracy for the test data set is presented in table 2 while its histogram is collected in fig 7 to examine the quality of reconstructed maps in detail three representative examples with different degrees of heterogeneity are selected and shown in fig 4 in which the trained model maps transmissivity and storativity from the measured hydraulic heads which are then compared with the real models to evaluate the reconstruction accuracy generally the proposed architecture successfully reconstructs the main heterogeneities of transmissivity and storativity fields the quality of the reconstruction also exposes a dependence on the complexity of the target maps in the case of ex1 where both fields have smooth distributions the network effectively detects their features including structure and magnitude in the case of ex2 although the transmissivity is well reconstructed the strong heterogeneity in the storativity field is only mapped with some smoothness since only the overall pattern is detected similarly ex3 is characterized by the presence of small heterogeneities that make their reconstruction a challenge for the process these high heterogeneities are thus captured with smoothness indeed the issue is a common challenge for all inversion methods where the reconstruction of complex distributions depends on the density of the data demanding a high resolution to enable capturing the fine details jardani et al 2022 ren and kalscheuer 2020 liu et al 2018 3 2 effect of multi task learning to further evaluate the effectiveness of multi task learning we compare the results of the trained multi task architecture with single task networks while a single task network translates hydraulic head data into transmissivity and storativity maps but by two separate networks case c1 as described in section 2 3 for a multi tasking design the multi task architecture is achieved by adding the interconnections between two single task networks thus the difference between the single task and multi task networks is only in the connection layers that are absent in the single task network we train the single task network using the same hyperparameters and data set as for the multi task architecture the trained networks are then tested on the same test dataset of 10 000 unseen models whose overall metrics are summarized in table 2 and fig 9 validation of the single task network on all test models yields an average rmse and r2 for the transmissivity reconstructions of 0 25 and 0 81 while the corresponding storativity reconstructions are 0 37 and 0 56 the results of single task networks are indeed encouraging and competitive as they are smaller thus trained more quickly with fewer computational resources however the multitask networks offers more accuracy with a 10 higher r2 and 10 lower rmse for both reconstructed tomograms this leverage is confirmed by analyzing of the resulting reconstructions of representative examples performed by the single task networks in fig 5 in which the reconstructions for the same representative samples are made and compared with the truth models the reconstructions for both fields with the single task networks are relatively less accurate than those obtained with the multi task network indeed the reconstruction of ex1 with the single tasks is satisfactory but the advantage always comes with outcome maps from the multi task architecture the advantage is more highlighted when applying the multi task network to complex heterogeneities that appear in ex2 and ex3 the trained multi task excels in capturing these heterogeneities compared to the single task networks where the reconstructions were found to be less accurate as explained in section 2 3 in multi task learning each task augments the input and regularizes the unified loss function making the network more effective to capture details embedded in a complex environment a similar conclusion has been drawn in the literature with applications of multitask networks in image processing horwath et al 2020 koziarski and cyganek 2018 shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 3 3 effect of number of observation points regardless of the optimization algorithms used the reconstruction accuracy in an inverse problem is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the measurements employed in this inversion in this section we examine how the quantity of hydraulic head data affects the reconstruction accuracy with the multi task network to this end we compare the reconstructions from hydraulic head acquisition in three different configurations of observation wells the first configuration represents a dense coverage with 49 wells from which the testing reconstructions are presented beforehand in fig 4 the second with only half of the original configuration 25 wells in fig 6 and the last with 16 wells the hydraulic head data retrieved with the new arrangements of observation wells are employed in the interpolation process to create input images for training for each configuration the multi task network is then trained with corresponding altered databases to optimize the network performance and the resulting reconstructions for the test models are presented in the table 2 and fig 9 overall the number of observation points determines the reconstruction accuracy in fact the reduction of piezometric data leads to a degradation of the information described in the hydraulic level maps which in turn leads to a significant reduction of the network effectiveness in predicting transmissivity and storativity fields this effect is even clearly visible especially when the aquifer properties are highly heterogeneous as shown in fig 7 for the representative samples where the reconstructions are performed using the coarse dataset and compared with the true ground models for coarse features in ex1 the neural network can reliably grasp the key features in both maps with some smoothing in the range of values however the trained network fails to reconstruct the finer details in ex2 and ex3 where the degree of heterogeneity in both fields is substantial differences in piezometric coverage over the study domain also affect the accuracy of reconstructions in fig 7ghi where the area better covered by more wells is better mapped this impact of data coverage is also confirmed by the results for 16 observation wells as shown in table 2 with an apparent dependence of reconstruction quality on the input data density as mentioned before it is well known that the effectiveness of an inversion algorithm in imaging heterogeneities in the subsurface depends on the ability of the data to cover these heterogeneities more often than not data sparsity makes reconstruction difficult and results in solution uncertainty ren and kalscheuer 2020 liu et al 2017 tarantola 2005 in this test we attempt to determine two tomograms with 2024 coordinates 2 32 32 from only 100 measurement points 4 25 the problem is thus highly underdetermined with a relatively low input output data rate of about 5 although multi interval temporal measurement can improve the data coverage which are sometimes redundant and cannot completely solve the space constraint issue 3 4 effect of observation uncertainty noise is an inherent component of any field measurement and assessing the noise effect on the inversion result is a crucial element in determining model uncertainty for this analysis we contaminate the hydraulic head data with variable order gaussian random noise with standard deviations of 5 10 and 25 of the hydraulic head amplitude the trained neural network then evaluates 10 000 sets of contaminated data whose average metrics are shown in table 2 and fig 9 the results from input data with different levels of noise show a clear impact of noise on the output reconstructions of the neural network with the mapping quality deteriorating as the noise level increases the impact is initially confirmed by the representative models with a noise level of 5 in fig 8 which remains the likely noise amplitude for hydraulic measurements here the reconstructions are evaluated with contaminated measurements and compared with the truth model of both fields the impact extent then appears limited when the features of the transmissivity and storativity fields are correctly reconstructed despite the noise mapping bias due to noise is then not apparent when comparing the reconstructed maps with the uncontaminated data in fig 4 and the contaminated data in fig 8 this noise resistance is related to the working mechanism of convolutional layers in the proposed architecture where the processing of hydraulic data in these layers is operated by filters that perform region wise sampling over the entire input maps such information extraction on the basis of neighboring points minimizes the potential abrupt noise at certain points and thus reduces the uncertainty of interpretation which has been confirmed in other work jardani et al 2022 vu and jardani 2021 wu and lin 2018 however the mechanism does not seem to work effectively in the presence of high noise since the output accuracy drops significantly when the noise level exceeds 10 and 25 on the one hand the noise in these situations is sufficiently high to deform the input maps completely which is beyond the ability of convolutional layers to limit the damage see table 2 and fig 9 on the other hand this random noise also degrades the time evolution of the hydraulic signal and eventually accumulates errors in the input maps in short the network exhibits some resilience to a certain range of noise although excessive noise can lead to significant degradation of the resulting maps to summarize the accuracy metrics for the test dataset from the previous discussions are grouped in fig 9 for histograms and in table 2 for average ranges 3 5 influence of features in training models the algorithm used in this paper is primarily based on a learning process that employs a database synthetically constructed as a priori information some choices on the nature of features in the hydraulic property fields have been made to reflect the known conditions of the water system under study e g following gaussian distribution in this study indeed we reintroduce an essential element of an inverse problem the a priori model which is generally used to constrain the inversion solving is critical to find a realistic solution and to avoid the problem of non unity therefore when analyzing the performance of a deep learning algorithm evaluating significance of the a priori model is of interest to identify its applicability limit and generalization degree to get a better idea about the limit and effectiveness of the proposed approach in this part the trained network in case c0 is recalled interpreting three test cases of which the features differ from those predefined in the training database in the first case d1 transmissivity and storativity have a binary distribution see fig 10 the trained network is able to provide an accurate representation of the transmissivity field however in the case of the storativity map some minor artifacts appear in the reconstruction as the discrepancies between the regions of the two tomograms are somewhat less clear this reflects the impact of the nature of the trained models which are gaussian with continuous distributions that disagree with the target maps in the second case the model also exhibits binary heterogeneity with a geochannel crossing the domain diagonally the prediction effectively reconstructs the location and shape of the target channel but the a priori information of the training model also impacts the reconstruction by the presence of some artifacts which are then minor in the last test d3 the network aims to detect a circular anomaly in both transmissivity and storativity two small anomalies are located in different places in the transmissivity and storativity models the trained network succeeds in detecting the anomalies with some tolerance in terms of shape and values finally although this trained network learns with generated patterns by geostatistical models the proposed architecture has proven its ability to reconstruct various patterns that deviate from the learned features the extensive generalization of the proposed network roots from an abundance of heterogeneity in the learning models which are generated from variograms with widely varying parameters this property is indeed a key feature of any data driven model that also works for a single task architecture as described in the literature e g vu and jardani 2021 2022 however in any case the selection of learning models must be based on a priori information from other hydro geo physical investigations on the studied area a favorable generalization of this algorithm yet offers a possibility to train from a database with a wide range of features which should be helpful to handle uncertain in the a priori information jardani et al 2022 3 6 comparison with conventional gauss newton algorithm in order to test the effectiveness of the new method against a conventional inversion method in this section we perform a simultaneous inversion of the transmissivity and storativity fields using the gauss newton algorithm both fields are assumed to be independent and to follow the predefined gaussian distributions with a variogram used as an a priori constraint of the database the algorithm is formulated to minimize the following objective function 13 l f m t m s h obs t f m t m s h obs α 1 m t m t t g 1 m t m t α 2 m s m s t m 1 m s m s where m t and m s are parameter vectors of logarithm transmissivity and storativity respectively while their corresponding prior values m t and m s are the mean of fields f is the forward problem and h obs are observed hydraulic head data g and m are the parameter covariance matrices of transmissivity and storativity respectively α1 and α2 are the regularization coefficients in this test get a value of 0 05 thus the parameter fields m t and m s are determined on the basis of an iterative minimization of the function 13 in which both fields are proposed tested and modified at each step until the convergence state for the transmissivity 14a m t k 1 m t k β 1 δ m t with 14b δ m t j t t j t α 1 g 1 1 j t t h obs f m t m s 14c j t f m t and for the storativity field 15a m s k 1 m s k β 2 δ m s 15b with δ m s j s t j s α 2 m 1 1 j s t h obs f m t m s 15c j s f m s where β1 β2 are the scalars determined by a line search at each step to speed up the minimization process j t and j s are jacobian matrices for the transmissivity and storativity fields respectively which are computed with classical finite difference method however can also be derived using the adjoint state method to reduce computation time this inversion algorithm is applied to solve three representative examples in fig 4 where the prior information for both fields recall the mean and covariance matrix used in generating the true distributions the measurements used for the inversion are the same as those for the neural network described above from the monitoring system with four pumping injection tests and 49 observation wells the solver employs the same computer as for training the proposed neural network with a multicore cpu running on 12 processors each inference takes about 2 days and the resulting inversion for three cases are illustrated in fig 11 overall the conventional inversion method yields comparable results to the neural network although a detailed analysis reveals some differences between the two the reconstruction quality relies on the selection of variogram parameters in the regularization conditions where changing in the selection can reduce the mapping accuracy to a half however stepwise processing in a conventional approach provides an opportunity to intervene during optimization to adjust or improve the final solution with various considerations which differs from an end to end deep learning operator further differences have been also described extensively in jardani et al 2022 between the gauss newton and the deep learning algorithm with a cnn concept in terms of computation time computing jacobi matrices using the difference method typically requires a massive and tedious repetition of the previous problem solution for example in our scenario each jacobi computation requires the use of 32 32 direct solvers at each solution step in addition each inversion process often involves dozens of iterations which is equivalent to generating the entire training data set in contrast jacobian matrices can be solved within minutes using the adjoint state method but it is a much more complex procedure especially in the time domain sun and yeh 1990 with such approach operating a gauss newton algorithm becomes faster other equivalent versions of gauss newton such as the principal component geostatistical approach pcga in which the jacobian matrix is introduced as a multiplication by a vector significantly reduce the optimization time kitanidis and lee 2014 thus inference in a neural network can be superior in terms of time and computational cost only when compared to the classical gauss newton method using a finite difference approach on a highly discretized domain in general the gauss newton algorithm can be executed in a reasonable amount of time compared to a statistical learning algorithm where the construction of a training database remains a cumbersome task gauss newton is a deterministic algorithm in which the resulting solution is a local minimum that depends on the initial model with which the optimization begins in general the prior model is used as the initial model but if this model is uncertain the computation may take a long time or even not lead to convergence deep learning algorithms are otherwise considered as global optimizers and their solutions hence do not depend on a given initial model hornik et al 1989 however both algorithms share a dependence on the a priori model while the conventional model is formalized in an objective function to be optimized with a deterministic algorithm the deep learning algorithm relies on featuring the database therefore deterministic algorithms must have a differential form which is not the case with deep learning algorithms as they offer more possibilities for a priori models even with a complex form jardani et al 2022 in this case for example a wide range of variograms is used to generate a database with a high degree of pattern diversity in order to achieve generalization of the trained network such a strategy allows to handle the uncertainty of a priori model in the dl algorithms however this uncertainty is complex to include in a deterministic algorithm which is often tied with a fixed a priori model where the uncertainty in turn affects the quality of reconstructions as shown in fig 11 for the result obtained with a gauss newton algorithm the reconstruction quality varies from one case to another depending on how close the a priori conditions are to the truth 4 conclusion in this paper we introduce a deep learning approach to map transmissivity and storativity fields from hydraulic heads measured during pumping injection tests this mapping directly approximates the inversion operator using a neural network with a multi task structure to perform multiple tasks the proposed network interconnects two single task convolutional neural networks with encoder decoder structure based on segnet architecture which maps two tomograms at the outcome the key technique for building the multi task network is to share hierarchical features between task processings that enhances the resulting transmissivity and storativity reconstructions even the two fields transmissivity and storativity may be independent their information is both embedded in the measured hydraulic heads with a complex interaction between the two in driving the hydraulic dynamics however by exploiting the similarity and contrast between the shared information of the tasks the multitask learning filters out the interaction thus improves the reconstruction quality of both fields the network interconnection can also act as a data augmentation leading to an improvement of the reconstruction generalization in each task at the same time this strategy preserves the specific information of each field by separating the process in the decoder part of both networks with minimal learnable parameters the proposed network is efficient in terms of memory and inference processing time since this learning process adopts a single unified loss function for both reconstructions yet it can be effectively trained with a standard gradient descent technique this new network is trained with a large synthetic database where aquifer properties are randomly generated using geostatistical variograms to provide models with different degrees of heterogeneity that ensures generalization of the network these transmissivity and storativity models are used in solving the groundwater flow equation to obtain numerical piezometric responses which are the input for training the network with two outcome fields the yielding reconstructions of the multi task network on the test models proved the effectiveness of multitask learning which outperforms the single task neural networks with 10 higher accuracy for both tomograms the performance of the trained architecture is then analyzed by considering different situations that may arise in real applications such as the scarcity of piezometric data the alteration by noises and uncertainties related to the a priori model used to generate the training models in this analysis the accuracy of neural network reconstructions shows a clear dependence on data coverage insufficient coverage often leads to a smooth interpretation of the fields as the small volume of data does not capture the full complexity of the aquifer indeed the dependence of inversion quality on data resolution is a common problem in inversion which is independent of the optimization tool used the proposed architecture also exhibits some resilience to data noise since the process is based on feature extraction from the input image an important advantage of the convolutional neural network the effectiveness of deep learning inversion is then tested for cases where the binary spatial distribution of the t and s fields deviates from the gaussian distribution used to generate the database as the network correctly identifies the main features of both fields the proposed approach proves its broad generalization in detecting even some unlearned features however to achieve this generalization a large training database is required which can be time consuming to build concerning the comparison of our network with the classical deterministic gauss newton method four main points can be drawn the first is that the deep learning algorithm can be considered as a global optimizer of which the result is independent of the initial model that is not the case for gauss newton algorithms second both methods share a strong dependence on the a priori model where a complementary information is required with the piezometric data to assist the algorithm in finding realistic models of the subsurface as in most cases measurement data alone are not sufficient to reveal the complexity of environments under study however the way introducing this a priori model in a deep learning algorithm is totally different from a gauss newton method in a gauss newton algorithm the a priori information is introduced into the objective function in the form of derivable and quadratic terms whereas a deep learning approach includes a priori constraints when generating database for the training process without requiring an a priori model in derivable form a deep learning algorithm can otherwise offer an advantage of including uncertainties of a priori conditions into the inversion when the construction of the database is built with a wide range of features to cover a variety of a priori conditions the trained network thus can gain a better generalization the third point is sensitivity to noise a deep learning algorithm minimizes the impact of data noise on the result maps thanks to the convolutional operation which processes the data image on a region wise basis as opposed to deterministic algorithms based on every data point the last point concerns the computation time building a deep learning algorithm is more computationally intensive than a gauss newton method when the generation of database often requires computing the forward problem for thousands of times however this becomes very interesting when the gauss newton code adopts a finite difference method to compute the jacobian matrix for a large number of unknowns which would also be extremely heavy these pros and cons of both methods should be further validated in light of a real dataset which should be the objective of future work credit authorship contribution

3076,in this paper we present a novel method to simultaneously map transmissivity and storativity in a heterogenous aquifer using a multitask convolutional neural network this coupled inversion algorithm translates transient hydraulic head data from pumping tests into two independent tomography of transmissivity and storativity in a two dimensional problem based on the segnet architecture the multitask neural network provides an effective solution with minimal weights and biases works as an end to end operator that directly approximates the inverse function multiple sharing mechanisms enable the multitasking approach to outperform single task models by 10 accuracy application to synthetic experiments shows that the quality of inverted maps relies on the complexity level of heterogeneity in the hydraulic fields mapping accuracy also depends on the data coverage but being resistant to data noise due to the featuring mechanism in the convolutional network adopted comparison with conventional inversion method reveals that the deep learning approach provides better generalization in the inversion while performing each inference on the order of milliseconds without further calibration from users keywords neural network multi task groundwater inversion transmissivity storativity data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction understanding flow and contaminant transport mechanisms in water reservoirs requires reliable assessments of the spatial patterns of hydrogeologic properties including hydraulic transmissivity and specific storage coefficient fitts 2012 şen 2015 methods for evaluating these parameters include hydraulic tomography which involves the acquisition and analysis of multiple piezometric responses associated with multiple pumping tests conducted sequentially hydraulic tomography analysis often involves a joint interpretation of all hydraulic head measurements in which the inversion approach is used to find the best transmissivity and storativity fields in terms of numerical fitting of the hydraulic measurements e g berg and illman 2015 castagna et al 2011 franssen et al 1999 the inverse problem is by nature ill posed and requires additional so called a priori information about the properties of the unknown hydraulic parameters to narrow the field of possibilities and arrive at a solution that satisfies both the measured data and a priori data criteria this ill posed problem is mainly due to the fact that the measured piezometric data are not sufficient to identify all heterogeneities of the environment tarantola 2005 yeh 1986 among the approaches used to constrain the inverse problem is the geostatistical approach in which the statistical properties mean and covariance of the target field are included in the optimization process as known parameters to regulate probability distributions of transmissivity and storativity tarantola 2005 in optimization deterministic algorithms such as gauss newton or conjugate gradient are usually applied to access a local minimum in handling the hydraulic tomography inversion the algorithms can incorporate a large dimension by computing the sensitivity of all measured values with respect to a small parameter variation at each unknown transmissivity and storativity parameter assigned to the discretized cell of the study area this computation can be effectively performed using an adjoint state formulation sun and yeh 1990 where an adjoint partial differential equation system further needs to solve for each observation point however in the transient mode the inversion of hydraulic tomography becomes more complex as the optimization aims to determine the spatial variabilities of both the transmissivity and storativity variables from a time recorded hydraulic head data set under these conditions the number of parameters increases making the problem more ill posed and underdetermined in practice tarantola 2005 mclaughlin and townley 1996 in this study we develop a deep learning algorithm based on the concept of convolutional neural networks to directly approximate the inverse function a function that performs an end to end operator to interpret the input hydraulic data as an image into multiple output hydraulic tomographies the transmissivity and the storativity a neural network uses multiple linear and nonlinear operators executed sequentially on hidden layers involving multiple multidimensional coefficients this high dimensional parameter system allows us to efficiently reconstruct the highly nonlinear inverse operator in our problem hornik et al 1989 the coefficients are derived via an optimization process known as the learning task this learning task consists of determining the coefficients that process the input maps to match the corresponding output maps both of which are stored in the database recent advances in learning algorithms have helped facilitate this optimization while most of the effort has been devoted to building a generalized database schmidt et al 2019 wani et al 2019 since the hydraulic tomography database can only be built based on a theoretical approach in this approach we generate thousands of transmissivity and storativity fields that are used to numerically generate the piezometric responses related to the pumping tests the entire dataset is thus used to build a network linking the piezometric responses and the hydraulic properties fields such deep learning algorithms are becoming an essential modeling tool in many fields including the geosciences thanks to the development of new networks such as convolutional neural networks the introduction of convolutional neural networks cnns has offered an efficient alternative to solve complex image processing problems such as tomography which are common in geophysical hydrogeological or remote sensing applications their effectiveness lies in convolutional computation which consists in extracting the main feature of the input images by scanning them with a small shared filter to reconstruct the output image processing only the main feature with small filters makes the computation more flexible and facilitates learning in the training phase cnns are typically formed as a multi layer architecture with interconnection schemes to make the network more efficient in handling complex tasks albawi et al 2017 among them the encoder decoder networks such as segnet badrinarayanan et al 2017 and unet ronneberger et al 2015 have been effectively applied in various tomography tasks in geosciences in seismic studies cnn networks have been used to reconstruct the spatial velocity of geological structures by inputting seismogram images into the networks zhao 2018 zhang and lin 2020 yang and ma 2019 moseley et al 2020 they were also adopted to perform 2d or 3d imaging of the subsurface by processing the apparent resistivity data recorded during the electrical resistivity tomography investigations liu et al 2020 vu and jardani 2021 in hydrology the cnn with encoder decoder has been effectively adapted to hydraulic tomography to process hydraulic data associated with pumping tests in reconstructing the transmissivity field in porous aquifers and in delineating the fracture structure in fractured aquifers jardani et al 2022 vu and jardani 2022 within the framework of this topic other cnn architectures were also tested such as the generative adversarial network gan to image hydraulic parameters in 2d or 3d binary models from the inversion of hydraulic data laloy et al 2017 2018 sun 2018 proposed by badrinarayanan et al 2017 for segmentation tasks segnet architecture has been quickly adopted in several applications in geosciences such as the classification of seismic facies hydraulic tomography in the reconstruction of hydraulic transmissivity detection of geochannels and mapping of 3d electrical resistivity pham et al 2018 mukhopadhyay and mallick 2019 vu and jardani 2021 while these works focus in single task networks the architecture proposed in this study attempts to deal with multiple tasks in a joint manner when dealing with a multivariate problem consisting of multiple output variables such as hydraulic tomography where both transmissivity and storativity fields are determined the interpretation of each field can be made independently using a single task neural network in this case each network is trained separately to derive the corresponding single field which can be cumbersome however the issue can be addressed jointly in a single neural network a multi task algorithm multi task learning mtl involves designing a network that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously in which each task benefits from the others through mutual learning the network interconnection can be established at hierarchical levels through which the extracted features are mutually transferred acting as data augmentation during the training process by exploiting the similarity and contrast between mutual features mtl based strategy promotes the generalization efficiency and accuracy of each task zhang and yang 2017 ruder 2017 the effectiveness of mtl networks has been recently studied especially in image processing and text translation zhang and yang 2017 liu et al 2016 however their application in geosciences is still limited and at an early stage of development in the field of seismic exploration siahsar et al 2017 developed a multi task algorithm to reduce the effects of random noise on seismic data wu et al 2019 suggested a unet based algorithm to detect faults seismic images and seismic normal vectors from training images of synthetic 3d seismic map li et al 2020 used a multitasking neural network to improve the resolution of seismic tomography by pairing an encoder decoder with a dense skip connection structure in this work we develop a multi task architecture to perform hydraulic transimissivity and storativity field reconstructions by analyzing hydraulic head data acquired in pumping experiments which has rarely been discussed and used for inversion problems in hydrogeology the proposed neural network consists of two encoder decoder structures both of which map transmissivity or storativity fields from temporal measurements of piezometric level related to pumping tests both architectures are based on segnet which is known for its ability to identify objects learned from images through segmentations with low computational cost compared to other autoencoders badrinarayanan et al 2017 in order to enhance the performance of multi task modeling each task element is previously optimized and then interconnected at multiple hierarchical levels this study which focuses on the ability of developing an mtl network to perform inversion tasks mapping hydraulic properties of aquifers from hydraulic data will be organized into 4 sections section 2 is dedicated to describing the theoretical background including groundwater modeling solving the inversion problem with the multitask network and its application to a synthetic case section 3 focuses on evaluating the performance of the trained network and the impact of various probable conditions including the quality and quantity of the trained data section 4 provides a comparison with a conventional least square inversion method outlining the differences between the two methods and their impact on prediction accuracy finally we conclude the paper with the main results discussions and an outlook on future work 2 methodology in this section we begin by summarizing the theoretical concept of groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer often referred to as the forward problem to numerically simulate hydraulic responses to pumping tests in this approach the forward problem is applied to form the training data that will be used to train the multi task networks that will be described later 2 1 forward problem groundwater modelling the horizontal groundwater flow in a 2d confined aquifer is governed by bear 1972 1a s h t t h q δ x subjected to the following boundary conditions 1b h h d a t γ d where h m is the hydraulic head t m2 s is the transmissivity s is the storage coefficient q m2 s is a sink source at the well location x and a constant hydraulic head hd is imposed as a boundary condition on the far away boundary γd solving the forward problem with heterogeneous distributions of hydraulic parameters can be done only by a numerical method such as the finite element method the solution involves in determining the spatio temporal distribution of the hydraulic load related to a water withdrawal imposed on the borehole by introducing the hydraulic properties of the aquifer and the boundary conditions solving the flow equations in this work is carried out using comsol software comsol multiphysics to create a database for training the neural network in fact the database consists of thousands of t and s fields randomly generated with characteristics regularized by a priori information such an a priori model usually constrains the inverse problem to avoid non uniqueness in optimization is recalled here in the machine learning algorithm to form the generation of training database as geostatistical constraint is one of the most common methods in the inversion of hydraulic tomography it is employed here to generate the fields of hydraulic properties while the corresponding hydrological responses are obtained from computing the forward problem 2 2 inversion problem hydraulic tomography from gw level measurements the forward problem from the previous section can be reformulated as follows 2 h f s t where h represents the hydraulic head data f denotes the forward operator and s t are the storativity and transmissivity fields in practice however the goal of a hydrogeological investigation is usually to map the parameter field from the observed data 3 s t f 1 h to estimate the parameter fields s t from a set of measurements a conventional inversion solver attempts to fit the given h by iteratively adjusting s t through an optimization process 4 s t a r g m i n h f s t g s t where s t denotes the estimated variable field s t in each step while g represents the regularization terms in this work however we design a neural network to directly approximate the operator inverse problem that linking the hydraulic head data and aquifer properties with the use of a training database then the approximation of this inverted function can be formulated as follows 5 f 1 ψ θ where ψ represents the neural network consisting of successive linear nonlinear operators the layers with a set of parameters θ thus ψ acts as an end to end function that directly reconstructs the storativity and transmissivity fields from a given measurement of h 6 s t f 1 h θ ψ h θ determination of network parameters θ implied in various linear and nonlinear operations in the networks is performed by a training process in which these parameters are chosen so that the network reproduces the models of the training data through optimizing the following loss function 7 θ a r g m i n s t i ψ h i θ where s t i denotes a model and its corresponding hydraulic head measurement h i obtained from solving the forward problem hydraulic parameter field reconstructions rely primarily on the training database building this database is hence the most critical task in this deep learning approach since a large database often promotes the accuracy of the network outcome the database contains a large number of models which requires a computational effort as a direct solution but also as a black box it is not involved in further computations of a sensitivity matrix as is the case with deterministic algorithms once trained however the neural network inverts the hydraulic parameters immediately and straightforwardly 2 3 multi task architecture in this work we develop a convolutional neural network based on the segnet architecture that can interpret the measurement of hydraulic head at the input into the mapping of storativity and transmissivity fields at the output segnet is a autoencoder neural network that has been proven to effectively capture the features embedded in live video under real world and complex circumstances originally segnet was designed for identifying trafict object but here the architecture is redimensioned and adapted into a network that maps two fields of hydraulic properties from temporal images of hydraulic heads captured during pumping tests the proposed multi task architecture then consists of two segnet based networks individually optimized for each task fig 1 each network consists of three encoder decoder pairs entailed with a regression layer at the output to map the corresponding field in each pair the encoder extracts and condenses the key features found in the input images and then transfers them to the next encoder while linking the indices to its decoder this decoder in turn extracts the features from the previous layer and compensates for the loss of resolution due to the condensation process in the encoders by using the indices to prepare the images to have the same resolution as the input images with the adoption of the gateway scheme the accuracy of the resulting reconstruction maps can be significantly improved which is an asset of this type of architectures this segnet network shares some topological similarities in its structure with other common encoder decoder networks such as vgg16 unet however by removing the fully connected layers from vgg16 segnet encoders are significantly smaller and easier to train in practice as the transfer of max pooling indices instead of values between encoders and decoders incurs only a fraction of the cost compared to unet siam et al 2018 thus segnet consists of a much smaller set of trainable parameters than competing architectures and can be determined using standard stochastic gradient descent in fact the total number of trainable parameters in this segnet based multi task architecture is 0 6 m which is significantly smaller than other recent architectures proposed in the literature gao et al 2019 misra et al 2016 therefore forming this small network requires less time and memory making it an ideal candidate for multitasking before building a multitasking network it is necessary to closely examine the structure of the single tasking network to understand how it works and to verify its limitations and advantages in segnet each encoder and its associated decoder are arranged symmetrically to keep the input and output maps the same size the encoding task is based on three operations such as convolution batch normalization and relu performed sequentially on the encoders the convolution calculation consists of scanning the input image with small filters to extract the features formed by the neighboring pixels the resulting maps are then passed and filtered through a batch normalization bn and a rectified linear unit relu before being reduced by a max pooling operation the encoders retain only the most important input information while reducing the dimensionality of the problem thereby lowering computational costs the condensation process at the encoder stage builds low level features and reduces the size of the parameters to be processed to better prevent the overfitting problem on the other hand the decoders unfold the condensed feature maps using an up sampling layer formed with transfer of poolling indices from the encoders then the resulting maps are processed by cn bn and relu to successively translate the features and resize the output to the same resolution as the input understanding the functionality of each part of the network helps in designing an efficient multitasking architecture by choosing the optimal position to ensure information transfer between tasks in the connected network the interest of multi task learning is the establishment of links between different networks performing different tasks during simultaneous learning each task can benefit from the others by sharing information mutual learning serves as a complement of data for the others reducing the risk of overfitting and achieving better generalization moreover both tasks are formalized with a single loss function that sumarizes the objective function of each task in this case each task sees the other as a regularization term ruder 2017 the regularization term acts as a numerical stabilizer in the optimization process that helps to better determine the parameters of the network however one of the main challenges in designing an efficient multi task architecture is determining how to share the features between tasks sharing at different layers often leads to a different feature distribution that can alter the efficiency of one or even all tasks misra et al 2016 multi task architectures usually have a shared trunk between tasks where all tasks have shared layers and task specific layers the first one retrieves the generic features in the shared part of the tasks while the latter handles the task specific features for optimal performance it is recommended to find a compromise between these two parts in an architecture in this aspect a multi task encoder decoder structure with a shared encoder and a task specific decoder seems promising while the encoder focuses on low level cross task feature learning the decoders perform high level feature interpretation to better learn task specific details in practice multi task architectures with an encoder decoder structure have been used in image processing kuga et al 2017 where the output variables share certain characteristics however this is not the case in our application where the two fields transmissivity and storativity are generated independently for this reason information transfer was only established at the decoder level by sharing low level features and the decoder processes very distinct features on the other hand if we assume that the two fields in the output have common characteristics the transfer can be performed both at the encoder and decoder kokkinos 2017 to connect the trunks misra et al 2016 proposed the use of trainable scalars to perform the weighted sum of the features of the two tasks at multiple feature levels by constructing the cross point units these units provide shared representations between the two tasks where their placements are decided in functioning of the dependencies between the tasks instead of trainable scalars gao et al 2019 suggested a fusible style scheme in which the feature maps of multiple tasks are concatenated and their dimensionalities are reduced by 1 1 convolutional layers following their work we use 1 1 convolutional layers to link hierarchical features in which the result of one task is added to another such additional layers are formed with learnable weights that are more flexible and require less memory than concatenation we retain the pooling index sharing mechanism in segnet which is computationally efficient and improves the accuracy of task specific reconstructions thus the new structure combines the linking and bridging mechanisms reduces the number of learned parameters to 0 6 million that can be trained efficiently from a standard gradient descent scheme the training phase aims at estimating the network parameters by optimizing the following objective function which is formulated as a sum of two objective functions for the two tasks 8 l l 1 l 2 9 l 1 j 0 h 1 k 0 w 1 m t j k m t j k and 10 l 2 j 0 h 1 k 0 w 1 m s j k m s j k where m t log 10 t and m t log 10 t with t and t denote for the true and predicted transmissivity h and w are the height and width of the output map m s log 10 s and m s log 10 s with s and s denote for the true and predicted storativity 2 4 hydrogeological model to construct a training database we randomly generate the transmissivity and storativity fields from geostatistical variograms using sgems in matlab remy et al 2009 two generations consist of 43 000 aquifer models where the distributions of log10t and log10s are independent and regulated by gaussian variograms whose mean range and sill parameters are randomly chosen with fixed intervals in detail both fields obey a variogram function γ u s 1 e x p u r but each field is generated independently with the sill s ranging from 0 1 to 1 and the range r varying from 10 to 30 m for the transmissivity field its mean value is randomly selected at each generation from 10 3 to 10 5 m2 s with transmissivity magnitudes ranging from 10 1 to 10 7 m2 s similarly the storativity mean ranges from 10 4 to 10 6 while storativity amplitudes range from 10 2 to 10 8 regarding to the degree of the heterogeneity both fields vary from 1 to 5 orders of magnitude with this method a database is created with different degrees of heterogeneity in a favorable generalization in this study no prior relationship is taken between transmissivity and storativity in the aquifers the parameterized fields of 32 32 cells are assigned to a 50 m 50 m aquifer on which 49 observation wells are regularly installed to measure variations in hydraulic head associated with water injection and extraction over time see fig 2 and table 1 in this study four injection pumping pairs are successively implemented with a flow rate of 10 l s two wells on opposite sides of the domain boundaries help to capture better the effects of aquifer heterogeneity on hydraulic head data in this theoretical study the hydraulic head data are numerically solved from the forward problem as described in section 2 the training database thus consists of transmissivity 32 32 1 and storativity 32 32 1 fields as the outputs and their hydraulic head responses collected with 49 wells at 10 timesteps in 2 min to construct an input of the same size as the output we use the nearest neighbor spatial interpolation algorithm to form piezometric variation maps with 32 32 cells for each timestep ultimately the input data for each model is organized as a multi channel matrix with 32 32 40 as the dimension where the depth 40 is derived from the number of injection pumping tests multiplied by the number of observations over time 3 results and discussion this section focuses on analyzing the results and some interferences that control the reconstruction quality with a multi task network such as the size of the training data the level of noise in the hydraulic head data and the characteristics of hydraulic property fields when generating the data for learning we also devote this section to include comparisons of the reconstruction accuracy from the proposed multi task network versus those from the simple networks and the classical gauss newton method 3 1 learning process and results to train the network we randomly select 30 000 models with the corresponding hydraulic data and another 3000 models for validation case c0 the training process is performed in matlab using the adam optimization algorithm with a constant learning rate of 0 001 and a batch size of 128 the training process is manually interrupted at epoch 227 to avoid overfitting and lasts 21 h on an nvidia quadro k2200 gpu in a dell precision tower 5810 the evolution of the objective function during the training is detailed in fig 3 to quantitively validate the resulting maps with the trained network we use the coefficient of determination and the root mean square deviation which are defined as follows 11a r t 2 1 ssr t sst t 11b r s 2 1 ssr s sst s 12a rmse t 1 n m t true m t pred 2 n 12b rmse s 1 n m s true m s pred 2 n where ssr t 1 n m t true m t pred 2 and sst t 1 n m t true m t true with m t true and m t pred are the true and predicted log10t while m t true is the mean of the true log10t field n denotes the number of pixel 32 32 similar definitions for the metrics related to the storativity field s to evaluate the effectiveness of the trained network we perform the test for 10 000 models that were not used in the learning phase in this test the network takes only 0 006 s to perform an interpretation of the simultaneous transmissivity and storativity tomography reconstructions of the entire test dataset yield average rmse and r2 values for the transmissivity models of 0 22 and 0 85 respectively while the corresponding values for the storativity models are 0 33 and 0 63 the network appears to reconstruct transmissivity more accurately than the storativity field this difference is due to the fact that storativity has less influence on the flow field in the aquifer especially at steady state during the pumping test to summarize the reconstruction accuracy for the test data set is presented in table 2 while its histogram is collected in fig 7 to examine the quality of reconstructed maps in detail three representative examples with different degrees of heterogeneity are selected and shown in fig 4 in which the trained model maps transmissivity and storativity from the measured hydraulic heads which are then compared with the real models to evaluate the reconstruction accuracy generally the proposed architecture successfully reconstructs the main heterogeneities of transmissivity and storativity fields the quality of the reconstruction also exposes a dependence on the complexity of the target maps in the case of ex1 where both fields have smooth distributions the network effectively detects their features including structure and magnitude in the case of ex2 although the transmissivity is well reconstructed the strong heterogeneity in the storativity field is only mapped with some smoothness since only the overall pattern is detected similarly ex3 is characterized by the presence of small heterogeneities that make their reconstruction a challenge for the process these high heterogeneities are thus captured with smoothness indeed the issue is a common challenge for all inversion methods where the reconstruction of complex distributions depends on the density of the data demanding a high resolution to enable capturing the fine details jardani et al 2022 ren and kalscheuer 2020 liu et al 2018 3 2 effect of multi task learning to further evaluate the effectiveness of multi task learning we compare the results of the trained multi task architecture with single task networks while a single task network translates hydraulic head data into transmissivity and storativity maps but by two separate networks case c1 as described in section 2 3 for a multi tasking design the multi task architecture is achieved by adding the interconnections between two single task networks thus the difference between the single task and multi task networks is only in the connection layers that are absent in the single task network we train the single task network using the same hyperparameters and data set as for the multi task architecture the trained networks are then tested on the same test dataset of 10 000 unseen models whose overall metrics are summarized in table 2 and fig 9 validation of the single task network on all test models yields an average rmse and r2 for the transmissivity reconstructions of 0 25 and 0 81 while the corresponding storativity reconstructions are 0 37 and 0 56 the results of single task networks are indeed encouraging and competitive as they are smaller thus trained more quickly with fewer computational resources however the multitask networks offers more accuracy with a 10 higher r2 and 10 lower rmse for both reconstructed tomograms this leverage is confirmed by analyzing of the resulting reconstructions of representative examples performed by the single task networks in fig 5 in which the reconstructions for the same representative samples are made and compared with the truth models the reconstructions for both fields with the single task networks are relatively less accurate than those obtained with the multi task network indeed the reconstruction of ex1 with the single tasks is satisfactory but the advantage always comes with outcome maps from the multi task architecture the advantage is more highlighted when applying the multi task network to complex heterogeneities that appear in ex2 and ex3 the trained multi task excels in capturing these heterogeneities compared to the single task networks where the reconstructions were found to be less accurate as explained in section 2 3 in multi task learning each task augments the input and regularizes the unified loss function making the network more effective to capture details embedded in a complex environment a similar conclusion has been drawn in the literature with applications of multitask networks in image processing horwath et al 2020 koziarski and cyganek 2018 shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 3 3 effect of number of observation points regardless of the optimization algorithms used the reconstruction accuracy in an inverse problem is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the measurements employed in this inversion in this section we examine how the quantity of hydraulic head data affects the reconstruction accuracy with the multi task network to this end we compare the reconstructions from hydraulic head acquisition in three different configurations of observation wells the first configuration represents a dense coverage with 49 wells from which the testing reconstructions are presented beforehand in fig 4 the second with only half of the original configuration 25 wells in fig 6 and the last with 16 wells the hydraulic head data retrieved with the new arrangements of observation wells are employed in the interpolation process to create input images for training for each configuration the multi task network is then trained with corresponding altered databases to optimize the network performance and the resulting reconstructions for the test models are presented in the table 2 and fig 9 overall the number of observation points determines the reconstruction accuracy in fact the reduction of piezometric data leads to a degradation of the information described in the hydraulic level maps which in turn leads to a significant reduction of the network effectiveness in predicting transmissivity and storativity fields this effect is even clearly visible especially when the aquifer properties are highly heterogeneous as shown in fig 7 for the representative samples where the reconstructions are performed using the coarse dataset and compared with the true ground models for coarse features in ex1 the neural network can reliably grasp the key features in both maps with some smoothing in the range of values however the trained network fails to reconstruct the finer details in ex2 and ex3 where the degree of heterogeneity in both fields is substantial differences in piezometric coverage over the study domain also affect the accuracy of reconstructions in fig 7ghi where the area better covered by more wells is better mapped this impact of data coverage is also confirmed by the results for 16 observation wells as shown in table 2 with an apparent dependence of reconstruction quality on the input data density as mentioned before it is well known that the effectiveness of an inversion algorithm in imaging heterogeneities in the subsurface depends on the ability of the data to cover these heterogeneities more often than not data sparsity makes reconstruction difficult and results in solution uncertainty ren and kalscheuer 2020 liu et al 2017 tarantola 2005 in this test we attempt to determine two tomograms with 2024 coordinates 2 32 32 from only 100 measurement points 4 25 the problem is thus highly underdetermined with a relatively low input output data rate of about 5 although multi interval temporal measurement can improve the data coverage which are sometimes redundant and cannot completely solve the space constraint issue 3 4 effect of observation uncertainty noise is an inherent component of any field measurement and assessing the noise effect on the inversion result is a crucial element in determining model uncertainty for this analysis we contaminate the hydraulic head data with variable order gaussian random noise with standard deviations of 5 10 and 25 of the hydraulic head amplitude the trained neural network then evaluates 10 000 sets of contaminated data whose average metrics are shown in table 2 and fig 9 the results from input data with different levels of noise show a clear impact of noise on the output reconstructions of the neural network with the mapping quality deteriorating as the noise level increases the impact is initially confirmed by the representative models with a noise level of 5 in fig 8 which remains the likely noise amplitude for hydraulic measurements here the reconstructions are evaluated with contaminated measurements and compared with the truth model of both fields the impact extent then appears limited when the features of the transmissivity and storativity fields are correctly reconstructed despite the noise mapping bias due to noise is then not apparent when comparing the reconstructed maps with the uncontaminated data in fig 4 and the contaminated data in fig 8 this noise resistance is related to the working mechanism of convolutional layers in the proposed architecture where the processing of hydraulic data in these layers is operated by filters that perform region wise sampling over the entire input maps such information extraction on the basis of neighboring points minimizes the potential abrupt noise at certain points and thus reduces the uncertainty of interpretation which has been confirmed in other work jardani et al 2022 vu and jardani 2021 wu and lin 2018 however the mechanism does not seem to work effectively in the presence of high noise since the output accuracy drops significantly when the noise level exceeds 10 and 25 on the one hand the noise in these situations is sufficiently high to deform the input maps completely which is beyond the ability of convolutional layers to limit the damage see table 2 and fig 9 on the other hand this random noise also degrades the time evolution of the hydraulic signal and eventually accumulates errors in the input maps in short the network exhibits some resilience to a certain range of noise although excessive noise can lead to significant degradation of the resulting maps to summarize the accuracy metrics for the test dataset from the previous discussions are grouped in fig 9 for histograms and in table 2 for average ranges 3 5 influence of features in training models the algorithm used in this paper is primarily based on a learning process that employs a database synthetically constructed as a priori information some choices on the nature of features in the hydraulic property fields have been made to reflect the known conditions of the water system under study e g following gaussian distribution in this study indeed we reintroduce an essential element of an inverse problem the a priori model which is generally used to constrain the inversion solving is critical to find a realistic solution and to avoid the problem of non unity therefore when analyzing the performance of a deep learning algorithm evaluating significance of the a priori model is of interest to identify its applicability limit and generalization degree to get a better idea about the limit and effectiveness of the proposed approach in this part the trained network in case c0 is recalled interpreting three test cases of which the features differ from those predefined in the training database in the first case d1 transmissivity and storativity have a binary distribution see fig 10 the trained network is able to provide an accurate representation of the transmissivity field however in the case of the storativity map some minor artifacts appear in the reconstruction as the discrepancies between the regions of the two tomograms are somewhat less clear this reflects the impact of the nature of the trained models which are gaussian with continuous distributions that disagree with the target maps in the second case the model also exhibits binary heterogeneity with a geochannel crossing the domain diagonally the prediction effectively reconstructs the location and shape of the target channel but the a priori information of the training model also impacts the reconstruction by the presence of some artifacts which are then minor in the last test d3 the network aims to detect a circular anomaly in both transmissivity and storativity two small anomalies are located in different places in the transmissivity and storativity models the trained network succeeds in detecting the anomalies with some tolerance in terms of shape and values finally although this trained network learns with generated patterns by geostatistical models the proposed architecture has proven its ability to reconstruct various patterns that deviate from the learned features the extensive generalization of the proposed network roots from an abundance of heterogeneity in the learning models which are generated from variograms with widely varying parameters this property is indeed a key feature of any data driven model that also works for a single task architecture as described in the literature e g vu and jardani 2021 2022 however in any case the selection of learning models must be based on a priori information from other hydro geo physical investigations on the studied area a favorable generalization of this algorithm yet offers a possibility to train from a database with a wide range of features which should be helpful to handle uncertain in the a priori information jardani et al 2022 3 6 comparison with conventional gauss newton algorithm in order to test the effectiveness of the new method against a conventional inversion method in this section we perform a simultaneous inversion of the transmissivity and storativity fields using the gauss newton algorithm both fields are assumed to be independent and to follow the predefined gaussian distributions with a variogram used as an a priori constraint of the database the algorithm is formulated to minimize the following objective function 13 l f m t m s h obs t f m t m s h obs α 1 m t m t t g 1 m t m t α 2 m s m s t m 1 m s m s where m t and m s are parameter vectors of logarithm transmissivity and storativity respectively while their corresponding prior values m t and m s are the mean of fields f is the forward problem and h obs are observed hydraulic head data g and m are the parameter covariance matrices of transmissivity and storativity respectively α1 and α2 are the regularization coefficients in this test get a value of 0 05 thus the parameter fields m t and m s are determined on the basis of an iterative minimization of the function 13 in which both fields are proposed tested and modified at each step until the convergence state for the transmissivity 14a m t k 1 m t k β 1 δ m t with 14b δ m t j t t j t α 1 g 1 1 j t t h obs f m t m s 14c j t f m t and for the storativity field 15a m s k 1 m s k β 2 δ m s 15b with δ m s j s t j s α 2 m 1 1 j s t h obs f m t m s 15c j s f m s where β1 β2 are the scalars determined by a line search at each step to speed up the minimization process j t and j s are jacobian matrices for the transmissivity and storativity fields respectively which are computed with classical finite difference method however can also be derived using the adjoint state method to reduce computation time this inversion algorithm is applied to solve three representative examples in fig 4 where the prior information for both fields recall the mean and covariance matrix used in generating the true distributions the measurements used for the inversion are the same as those for the neural network described above from the monitoring system with four pumping injection tests and 49 observation wells the solver employs the same computer as for training the proposed neural network with a multicore cpu running on 12 processors each inference takes about 2 days and the resulting inversion for three cases are illustrated in fig 11 overall the conventional inversion method yields comparable results to the neural network although a detailed analysis reveals some differences between the two the reconstruction quality relies on the selection of variogram parameters in the regularization conditions where changing in the selection can reduce the mapping accuracy to a half however stepwise processing in a conventional approach provides an opportunity to intervene during optimization to adjust or improve the final solution with various considerations which differs from an end to end deep learning operator further differences have been also described extensively in jardani et al 2022 between the gauss newton and the deep learning algorithm with a cnn concept in terms of computation time computing jacobi matrices using the difference method typically requires a massive and tedious repetition of the previous problem solution for example in our scenario each jacobi computation requires the use of 32 32 direct solvers at each solution step in addition each inversion process often involves dozens of iterations which is equivalent to generating the entire training data set in contrast jacobian matrices can be solved within minutes using the adjoint state method but it is a much more complex procedure especially in the time domain sun and yeh 1990 with such approach operating a gauss newton algorithm becomes faster other equivalent versions of gauss newton such as the principal component geostatistical approach pcga in which the jacobian matrix is introduced as a multiplication by a vector significantly reduce the optimization time kitanidis and lee 2014 thus inference in a neural network can be superior in terms of time and computational cost only when compared to the classical gauss newton method using a finite difference approach on a highly discretized domain in general the gauss newton algorithm can be executed in a reasonable amount of time compared to a statistical learning algorithm where the construction of a training database remains a cumbersome task gauss newton is a deterministic algorithm in which the resulting solution is a local minimum that depends on the initial model with which the optimization begins in general the prior model is used as the initial model but if this model is uncertain the computation may take a long time or even not lead to convergence deep learning algorithms are otherwise considered as global optimizers and their solutions hence do not depend on a given initial model hornik et al 1989 however both algorithms share a dependence on the a priori model while the conventional model is formalized in an objective function to be optimized with a deterministic algorithm the deep learning algorithm relies on featuring the database therefore deterministic algorithms must have a differential form which is not the case with deep learning algorithms as they offer more possibilities for a priori models even with a complex form jardani et al 2022 in this case for example a wide range of variograms is used to generate a database with a high degree of pattern diversity in order to achieve generalization of the trained network such a strategy allows to handle the uncertainty of a priori model in the dl algorithms however this uncertainty is complex to include in a deterministic algorithm which is often tied with a fixed a priori model where the uncertainty in turn affects the quality of reconstructions as shown in fig 11 for the result obtained with a gauss newton algorithm the reconstruction quality varies from one case to another depending on how close the a priori conditions are to the truth 4 conclusion in this paper we introduce a deep learning approach to map transmissivity and storativity fields from hydraulic heads measured during pumping injection tests this mapping directly approximates the inversion operator using a neural network with a multi task structure to perform multiple tasks the proposed network interconnects two single task convolutional neural networks with encoder decoder structure based on segnet architecture which maps two tomograms at the outcome the key technique for building the multi task network is to share hierarchical features between task processings that enhances the resulting transmissivity and storativity reconstructions even the two fields transmissivity and storativity may be independent their information is both embedded in the measured hydraulic heads with a complex interaction between the two in driving the hydraulic dynamics however by exploiting the similarity and contrast between the shared information of the tasks the multitask learning filters out the interaction thus improves the reconstruction quality of both fields the network interconnection can also act as a data augmentation leading to an improvement of the reconstruction generalization in each task at the same time this strategy preserves the specific information of each field by separating the process in the decoder part of both networks with minimal learnable parameters the proposed network is efficient in terms of memory and inference processing time since this learning process adopts a single unified loss function for both reconstructions yet it can be effectively trained with a standard gradient descent technique this new network is trained with a large synthetic database where aquifer properties are randomly generated using geostatistical variograms to provide models with different degrees of heterogeneity that ensures generalization of the network these transmissivity and storativity models are used in solving the groundwater flow equation to obtain numerical piezometric responses which are the input for training the network with two outcome fields the yielding reconstructions of the multi task network on the test models proved the effectiveness of multitask learning which outperforms the single task neural networks with 10 higher accuracy for both tomograms the performance of the trained architecture is then analyzed by considering different situations that may arise in real applications such as the scarcity of piezometric data the alteration by noises and uncertainties related to the a priori model used to generate the training models in this analysis the accuracy of neural network reconstructions shows a clear dependence on data coverage insufficient coverage often leads to a smooth interpretation of the fields as the small volume of data does not capture the full complexity of the aquifer indeed the dependence of inversion quality on data resolution is a common problem in inversion which is independent of the optimization tool used the proposed architecture also exhibits some resilience to data noise since the process is based on feature extraction from the input image an important advantage of the convolutional neural network the effectiveness of deep learning inversion is then tested for cases where the binary spatial distribution of the t and s fields deviates from the gaussian distribution used to generate the database as the network correctly identifies the main features of both fields the proposed approach proves its broad generalization in detecting even some unlearned features however to achieve this generalization a large training database is required which can be time consuming to build concerning the comparison of our network with the classical deterministic gauss newton method four main points can be drawn the first is that the deep learning algorithm can be considered as a global optimizer of which the result is independent of the initial model that is not the case for gauss newton algorithms second both methods share a strong dependence on the a priori model where a complementary information is required with the piezometric data to assist the algorithm in finding realistic models of the subsurface as in most cases measurement data alone are not sufficient to reveal the complexity of environments under study however the way introducing this a priori model in a deep learning algorithm is totally different from a gauss newton method in a gauss newton algorithm the a priori information is introduced into the objective function in the form of derivable and quadratic terms whereas a deep learning approach includes a priori constraints when generating database for the training process without requiring an a priori model in derivable form a deep learning algorithm can otherwise offer an advantage of including uncertainties of a priori conditions into the inversion when the construction of the database is built with a wide range of features to cover a variety of a priori conditions the trained network thus can gain a better generalization the third point is sensitivity to noise a deep learning algorithm minimizes the impact of data noise on the result maps thanks to the convolutional operation which processes the data image on a region wise basis as opposed to deterministic algorithms based on every data point the last point concerns the computation time building a deep learning algorithm is more computationally intensive than a gauss newton method when the generation of database often requires computing the forward problem for thousands of times however this becomes very interesting when the gauss newton code adopts a finite difference method to compute the jacobian matrix for a large number of unknowns which would also be extremely heavy these pros and cons of both methods should be further validated in light of a real dataset which should be the objective of future work credit authorship contribution

3077,the control mechanisms of temporal and small scale spatial characteristics on different types of preferential flow pf processes during infiltration are still lacking two year high resolution in situ soil moisture profiles were used to investigate the controls of pf processes and its interaction with moisture and vegetation dynamics which covers three hillslope positions upslope 14 midslope 9 and downslope 4 and three vegetation treatments bare ground stubble grassland and natural grassland in a typical semi arid grassland of eurasia two types of pf were identified non sequential response nsr was taken as one indication of pf using the disordered response of soil moisture profiles to rainfall fast preferential flow in sequence response pf rate was taken as another indicator when a measured maximum pore water rate higher than saturated hydraulic conductivity the conditions for the occurrence of the two pfs were inconsistent and different from the studies which showed the higher probability of pfs under dryer conditions and with higher rainfall intensities small rainfall events with low rainfall intensity and relatively low soil moisture at most locations showed higher nsr frequency which further highlight the strong dependence of nsr on hydrophobicity and macropore structure of the topsoil whereas a higher rainfall intensity increased pf rate under wet conditions meanwhile the occurrence of pf rate was also significantly controlled by vegetation coverage soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity of 5 10 cm soil layer furthermore the frequency of pf was 15 9 44 5 and its contribution to the total infiltration was 50 the water recession rate of nsr and pf was slower and faster than that of matrix flow respectively this demonstrates the importance of pf to water replenishment in scarce rain areas and the influence of combinations of spatial temporal factors on different flow processes keywords typical grassland slope xilin river basin soil moisture response preferential flow slope hydrology data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction preferential flow pf describes flow processes which bypasses a part of the soil matrix and has a faster flow rate hendrickx and flury 2001 šimunek and genuchten 2006 pf can influence the distribution of soil moisture mei et al 2018 groundwater recharge ireson and butler 2011 root water absorption schwaerzel et al 2009 solute transport larsbo et al 2014 soil erosion glass et al 2002 and other processes which play a vital role in local and regional eco hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycles mcclain et al 2003 jarvis 2007 clothier et al 2008 the contribution of pf to hydrological science was quantified for the first time in the 1970s through experimental observations beven and germann 1982 subsequent studies have found that pf occurs in all soil and landscape units jarvis 2007 weiler 2017 and macropore flow weiler and naef 2003 fingered flow steenhuis et al 2013 and funnel flow schwaerzel et al 2012 are three principal modes of pf although the physical mechanism differs for each flow pattern the range of their velocity can be higher in the vadose zone by several orders of magnitude nimmo 2007 therefore many models consider this non equilibrium flow phenomenon in soil to better understand the hydrological behavior simunek et al 2003 gerke 2006 in the process of development and improvement of relevant models researchers have a clearer understanding of the characteristics of pf but the knowledge about the temporal and spatial characteristics that affect the pf distribution is still insufficient because the high heterogeneity and complex interaction of various influencing factors jarvis 2007 graham and lin 2011 numerous methods have been developed to investigate pf in the laboratory and the field allaire et al 2009 beven and germann 2013 for example x ray scanning magnetic resonance imaging mri larsbo et al 2014 naveed et al 2016 dye tracer analysis and breakthrough curve test methods zehe and flühler 2001 anderson et al 2009 jarvis et al 2016 can be used to quantify pf from the pore to the pedon scale however the applicability of these methods is limited in acquisition of real time processes and dynamic information allaire et al 2009 lin 2010 luo et al 2010a wiekenkamp et al 2016 the subsequent development of long term and non destructive techniques such as geophysical surveying methods sammartino et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 are also limited by the rough resolution points of interest that cannot be directly measured and uncertainty associated with the inversion algorithm lin and zhou 2008 angermann et al 2017 compared with these methods in situ soil moisture monitoring with high time resolution minute provides an opportunity for investigating the occurrence and mechanism of pf it is widely used because of its relatively low cost strong operability and minimal disturbance to the original soil during the installation process guo et al 2018 further it is applicable for natural rainfall and simulated rainfall allaire et al 2009 hardie et al 2013 more importantly frequent pf processes can be captured on the minute scale through repeated high frequency observations of soil moisture at different depths hardie et al 2013 thus far numerous studies have explored pf and its relationship with spatial characteristics and hydrological conditions using soil moisture time series jarvis 2007 van schaik 2009 ghafoor et al 2013 koestel and jorda 2014 however most of them mainly focused on the factors with large heterogeneity and showed differences in pf occurrence among distinct soil types lin and zhou 2008 luo et al 2010b topography and geomorphology ying et al 2012 or vegetation cover types ying et al 2012 bachmair et al 2009 in fact the complexity of the occurrence of pf also restricted by many local characteristics and the role of some explanatory variables still remain unidentified hendrickx and flury 2001 as described by wiekenkamp et al 2016 the overall non uniformity of the occurrence of pf in watershed is attributable to the unresolved small scale heterogeneity of influencing factors demand et al 2019 showed that small scale soil properties have an important influence on pf in different landscape units of complex watersheds hardie et al 2013 also found that different types of pfs in a single point soil profile are related to the distinct texture of the soil layers moreover several studies have demonstrated that vegetation coverage of grassland meerveld et al 2019 wu et al 2022 and hillslope position tang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 play a critical role in pf however studies linking the small scale soil properties hillslope position and the occurrence of different types of pfs under different vegetation coverage during natural initial and boundary conditions based on soil moisture time series with high time resolution have rarely been investigated changes in soil profile water content of different flow processes can provide information about pf processes and reflect the amount of water transported demand et al 2019 but most studies acknowledging the importance of pf have focused only on its occurrence frequency graham and lin 2011 wiekenkamp et al 2016 therefore the soil moisture increase process between different infiltration response types still needed in addition the recession analysis that characterizes the rate of soil moisture reduction after a rainfall event is also crucial in the calibration and verification of hydrological models romero et al 2017 basso et al 2021 however only few studies have investigated the process of soil moisture recession under different infiltration response types this study investigated the characteristics and factors of pf of bare ground stubble grassland and natural grassland which were taken as proxy of different grades of vegetation coverage respectively in different slope segments i e upslope midslope and downslope through high frequency in situ soil moisture sensing monitoring of profiles in a typical semi arid grassland therefore a method for determining the occurrence frequency of pf was first established second the characteristics of rainfall events and initial soil moisture conditions driving the occurrence of pf were identified subsequently the impact of soil properties vegetation characteristics and topographical location on pf on the small scale are discussed finally the influence mechanism of different infiltration response types on the water movement process and infiltration are clarified the results of this study can provide references for accurately evaluating the occurrence of pf and thereby constructing hydrological prediction models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the selected hillslope is located in the lower reaches of xilin river basin in the eastern part of the

design by analyzing the variation range of the mountains slope and the vegetation coverage min max 3 68 in the basin using arcgis three transects of different vegetation treatments with two replicates for each were set up on the hillslope where the vegetation growth was relatively uniform each transect contained three 6 m 3 m plots which were set up on the upslope u midslope m and downslope d with corresponding slope angles of 14 9 and 4 respectively fig 1b to avoid interference at least 2 m of open space was left between the repeated plots as a buffer zone in which the vegetation and soil characteristics were investigated a total of 18 plots were set up three different vegetation treatments were bare ground bg stubble grassland sg and natural grassland ck respectively fig 1c bg removed only the aboveground part of the vegetation while retaining the root system representing the low vegetation coverage grassland the sg with the stubble height of 4 cm after the vegetation leaves were cut off represented the grassland with medium vegetation coverage the ck as a control was left untreated and represented a high density grassland in the early stage of vegetation growth every year i e may in 2019 and 2020 bg and sg were pruned manually in situ and then different treatments were controlled by periodic 3 7 days trimmed until the end of the experiment each year i e the end of september to monitor soil moisture a soil pit with a diameter of 30 cm and a depth of 50 cm was dug in the center of each plot at the end of march 2019 four soil moisture sensors tdr 310s resolution of 0 1 vol were inserted horizontally into the soil at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm below the ground surface with a sampling interval of 5 min each sensor has a deviation of a few centimeters from the one above in the vertical plane to avoid being affected by changes in the potential flow path of the sensor above after the installation carefully backfilled the pit with the original soil and compacted it layer by layer to the original bulk density to minimize the disturbance as much as possible taking into account the influence of hillslopes on the temporal and spatial distribution of natural rainfall a self recording rain gauge rg3 m with a resolution of 0 2 mm was installed in each slope segment to record the natural rainfall process further rainfall was integrated to 5 min interval the data of soil moisture and rainfall used were between june and september in 2019 and 2020 2 2 2 field survey in early april 2019 the soil samples were collected in the buffer zone at the same contour position as the installed soil moisture sensor each sample was collected three times using a cutting ring diameter 5 cm height 5 cm and an auger at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm the dry weighing method at 105 c for 24 h was used to determine the soil bulk density bd g cm 3 after passing air dried soil samples through a 2 mm sieve the particle size distribution of the soil

soil ks cm h 1 on the hillslope under different vegetation treatments was measured in early april 2019 using a double ring infiltrator with inner and outer ring diameters of 100 cm and 150 cm respectively mariotte bottles were connected to the inner and outer rings for continuous and stable water supply changes in water levels of the mariotte bottles and the inner and outer rings were recorded until a stable state was reached lai et al 2010 li et al 2020 in addition three 1 m 1 m quadrats were randomly selected in each plot and photographed using a digital camera every 10 days from june to september in 2019 and 2020 the normalized difference index was used to extract the surface vegetation coverage fc ecke et al 1993 at the end of the growing season each year soil samples with roots were collected from each plot using a rectangular metal box with dimensions of 20 cm length 10 cm width and 10 cm height to obtain belowground biomass bgb g cm 2 table 1 and fig 2 show the soil properties and vegetation parameters of each plot on the hillslope 2 3 data processing and analysis 2 3 1 classification of rainfall events and definition of infiltration events the rainfall time series was divided into discrete rainfall events where if the interval between two rainfall events is 6 h it is regarded as a single rainfall event fig 3 rainfall psum maximum rainfall intensity imax average rainfall intensity iavg at a time step of 5 min of each rainfall event and rainfall duration d were calculated generally response events begin to occur when soil moisture increases beyond the instrument noise level hardie et al 2013 in studies for sensors with an accuracy between 1 vol and 4 vol it is believed that soil moisture change should exceed the threshold of instrument noise by 0 2 vol germann and hensel 2006 blume et al 2009 in this study the minimum change threshold of soil moisture content was set to 0 3 vol and the infiltration event was defined as an increase in soil moisture by 0 3 vol as detected by at least one sensor in the soil profile in this manner the response time rt of each sensor and the time difference of the soil moisture response of adjacent soil layers drt defined as the difference between the response time of soil moisture in the lower and upper layers can be determined fig 3 the soil moisture response event was tracked for up to 48 h after the rainfall event ended or until the next rainfall event began as the classification of different infiltration response events further explained in 2 3 2 was based on the first response of the sensor demand et al 2019 the rainfall rpsum and rainfall intensity riavg rimax of all soil layers before the response were also calculated from each infiltration event the initial soil water content θinit defined as the water content immediately before the rainfall event maximum soil water content θmax and increment of soil moisture δθ of the soil at different depths were extracted fig 3 here δθ was used to describe the response of soil moisture to rainfall under a certain soil depth at a specific location finally the quartile method of soil profile water content was used to divide the soil into dry and wet initial states blume et al 2009 2 3 2 identification and classification of infiltration response types for all infiltration events the response time sequence of the soil moisture sensor can be divided into hardie et al 2013 1 non sequential response nsr sensors do not respond in order from top to bottom 2 velocity based preferential flow pf rate sensors respond in sequence from top to bottom and the maximum pore water rate vmax is greater than ks vmax is obtained by dividing the distance between sensors by drt germann and hensel 2006 it should be noted that vmax represents the fastest flow component in the soil volume that can be measured between adjacent sensors 3 sequential response sr sensors respond in sequence from top to bottom and vmax is less than ks and 4 no response nr the soil moisture change does not exceed the minimum threshold 0 3 vol the occurrence frequency of different infiltration response types was calculated using the following equation 3 nsr pf rate sr the sum of nsr pf rate sr responses the total number of infiltration events based on pf information from the literature we proposed the following hypothesis the generation of pf is strongly dependent on rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture content specifically high rainfall and dry conditions will promote the occurrence of pf 2 3 3 quantification of soil moisture recession process to better understand the process of the soil moisture response to rainfall the reduction of soil moisture δθr that is the change of soil moisture from θmax to the steady state was calculated fig 3 this segment of soil moisture change curve is called the recession curve and this process can be described by a simple exponential function rutledge and mesko 1996 brandes et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 θ t θ 0 k t where θ0 and θt are the soil moisture content at any time and after t time respectively and k is the recession constant as an intrinsic characteristic of soil k reflects the extent of soil water retention and is not easily affected by time changes romero et al 2017 the most commonly used estimation method is the master recession curve mrc method in which an average recession curve is generated from multiple recession segments nathan and mcmahon 1990 sujono et al 2004 specifically in the scatter diagram of any point in the recession curve and the soil water content after t time the fitted straight line passing through the origin is mrc and the slope at this time is the recession constant k the larger the value of k the slower the drainage speed rivera ramirez et al 2002 generally speaking the larger the time interval t is the more accurate the value of k basso et al 2021 however acquiring an accurate k value would require a longer data period and many recession segments would be excluded from the analysis in this study the time interval t was 3 h and the standard error se and coefficient of determination r2 of the k value were also calculated 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance and bonferroni post hoc test were conducted to identify differences of pf frequency between different slope segments as most of the data did not satisfy the normal distribution and the homogeneity of variance the non parametric kruskal wallis test was performed to analyze the influence of rainfall characteristics and initial soil water content on different infiltration response types in addition spearman s bivariate correlation analysis was applied to determine potential relationships between soil properties of different soil layers vegetation characteristics slope gradients and the frequency of pf the significance level of all statistical tests was set to p 0 05 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the total rainfall during the observation period was 444 3 mm and rainfall from june to september in 2019 and 2020 accounted for 38 168 9 mm and 62 275 4 mm respectively of the total rainfall fig 4 a a total of 79 rainfall events occurred during the observation period and the maximum individual rainfall was 44 9 mm rainfall events with psum of 5 mm and 10 mm accounted for 67 0 and 85 8 of the total rainfall events respectively 87 6 of all events had a imax 2 mm 5 min fig 4b as shown in fig 4c rainfall in this area is characterized by small rainfall events with low rainfall intensity and high rainfall events with heavy rainfall intensity 3 2 characteristics of infiltration response types 3 2 1 occurrence frequency of infiltration response type vertical changes in soil moisture drt can characterize the temporal pattern of the water infiltration process a negative drt value indicates the occurrence of a non sequential preferential flow nsr on the hillslope wiekenkamp et al 2016 in addition as shown in table 2 approximately one fifth of the sequential response events had vmax greater than ks i e pf rate velocity based preferential flow the frequency of pfs nsr and pf rate showed an insignificant upward trend from the upslope 27 3 to the midslope 28 0 to the downslope 28 9 fig 5 a among them the frequency of nsr and pf rate gradually decreased and increased along the downhill direction respectively on the whole the frequency of pf rate was 1 4 2 7 times that of nsr the frequency of nsr did not differ significantly among different vegetation treatments but was the highest in bg and pf rate was more likely to occur in ck fig 5b most infiltration response types of all locations belonged to sr among which mbg was as high as 84 1 and mck was the lowest accounting for 55 5 fig 5c approximately 30 of infiltration events belonged to pf among which the frequency of nsr and pf rate was 4 8 13 9 and 10 1 30 6 respectively the occurrence frequency of the three response types all decreased with depth 3 2 2 controls of pf occurrence to assess the influence of rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture conditions on different response behaviors the average value of each parameter in different infiltration response types was calculated table 3 among the three response types psum imax and iavg of the nsr event were the smallest while those corresponding to the pf rate event were significantly higher the d of rainfall events corresponding to pf was significantly lower than that of sr further the pre response rainfall characteristics rpsum rimax riavg were significantly different among nsr pf rate and sr different from psum the rpsum of sr events was 1 44 4 24 times that of nsr and pf rate events indicating that the initial rainfall required for triggering the sr event is significantly greater than that of pf the above results show that nsr is triggered mainly by small rainfall events with short duration while pf rate is triggered by heavy rainfall events with short duration in addition nsr and sr have similar θinit suggesting that θinit has no decisive effect on nsr however the θinit of pf rate events was significantly higher than that of sr events indicating that wet soil conditions are conducive to the occurrence of pf rate changes in pf frequency at all locations with rainfall characteristics and initial soil moisture content were further analyzed the results showed that the frequency of nsr generally decreased with increasing rpsum fig 6 a when rpsum 5 mm nsr occurred in only certain locations and when rpsum was 0 5 mm the probability of nsr occurrence was as high as 76 6 the frequency of pf rate at a specific location generally increased with increasing rain intensity fig 6b when imax was 2 4 mm 5 min and 4 mm 5 min the probability of pf rate was 32 1 and 51 9 respectively fig 7 showed that the occurrence frequency of nsr at most locations was higher when θinit was smaller and a few locations will promote the generation of nsr in wetter conditions however pf rate showed a trend of initial decline and subsequent rise with all locations reaching the extreme value under wet conditions in addition the frequency of pf differed among locations indicating that soil properties and vegetation cover also play an important role in the occurrence of pf the correlation between the occurrence frequency of pf and the spatial attributes showed fig 8 that the occurrence frequency of nsr was closely related to soil silt sand content and dg of the 5 cm layer similarly the frequency of pf rate was mainly affected by the content of soil silt sand dg and ks of the 10 cm soil layer vegetation cover fc showed opposite effects on the two types of pf the increase of fc can inhibit the occurrence of nsr but effectively promote the occurrence of pf rate bgb showed a positive effect on the occurrence of pf although the correlation was not significant in addition a significant correlation was observed between slope and soil parameters with correlation coefficients between 0 896 and 0 949 p 0 05 indicating that slope has a strong influence on soil properties 3 3 quantitative description of soil water increment and recession process the observed δθ was between 0 3 vol and 9 4 vol the distribution pattern of δθ along the soil profile varied for nsr pf rate and sr fig 9 during sr events the resistance of soil moisture response increased with depth but water could reach 20 cm and the soil moisture in the 40 cm soil layer of dsg also responded similarly δθ in pf rate decreased with depth and was mainly concentrated in shallow soils 5 cm and 10 cm however it greatly contributed to the increase of infiltration water accounting for 44 4 57 5 of the total infiltration water in the profile on the contrary no damping of δθ with depth was observed for nsr events and δθ at a depth of 20 cm was 1 0 7 3 times that at 10 cm δθr accounted for 49 3 33 4 and 17 3 of the total reduction during the pf rate sr and nsr events respectively moreover the k of different response types followed the order nsr sr pf rate fig 10 suggesting that pf rate can significantly increase the recession rate of soil moisture whereas nsr can slow down the loss of water for nsr events the k values of different slope segments followed the order midslope upslope downslope this indicates the absence of a certain regularity of the water recession velocity along the slope gradient which may be related to the pore distribution characteristics and the role of local micro topography the moisture loss of ck was the slowest in nsr according to the k values in different vegetation treatments for pf rate and sr the value of k followed the order downslope midslope upslope indicating that slope has an important effect on the redistribution of soil water in the sequence of response events famiglietti et al 1998 moreover for different vegetation treatments in a certain slope segment k decreased with increasing vegetation cover explaining that vegetation can significantly increase the rate of water recession in the sequence of response events 4 discussion 4 1 temporal controls of pf frequency this study found that the rainfall characteristics of the two types of pf i e nsr and pf rate were significantly different which was inconsistent with our initial hypothesis how easy the pf may be activated is strongly influenced by the initial soil moisture conditions liu and lin 2015 hopkins et al 2016 sanchez garcia et al 2020 therefore the timing of rainfall events was critical to trigger the onset of pf 4 1 1 non sequential response nsr many studies believed that pf occurs more frequently under dry conditions and with higher rainfall rainfall intensity koestel and jorda 2014 wiekenkamp et al 2016 demand et al 2019 this study found that nsr is more likely to occur during small rainfall events with short duration although the θinit had no significant effect on the occurrence of nsr table 3 most locations had the higher frequency of nsr under relatively dryer conditions fig 7 the generation and development of pf in soil requires appropriate conditions such as internal factors soil architecture and external driving force water input guo et al 2018 for undisturbed grassland soil macropore flow usually occurs at or near the surface petersen et al 2001 kulli et al 2003 because broken rocks in the soil hollow spaces occur around plant roots lin 2009 luo et al 2019 connected channels form of the decayed roots guo et al 2019 soil biological activities such as animal caves cheng et al 2017 and the drying wetting alternation of soil bachmair et al 2009 can lead to the generation of connected pore structures and pf channels furthermore vegetation litter root exudates and animal manure increase the organic matter content of soil 4 21 7 65 luo et al 2010b the generation and degradation of organic compounds in sandy and other coarse grained soils will lead to soil hydrophobicity simon et al 2009 the enhanced hydrophobicity under dry conditions can increase the resistance of soil to wetting thereby forcing water to funneled into open macropores within a short time after introduction of water source such as precipitation even with small rainfall ritsema and dekker 2000 goebel et al 2011 hardie et al 2011 hardie et al 2013 on the contrary the nsr frequencies of bg and sg in the midslope were higher when the θinit was relatively high the possible reasons are discussed in section 4 1 2 such site specific relationships about pf occurrence had a strong variability and can be true even for closely located soils which highlights the importance of small scale spatial features to the pf 4 1 2 velocity based preferential flow pf rate we found that the high intensity rainfall events with short duration that the study area often experiences and a higher θinit are more conducive to the occurrence of pf rate a higher abundance of pf during high θinit is consistent with the classic assumption of pf which should be triggered more often under wet conditions with a lower infiltrability mechanisms of enhancement by greater wetness include 1 the water pressure in the soil matrix is close to or exceeds the water entry pressure and push water moving to pf pathways jarvis 2007 2 a higher θinit can increase connectivity of soil macropores which enhance pf weiler and naef 2003 3 it can also restrain lateral water movement from pf pathways to the soil matrix buttle and mcdonald 2002 and 4 the hydraulic characteristics of the soil are more active in moist soil wang et al 2003 yao et al 2017 that during these wet conditions a higher rainfall intensity further promotes the initialization of pf in general a large rainfall of short duration and high intensity favors pf occurrence in soils because a higher water input intensity can lead to a more positive pressure potential in the topsoil gjettermann et al 1997 however arid and semi arid areas dominated by infiltration excess runoff doody et al 2010 higher rainfall intensity increases soil erodibility which increases the sediment carrying capacity of runoff and erosion force on the surface thus filling soil pores on and near the surface li and pan 2020 even so pf still occurs in macropores that filled with sediments which act as regions of interpenetrating conductive porous media scanlon 1992 nimmo 2021 4 2 spatial controls of pf frequency 4 2 1 hillslope location the frequency of pf is insensitive to terrain location likely because the slope represents only the steepness of the terrain whereas factors related the pf behavior such as micro topography and surface roughness are difficult to observe and measure directly graham and lin 2011 interestingly the frequency of pf rate increased significantly along the downhill direction which may be related to the larger contribution area i e water input conditions guo et al 2018 on the contrary the change of nsr showed a decreasing trend it may be because of the bulk density that relates to water transmission and water capacity nimmo 2021 budhathoki et al 2022 also showed that in grasslands runoff from the upslope may increase the degree of soil compaction in the downslope leading to changes in the soil macropore structure this suggests that slope features indirectly control the dynamics and intensity of pf by influencing soil properties hopkins et al 2016 4 2 2 soil property the results of correlation analysis showed that soil properties especially soil texture and soil hydraulic characteristics strongly affect pf fig 8 it is reported that soil texture influences the pore size spectrum of macropores kung et al 2006 the larger the mass fraction of sand in the soil are the pf path is more obvious and the pf intensity is greater buttle and mcdonald 2002 kung et al 2006 liu et al 2021 alaoui 2015 reported that the topsoil with coarser particle sizes plays a decisive role in the process of water flow with open macropores on the land surface as higher structural porosity is favorable for the formation of pf stumpp and maloszewski 2010 we also found that the distribution of soil particle size in the 0 5 cm soil layer had a significant effect on the generation of nsr furthermore the heterogeneity caused by soil texture by affecting soil layer patterns and soil hydraulic properties can initiate pf yan and zhao 2016 many studies showed that downward moving water can become unstable at textural interfaces when a fine textured layer above a coarse lower layer and move rapidly through coarse soil even if modest difference in grain size hardie et al 2013 in this study the topsoil that with lower soil sand content and hydraulic conductivity than those of the 5 10 cm soil layer restricts the downward movement of water this small scale heterogeneity and abrupt changes in hydraulic gradients within short distances can cause hydraulic instability in the soil promoting the occurrence of pf kishel and gerla 2010 hardie et al 2013 and wang et al 2018 also suggested that differences in soil structure and soil texture among soil layers can lead to unstable water movement this demonstrates the influence of small scale soil properties on pf behavior should be considered in the study of pf 4 2 3 vegetation characteristics surface cover is an important factor controlling water flow which strongly affects the response process of soil moisture bachmair et al 2009 the results showed that vegetation coverage fc tend to restrain the occurrence of nsr because water from small rainfall events is mainly lost through vegetation interception and evaporation when the fc is larger similar conclusions were made by stumpp et al 2007 and stumpp and maloszewski 2010 they also showed that bare farmland soil promotes pf occurrence in contrast the frequency of pf rate had a significant positive correlation with fc vegetation redistributes precipitation before it falls on the soil surface weakening the splash impact of raindrops and promoting the occurrence of pf by transporting rainfall to the soil near the stems johnson and lehmann 2006 furthermore vegetation cover can increase soil carbon contents which enhance soil hydrophobicity and soil fauna activity creating a soil environment that favors pf gjettermann et al 1997 as an important part of vegetation and soil root system is an important medium for the occurrence of preferential flow alaoui 2015 the results showed that the higher pf frequency was related to the higher belowground biomass bgb this was attributed to the complex root network formed by vegetation growth can effectively improve the soil structure and hydraulic properties hu et al 2020 shi et al 2021 and then have a positive impact on soil infiltration it is reported that soils with roots exhibited different soil physical properties and water infiltration behavior compared with rootless soils jiang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 studied on the rainfall infiltration in semi arid grassland and also found that root system was one of the main factors affecting soil infiltration rate and infiltration rate was positively correlated with bgb this is consistent with our conclusion in addition the stable macropores formed by plant roots and decayed roots can also promote the infiltration of precipitation into the deep soil cui et al 2019 guo et al 2019 the results of dye tracer experiments conducted in the field by jiang et al 2018 showed that a large proportion of the stained areas in the unrooted plot was confined to the 0 10 cm soil layer while the rooted plot was mainly concentrated in the upper 20 cm soil layer and the maximum stained width and stained area were significantly higher than that of the rootless area these findings suggest that the role of roots in water distribution has far reaching significance for the replenishment of soil moisture in arid ecosystems 4 3 effect of preferential flow on the increase and decrease process of soil moisture response in addition to the occurrence frequency of pf the importance of pf during infiltration was highlighted by the quantity of transported water indicated by the δθ δθ of nsr events gradually increased with depth fig 9 which implied water bypassing the topsoil matrix and reaching the deep layer directly hardie et al 2013 demand et al 2019 although δθ decreased with depth during pf rate events fig 9 it accounted for up to 50 that of the three types of infiltration responses and the pf rate frequency was 1 4 2 7 times higher than that of nsr alaoui 2015 also reported that pf contributed between 11 and 94 to the total infiltration results suggest that the pf is an important form of hydrological response and plays a decisive role in the ecological water balance of the region further there are certain differences in the recession process of soil moisture between two infiltration response types the largest δθr and water recession were observed for pf rate whereas the smallest values were observed for nsr this may be related to the initial soil water content of the recession process shang and mao 2014 found that the recession rate and cumulative reduction increased with increasing soil water content through simulating soil water recession in a farmland vegetation conditions also affect the decline of soil moisture rivera ramirez et al 2002 generally speaking the transpiration of vegetation will accelerate the loss of water the question arises why the lowest decreasing rate was observed in ck during nsr events first higher vegetation coverage can prevent the pore channels from being directly exposed to sunlight thus reducing the evaporation of soil moisture second macropores in sandy loam do not significantly affect soil evaporation zhou et al 2020 this phenomenon positively affects grassland ecosystems and their service functions 5 conclusions high frequency soil moisture monitoring profiles were established to identify the occurrence spatiotemporal controls of pf and the distribution characteristics of soil moisture among different infiltration response processes under different scenarios in a typical semi arid grassland hillslope the results showed that the frequency of pf was 15 9 44 5 of which the pf rate frequency was 1 4 2 7 times that of nsr the spatial and temporal controls of the two pfs occurrence were different by systematically analyzing we found that beside the open macropores affected by the coarser soil texture and roots in shallow soil layer nsr strongly depends on the initial state of soil lower initial soil water content and water repellency this leads to the occurrence of nsr even in small rainfall events and the vegetation coverage has insignificant inhibitory effect on nsr however pf rate is more inclined to occur in a higher rainfall intensity with wetter condition soil properties especially the soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity of 5 10 cm soil layer have obvious effects on the occurrence of pf rate vegetation coverage and belowground biomass also showed to promote the pf rate furthermore pf rate makes a greater contribution to infiltration water and the water recession rate is slower than that of matrix flow during nsr these findings emphasize the control mechanism of temporal factors and small scale spatial characteristics on different types of pf processes and the water replenishment of pf on areas with scarce rainfall the study highlights the necessity of a deeper understanding of pf processes for improving pf assessment on the hillslopes of typical semi arid grasslands which could provide a reference for related research furthermore modelers should consider different types of pf and their controls in research on related hydrological processes which would facilitate the establishment of the foundation for constructing accurate process based eco hydrological models on multi temporal and spatial scales funding this

3077,the control mechanisms of temporal and small scale spatial characteristics on different types of preferential flow pf processes during infiltration are still lacking two year high resolution in situ soil moisture profiles were used to investigate the controls of pf processes and its interaction with moisture and vegetation dynamics which covers three hillslope positions upslope 14 midslope 9 and downslope 4 and three vegetation treatments bare ground stubble grassland and natural grassland in a typical semi arid grassland of eurasia two types of pf were identified non sequential response nsr was taken as one indication of pf using the disordered response of soil moisture profiles to rainfall fast preferential flow in sequence response pf rate was taken as another indicator when a measured maximum pore water rate higher than saturated hydraulic conductivity the conditions for the occurrence of the two pfs were inconsistent and different from the studies which showed the higher probability of pfs under dryer conditions and with higher rainfall intensities small rainfall events with low rainfall intensity and relatively low soil moisture at most locations showed higher nsr frequency which further highlight the strong dependence of nsr on hydrophobicity and macropore structure of the topsoil whereas a higher rainfall intensity increased pf rate under wet conditions meanwhile the occurrence of pf rate was also significantly controlled by vegetation coverage soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity of 5 10 cm soil layer furthermore the frequency of pf was 15 9 44 5 and its contribution to the total infiltration was 50 the water recession rate of nsr and pf was slower and faster than that of matrix flow respectively this demonstrates the importance of pf to water replenishment in scarce rain areas and the influence of combinations of spatial temporal factors on different flow processes keywords typical grassland slope xilin river basin soil moisture response preferential flow slope hydrology data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction preferential flow pf describes flow processes which bypasses a part of the soil matrix and has a faster flow rate hendrickx and flury 2001 šimunek and genuchten 2006 pf can influence the distribution of soil moisture mei et al 2018 groundwater recharge ireson and butler 2011 root water absorption schwaerzel et al 2009 solute transport larsbo et al 2014 soil erosion glass et al 2002 and other processes which play a vital role in local and regional eco hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycles mcclain et al 2003 jarvis 2007 clothier et al 2008 the contribution of pf to hydrological science was quantified for the first time in the 1970s through experimental observations beven and germann 1982 subsequent studies have found that pf occurs in all soil and landscape units jarvis 2007 weiler 2017 and macropore flow weiler and naef 2003 fingered flow steenhuis et al 2013 and funnel flow schwaerzel et al 2012 are three principal modes of pf although the physical mechanism differs for each flow pattern the range of their velocity can be higher in the vadose zone by several orders of magnitude nimmo 2007 therefore many models consider this non equilibrium flow phenomenon in soil to better understand the hydrological behavior simunek et al 2003 gerke 2006 in the process of development and improvement of relevant models researchers have a clearer understanding of the characteristics of pf but the knowledge about the temporal and spatial characteristics that affect the pf distribution is still insufficient because the high heterogeneity and complex interaction of various influencing factors jarvis 2007 graham and lin 2011 numerous methods have been developed to investigate pf in the laboratory and the field allaire et al 2009 beven and germann 2013 for example x ray scanning magnetic resonance imaging mri larsbo et al 2014 naveed et al 2016 dye tracer analysis and breakthrough curve test methods zehe and flühler 2001 anderson et al 2009 jarvis et al 2016 can be used to quantify pf from the pore to the pedon scale however the applicability of these methods is limited in acquisition of real time processes and dynamic information allaire et al 2009 lin 2010 luo et al 2010a wiekenkamp et al 2016 the subsequent development of long term and non destructive techniques such as geophysical surveying methods sammartino et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 are also limited by the rough resolution points of interest that cannot be directly measured and uncertainty associated with the inversion algorithm lin and zhou 2008 angermann et al 2017 compared with these methods in situ soil moisture monitoring with high time resolution minute provides an opportunity for investigating the occurrence and mechanism of pf it is widely used because of its relatively low cost strong operability and minimal disturbance to the original soil during the installation process guo et al 2018 further it is applicable for natural rainfall and simulated rainfall allaire et al 2009 hardie et al 2013 more importantly frequent pf processes can be captured on the minute scale through repeated high frequency observations of soil moisture at different depths hardie et al 2013 thus far numerous studies have explored pf and its relationship with spatial characteristics and hydrological conditions using soil moisture time series jarvis 2007 van schaik 2009 ghafoor et al 2013 koestel and jorda 2014 however most of them mainly focused on the factors with large heterogeneity and showed differences in pf occurrence among distinct soil types lin and zhou 2008 luo et al 2010b topography and geomorphology ying et al 2012 or vegetation cover types ying et al 2012 bachmair et al 2009 in fact the complexity of the occurrence of pf also restricted by many local characteristics and the role of some explanatory variables still remain unidentified hendrickx and flury 2001 as described by wiekenkamp et al 2016 the overall non uniformity of the occurrence of pf in watershed is attributable to the unresolved small scale heterogeneity of influencing factors demand et al 2019 showed that small scale soil properties have an important influence on pf in different landscape units of complex watersheds hardie et al 2013 also found that different types of pfs in a single point soil profile are related to the distinct texture of the soil layers moreover several studies have demonstrated that vegetation coverage of grassland meerveld et al 2019 wu et al 2022 and hillslope position tang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 play a critical role in pf however studies linking the small scale soil properties hillslope position and the occurrence of different types of pfs under different vegetation coverage during natural initial and boundary conditions based on soil moisture time series with high time resolution have rarely been investigated changes in soil profile water content of different flow processes can provide information about pf processes and reflect the amount of water transported demand et al 2019 but most studies acknowledging the importance of pf have focused only on its occurrence frequency graham and lin 2011 wiekenkamp et al 2016 therefore the soil moisture increase process between different infiltration response types still needed in addition the recession analysis that characterizes the rate of soil moisture reduction after a rainfall event is also crucial in the calibration and verification of hydrological models romero et al 2017 basso et al 2021 however only few studies have investigated the process of soil moisture recession under different infiltration response types this study investigated the characteristics and factors of pf of bare ground stubble grassland and natural grassland which were taken as proxy of different grades of vegetation coverage respectively in different slope segments i e upslope midslope and downslope through high frequency in situ soil moisture sensing monitoring of profiles in a typical semi arid grassland therefore a method for determining the occurrence frequency of pf was first established second the characteristics of rainfall events and initial soil moisture conditions driving the occurrence of pf were identified subsequently the impact of soil properties vegetation characteristics and topographical location on pf on the small scale are discussed finally the influence mechanism of different infiltration response types on the water movement process and infiltration are clarified the results of this study can provide references for accurately evaluating the occurrence of pf and thereby constructing hydrological prediction models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the selected hillslope is located in the lower reaches of xilin river basin in the eastern part of the

range of mountain slope the main soil types and vegetation communities in the basin while also taking into account the convenience and accessibility of transportation it is a typical grassland area

addition some small shrubs also grow in the upper part of the hillslope the average height of the grassland is approximately 7 cm and the root system is mainly distributed in the 0 30 cm soil layer the growing season is from may to september after which the temperature drops sharply and the herbaceous plants rapidly die shen et al 2016 2 2 experiment design and data acquisition 2 2 1 experiment design by analyzing the variation range of the mountains slope and the vegetation coverage min max 3 68 in the basin using arcgis three transects of different vegetation treatments with two replicates for each were set up on the hillslope where the vegetation growth was relatively uniform each transect contained three 6 m 3 m plots which were set up on the upslope u midslope m and downslope d with corresponding slope angles of 14 9 and 4 respectively fig 1b to avoid interference at least 2 m of open space was left between the repeated plots as a buffer zone in which the vegetation and soil characteristics were investigated a total of 18 plots were set up three different vegetation treatments were bare ground bg stubble grassland sg and natural grassland ck respectively fig 1c bg removed only the aboveground part of the vegetation while retaining the root system representing the low vegetation coverage grassland the sg with the stubble height of 4 cm after the vegetation leaves were cut off represented the grassland with medium vegetation coverage the ck as a control was left untreated and represented a high density grassland in the early stage of vegetation growth every year i e may in 2019 and 2020 bg and sg were pruned manually in situ and then different treatments were controlled by periodic 3 7 days trimmed until the end of the experiment each year i e the end of september to monitor soil moisture a soil pit with a diameter of 30 cm and a depth of 50 cm was dug in the center of each plot at the end of march 2019 four soil moisture sensors tdr 310s resolution of 0 1 vol were inserted horizontally into the soil at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm below the ground surface with a sampling interval of 5 min each sensor has a deviation of a few centimeters from the one above in the vertical plane to avoid being affected by changes in the potential flow path of the sensor above after the installation carefully backfilled the pit with the original soil and compacted it layer by layer to the original bulk density to minimize the disturbance as much as possible taking into account the influence of hillslopes on the temporal and spatial distribution of natural rainfall a self recording rain gauge rg3 m with a resolution of 0 2 mm was installed in each slope segment to record the natural rainfall process further rainfall was integrated to 5 min interval the data of soil moisture and rainfall used were between june and september in 2019 and 2020 2 2 2 field survey in early april 2019 the soil samples were collected in the buffer zone at the same contour position as the installed soil moisture sensor each sample was collected three times using a cutting ring diameter 5 cm height 5 cm and an auger at depths of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 40 cm the dry weighing method at 105 c for 24 h was used to determine the soil bulk density bd g cm 3 after passing air dried soil samples through a 2 mm sieve the particle size distribution of the soil samples was measured using the helos rodos automatic laser particle size analyzer the contents of clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 mm were determined subsequently the geometric mean particle diameter dg formula 1 and geometric particle standard deviation σg formula 2 were calculated to determine the mixing ratio of different particle sizes shirazi and boersma 2001 1 d g exp a 2 σ

of the i th class of particle size d i d i d i 1 2 according to the results of li et al 2020 on the scale transfer of soil infiltration in the xilin river basin the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil ks cm h 1 on the hillslope under different vegetation treatments was measured in early april 2019 using a double ring infiltrator with inner and outer ring diameters of 100 cm and 150 cm respectively mariotte bottles were connected to the inner and outer rings for continuous and stable water supply changes in water levels of the mariotte bottles and the inner and outer rings were recorded until a stable state was reached lai et al 2010 li et al 2020 in addition three 1 m 1 m quadrats were randomly selected in each plot and photographed using a digital camera every 10 days from june to september in 2019 and 2020 the normalized difference index was used to extract the surface vegetation coverage fc ecke et al 1993 at the end of the growing season each year soil samples with roots were collected from each plot using a rectangular metal box with dimensions of 20 cm length 10 cm width and 10 cm height to obtain belowground biomass bgb g cm 2 table 1 and fig 2 show the soil properties and vegetation parameters of each plot on the hillslope 2 3 data processing and analysis 2 3 1 classification of rainfall events and definition of infiltration events the rainfall time series was divided into discrete rainfall events where if the interval between two rainfall events is 6 h it is regarded as a single rainfall event fig 3 rainfall psum maximum rainfall intensity imax average rainfall intensity iavg at a time step of 5 min of each rainfall event and rainfall duration d were calculated generally response events begin to occur when soil moisture increases beyond the instrument noise level hardie et al 2013 in studies for sensors with an accuracy between 1 vol and 4 vol it is believed that soil moisture change should exceed the threshold of instrument noise by 0 2 vol germann and hensel 2006 blume et al 2009 in this study the minimum change threshold of soil moisture content was set to 0 3 vol and the infiltration event was defined as an increase in soil moisture by 0 3 vol as detected by at least one sensor in the soil profile in this manner the response time rt of each sensor and the time difference of the soil moisture response of adjacent soil layers drt defined as the difference between the response time of soil moisture in the lower and upper layers can be determined fig 3 the soil moisture response event was tracked for up to 48 h after the rainfall event ended or until the next rainfall event began as the classification of different infiltration response events further explained in 2 3 2 was based on the first response of the sensor demand et al 2019 the rainfall rpsum and rainfall intensity riavg rimax of all soil layers before the response were also calculated from each infiltration event the initial soil water content θinit defined as the water content immediately before the rainfall event maximum soil water content θmax and increment of soil moisture δθ of the soil at different depths were extracted fig 3 here δθ was used to describe the response of soil moisture to rainfall under a certain soil depth at a specific location finally the quartile method of soil profile water content was used to divide the soil into dry and wet initial states blume et al 2009 2 3 2 identification and classification of infiltration response types for all infiltration events the response time sequence of the soil moisture sensor can be divided into hardie et al 2013 1 non sequential response nsr sensors do not respond in order from top to bottom 2 velocity based preferential flow pf rate sensors respond in sequence from top to bottom and the maximum pore water rate vmax is greater than ks vmax is obtained by dividing the distance between sensors by drt germann and hensel 2006 it should be noted that vmax represents the fastest flow component in the soil volume that can be measured between adjacent sensors 3 sequential response sr sensors respond in sequence from top to bottom and vmax is less than ks and 4 no response nr the soil moisture change does not exceed the minimum threshold 0 3 vol the occurrence frequency of different infiltration response types was calculated using the following equation 3 nsr pf rate sr the sum of nsr pf rate sr responses the total number of infiltration events based on pf information from the literature we proposed the following hypothesis the generation of pf is strongly dependent on rainfall intensity and initial soil moisture content specifically high rainfall and dry conditions will promote the occurrence of pf 2 3 3 quantification of soil moisture recession process to better understand the process of the soil moisture response to rainfall the reduction of soil moisture δθr that is the change of soil moisture from θmax to the steady state was calculated fig 3 this segment of soil moisture change curve is called the recession curve and this process can be described by a simple exponential function rutledge and mesko 1996 brandes et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 θ t θ 0 k t where θ0 and θt are the soil moisture content at any time and after t time respectively and k is the recession constant as an intrinsic characteristic of soil k reflects the extent of soil water retention and is not easily affected by time changes romero et al 2017 the most commonly used estimation method is the master recession curve mrc method in which an average recession curve is generated from multiple recession segments nathan and mcmahon 1990 sujono et al 2004 specifically in the scatter diagram of any point in the recession curve and the soil water content after t time the fitted straight line passing through the origin is mrc and the slope at this time is the recession constant k the larger the value of k the slower the drainage speed rivera ramirez et al 2002 generally speaking the larger the time interval t is the more accurate the value of k basso et al 2021 however acquiring an accurate k value would require a longer data period and many recession segments would be excluded from the analysis in this study the time interval t was 3 h and the standard error se and coefficient of determination r2 of the k value were also calculated 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance and bonferroni post hoc test were conducted to identify differences of pf frequency between different slope segments as most of the data did not satisfy the normal distribution and the homogeneity of variance the non parametric kruskal wallis test was performed to analyze the influence of rainfall characteristics and initial soil water content on different infiltration response types in addition spearman s bivariate correlation analysis was applied to determine potential relationships between soil properties of different soil layers vegetation characteristics slope gradients and the frequency of pf the significance level of all statistical tests was set to p 0 05 3 results 3 1 rainfall characteristics the total rainfall during the observation period was 444 3 mm and rainfall from june to september in 2019 and 2020 accounted for 38 168 9 mm and 62 275 4 mm respectively of the total rainfall fig 4 a a total of 79 rainfall events occurred during the observation period and the maximum individual rainfall was 44 9 mm rainfall events with psum of 5 mm and 10 mm accounted for 67 0 and 85 8 of the total rainfall events respectively 87 6 of all events had a imax 2 mm 5 min fig 4b as shown in fig 4c rainfall in this area is characterized by small rainfall events with low rainfall intensity and high rainfall events with heavy rainfall intensity 3 2 characteristics of infiltration response types 3 2 1 occurrence frequency of infiltration response type vertical changes in soil moisture drt can characterize the temporal pattern of the water infiltration process a negative drt value indicates the occurrence of a non sequential preferential flow nsr on the hillslope wiekenkamp et al 2016 in addition as shown in table 2 approximately one fifth of the sequential response events had vmax greater than ks i e pf rate velocity based preferential flow the frequency of pfs nsr and pf rate showed an insignificant upward trend from the upslope 27 3 to the midslope 28 0 to the downslope 28 9 fig 5 a among them the frequency of nsr and pf rate gradually decreased and increased along the downhill direction respectively on the whole the frequency of pf rate was 1 4 2 7 times that of nsr the frequency of nsr did not differ significantly among different vegetation treatments but was the highest in bg and pf rate was more likely to occur in ck fig 5b most infiltration response types of all locations belonged to sr among which mbg was as high as 84 1 and mck was the lowest accounting for 55 5 fig 5c approximately 30 of infiltration events belonged to pf among which the frequency of nsr and pf rate was 4 8 13 9 and 10 1 30 6 respectively the occurrence frequency of the three response types all decreased with depth 3 2 2 controls of pf occurrence to assess the influence of rainfall characteristics and antecedent soil moisture conditions on different response behaviors the average value of each parameter in different infiltration response types was calculated table 3 among the three response types psum imax and iavg of the nsr event were the smallest while those corresponding to the pf rate event were significantly higher the d of rainfall events corresponding to pf was significantly lower than that of sr further the pre response rainfall characteristics rpsum rimax riavg were significantly different among nsr pf rate and sr different from psum the rpsum of sr events was 1 44 4 24 times that of nsr and pf rate events indicating that the initial rainfall required for triggering the sr event is significantly greater than that of pf the above results show that nsr is triggered mainly by small rainfall events with short duration while pf rate is triggered by heavy rainfall events with short duration in addition nsr and sr have similar θinit suggesting that θinit has no decisive effect on nsr however the θinit of pf rate events was significantly higher than that of sr events indicating that wet soil conditions are conducive to the occurrence of pf rate changes in pf frequency at all locations with rainfall characteristics and initial soil moisture content were further analyzed the results showed that the frequency of nsr generally decreased with increasing rpsum fig 6 a when rpsum 5 mm nsr occurred in only certain locations and when rpsum was 0 5 mm the probability of nsr occurrence was as high as 76 6 the frequency of pf rate at a specific location generally increased with increasing rain intensity fig 6b when imax was 2 4 mm 5 min and 4 mm 5 min the probability of pf rate was 32 1 and 51 9 respectively fig 7 showed that the occurrence frequency of nsr at most locations was higher when θinit was smaller and a few locations will promote the generation of nsr in wetter conditions however pf rate showed a trend of initial decline and subsequent rise with all locations reaching the extreme value under wet conditions in addition the frequency of pf differed among locations indicating that soil properties and vegetation cover also play an important role in the occurrence of pf the correlation between the occurrence frequency of pf and the spatial attributes showed fig 8 that the occurrence frequency of nsr was closely related to soil silt sand content and dg of the 5 cm layer similarly the frequency of pf rate was mainly affected by the content of soil silt sand dg and ks of the 10 cm soil layer vegetation cover fc showed opposite effects on the two types of pf the increase of fc can inhibit the occurrence of nsr but effectively promote the occurrence of pf rate bgb showed a positive effect on the occurrence of pf although the correlation was not significant in addition a significant correlation was observed between slope and soil parameters with correlation coefficients between 0 896 and 0 949 p 0 05 indicating that slope has a strong influence on soil properties 3 3 quantitative description of soil water increment and recession process the observed δθ was between 0 3 vol and 9 4 vol the distribution pattern of δθ along the soil profile varied for nsr pf rate and sr fig 9 during sr events the resistance of soil moisture response increased with depth but water could reach 20 cm and the soil moisture in the 40 cm soil layer of dsg also responded similarly δθ in pf rate decreased with depth and was mainly concentrated in shallow soils 5 cm and 10 cm however it greatly contributed to the increase of infiltration water accounting for 44 4 57 5 of the total infiltration water in the profile on the contrary no damping of δθ with depth was observed for nsr events and δθ at a depth of 20 cm was 1 0 7 3 times that at 10 cm δθr accounted for 49 3 33 4 and 17 3 of the total reduction during the pf rate sr and nsr events respectively moreover the k of different response types followed the order nsr sr pf rate fig 10 suggesting that pf rate can significantly increase the recession rate of soil moisture whereas nsr can slow down the loss of water for nsr events the k values of different slope segments followed the order midslope upslope downslope this indicates the absence of a certain regularity of the water recession velocity along the slope gradient which may be related to the pore distribution characteristics and the role of local micro topography the moisture loss of ck was the slowest in nsr according to the k values in different vegetation treatments for pf rate and sr the value of k followed the order downslope midslope upslope indicating that slope has an important effect on the redistribution of soil water in the sequence of response events famiglietti et al 1998 moreover for different vegetation treatments in a certain slope segment k decreased with increasing vegetation cover explaining that vegetation can significantly increase the rate of water recession in the sequence of response events 4 discussion 4 1 temporal controls of pf frequency this study found that the rainfall characteristics of the two types of pf i e nsr and pf rate were significantly different which was inconsistent with our initial hypothesis how easy the pf may be activated is strongly influenced by the initial soil moisture conditions liu and lin 2015 hopkins et al 2016 sanchez garcia et al 2020 therefore the timing of rainfall events was critical to trigger the onset of pf 4 1 1 non sequential response nsr many studies believed that pf occurs more frequently under dry conditions and with higher rainfall rainfall intensity koestel and jorda 2014 wiekenkamp et al 2016 demand et al 2019 this study found that nsr is more likely to occur during small rainfall events with short duration although the θinit had no significant effect on the occurrence of nsr table 3 most locations had the higher frequency of nsr under relatively dryer conditions fig 7 the generation and development of pf in soil requires appropriate conditions such as internal factors soil architecture and external driving force water input guo et al 2018 for undisturbed grassland soil macropore flow usually occurs at or near the surface petersen et al 2001 kulli et al 2003 because broken rocks in the soil hollow spaces occur around plant roots lin 2009 luo et al 2019 connected channels form of the decayed roots guo et al 2019 soil biological activities such as animal caves cheng et al 2017 and the drying wetting alternation of soil bachmair et al 2009 can lead to the generation of connected pore structures and pf channels furthermore vegetation litter root exudates and animal manure increase the organic matter content of soil 4 21 7 65 luo et al 2010b the generation and degradation of organic compounds in sandy and other coarse grained soils will lead to soil hydrophobicity simon et al 2009 the enhanced hydrophobicity under dry conditions can increase the resistance of soil to wetting thereby forcing water to funneled into open macropores within a short time after introduction of water source such as precipitation even with small rainfall ritsema and dekker 2000 goebel et al 2011 hardie et al 2011 hardie et al 2013 on the contrary the nsr frequencies of bg and sg in the midslope were higher when the θinit was relatively high the possible reasons are discussed in section 4 1 2 such site specific relationships about pf occurrence had a strong variability and can be true even for closely located soils which highlights the importance of small scale spatial features to the pf 4 1 2 velocity based preferential flow pf rate we found that the high intensity rainfall events with short duration that the study area often experiences and a higher θinit are more conducive to the occurrence of pf rate a higher abundance of pf during high θinit is consistent with the classic assumption of pf which should be triggered more often under wet conditions with a lower infiltrability mechanisms of enhancement by greater wetness include 1 the water pressure in the soil matrix is close to or exceeds the water entry pressure and push water moving to pf pathways jarvis 2007 2 a higher θinit can increase connectivity of soil macropores which enhance pf weiler and naef 2003 3 it can also restrain lateral water movement from pf pathways to the soil matrix buttle and mcdonald 2002 and 4 the hydraulic characteristics of the soil are more active in moist soil wang et al 2003 yao et al 2017 that during these wet conditions a higher rainfall intensity further promotes the initialization of pf in general a large rainfall of short duration and high intensity favors pf occurrence in soils because a higher water input intensity can lead to a more positive pressure potential in the topsoil gjettermann et al 1997 however arid and semi arid areas dominated by infiltration excess runoff doody et al 2010 higher rainfall intensity increases soil erodibility which increases the sediment carrying capacity of runoff and erosion force on the surface thus filling soil pores on and near the surface li and pan 2020 even so pf still occurs in macropores that filled with sediments which act as regions of interpenetrating conductive porous media scanlon 1992 nimmo 2021 4 2 spatial controls of pf frequency 4 2 1 hillslope location the frequency of pf is insensitive to terrain location likely because the slope represents only the steepness of the terrain whereas factors related the pf behavior such as micro topography and surface roughness are difficult to observe and measure directly graham and lin 2011 interestingly the frequency of pf rate increased significantly along the downhill direction which may be related to the larger contribution area i e water input conditions guo et al 2018 on the contrary the change of nsr showed a decreasing trend it may be because of the bulk density that relates to water transmission and water capacity nimmo 2021 budhathoki et al 2022 also showed that in grasslands runoff from the upslope may increase the degree of soil compaction in the downslope leading to changes in the soil macropore structure this suggests that slope features indirectly control the dynamics and intensity of pf by influencing soil properties hopkins et al 2016 4 2 2 soil property the results of correlation analysis showed that soil properties especially soil texture and soil hydraulic characteristics strongly affect pf fig 8 it is reported that soil texture influences the pore size spectrum of macropores kung et al 2006 the larger the mass fraction of sand in the soil are the pf path is more obvious and the pf intensity is greater buttle and mcdonald 2002 kung et al 2006 liu et al 2021 alaoui 2015 reported that the topsoil with coarser particle sizes plays a decisive role in the process of water flow with open macropores on the land surface as higher structural porosity is favorable for the formation of pf stumpp and maloszewski 2010 we also found that the distribution of soil particle size in the 0 5 cm soil layer had a significant effect on the generation of nsr furthermore the heterogeneity caused by soil texture by affecting soil layer patterns and soil hydraulic properties can initiate pf yan and zhao 2016 many studies showed that downward moving water can become unstable at textural interfaces when a fine textured layer above a coarse lower layer and move rapidly through coarse soil even if modest difference in grain size hardie et al 2013 in this study the topsoil that with lower soil sand content and hydraulic conductivity than those of the 5 10 cm soil layer restricts the downward movement of water this small scale heterogeneity and abrupt changes in hydraulic gradients within short distances can cause hydraulic instability in the soil promoting the occurrence of pf kishel and gerla 2010 hardie et al 2013 and wang et al 2018 also suggested that differences in soil structure and soil texture among soil layers can lead to unstable water movement this demonstrates the influence of small scale soil properties on pf behavior should be considered in the study of pf 4 2 3 vegetation characteristics surface cover is an important factor controlling water flow which strongly affects the response process of soil moisture bachmair et al 2009 the results showed that vegetation coverage fc tend to restrain the occurrence of nsr because water from small rainfall events is mainly lost through vegetation interception and evaporation when the fc is larger similar conclusions were made by stumpp et al 2007 and stumpp and maloszewski 2010 they also showed that bare farmland soil promotes pf occurrence in contrast the frequency of pf rate had a significant positive correlation with fc vegetation redistributes precipitation before it falls on the soil surface weakening the splash impact of raindrops and promoting the occurrence of pf by transporting rainfall to the soil near the stems johnson and lehmann 2006 furthermore vegetation cover can increase soil carbon contents which enhance soil hydrophobicity and soil fauna activity creating a soil environment that favors pf gjettermann et al 1997 as an important part of vegetation and soil root system is an important medium for the occurrence of preferential flow alaoui 2015 the results showed that the higher pf frequency was related to the higher belowground biomass bgb this was attributed to the complex root network formed by vegetation growth can effectively improve the soil structure and hydraulic properties hu et al 2020 shi et al 2021 and then have a positive impact on soil infiltration it is reported that soils with roots exhibited different soil physical properties and water infiltration behavior compared with rootless soils jiang et al 2018 huang et al 2016 studied on the rainfall infiltration in semi arid grassland and also found that root system was one of the main factors affecting soil infiltration rate and infiltration rate was positively correlated with bgb this is consistent with our conclusion in addition the stable macropores formed by plant roots and decayed roots can also promote the infiltration of precipitation into the deep soil cui et al 2019 guo et al 2019 the results of dye tracer experiments conducted in the field by jiang et al 2018 showed that a large proportion of the stained areas in the unrooted plot was confined to the 0 10 cm soil layer while the rooted plot was mainly concentrated in the upper 20 cm soil layer and the maximum stained width and stained area were significantly higher than that of the rootless area these findings suggest that the role of roots in water distribution has far reaching significance for the replenishment of soil moisture in arid ecosystems 4 3 effect of preferential flow on the increase and decrease process of soil moisture response in addition to the occurrence frequency of pf the importance of pf during infiltration was highlighted by the quantity of transported water indicated by the δθ δθ of nsr events gradually increased with depth fig 9 which implied water bypassing the topsoil matrix and reaching the deep layer directly hardie et al 2013 demand et al 2019 although δθ decreased with depth during pf rate events fig 9 it accounted for up to 50 that of the three types of infiltration responses and the pf rate frequency was 1 4 2 7 times higher than that of nsr alaoui 2015 also reported that pf contributed between 11 and 94 to the total infiltration results suggest that the pf is an important form of hydrological response and plays a decisive role in the ecological water balance of the region further there are certain differences in the recession process of soil moisture between two infiltration response types the largest δθr and water recession were observed for pf rate whereas the smallest values were observed for nsr this may be related to the initial soil water content of the recession process shang and mao 2014 found that the recession rate and cumulative reduction increased with increasing soil water content through simulating soil water recession in a farmland vegetation conditions also affect the decline of soil moisture rivera ramirez et al 2002 generally speaking the transpiration of vegetation will accelerate the loss of water the question arises why the lowest decreasing rate was observed in ck during nsr events first higher vegetation coverage can prevent the pore channels from being directly exposed to sunlight thus reducing the evaporation of soil moisture second macropores in sandy loam do not significantly affect soil evaporation zhou et al 2020 this phenomenon positively affects grassland ecosystems and their service functions 5 conclusions high frequency soil moisture monitoring profiles were established to identify the occurrence spatiotemporal controls of pf and the distribution characteristics of soil moisture among different infiltration response processes under different scenarios in a typical semi arid grassland hillslope the results showed that the frequency of pf was 15 9 44 5 of which the pf rate frequency was 1 4 2 7 times that of nsr the spatial and temporal controls of the two pfs occurrence were different by systematically analyzing we found that beside the open macropores affected by the coarser soil texture and roots in shallow soil layer nsr strongly depends on the initial state of soil lower initial soil water content and water repellency this leads to the occurrence of nsr even in small rainfall events and the vegetation coverage has insignificant inhibitory effect on nsr however pf rate is more inclined to occur in a higher rainfall intensity with wetter condition soil properties especially the soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity of 5 10 cm soil layer have obvious effects on the occurrence of pf rate vegetation coverage and belowground biomass also showed to promote the pf rate furthermore pf rate makes a greater contribution to infiltration water and the water recession rate is slower than that of matrix flow during nsr these findings emphasize the control mechanism of temporal factors and small scale spatial characteristics on different types of pf processes and the water replenishment of pf on areas with scarce rainfall the study highlights the necessity of a deeper understanding of pf processes for improving pf assessment on the hillslopes of typical semi arid grasslands which could provide a reference for related research furthermore modelers should consider different types of pf and their controls in research on related hydrological processes which would facilitate the establishment of the foundation for constructing accurate process based eco hydrological models on multi temporal and spatial scales funding this

3078,the driving factors of water exchange in the yangtze poyang river lake system yprls which is vital to the water resource management of yprls still remain unclear in this study the impacts of three major factors on the water exchange in the yprls from 1989 to 2016 were distinguished our results revealed that the catchment inflow into poyang lake cipl dominates the variations in q h the discharge of poyang lake s outflow contributing nearly 100 of the annual variation and evenly 120 of the seasonal variations the forcing of the yangtze river including the effect of operation of the three gorges dam tgd and effects of other yangtze related factors in addition to it stably explains approximately over 76 of the annual and seasonal variations in z h water level at the junction of the river and lake the sensitivity coefficient of the seasonal q h to the cipl and that of the seasonal z h to the forcing of the yangtze river varying with the seasons are 0 63 and 0 41 respectively furthermore the cipl induced and the yangtze induced frequency of the backflow from the river to the lake brl is 26 times and 7 times respectively specifically the frequency of brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s and 3000 m3 s is mainly affected by the cipl and the forcing of the yangtze river respectively the variations in the seasonal z h are speculated to be influenced by the water regime and the stage discharge relationships which may explain the stable dominate of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal z h and may affect the timing of autumn drought in the poyang lake our results may help to capture the main causes of complex hydrological changes in the yprls keywords water exchange attribution analysis yangtze poyang system multiple time scales backflow data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the connected river lake system in a river basin is an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle which drives the transportation of matter and energy in the basin lu et al 2021 zou et al 2017 xia et al 2017 charlesworth and foster 1996 recently the interaction between rivers and lakes has been altered by climate change and anthropogenic activities worldwide wu et al 2021 chen et al 2018 verdonschot et al 2013 milner et al 2012 nevertheless our understanding of the factors driving the water exchange in a river lake system which is crucial for maintaining and regulating the water and material transfer and for decision making related to catchment management is insufficient in many regions yang et al 2022 yang et al 2016 golden et al 2014 elisa et al 2010 kneis et al 2006 it is notable that some river lake systems contain large lakes which provide humanity with various important ecosystem services such as water supply and flood regulation on regional and global scales and these ecosystem services are significantly correlated to hydrological alteration li et al 2022 liu et al 2020 munar et al 2018 thus the hydrological alteration of a river lake system that contains a large lake has been a key topic in hydrology research in recent decades li et al 2022 liu et al 2020 munar et al 2018 milner et al 2012 since the dynamics of the water exchange in a river lake system containing a large lake are important for the hydrological alteration of such a river lake system it is crucial for quantifying the response of the water exchange to the anthropogenic and meteorological impacts in a river lake system that contains a large lake wu et al 2021 yang et al 2016 verdonschot et al 2013 the yangtze poyang river lake system yprls has global significance and comprises a large lake yang et al 2016 the yprls consists of the poyang lake and the middle reaches of the yangtze river the poyang lake and the yangtze river are the largest freshwater lake in china and the third longest river in the world respectively therefore investigating the characteristics of the variations in the water exchange in the yprls could help to reveal how the water exchange in this river lake system containing a large lake responds to the changing environment in the yprls the poyang lake receives inflow from five upstream tributaries and it empties into the yangtze river through the northern outlet chen et al 2018 dai et al 2015 the water exchange in the yprls is the basis for the sediment and nutrition transport while it mainly consists of the backflow from the river to the lake brl and the outflow from the poyang lake the water exchange in the yprls is usually represented by the discharge of poyang lake s outflow q h and the water level at the junction of the yangtze river and the poyang lake z h lu et al 2021 gao et al 2014 thus far drainage from the poyang lake into the yangtze river has mostly been observed but brl events occasionally occur jiang et al 2021 determined by the water regime of the yangtze river and the poyang lake q h usually peaks in the summer and decreases to the lowest in the early spring wang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 simultaneously the water exchange in the yprls is generally modified by the water level difference between the poyang lake and the yangtze river and thus a brl event tends to occur when the water level of the yangtze river is higher than that of the poyang lake mei et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 it is also notable that the water exchange influencing the water budget and the water level fluctuation of the poyang lake is modified by the impoundment and operation of the three gorges dam tgd in 2003 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 accordingly the hydrological regime water storage and ecosystem in the poyang lake basin changes after the tgd impoundment which is important for guaranteeing the water supply for agricultural irrigation domestic use and wetland ecosystem functions wang et al 2021 zhan et al 2017 qian et al 2016 in particular the autumn drought in the poyang lake which is facilitated by a higher q h and lower z h occurs earlier and lasts longer since the construction of the tgd wang et al 2019 mei et al 2015 gao et al 2014 guo et al 2012 nevertheless the mechanism of the variations in the water exchange in the yprls which has significance for the management of the poyang lake and is crucial to the maintenance of its main functions has not yet been quantitatively described the alteration of the water exchange in the yprls results from complicated interactions between multiple influencing factors while the catchment inflow into poyang lake cipl and the yangtze river streamflow are the most vital factors yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 extensive studies have considered the impacts of the tgd and have reported that the tgd operation is responsible for the more frequent droughts and floods in the poyang lake yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 furthermore some investigations of the variations in the water exchange in the yprls and the water regime of the poyang lake have been conducted in recent years li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 simulated the responses of the water exchange to the cipl and the yangtze river streamflow and hypothesized that increasing the cipl could cause the lake s outflow to increase yao et al 2018 simulated the spatiotemporal impacts of the local catchment and the yangtze river on typical seasonal low water level cases and found that the contributions of the catchment and the yangtze river are approximately 70 and 30 in the spring of 1963 and 5 and 95 in the autumn of 2006 respectively mei et al 2015 quantified the influence of the daily water budget on the average water level of the poyang lake and concluded that the average contribution of the regulation of the tgd to the recession of the poyang lake is 56 3 gao et al 2014 analyzed annual and seasonal data and reported that the climate change in the yangtze basin and the poyang lake watershed is the main factor determining the changes in the water exchange in the yprls additionally the yangtze river streamflow is affected by other influencing factors in addition to the tgd operation oifyr such as climate change and the operation of the cascade reservoirs while the effects of the oifyr influenced yangtze river streamflow on the carbon cycle water quality and ecosystem of the poyang lake have been continuously studied in recent years lu et al 2021 li et al 2019 wu et al 2017 however the distinction between the oifyr induced influence and the tgd induced influence on the water exchange in the yprls has not been sufficiently investigated song et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 dai et al 2015 guo et al 2012 moreover notwithstanding the fact that the water level at the northern outlet of the poyang lake has a considerable influence on the storage of the poyang lake the role of z h in the dynamics of the water exchange has not received sufficient attention accordingly a thorough investigation of the water exchange in the yprls that considers impact of the oifyr and quantifies the variations in z h would help to draw a more reasonable conclusion regarding the evolution of the hydrodynamic variations of the poyang lake such research may also help us gain a better understanding of the hydrological alteration of the poyang lake such as the trend of the autumn drought additionally the investigation would help resolve the debate regarding to what extent the tgd affects the droughts in the poyang lake in this study we coupled a hydrological model i e the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm and a statistical model i e the yangtze poyang water exchange statistical ypwes model to quantify the contributions of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl to the water exchange in the yprls the goal of this study is to investigate the daily seasonal and annual responses of the water exchange to multiple influencing factors over a long period furthermore the responses of the water exchange to three influencing factors were obtained based on scenario experiments and particular attention is paid to the variations in the water exchange when the autumn drought in the poyang lake and brl events occur we also calculated the sensitivity of the water exchange to three influencing factors to identify the most sensitive influencing factor of each water exchange indicator and to obtain a better understanding of the response of the water exchange in the yprls the main objectives of our study were 1 to investigate the variations in the water exchange in the yprls at multiple time scales 2 to quantify the effects of three influencing factors on the water exchange in the yprls and 3 to assess the contributions of three influencing factors to the water exchange in the yprls at multiple time scales this study aims at capturing the main factors causing the variations in the water exchange in the yprls which will help to improve the water resource management of the yprls and facilitating the hydrological study of river lake systems 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yprls is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river 115 50 116 50 e and 28 20 29 50 n and downstream of the tgd fig 1 the poyang lake is located on the south bank of the middle section of the yangtze river and it spans approximately 170 km from north to south and 74 km from east to west the poyang lake catchment is about 1 622 105 km2 and receives water from five upstream rivers the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers chen et al 2018 dai et al 2015 the only outlet that connects the poyang lake to the yangtze river is a narrow channel located at the north end of the poyang lake yao et al 2019 shankman et al 2006 in order to observe the hydrological regime of the poyang lake catchment and the yangtze river multiple hydrological stations and water level stations have been established

xingzi duchang wucheng poyang and kangshan stations additionally seven hydrological stations i e qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijuiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations have been set up to observe the inflow into the poyang lake from the five upstream rivers 2 2 data the establishment of the dtvgm mainly requires topographic data underlying surface data observed historical climate forcing data

duration at the daily scale during 1989 2016 https data cma cn the established dtvgm was calibrated and validated using the daily streamflow data from jiujiang station during 1989 2016 which were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources and the hydrological statistical year book the ypwes model was constructed based on the daily water level and discharge data from the gauging stations table 1 and these data were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources and the hydrological statistical yearbook the equivalent water level in the poyang lake region was computed using the data from five water level stations xingzi duchang wucheng kangshan and poyang stations the data from the hydrological stations that represent the inflow into the poyang lake qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations were collected to calculate the discharge of the cipl using statistical analysis and data from the literature li et al 2020 chen et al 2019 the water exchange in the yprls was represented by the observed discharge and water level at hukou station which is located at the junction of the poyang lake and the yangtze river and the yangtze river streamflow was represented by the daily observed discharge at jiujiang station 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological model in order to distinguish between the effects of the tgd operation and the oifyp a hydrological model was adopted to quantify the effects of the oifyr on the yangtze river streamflow this task was accomplished by establishing the dtvgm the dtvgm is a distributed hydrological system model that inputs the data for the sub basin including the slope flow direction river network basin boundary and land cover using the geographic information system gis digital elevation model dem the dtvgm simulates the runoff generation which is related to the variations in the soil moisture based on the storage and drainage equation and water balance equation while the flowing routing module is integrated with the conflux networks captured by adopting the dem xia 2005 xia et al 1997 xia 1991 overall the dtvgm is capable of capturing the flow at the outlet of the basin and simulating the spatial and temporal distributions of the features of the water cycle at the basin scale zeng et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 xia et al 2005 in the dtvgm the runoff generation module is based on the water balance principle while the relevant variables are calculated using the newton iteration method the confluence calculation for establishing scale free river networks is based on the dem and dynamic network theory subsequently the networks are divided into slope and river sections to conduct the confluence calculations the motion wave is adopted to calculate the process at each node which represents the runoff generating unit and then the simulation results are transmitted between the different nodes according to the topography of the river network the core equations of the dtvgm are eqs 1 6 1 p i w i w i 1 r s i e i r s s i r g i where p is precipitation mm w is soil moisture mm e is evaporation

coefficient of the cross section further details about the dtvgm model establishment have been provided in previous studies yang et al 2022 zeng et al 2020 in this study the dtvgm mainly took the impacts of the meteorological conditions and underlying surface conditions into account and then output the simulated variations in the daily streamflow of the yangtze river from 1989 to 2016 3 2 ypwes statistic model the water exchange in the yprls is complex due to the interactions between the yangtze river and the poyang lake the ypwes model was established to simulate the responses of the discharge and water level which were observed at the outlet of the poyang lake to show the variations in the cipl and the yangtze river streamflow chen et al 2022 the ypwes model which adopts a lumped framework is based on the correlation between the change in the discharge and the change in the water level and the water balance principle after derivation the six basic equations of the ypwes model are as follows 7 q h 1 c f q h 1 g q j z p c 1 a 1 q h 1 b 1 q j c 1 z p d 1 q j 2 e 1 z p 2 f 1 q j z p 9 z h c 2 a 2 q j b 2 q h c 2 z p d 2 q j 2 e 2 q h 2 f 2 z p 2 g 2 q j q h h 2 z p q h q h 2 c

ypwes model and the coefficients in eqs 7 9 and 10 are the parameters of the ypwes model because their values are determined by the user after calibrating the parameters and coefficients of the ypwes model the daily q j output from the dtvgm the daily observed values of q pin z p and q h which were observed on the first day of the simulation period were input into the ypwes model to output the simulated daily q h and z h the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient the coefficient of determination r2 and the root mean square error rmse were used to evaluate the model s performance 13 nse 1

values respectively 3 3 scenario experiments the coupling of the dtvgm and the ypwes model is the basis of the scenario experiments which were conducted to isolate the impacts of the three influencing factors on the water exchange in the yprls in order to accurately ascertain the effects of the three influencing factors by considering the construction of the tgd in 2003 and the duration of available data for the cipl the study period 1989 2016 was subdivided into two equal length periods 1989 2002 and 2003 2016 furthermore the observed streamflow of the yangtze river was used to represent the response of the yangtze river streamflow to the forcing of the yangtze river which reflects the net influence of the oifyr and the tgd operation while the yangtze river streamflow simulated using the dtvgm was used to represent the oifyr induced variations in the yangtze river streamflow subsequently six scenarios were constructed to conduct the experiments at the daily scale table 2 scenario s1 was the baseline scenario and the observed data from 1989 to 2002 was used scenario s2 used the simulated yangtze river streamflow from 2003 to 2016 and the cipl data from s1 to present the impact of the oifyr on the yangtze river streamflow scenario s3 used the data for the yangtze river streamflow from s1 and the cipl data from 2003 to 2016 to quantify the influence of the cipl scenario s4 used the simulated yangtze river streamflow from 2003 to 2016 and the cipl data from s3 to assess the impact of the oifyr and the impact of the cipl on the yangtze river streamflow scenario s5 used the observed streamflow of the yangtze river from 2003 to 2016 and the cipl data from s1 to evaluate the variations in the yangtze river streamflow finally scenario s6 used the observed data from 2003 to 2016 to calculate the impacts of the three influencing factors consequently the effects of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl on the water exchange were quantified using the results of the scenario experiments and the ypwes model the subscripts t o and c denote the variations in the daily q h and z h caused by the effects of the tgd the oifyr and the cipl respectively meanwhile the difference between simulated results of scenarios would exhibit the effect of each influencing factor while the discharge or water level simulated in the ith scenario is noted as si accordingly we quantified the impact of each factor by calculating the difference between simulated results of some chosen scenarios according to a certain scheme of scenario experiment the results of the scenario experiments were calculated to explain the net variations in the water exchange using equations 15 22 15 δ q o s 2 s 1 16 δ q t s 5 s 2 17 δ q c s 6 s 5 18 δ q h δ q o δ q

exchange at multiple time scales in this study the annual and seasonal q h and z h were calculated by averaging the amounts of the annual and seasonal q h and z h we calculated the variations in q h and z h after the tgd impoundment on the annual seasonal and daily scales based on the observed data table 3 the results show that the outflow from the poyang lake decreased by 639 m3 s after the impoundment of the tgd and the water level at the junction of the yangtze river and the poyang lake decreased by 0 97 m moreover since the tgd operation has an obvious effect on the seasonal streamflow of the yangtze river the variations in the water exchange on the seasonal scale were analyzed according to the scheduling rules of the tgd lai et al 2014 guo et al 2012 in detail the scheme of the tgd operation consists of four periods a supplement period a sluicing period a flood period and an impounding period zhao et al 2017 yao et al 2018 gao et al 2014 in the flood period which generally lasts from june to september the tgd impounds the flood water and suppresses the downstream streamflow in order to achieve flood regulation subsequently to impound a large amount of water in the three gorges reservoir tgr the tgd continues reducing the downstream streamflow during the impoundment period which lasts for approximately one month then the tgd maintains the downstream streamflow to supply water to the downstream yangtze basin during the supplement period from december to may eventually to reduce the water level at the head of the tgr the tgd increases the discharge ability during the sluicing period from may to june it should be noted that during each year the tgd operation progresses through these four periods in the following order the supplement period the sluicing period the flood period and the impoundment period moreover each period of the tgd operation basically coincides with a season this indicates that the tgd operation influences the downstream streamflow at the seasonal scale according to the observed data the observed changes in the seasonal q h during the supplement sluicing flood and impoundment periods of the tgd operation are 334 m3 s 69 m3 s 984 m3 s and 1386 m3 s respectively thus the seasonal q h is generally suppressed during the four periods after the impoundment of the tgd in addition the observed seasonal z h decreases by 0 64 m 0 69 m 1 17 m and 1 79 m in the supplement sluicing flood and impoundment periods respectively therefore the seasonal z h rather than the seasonal q h exhibits a stable downward trend with respect to the dynamics of the occurrence of daily brl events we selected a brl event with a particular backflow discharge for the frequency analysis and the step of the backflow discharge was taken as 1000 m3 s table 4 in this study if the mean q h is negative for multiple days the frequency of the occurrence of brl events is thought to increase by corresponding times thus according to the observation data most of the brl events occur from june to september and the frequency of the brl events in the pre tgd period is 35 times lower than that during the post tgd period furthermore the daily discharge of the brl events no longer exceeds 7000 m3 s after the impoundment of the tgd and the observed average discharge of the backflow is 2510 m3 s and 2453 m3 s before and after the impoundment of the tgd respectively consequently although the occurrence of brl events with a high backflow discharge is suppressed the frequency of brl events increases considerably after the impoundment of the tgd 4 2 model calibration and validation the calibration period and validation period of the two established models were 1989 2002 and 2003 2016 respectively the crucial parameters of the dtvgm model were determined based on the data for the calibration period table 5 while the performance of the dtvgm model was evaluated using the observed discharge data from jiujiang station during the simulation period fig 2 a furthermore the daily observed q h and z h from hukou station were used to calibrate and validate the ypwes model the crucial parameters of the ypwes were determined based on the data for the calibration period table 6 and the simulated results of the daily q h and z h are shown in fig 2b and 2c as shown in table 7 the simulation results of the dtvgm during the calibration period and the validation period have nse and r2 values of greater than 0 86 and 0 75 respectively and the flow process at jiujiang station simulated using the dtvgm is basically consistent with the actual process in addition the simulated results of the ypwes model during the calibration period and the validation period have nse and r2 values of over 0 93 and thus it effectively reproduces the variations in the daily q h and z h in general consequently it is concluded that the established dtvgm and ypwes models could be employed to quantify the responses of the yangtze river streamflow and the water exchange in the yprls to the impacts of multiple factors 4 3 contributions of the influencing factors the annual and seasonal changes in the q h and z h were simulated using the results of scenario experiments and the contributions of the three influencing factors to the changes in q h and z h were also simulated figs 3 5 the simulation results show that the annual q h decreases by 21 m3 s 15 m3 s and 567 m3 s under the influence of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl respectively and these factors can explain 3 71 2 66 and 101 05 of the variations in the annual q h respectively evidently the variations in the annual average q h are mainly controlled by the cipl while the tgd operation and the oifyr make similar absolute contributions to the water exchange in the yprls moreover with respect to the seasonal variations the simulated variations in the average q h in the supplement sluicing flood and impoundment periods of the tgd operation are 302 m3 s 107 m3 s 985 m3 s and 1042 m3 s respectively in addition on average the impacts of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl could explain 30 39 10 24 and 120 16 of the seasonal variations in q h respectively thus the influence of the cipl on the variations in q h is less dominant at the seasonal scale than at the annual scale because the impacts of the tgd operation and the oifyr are larger at the seasonal scale than at the annual scale furthermore although the increase in the seasonal q h is facilitated by the tgd operation during both the impoundment period and the flood period only the impounding period of the tgd operation coincides with the occurrence of the autumn drought in the poyang lake wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 the simulation results show that annual z h decreases by 0 62 m the impacts of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl lead to annual z h changes by 0 01 m 0 47 m and 0 14 m respectively accounting for 1 61 75 81 and 22 58 of the variations in the annual z h thus the influence of the forcing of the yangtze river on the annual z h is significantly larger than that of the cipl in addition the simulated seasonal z h decreases by 0 17 m 0 35 m 1 15 m and 1 30 m during the supplement sluicing flood and impoundment periods of the tgd operation respectively on average the impacts of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl account for 113 97 189 18 and 24 79 of the seasonal variations in the z h respectively overall the contribution of the cipl to the seasonal and annual variations in the z h is generally the smallest while that of the oifyr is basically the largest contributor to the seasonal and annual variations in the z h specifically the oifyr is the most significant influencing factor from the impounding period to the sluicing period while the tgd operation is the most significant influencing factor during the flood period nevertheless during the impoundment period the influence of the tgd operation leads to the most drastic decrease in the seasonal z h while the impacts of the cipl and the oifyr made minor contributions to the seasonal z h 4 4 sensitivity coefficients of the water exchange to influencing factors the monthly sensitivity coefficients of the water exchange in the yprls to the three influencing factors were calculated using the results of scenario experiments the sensitivity coefficient of the water exchange was calculated for each influencing factor using the ratio of the relative changes in the q h and z h to the relative changes in the q j and q pin caused by the three influencing factors the water exchange s monthly sensitivity coefficients for each influencing factor are shown in figs 6 and 7 according to the linear relationships under the impacts of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl the sensitivity coefficients of q h to q j and q pin are 0 065 0 108 and 0 634 respectively in addition the sensitivity coefficient of z h to q j is 0 416 under the influence of the oifyr however the corresponding sensitivity coefficients of the seasonal z h to q j are 0 570 and 0 124 when q j and q pin are reduced by the impacts of the tgd operation and the cipl respectively otherwise they are 0 254 and 0 0385 respectively overall the sensitivity coefficients of the seasonal q h to the cipl and that of the seasonal z h to the forcing of the yangtze river which varies with the seasons are 0 634 and 0 416 respectively additionally the relative change in the monthly q h is positively correlated to the change in the monthly q pin and the linear relationship between them is strong with an r2 value of 0 8 in contrast a weaker linear relationship exists between the relative change in the monthly q h and the relative change in the monthly q j and the latter is generally negatively correlated with the former furthermore the relative change in the monthly z h is more closely related to the relative change in the monthly q j r2 0 89 than to the relative change in the monthly q pin r2 0 75 consequently the yangtze river streamflow and the discharge of the cipl are significantly correlated with z h at the monthly scale and the discharge of the cipl is significantly correlated with q h at the monthly scale nevertheless the relationship between the yangtze river streamflow and q h at the monthly scale is negligible 4 5 variations in the brl events in different scenarios the simulated results of daily backflow discharge based on the results of the scenario experiments are shown in fig 8 it is evident that the simulated daily backflow discharge which occasionally exceeds 6000 m3 s before the impoundment of the tgd no longer exceeds 6000 m3 s after the tgd operation began additionally the average discharge of the backflow is 2515 m3 s and 2022 m3 s in scenarios s1 and s6 respectively thus the simulated daily discharge of the backflow in the yprls drastically decreases after the impoundment of the tgd thus the results show that daily brl events occur 69 times 89 times 120 times 99 times 80 times and 95 times in scenarios s1 s6 respectively as shown in fig 9 a the brl events with a backflow discharge of 1000 m3 s between 1000 m3 s and 3000 m3 s and 3000 m3 s have basically similar frequency and the frequency of the brl events with a backflow discharge of 6000 m3 s is very low therefore the brl events in each scenario were divided into four groups a low backflow discharge group 1000 m3 s a medium backflow discharge group 1000 3000 m3 s a high backflow discharge group 3000 6000 m3 s and an extreme backflow discharge group 6000 m3 s nevertheless the simulation errors of the daily q h have a non negligible impact on the identification of the brl events thus impacts of the three influencing factors on the brl events were computed for considering each scenario to quantify the dynamics of the frequency of the brl events with specific backflow discharge ranges as is illustrated in fig 9b the frequency of the brl events increases by 25 times 0 times and 7 times under the influence of the cipl the oifyr and the tgd operation respectively furthermore the influence of the cipl mainly increases the frequency of the brl events with low and medium backflow discharge by 10 times while the frequency of the brl events with low backflow discharge is increased by the tgd operation and the oifyr by 14 times and 10 times respectively these factors also suppress the frequency of the brl events with extreme backflow discharge by 4 times in particular the increase of frequency of the brl events with high backflow discharge which is as high as 8 times is mainly induced by the tgd operation 5 discussions 5 1 characteristics of the contribution of every influencing factor the interactions between the river and the lake are important for the hydrological changes in a river lake system and the changing environment has led to obvious variations in the water exchange in river lake systems which has become a matter of great concern worldwide in recent years in this study the contributions of the influencing factors to the variations in the water exchange in the yprls on multiple time scales during 1989 2016 were quantified based on the distinguished effects of the three factors the simulation results of the daily q h and z h have a satisfactory accuracy and they exhibit decreasing trends at the annual and seasonal scales and daily discharge of the backflow in the yprls exhibits a decreasing trend these trends are consistent with the observed variations at the different time scales in general furthermore the simulated decrease in the seasonal q h is initially suppressed and then promoted by the influencing factors during the four periods of the tgd operation which is consistent with the trend of the observed seasonal q h in addition both the observed and simulated decreases in the seasonal z h are facilitated by the influencing factors during the four periods in particular the observed restriction of the discharge of the backflow caused by the tgd operation also exists in the simulation results although the simulated results underestimate the upper limit of the tgd influenced backflow discharge by 1000 m3 s this error is acceptable because only two underestimated backflow events occur while more than 80 brl events occur after the impoundment of the tgd fig 8 therefore the simulation results generally reflect the accurate trend of the water exchange at multiple time scales the accurately simulated results are used in the evaluation of the impacts of each influencing factor on the q h and z h on different time scales as shown in figs 3 4 and 5 the influence of the cipl generally decreases q h and z h at the annual and seasonal scales but overall this influence leads to the higher frequency of brl events since the influence of the cipl always increases the q h and z h the influence of the cipl has a stable effect on the water exchange in the yprls in contrast the influence of the forcing of the yangtze river makes a variable contribution to the variations in the seasonal q h since it is not constantly favorable or detrimental to an increase in the seasonal q h nevertheless the forcing of the yangtze river explains an average of 76 of the decrease in z h at the seasonal scale it is noteworthy that the tgd operation and the oifyr had opposite effects on the seasonal q h and z h in general figs 3 and 4 which may be due to that the effects of the tgd operation and the oifyr are not completely independent specifically since the tgd operation is partially determined by the oifyr influenced upstream inflow the seasonal impacts of the tgd operation and the oifyr on the downstream streamflow of the yangtze river are bound to be interrelated to a certain extent wang et al 2020 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 gao et al 2014 moreover the seasonal variations in the z h rather than the seasonal variations in the q h generally exhibit a stable response to the forcing of the yangtze river which may be due to the primary influence of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal variations in the z h although previous studies mainly focus on the response of the dynamics of the water exchange in the yprls to the regulated yangtze river streamflow and the changing discharge of the cipl in this study we found that the water exchange exhibits distinct sensitivities to the influencing factors which can be used to evaluate the impacts of the influencing factors li et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 the monthly variations in z h are more sensitive to the yangtze induced monthly variations in q j while the monthly variations in q h are more sensitive to the cipl induced monthly variations in q pin evidently at the monthly scale q h and z h are mainly sensitive to the influencing factor that has a stable influence on them furthermore it is noteworthy that the sensitivity coefficient of the monthly z h to the tgd influenced monthly q j is the highest when the yangtze river streamflow is hindered by the tgd operation whilst this sensitivity coefficient significantly decreases when the yangtze river streamflow is increased by the tgd operation thus the influence of the tgd operation decreases z h easily but has more difficulty increasing it at the monthly scale which indicates that the tgd induced decline in the seasonal z h may have been more significant since a lower z h would promote the droughts in the poyang lake we suggest that the tgd operation should be planned carefully zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 lai et al 2014 5 2 comparison of the contributions at annual and seasonal scale in order to better analyze the major factor influencing the water exchange in the yprls comparisons of the impacts of the factors on different time scales were conducted according to the simulation results shown in figs 3 and 4 the cipl has the most vital influence on the variations in q h and it explains 101 05 of the annual variations and 120 16 of the seasonal variations which is consistent with the results of a previous study zheng et al 2015 nevertheless although the decrease in the seasonal q h is also mainly affected by the influence of the cipl the influence of the cipl on q h is less significant at the seasonal scale than at the annual scale which may be due to the appropriate combination of the cipl and the water level difference between the poyang lake and the yangtze river at the seasonal scale yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 notably the tgd operation which has a minor influence on the seasonal q h is the only influencing factor that facilitates the outflow from the poyang lake during the impoundment period in contrast the influence of the tgd operation makes the largest and predominant contribution to the decrease in the seasonal z h during the impoundment period this can be explained by the fact that the seasonal z h is the most sensitive to the tgd operation during the impoundment period when the yangtze river streamflow is hindered by the operation of the tgd fig 7 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 thus since the autumn drought in the poyang lake is promoted by the increase in q h and the decrease in z h the tgd operation may have been the only influencing factor that completely increases the severity of the autumn drought in the poyang lake yao et al 2019 furthermore at the junction of the yangtze river and the poyang lake z h is simultaneously influenced by the yangtze river streamflow and the poyang lake s outflow zhang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 as shown in fig 4 the tgd induced decrease in the yangtze river streamflow and the tgd induced increase in the poyang lake s outflow occur during the flood and impoundment periods respectively however as shown in fig 5 the tgd induced seasonal z h decreases and increases during the impoundment period and the flood period respectively which indicates that the net effect of the yangtze river streamflow and the poyang lake s outflow on z h varies in the different seasons the variations in these effects can be explained by the difference between the stage discharge relationship of the yangtze river streamflow and that of the poyang lake s outflow first drastic decreases in the seasonal q j and q h occurred in certain seasons which are mainly due to the water regime of the middle of the yangtze river basin and that of the poyang lake basin wang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 specifically according to the observed data displayed in figs 3 and 4 before the impoundment of the tgd the seasonal q j during the impoundment period is about 10000 m3 s lower than that during the flood period and the decrease in the seasonal q h between the two periods is only about 3000 m3 s furthermore the response pattern of the water level to the discharge of the yangtze river streamflow is similar to that of the water level to the discharge of the cipl that is the water level is more sensitive to the variations in the low discharge chen et al 2021 huang et al 2017 thus it can be reasonably speculated that the decrease in the seasonal z h caused by the tgd operation is less significant than the cipl induced increase in the seasonal z h during the flood period but it exceeds the latter in the impoundment period accordingly the appropriate dissimilarities in the seasonal decreases in the discharge and stage discharge relationship in the yprls may determine the dynamics of the seasonal z h the dynamic mechanism of the seasonal z h also affects the timing of the autumn drought in the poyang lake since the lower z h facilitates the outflow from the poyang lake this indicates that understanding the dynamic mechanism of the seasonal z h is important wang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 mei et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the stage discharge relationship observed at hukou station is very complex and it can be explained by the fact that the seasonal variations in z h and q h are mainly determined by the forcing of the yangtze river and the cipl respectively huang et al 2017 furthermore previous studies have determined that the tgd induced changes in the water level reduction in the yangtze river channel is obvious during the impoundment period which is consistent with the results of the scenario experiments li et al 2019 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 therefore the proposed mechanism of water fluctuation at hukou station is supported by the results of the existing research but the reason for the different tgd induced seasonal variations in z h during the flood and impoundment periods requires a quantitative description 5 3 comparison of the contributions at daily scale in order to better understand the dynamics of the water exchange in the yprls at a finer time scale the contributions at the daily scale were analyzed with respect to the brl events previous studies have reported that the occurrence of brl events is increased and suppressed by the increase in the yangtze river streamflow and the cipl s discharge respectively li et al 2016 accordingly as shown in fig 10 the daily q j and q pin from june to september exhibit drastic reductions after the impoundment of the tgd which indicates that the change in the cipl s discharge and the change in the yangtze river streamflow promote and impede the occurrence of brl events respectively thus since the net influence of the cipl and the forcing of the yangtze river increases the frequency of brl events by 26 times the influence of the cipl should have increased it by more than 26 times which is generally consistent with the speculated variation illustrated in fig 9b given that the net influence of the forcing of the yangtze river decreases the frequency of the brl events the influence of the oifyr should be less significant than the influence of the tgd operation which decreases the frequency of the brl events by 7 times thus the speculated influence of the oifyr which decreases the frequency of the brl events by 0 times is acceptable overall the frequency of the brl events changes by more than 26 times 7 times and 0 times under the influence of the cipl the tgd operation and the oifyr respectively furthermore the cipl induced increase in the frequency of the brl events mainly involves the brl event with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s in contrast influenced by the forcing of the yangtze river the frequency of the brl events with high and extreme backflow discharge increases by 8 times and 8 times respectively simultaneously under the impact of the cipl the frequency of the brl events with high and extreme backflow discharge increases by 3 times and 2 times respectively therefore the brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s are mainly influenced by the forcing of the yangtze river the decrease in the frequency of the extreme brl events may be explained by the decrease in the yangtze river streamflow moreover the occurrence of brl events with high backflow discharge is mainly affected by the operation of the tgd fig 9 we speculate that the tgd induced increase in the brl events only occurs when the influence of the tgd operation is more significant than the influence of the cipl for the brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s the tgd operation has the largest negative effect on the frequency which is also the result of the decrease in the yangtze river streamflow because the yangtze river streamflow has basically decreased in the flood impoundment period since the tgd operation began yang et al 2016 although the net contribution of the tgd operation and the oifyr to the frequency of the brl events is less significant than the influence of the cipl each of them has an individual impact on the frequency of the brl events which is equivalent to the effect of the cipl this indicates that the relevance of the influence of the tgd and the influence of the cipl may result in their net influence being smaller than their individual impacts overall the impacts of the cipl and the forcing of the yangtze river are the main factors influencing the brl events with backflow discharge less than and greater than 3000 m3 s respectively the net contribution of the tgd operation and the oifyr to the frequency of the brl events is small due to their unequal and opposite impacts on the brl events the implications of the forcing of the yangtze river for the occurrence of brl events have been recognized for decades that is the occurrence of brl events has generally decreased since the impoundment of the tgd wu et al 2021 yang et al 2016 chen et al 2018 therefore our results which suggest that not only the frequency of the brl events but also the magnitude of the mean backflow discharge exhibits obvious decreases after the emplacement of the tgd are consistent with the conclusions of previous studies and the observation data furthermore since it is found in this study that the occurrence of the brl events with different backflow discharge is mainly affected by the forcing of the yangtze river and influence of the cipl respectively the findings of this study may help to improve our understanding of the brl events and in the management of the flood events in the poyang lake 5 4 limitations and future researches in this study the impacts of three factors on water exchange in the yprls at multiple time scales are distinguished and quantitatively analyzed we mainly assess the effects of the major factors influencing the water exchange but some minor influencing factors such as sand mining at the northern flow channel of the poyang lake are ignored yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 according to previous studies the impacts of sand mining and channel erosion do not play major roles in the variations in water exchange in the yprls yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 however the results of the attribution analysis would be further improved by taking these factors into account in our investigation the simulated tgd induced and oifyr induced seasonal variations in the q h and z h are generally reasonable and they are basically consistent with the dynamics of the q h and z h reported by previous studies yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 it should be noted that the estimations of the tgd induced and oifyr induced impacts are influenced by their intrinsic connection to a certain extent zhao et al 2017 yao et al 2018 nevertheless the dominant influence of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal variations in z h is not affected by the intrinsic connection between the tgd induced and oifyr induced impacts similarly the response of the brl events with high backflow discharge to the effect of the forcing of the yangtze river which is revealed by our analysis is also free from the intrinsic connection between the tgd induced and oifyr induced impacts therefore the intrinsic connection between the tgd induced and oifyr induced impacts does not significantly affect the estimation of the influence of the forcing of the yangtze river however making a more accurate distinction between the contributions of the tgd operation and the oifyr would lead to a better understanding of their impacts our research reveals that the forcing of the yangtze river and the influence of the cipl dominate the dynamics of the z h and q h respectively although the relationship between q h and the cipl has been identified in previous studies the dynamic mechanism of z h has received less attention wang et al 2018 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 it should be noted that the changes in the yangtze river streamflow and the changes in the discharge of the cipl exhibit the same trend during the flood period and impoundment period of the tgd operation but this leads to an unequal variation in the seasonal changes in z h since the dynamics of the poyang lake s water resources are partially controlled by z h more research on the mechanism of the seasonal fluctuations in z h are required thus the results of our study may lead to a speculation that the mechanism of water level fluctuation at the junction of a large river and a large lake may be very complex which would influence the water storage in the large lake however case studies are needed to evaluate the universality of this speculation for example an investigation of the water exchange in the yangtze river dongting lake system would be helpful since the dongting lake is a large freshwater lake and has a natural connection with to the yangtze river zou et al 2019 overall the investigation of water exchange in river lake systems that contain a large lake would help us to better understand how and to what extent the changes in the environment influence the water exchange in the river lake system 6 conclusion in this study the influence of each factor was thoroughly quantified based on scenario experiments to draw a comprehensive and reasonable conclusion the outflow of the poyang lake generally exhibits a decreasing trend on the annual and seasonal scales and the influence of the cipl explains more than 100 of its variations on average over 76 of the annual and seasonal variations in the water level at the junction of the yangtze river and the poyang lake are caused by the net effect of the tgd operation and the oifyr and their individual effects are generally opposite and thus offset each other in addition the sensitivity coefficient of the seasonal q h to the cipl and that of the seasonal z h to the forcing of the yangtze river which varies seasonally are 0 634 and 0 416 on average respectively on the daily scale the frequency of the brl events changes by more than 26 times 7 times and 0 times under the influence of the cipl the tgd operation and the oifyr respectively in detail the influence of the cipl mainly affects the brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s while the frequency of the brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s is mainly influenced by the forcing of the yangtze river in addition we speculate that the seasonal variations in z h involves the water regime and stage discharge relationships which may help to explain the stability of the major impacts of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal z h the mechanism of the seasonal variations in z h also determined whether the occurrence of the autumn drought in the poyang lake would occur earlier we believe the revealed dynamics and mechanisms can be used as a reference to help solve the water issues in the yprls overall the response mechanism of z h is complex and it may be partially related to the water regime and stage discharge relationships in addition the connection between the influence of the tgd operation and that of the oifyr has a large impact on the stability of the effect of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal z h and the variations in the brl events since the variations in the brl events and the z h are important to the sediment transport duration of flooding and timing of the autumn drought in the poyang lake more detailed studies of their mechanisms may be helpful in solving the water issues in the yprls credit authorship contribution statement minghao chen

3078,the driving factors of water exchange in the yangtze poyang river lake system yprls which is vital to the water resource management of yprls still remain unclear in this study the impacts of three major factors on the water exchange in the yprls from 1989 to 2016 were distinguished our results revealed that the catchment inflow into poyang lake cipl dominates the variations in q h the discharge of poyang lake s outflow contributing nearly 100 of the annual variation and evenly 120 of the seasonal variations the forcing of the yangtze river including the effect of operation of the three gorges dam tgd and effects of other yangtze related factors in addition to it stably explains approximately over 76 of the annual and seasonal variations in z h water level at the junction of the river and lake the sensitivity coefficient of the seasonal q h to the cipl and that of the seasonal z h to the forcing of the yangtze river varying with the seasons are 0 63 and 0 41 respectively furthermore the cipl induced and the yangtze induced frequency of the backflow from the river to the lake brl is 26 times and 7 times respectively specifically the frequency of brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s and 3000 m3 s is mainly affected by the cipl and the forcing of the yangtze river respectively the variations in the seasonal z h are speculated to be influenced by the water regime and the stage discharge relationships which may explain the stable dominate of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal z h and may affect the timing of autumn drought in the poyang lake our results may help to capture the main causes of complex hydrological changes in the yprls keywords water exchange attribution analysis yangtze poyang system multiple time scales backflow data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the connected river lake system in a river basin is an important component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle which drives the transportation of matter and energy in the basin lu et al 2021 zou et al 2017 xia et al 2017 charlesworth and foster 1996 recently the interaction between rivers and lakes has been altered by climate change and anthropogenic activities worldwide wu et al 2021 chen et al 2018 verdonschot et al 2013 milner et al 2012 nevertheless our understanding of the factors driving the water exchange in a river lake system which is crucial for maintaining and regulating the water and material transfer and for decision making related to catchment management is insufficient in many regions yang et al 2022 yang et al 2016 golden et al 2014 elisa et al 2010 kneis et al 2006 it is notable that some river lake systems contain large lakes which provide humanity with various important ecosystem services such as water supply and flood regulation on regional and global scales and these ecosystem services are significantly correlated to hydrological alteration li et al 2022 liu et al 2020 munar et al 2018 thus the hydrological alteration of a river lake system that contains a large lake has been a key topic in hydrology research in recent decades li et al 2022 liu et al 2020 munar et al 2018 milner et al 2012 since the dynamics of the water exchange in a river lake system containing a large lake are important for the hydrological alteration of such a river lake system it is crucial for quantifying the response of the water exchange to the anthropogenic and meteorological impacts in a river lake system that contains a large lake wu et al 2021 yang et al 2016 verdonschot et al 2013 the yangtze poyang river lake system yprls has global significance and comprises a large lake yang et al 2016 the yprls consists of the poyang lake and the middle reaches of the yangtze river the poyang lake and the yangtze river are the largest freshwater lake in china and the third longest river in the world respectively therefore investigating the characteristics of the variations in the water exchange in the yprls could help to reveal how the water exchange in this river lake system containing a large lake responds to the changing environment in the yprls the poyang lake receives inflow from five upstream tributaries and it empties into the yangtze river through the northern outlet chen et al 2018 dai et al 2015 the water exchange in the yprls is the basis for the sediment and nutrition transport while it mainly consists of the backflow from the river to the lake brl and the outflow from the poyang lake the water exchange in the yprls is usually represented by the discharge of poyang lake s outflow q h and the water level at the junction of the yangtze river and the poyang lake z h lu et al 2021 gao et al 2014 thus far drainage from the poyang lake into the yangtze river has mostly been observed but brl events occasionally occur jiang et al 2021 determined by the water regime of the yangtze river and the poyang lake q h usually peaks in the summer and decreases to the lowest in the early spring wang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 simultaneously the water exchange in the yprls is generally modified by the water level difference between the poyang lake and the yangtze river and thus a brl event tends to occur when the water level of the yangtze river is higher than that of the poyang lake mei et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 it is also notable that the water exchange influencing the water budget and the water level fluctuation of the poyang lake is modified by the impoundment and operation of the three gorges dam tgd in 2003 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 accordingly the hydrological regime water storage and ecosystem in the poyang lake basin changes after the tgd impoundment which is important for guaranteeing the water supply for agricultural irrigation domestic use and wetland ecosystem functions wang et al 2021 zhan et al 2017 qian et al 2016 in particular the autumn drought in the poyang lake which is facilitated by a higher q h and lower z h occurs earlier and lasts longer since the construction of the tgd wang et al 2019 mei et al 2015 gao et al 2014 guo et al 2012 nevertheless the mechanism of the variations in the water exchange in the yprls which has significance for the management of the poyang lake and is crucial to the maintenance of its main functions has not yet been quantitatively described the alteration of the water exchange in the yprls results from complicated interactions between multiple influencing factors while the catchment inflow into poyang lake cipl and the yangtze river streamflow are the most vital factors yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 extensive studies have considered the impacts of the tgd and have reported that the tgd operation is responsible for the more frequent droughts and floods in the poyang lake yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 furthermore some investigations of the variations in the water exchange in the yprls and the water regime of the poyang lake have been conducted in recent years li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 simulated the responses of the water exchange to the cipl and the yangtze river streamflow and hypothesized that increasing the cipl could cause the lake s outflow to increase yao et al 2018 simulated the spatiotemporal impacts of the local catchment and the yangtze river on typical seasonal low water level cases and found that the contributions of the catchment and the yangtze river are approximately 70 and 30 in the spring of 1963 and 5 and 95 in the autumn of 2006 respectively mei et al 2015 quantified the influence of the daily water budget on the average water level of the poyang lake and concluded that the average contribution of the regulation of the tgd to the recession of the poyang lake is 56 3 gao et al 2014 analyzed annual and seasonal data and reported that the climate change in the yangtze basin and the poyang lake watershed is the main factor determining the changes in the water exchange in the yprls additionally the yangtze river streamflow is affected by other influencing factors in addition to the tgd operation oifyr such as climate change and the operation of the cascade reservoirs while the effects of the oifyr influenced yangtze river streamflow on the carbon cycle water quality and ecosystem of the poyang lake have been continuously studied in recent years lu et al 2021 li et al 2019 wu et al 2017 however the distinction between the oifyr induced influence and the tgd induced influence on the water exchange in the yprls has not been sufficiently investigated song et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 dai et al 2015 guo et al 2012 moreover notwithstanding the fact that the water level at the northern outlet of the poyang lake has a considerable influence on the storage of the poyang lake the role of z h in the dynamics of the water exchange has not received sufficient attention accordingly a thorough investigation of the water exchange in the yprls that considers impact of the oifyr and quantifies the variations in z h would help to draw a more reasonable conclusion regarding the evolution of the hydrodynamic variations of the poyang lake such research may also help us gain a better understanding of the hydrological alteration of the poyang lake such as the trend of the autumn drought additionally the investigation would help resolve the debate regarding to what extent the tgd affects the droughts in the poyang lake in this study we coupled a hydrological model i e the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm and a statistical model i e the yangtze poyang water exchange statistical ypwes model to quantify the contributions of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl to the water exchange in the yprls the goal of this study is to investigate the daily seasonal and annual responses of the water exchange to multiple influencing factors over a long period furthermore the responses of the water exchange to three influencing factors were obtained based on scenario experiments and particular attention is paid to the variations in the water exchange when the autumn drought in the poyang lake and brl events occur we also calculated the sensitivity of the water exchange to three influencing factors to identify the most sensitive influencing factor of each water exchange indicator and to obtain a better understanding of the response of the water exchange in the yprls the main objectives of our study were 1 to investigate the variations in the water exchange in the yprls at multiple time scales 2 to quantify the effects of three influencing factors on the water exchange in the yprls and 3 to assess the contributions of three influencing factors to the water exchange in the yprls at multiple time scales this study aims at capturing the main factors causing the variations in the water exchange in the yprls which will help to improve the water resource management of the yprls and facilitating the hydrological study of river lake systems 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yprls is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river 115 50 116 50 e and 28 20 29 50 n and downstream of the tgd fig 1 the poyang lake is located on the south bank of the middle section of the yangtze river and it spans approximately 170 km from north to south and 74 km from east to west the poyang lake catchment is about 1 622 105 km2 and receives water from five upstream rivers the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers chen et al 2018 dai et al 2015 the only outlet that connects the poyang lake to the yangtze river is a narrow channel located at the north end of the poyang lake yao et al 2019 shankman et al 2006 in order to observe the hydrological regime of the poyang lake catchment and the yangtze river multiple hydrological stations and water level stations have been established three stations jiujiang station hukou station and balijiang station are located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river five water level stations are evenly distributed in the poyang lake region xingzi duchang wucheng poyang and kangshan stations additionally seven hydrological stations i e qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijuiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng stations have been set up to observe the inflow into the poyang lake from the five upstream rivers 2 2 data the establishment of the dtvgm mainly requires topographic data underlying surface data observed historical climate forcing data

located at the junction of the poyang lake and the yangtze river and the yangtze river streamflow was represented by the daily observed discharge at jiujiang station 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological model in order to distinguish between the effects of the tgd operation and the oifyp a hydrological model was adopted to quantify the effects of the oifyr on the yangtze river streamflow this task was accomplished by establishing the dtvgm the dtvgm is a distributed hydrological system model that inputs the data for the sub basin including the slope flow direction river network basin boundary and land cover using the geographic information system gis digital elevation model dem the dtvgm simulates the runoff generation which is related to the variations in the soil moisture based on the storage and drainage equation and water balance equation while the flowing routing module is integrated with the conflux networks captured by adopting the dem xia 2005 xia et al 1997 xia 1991 overall the dtvgm is capable of capturing the flow at the outlet of the basin and simulating the spatial and temporal distributions of the features of the water cycle at the basin scale zeng et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 xia et al 2005 in the dtvgm the runoff generation module is based on the water balance principle while the relevant variables are calculated using the newton iteration method the confluence calculation for establishing scale free river networks is based on the dem and dynamic network theory subsequently the networks are divided into slope and river sections to conduct the confluence calculations the motion wave is adopted to calculate the process at each node which represents the runoff generating unit and then the simulation results are transmitted between the different nodes

impacts of the meteorological conditions and underlying surface conditions into account and then output the simulated variations in the daily streamflow of the yangtze river from 1989 to 2016 3 2 ypwes statistic model the water exchange in the yprls is complex due to the interactions between the yangtze river and the poyang lake the ypwes model was established to simulate the responses of the discharge and water level which were observed at the outlet of the poyang lake to show the variations in the cipl and the yangtze river streamflow chen et al 2022 the ypwes model which adopts a lumped framework is based on the correlation between the change in the discharge and the change in the water level and the water balance principle after derivation the six basic equations of the ypwes model

factors on the water exchange in the yprls in order to accurately ascertain the effects of the three influencing factors by considering the construction of the tgd in 2003 and the duration of available data for the cipl the study period 1989 2016 was subdivided into two equal length periods 1989 2002 and 2003 2016 furthermore the observed streamflow of the yangtze river was used to represent the response of the yangtze river streamflow to the forcing of the yangtze river which reflects the net influence of the oifyr and the tgd operation while the yangtze river streamflow simulated using the dtvgm was used to represent the oifyr induced variations in the yangtze river streamflow subsequently six scenarios were constructed to conduct the experiments at the daily scale table 2 scenario s1 was the baseline scenario and the observed data from 1989 to 2002 was used scenario s2 used the simulated yangtze river streamflow from 2003 to 2016 and the cipl data from s1 to present the impact of the oifyr on the yangtze river streamflow scenario s3 used the data for the yangtze river streamflow from s1 and the cipl data from 2003 to 2016 to quantify the influence of the cipl scenario s4 used the simulated yangtze river streamflow from 2003 to 2016 and the cipl data from s3 to assess the impact of the oifyr and the impact of the cipl on the yangtze river streamflow scenario s5 used the observed streamflow of the yangtze river from 2003 to 2016 and the cipl data from s1 to evaluate the variations in the yangtze river streamflow finally scenario s6 used the observed data from 2003 to 2016 to calculate the impacts of the three influencing factors consequently the effects of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl on the water exchange were quantified using the results of the scenario experiments and the ypwes model the subscripts t o and c denote the variations in the daily q h and z h caused by the effects of the tgd the oifyr and the cipl respectively meanwhile the difference between simulated results of scenarios would exhibit the effect of each influencing factor while the discharge or water level simulated in the ith scenario is noted as si accordingly we quantified the impact of each factor by calculating the difference between simulated results of some chosen scenarios according to a certain scheme of scenario experiment the results of the scenario experiments were calculated to explain the net variations in the water exchange using equations 15 22 15 δ q o s 2 s 1 16 δ q t s 5 s 2 17 δ q c s 6 s 5 18 δ q h δ q o δ q

exchange at multiple time scales in this study the annual and seasonal q h and z h were calculated by averaging the amounts of the annual and seasonal q h and z h we calculated the variations in q h and z h after the tgd impoundment on the annual seasonal and daily scales based on the observed data table 3 the results show that the outflow from the poyang lake decreased by 639 m3 s after the impoundment of the tgd and the water level at the junction of the yangtze river and the poyang lake decreased by 0 97 m moreover since the tgd operation has an obvious effect on the seasonal streamflow of the yangtze river the variations in the water exchange on the seasonal scale were analyzed according to the scheduling rules of the tgd lai et al 2014 guo et al 2012 in detail the scheme of the tgd operation consists of four periods a supplement period a sluicing period a flood period and an impounding period zhao et al 2017 yao et al 2018 gao et al 2014 in the flood period which generally lasts from june to september the tgd impounds the flood water and suppresses the downstream streamflow in order to achieve flood regulation subsequently to impound a large amount of water in the three gorges reservoir tgr the tgd continues reducing the downstream streamflow during the impoundment period which lasts for approximately one month then the tgd maintains the downstream streamflow to supply water to the downstream yangtze basin during the supplement period from december to may eventually to reduce the water level at the head of the tgr the tgd increases the discharge ability during the sluicing period from may to june it should be noted that during each year the tgd operation progresses through these four periods in the following order the supplement period the sluicing period the flood period and the impoundment period moreover each period of the tgd operation basically coincides with a season this indicates that the tgd operation influences the downstream streamflow at the seasonal scale according to the observed data the observed changes in the seasonal q h during the supplement sluicing flood and impoundment periods of the tgd operation are 334 m3 s 69 m3 s 984 m3 s and 1386 m3 s respectively thus the seasonal q h is generally suppressed during the four periods after the impoundment of the tgd in addition the observed seasonal z h decreases by 0 64 m 0 69 m 1 17 m and 1 79 m in the supplement sluicing flood and impoundment periods respectively therefore the seasonal z h rather than the seasonal q h exhibits a stable downward trend with respect to the dynamics of the occurrence of daily brl events we selected a brl event with a particular backflow discharge for the frequency analysis and the step of the backflow discharge was taken as 1000 m3 s table 4 in this study if the mean q h is negative for multiple days the frequency of the occurrence of brl events is thought to increase by corresponding times thus according to the observation data most of the brl events occur from june to september and the frequency of the brl events in the pre tgd period is 35 times lower than that during the post tgd period furthermore the daily discharge of the brl events no longer exceeds 7000 m3 s after the impoundment of the tgd and the observed average discharge of the backflow is 2510 m3 s and 2453 m3 s before and after the impoundment of the tgd respectively consequently although the occurrence of brl events with a high backflow discharge is suppressed the frequency of brl events increases considerably after the impoundment of the tgd 4 2 model calibration and validation the calibration period and validation period of the two established models were 1989 2002 and 2003 2016 respectively the crucial parameters of the dtvgm model were determined based on the data for the calibration period table 5 while the performance of the dtvgm model was evaluated using the observed discharge data from jiujiang station during the simulation period fig 2 a furthermore the daily observed q h and z h from hukou station were used to calibrate and validate the ypwes model the crucial parameters of the ypwes were determined based on the data for the calibration period table 6 and the simulated results of the daily q h and z h are shown in fig 2b and 2c as shown in table 7 the simulation results of the dtvgm during the calibration period and the validation period have nse and r2 values of greater than 0 86 and 0 75 respectively and the flow process at jiujiang station simulated using the dtvgm is basically consistent with the actual process in addition the simulated results of the ypwes model during the calibration period and the validation period have nse and r2 values of over 0 93 and thus it effectively reproduces the variations in the daily q h and z h in general consequently it is concluded that the established dtvgm and ypwes models could be employed to quantify the responses of the yangtze river streamflow and the water exchange in the yprls to the impacts of multiple factors 4 3 contributions of the influencing factors the annual and seasonal changes in the q h and z h were simulated using the results of scenario experiments and the contributions of the three influencing factors to the changes in q h and z h were also simulated figs 3 5 the simulation results show that the annual q h decreases by 21 m3 s 15 m3 s and 567 m3 s under the influence of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl respectively and these factors can explain 3 71 2 66 and 101 05 of the variations in the annual q h respectively evidently the variations in the annual average q h are mainly controlled by the cipl while the tgd operation and the oifyr make similar absolute contributions to the water exchange in the yprls moreover with respect to the seasonal variations the simulated variations in the average q h in the supplement sluicing flood and impoundment periods of the tgd operation are 302 m3 s 107 m3 s 985 m3 s and 1042 m3 s respectively in addition on average the impacts of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl could explain 30 39 10 24 and 120 16 of the seasonal variations in q h respectively thus the influence of the cipl on the variations in q h is less dominant at the seasonal scale than at the annual scale because the impacts of the tgd operation and the oifyr are larger at the seasonal scale than at the annual scale furthermore although the increase in the seasonal q h is facilitated by the tgd operation during both the impoundment period and the flood period only the impounding period of the tgd operation coincides with the occurrence of the autumn drought in the poyang lake wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 the simulation results show that annual z h decreases by 0 62 m the impacts of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl lead to annual z h changes by 0 01 m 0 47 m and 0 14 m respectively accounting for 1 61 75 81 and 22 58 of the variations in the annual z h thus the influence of the forcing of the yangtze river on the annual z h is significantly larger than that of the cipl in addition the simulated seasonal z h decreases by 0 17 m 0 35 m 1 15 m and 1 30 m during the supplement sluicing flood and impoundment periods of the tgd operation respectively on average the impacts of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl account for 113 97 189 18 and 24 79 of the seasonal variations in the z h respectively overall the contribution of the cipl to the seasonal and annual variations in the z h is generally the smallest while that of the oifyr is basically the largest contributor to the seasonal and annual variations in the z h specifically the oifyr is the most significant influencing factor from the impounding period to the sluicing period while the tgd operation is the most significant influencing factor during the flood period nevertheless during the impoundment period the influence of the tgd operation leads to the most drastic decrease in the seasonal z h while the impacts of the cipl and the oifyr made minor contributions to the seasonal z h 4 4 sensitivity coefficients of the water exchange to influencing factors the monthly sensitivity coefficients of the water exchange in the yprls to the three influencing factors were calculated using the results of scenario experiments the sensitivity coefficient of the water exchange was calculated for each influencing factor using the ratio of the relative changes in the q h and z h to the relative changes in the q j and q pin caused by the three influencing factors the water exchange s monthly sensitivity coefficients for each influencing factor are shown in figs 6 and 7 according to the linear relationships under the impacts of the tgd operation the oifyr and the cipl the sensitivity coefficients of q h to q j and q pin are 0 065 0 108 and 0 634 respectively in addition the sensitivity coefficient of z h to q j is 0 416 under the influence of the oifyr however the corresponding sensitivity coefficients of the seasonal z h to q j are 0 570 and 0 124 when q j and q pin are reduced by the impacts of the tgd operation and the cipl respectively otherwise they are 0 254 and 0 0385 respectively overall the sensitivity coefficients of the seasonal q h to the cipl and that of the seasonal z h to the forcing of the yangtze river which varies with the seasons are 0 634 and 0 416 respectively additionally the relative change in the monthly q h is positively correlated to the change in the monthly q pin and the linear relationship between them is strong with an r2 value of 0 8 in contrast a weaker linear relationship exists between the relative change in the monthly q h and the relative change in the monthly q j and the latter is generally negatively correlated with the former furthermore the relative change in the monthly z h is more closely related to the relative change in the monthly q j r2 0 89 than to the relative change in the monthly q pin r2 0 75 consequently the yangtze river streamflow and the discharge of the cipl are significantly correlated with z h at the monthly scale and the discharge of the cipl is significantly correlated with q h at the monthly scale nevertheless the relationship between the yangtze river streamflow and q h at the monthly scale is negligible 4 5 variations in the brl events in different scenarios the simulated results of daily backflow discharge based on the results of the scenario experiments are shown in fig 8 it is evident that the simulated daily backflow discharge which occasionally exceeds 6000 m3 s before the impoundment of the tgd no longer exceeds 6000 m3 s after the tgd operation began additionally the average discharge of the backflow is 2515 m3 s and 2022 m3 s in scenarios s1 and s6 respectively thus the simulated daily discharge of the backflow in the yprls drastically decreases after the impoundment of the tgd thus the results show that daily brl events occur 69 times 89 times 120 times 99 times 80 times and 95 times in scenarios s1 s6 respectively as shown in fig 9 a the brl events with a backflow discharge of 1000 m3 s between 1000 m3 s and 3000 m3 s and 3000 m3 s have basically similar frequency and the frequency of the brl events with a backflow discharge of 6000 m3 s is very low therefore the brl events in each scenario were divided into four groups a low backflow discharge group 1000 m3 s a medium backflow discharge group 1000 3000 m3 s a high backflow discharge group 3000 6000 m3 s and an extreme backflow discharge group 6000 m3 s nevertheless the simulation errors of the daily q h have a non negligible impact on the identification of the brl events thus impacts of the three influencing factors on the brl events were computed for considering each scenario to quantify the dynamics of the frequency of the brl events with specific backflow discharge ranges as is illustrated in fig 9b the frequency of the brl events increases by 25 times 0 times and 7 times under the influence of the cipl the oifyr and the tgd operation respectively furthermore the influence of the cipl mainly increases the frequency of the brl events with low and medium backflow discharge by 10 times while the frequency of the brl events with low backflow discharge is increased by the tgd operation and the oifyr by 14 times and 10 times respectively these factors also suppress the frequency of the brl events with extreme backflow discharge by 4 times in particular the increase of frequency of the brl events with high backflow discharge which is as high as 8 times is mainly induced by the tgd operation 5 discussions 5 1 characteristics of the contribution of every influencing factor the interactions between the river and the lake are important for the hydrological changes in a river lake system and the changing environment has led to obvious variations in the water exchange in river lake systems which has become a matter of great concern worldwide in recent years in this study the contributions of the influencing factors to the variations in the water exchange in the yprls on multiple time scales during 1989 2016 were quantified based on the distinguished effects of the three factors the simulation results of the daily q h and z h have a satisfactory accuracy and they exhibit decreasing trends at the annual and seasonal scales and daily discharge of the backflow in the yprls exhibits a decreasing trend these trends are consistent with the observed variations at the different time scales in general furthermore the simulated decrease in the seasonal q h is initially suppressed and then promoted by the influencing factors during the four periods of the tgd operation which is consistent with the trend of the observed seasonal q h in addition both the observed and simulated decreases in the seasonal z h are facilitated by the influencing factors during the four periods in particular the observed restriction of the discharge of the backflow caused by the tgd operation also exists in the simulation results although the simulated results underestimate the upper limit of the tgd influenced backflow discharge by 1000 m3 s this error is acceptable because only two underestimated backflow events occur while more than 80 brl events occur after the impoundment of the tgd fig 8 therefore the simulation results generally reflect the accurate trend of the water exchange at multiple time scales the accurately simulated results are used in the evaluation of the impacts of each influencing factor on the q h and z h on different time scales as shown in figs 3 4 and 5 the influence of the cipl generally decreases q h and z h at the annual and seasonal scales but overall this influence leads to the higher frequency of brl events since the influence of the cipl always increases the q h and z h the influence of the cipl has a stable effect on the water exchange in the yprls in contrast the influence of the forcing of the yangtze river makes a variable contribution to the variations in the seasonal q h since it is not constantly favorable or detrimental to an increase in the seasonal q h nevertheless the forcing of the yangtze river explains an average of 76 of the decrease in z h at the seasonal scale it is noteworthy that the tgd operation and the oifyr had opposite effects on the seasonal q h and z h in general figs 3 and 4 which may be due to that the effects of the tgd operation and the oifyr are not completely independent specifically since the tgd operation is partially determined by the oifyr influenced upstream inflow the seasonal impacts of the tgd operation and the oifyr on the downstream streamflow of the yangtze river are bound to be interrelated to a certain extent wang et al 2020 yao et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 gao et al 2014 moreover the seasonal variations in the z h rather than the seasonal variations in the q h generally exhibit a stable response to the forcing of the yangtze river which may be due to the primary influence of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal variations in the z h although previous studies mainly focus on the response of the dynamics of the water exchange in the yprls to the regulated yangtze river streamflow and the changing discharge of the cipl in this study we found that the water exchange exhibits distinct sensitivities to the influencing factors which can be used to evaluate the impacts of the influencing factors li et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 the monthly variations in z h are more sensitive to the yangtze induced monthly variations in q j while the monthly variations in q h are more sensitive to the cipl induced monthly variations in q pin evidently at the monthly scale q h and z h are mainly sensitive to the influencing factor that has a stable influence on them furthermore it is noteworthy that the sensitivity coefficient of the monthly z h to the tgd influenced monthly q j is the highest when the yangtze river streamflow is hindered by the tgd operation whilst this sensitivity coefficient significantly decreases when the yangtze river streamflow is increased by the tgd operation thus the influence of the tgd operation decreases z h easily but has more difficulty increasing it at the monthly scale which indicates that the tgd induced decline in the seasonal z h may have been more significant since a lower z h would promote the droughts in the poyang lake we suggest that the tgd operation should be planned carefully zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 lai et al 2014 5 2 comparison of the contributions at annual and seasonal scale in order to better analyze the major factor influencing the water exchange in the yprls comparisons of the impacts of the factors on different time scales were conducted according to the simulation results shown in figs 3 and 4 the cipl has the most vital influence on the variations in q h and it explains 101 05 of the annual variations and 120 16 of the seasonal variations which is consistent with the results of a previous study zheng et al 2015 nevertheless although the decrease in the seasonal q h is also mainly affected by the influence of the cipl the influence of the cipl on q h is less significant at the seasonal scale than at the annual scale which may be due to the appropriate combination of the cipl and the water level difference between the poyang lake and the yangtze river at the seasonal scale yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 notably the tgd operation which has a minor influence on the seasonal q h is the only influencing factor that facilitates the outflow from the poyang lake during the impoundment period in contrast the influence of the tgd operation makes the largest and predominant contribution to the decrease in the seasonal z h during the impoundment period this can be explained by the fact that the seasonal z h is the most sensitive to the tgd operation during the impoundment period when the yangtze river streamflow is hindered by the operation of the tgd fig 7 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 gao et al 2014 thus since the autumn drought in the poyang lake is promoted by the increase in q h and the decrease in z h the tgd operation may have been the only influencing factor that completely increases the severity of the autumn drought in the poyang lake yao et al 2019 furthermore at the junction of the yangtze river and the poyang lake z h is simultaneously influenced by the yangtze river streamflow and the poyang lake s outflow zhang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 as shown in fig 4 the tgd induced decrease in the yangtze river streamflow and the tgd induced increase in the poyang lake s outflow occur during the flood and impoundment periods respectively however as shown in fig 5 the tgd induced seasonal z h decreases and increases during the impoundment period and the flood period respectively which indicates that the net effect of the yangtze river streamflow and the poyang lake s outflow on z h varies in the different seasons the variations in these effects can be explained by the difference between the stage discharge relationship of the yangtze river streamflow and that of the poyang lake s outflow first drastic decreases in the seasonal q j and q h occurred in certain seasons which are mainly due to the water regime of the middle of the yangtze river basin and that of the poyang lake basin wang et al 2018 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 specifically according to the observed data displayed in figs 3 and 4 before the impoundment of the tgd the seasonal q j during the impoundment period is about 10000 m3 s lower than that during the flood period and the decrease in the seasonal q h between the two periods is only about 3000 m3 s furthermore the response pattern of the water level to the discharge of the yangtze river streamflow is similar to that of the water level to the discharge of the cipl that is the water level is more sensitive to the variations in the low discharge chen et al 2021 huang et al 2017 thus it can be reasonably speculated that the decrease in the seasonal z h caused by the tgd operation is less significant than the cipl induced increase in the seasonal z h during the flood period but it exceeds the latter in the impoundment period accordingly the appropriate dissimilarities in the seasonal decreases in the discharge and stage discharge relationship in the yprls may determine the dynamics of the seasonal z h the dynamic mechanism of the seasonal z h also affects the timing of the autumn drought in the poyang lake since the lower z h facilitates the outflow from the poyang lake this indicates that understanding the dynamic mechanism of the seasonal z h is important wang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 mei et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the stage discharge relationship observed at hukou station is very complex and it can be explained by the fact that the seasonal variations in z h and q h are mainly determined by the forcing of the yangtze river and the cipl respectively huang et al 2017 furthermore previous studies have determined that the tgd induced changes in the water level reduction in the yangtze river channel is obvious during the impoundment period which is consistent with the results of the scenario experiments li et al 2019 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 therefore the proposed mechanism of water fluctuation at hukou station is supported by the results of the existing research but the reason for the different tgd induced seasonal variations in z h during the flood and impoundment periods requires a quantitative description 5 3 comparison of the contributions at daily scale in order to better understand the dynamics of the water exchange in the yprls at a finer time scale the contributions at the daily scale were analyzed with respect to the brl events previous studies have reported that the occurrence of brl events is increased and suppressed by the increase in the yangtze river streamflow and the cipl s discharge respectively li et al 2016 accordingly as shown in fig 10 the daily q j and q pin from june to september exhibit drastic reductions after the impoundment of the tgd which indicates that the change in the cipl s discharge and the change in the yangtze river streamflow promote and impede the occurrence of brl events respectively thus since the net influence of the cipl and the forcing of the yangtze river increases the frequency of brl events by 26 times the influence of the cipl should have increased it by more than 26 times which is generally consistent with the speculated variation illustrated in fig 9b given that the net influence of the forcing of the yangtze river decreases the frequency of the brl events the influence of the oifyr should be less significant than the influence of the tgd operation which decreases the frequency of the brl events by 7 times thus the speculated influence of the oifyr which decreases the frequency of the brl events by 0 times is acceptable overall the frequency of the brl events changes by more than 26 times 7 times and 0 times under the influence of the cipl the tgd operation and the oifyr respectively furthermore the cipl induced increase in the frequency of the brl events mainly involves the brl event with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s in contrast influenced by the forcing of the yangtze river the frequency of the brl events with high and extreme backflow discharge increases by 8 times and 8 times respectively simultaneously under the impact of the cipl the frequency of the brl events with high and extreme backflow discharge increases by 3 times and 2 times respectively therefore the brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s are mainly influenced by the forcing of the yangtze river the decrease in the frequency of the extreme brl events may be explained by the decrease in the yangtze river streamflow moreover the occurrence of brl events with high backflow discharge is mainly affected by the operation of the tgd fig 9 we speculate that the tgd induced increase in the brl events only occurs when the influence of the tgd operation is more significant than the influence of the cipl for the brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s the tgd operation has the largest negative effect on the frequency which is also the result of the decrease in the yangtze river streamflow because the yangtze river streamflow has basically decreased in the flood impoundment period since the tgd operation began yang et al 2016 although the net contribution of the tgd operation and the oifyr to the frequency of the brl events is less significant than the influence of the cipl each of them has an individual impact on the frequency of the brl events which is equivalent to the effect of the cipl this indicates that the relevance of the influence of the tgd and the influence of the cipl may result in their net influence being smaller than their individual impacts overall the impacts of the cipl and the forcing of the yangtze river are the main factors influencing the brl events with backflow discharge less than and greater than 3000 m3 s respectively the net contribution of the tgd operation and the oifyr to the frequency of the brl events is small due to their unequal and opposite impacts on the brl events the implications of the forcing of the yangtze river for the occurrence of brl events have been recognized for decades that is the occurrence of brl events has generally decreased since the impoundment of the tgd wu et al 2021 yang et al 2016 chen et al 2018 therefore our results which suggest that not only the frequency of the brl events but also the magnitude of the mean backflow discharge exhibits obvious decreases after the emplacement of the tgd are consistent with the conclusions of previous studies and the observation data furthermore since it is found in this study that the occurrence of the brl events with different backflow discharge is mainly affected by the forcing of the yangtze river and influence of the cipl respectively the findings of this study may help to improve our understanding of the brl events and in the management of the flood events in the poyang lake 5 4 limitations and future researches in this study the impacts of three factors on water exchange in the yprls at multiple time scales are distinguished and quantitatively analyzed we mainly assess the effects of the major factors influencing the water exchange but some minor influencing factors such as sand mining at the northern flow channel of the poyang lake are ignored yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 according to previous studies the impacts of sand mining and channel erosion do not play major roles in the variations in water exchange in the yprls yao et al 2019 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 however the results of the attribution analysis would be further improved by taking these factors into account in our investigation the simulated tgd induced and oifyr induced seasonal variations in the q h and z h are generally reasonable and they are basically consistent with the dynamics of the q h and z h reported by previous studies yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 it should be noted that the estimations of the tgd induced and oifyr induced impacts are influenced by their intrinsic connection to a certain extent zhao et al 2017 yao et al 2018 nevertheless the dominant influence of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal variations in z h is not affected by the intrinsic connection between the tgd induced and oifyr induced impacts similarly the response of the brl events with high backflow discharge to the effect of the forcing of the yangtze river which is revealed by our analysis is also free from the intrinsic connection between the tgd induced and oifyr induced impacts therefore the intrinsic connection between the tgd induced and oifyr induced impacts does not significantly affect the estimation of the influence of the forcing of the yangtze river however making a more accurate distinction between the contributions of the tgd operation and the oifyr would lead to a better understanding of their impacts our research reveals that the forcing of the yangtze river and the influence of the cipl dominate the dynamics of the z h and q h respectively although the relationship between q h and the cipl has been identified in previous studies the dynamic mechanism of z h has received less attention wang et al 2018 yang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 it should be noted that the changes in the yangtze river streamflow and the changes in the discharge of the cipl exhibit the same trend during the flood period and impoundment period of the tgd operation but this leads to an unequal variation in the seasonal changes in z h since the dynamics of the poyang lake s water resources are partially controlled by z h more research on the mechanism of the seasonal fluctuations in z h are required thus the results of our study may lead to a speculation that the mechanism of water level fluctuation at the junction of a large river and a large lake may be very complex which would influence the water storage in the large lake however case studies are needed to evaluate the universality of this speculation for example an investigation of the water exchange in the yangtze river dongting lake system would be helpful since the dongting lake is a large freshwater lake and has a natural connection with to the yangtze river zou et al 2019 overall the investigation of water exchange in river lake systems that contain a large lake would help us to better understand how and to what extent the changes in the environment influence the water exchange in the river lake system 6 conclusion in this study the influence of each factor was thoroughly quantified based on scenario experiments to draw a comprehensive and reasonable conclusion the outflow of the poyang lake generally exhibits a decreasing trend on the annual and seasonal scales and the influence of the cipl explains more than 100 of its variations on average over 76 of the annual and seasonal variations in the water level at the junction of the yangtze river and the poyang lake are caused by the net effect of the tgd operation and the oifyr and their individual effects are generally opposite and thus offset each other in addition the sensitivity coefficient of the seasonal q h to the cipl and that of the seasonal z h to the forcing of the yangtze river which varies seasonally are 0 634 and 0 416 on average respectively on the daily scale the frequency of the brl events changes by more than 26 times 7 times and 0 times under the influence of the cipl the tgd operation and the oifyr respectively in detail the influence of the cipl mainly affects the brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s while the frequency of the brl events with backflow discharge of 3000 m3 s is mainly influenced by the forcing of the yangtze river in addition we speculate that the seasonal variations in z h involves the water regime and stage discharge relationships which may help to explain the stability of the major impacts of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal z h the mechanism of the seasonal variations in z h also determined whether the occurrence of the autumn drought in the poyang lake would occur earlier we believe the revealed dynamics and mechanisms can be used as a reference to help solve the water issues in the yprls overall the response mechanism of z h is complex and it may be partially related to the water regime and stage discharge relationships in addition the connection between the influence of the tgd operation and that of the oifyr has a large impact on the stability of the effect of the forcing of the yangtze river on the seasonal z h and the variations in the brl events since the variations in the brl events and the z h are important to the sediment transport duration of flooding and timing of the autumn drought in the poyang lake more detailed studies of their mechanisms may be helpful in solving the water issues in the yprls credit authorship contribution statement minghao chen

3079,the dry wet alternation evolves in both time and space and it has the characteristics of both dry and wet events previous studies have focused more on dry wet abrupt alternation and little is known about dry wet alternation in larger time scale and space scales in addition previous studies have focused either on time or on space domain without considering spatio temporal continuity of dry wet alternation this study proposes an identification method of dry wet alternation which can be used to identify and extract successive dry wet alternations in a long time series a series of three dimensional dry wet structures is developed to visualize dry wet alternation and simulate the spatial temporal evolution the time dimension is added into the two dimensional latitude longitude space to better describe dry wet alternation and extract dry wet alternation more completely consecutive slices are obtained at each unit time interval to characterize the occurrence development migration and disappearance of dry wet alternation in the space domain in order to better understand the spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation six indicators transition period transition rate area volume intensity and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure are proposed to quantify the attributes of dry wet alternation such as the transition period and rate scope of influence and severity and statistical methods are used to analyze the complex spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation it is found that dry wet alternation occurs most frequently in the 1980s and then in the 1960s and 2010s in the huai river basin there exists a transition in the spatial distribution of dry wet regions in the huai river basin in the 1960s 2000s as it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s but dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s drought is more likely to have large influence range and high severity than wet the transition period and rate reach the extremum in june august and the severity and influence range exhibit an increasing trend since 1980s our study may contribute to better understanding the formation and development of dry wet alternation under environmental changes keywords dry wet alternation dry wet identification distribution pattern evolution characteristics 1 introduction drought is a climatic phenomenon that can occur in any part of the world as a result of water deficit for an extended period of time and it is usually a slow continuous and complex process with high spatio temporal variability and a wide spectrum of influence hao and singh 2015 in contrast flood is the result of prolonged or intense precipitation and it usually occurs abruptly and periodically and has high seasonal and regional variability wilby and keenan 2012 it is clear that continuous occurrence of flood events make the region susceptible to a long term wet spell the dry wet alternation is alternating occurrence of dry and wet extremes in a given period of time in recent years the frequency intensity and impacted areas of dry wet alternation have been increasing at an alarming rate elleder 2010 probably because the climate system becomes unstable in the context of global warming atmospheric circulation anomaly and accelerated hydrological cycle and as a consequence dry wet extremes such as rainstorms floods and droughts become more frequent and intense as dry wet alternation has the characteristics of both dry and wet extremes it would be expected to be more destructive to human life global food production and water cycle than single dry or wet extremes fussel 2009 ipcc 2013 this suggests the need for more quantitative studies of the spatio temporal variability and evolution characteristics of dry wet alternation in order to better understand the meteorological and hydrological evolution under climate change and to provide early warning for meteorological disasters the frequent and widespread occurrence of meteorological extremes such as drought and flood under climate change makes the study of dry wet alternation in a short period of time particularly relevant previous studies have investigated the characteristics and causes of the abrupt transition from extreme drought to flood in 2010 2011 in the amazonas river and tributaries espinoza et al 2012 coexistence of two contrasting seasonal extremes floods in amazonia and droughts in northeast brazil in tropical south america in 2012 marengo et al 2013 abrupt transition from long term extreme drought to flood with the occurrence of heavy rainfall in texas yoon et al 2018 the wetland area in response to drought flood abrupt alternation in the yangtze river basin tian et al 2014 and intense drought flood alternation in other regions of china ionita et al 2015a ji et al 2017 yan et al 2013 a number of quantitative methods have also been proposed to identify drought flood alternation for instance wu et al proposed the long or short cycle drought flood abrupt alternation indicator ldfai sdfai considering the precipitation difference in summer and then analyzed the relationship between long term drought flood abrupt alternation in summer and atmospheric circulation anomalies in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river considering the fixed time for drought flood alternation in ldfai sdfai zhang et al 2012 proposed the runoff drought flood abrupt alternation indicator rdfai based on runoff based on which the drought flood abrupt alternation during the main rainy season in the huai river basin was analyzed the dry wet abrupt alternation indicator dwaai was proposed to deal with the problems that could lead to inaccurate identification of drought flood abrupt alternation such as inappropriate timescale and lack of consideration of the duration and speed of drought flood alternation fan 2019 li et al 2017 shan et al 2018 shan et al 2017 some meteorological indicators for analysis of drought and flood are also used to identify drought flood alternation because of simple calculation and wide applicability for instance zhang et al 2019 found that the consecutive days of non effective precipitation and the accumulative effective precipitation in the flood period could accurately describe the evolution of drought flood abrupt alternation tian et al 2014 analyzed changes in wetland area in response to a sudden transition from drought to flood in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river based on the standard precipitation indicator spi huang et al 2020 analyzed the characteristics and variability of dry wet alternation by using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indicator spei it is noted that recent studies have focused more on the temporal or spatial distribution and evolution of dry wet alternation shan et al 2018 investigated the temporal distribution of dry wet abrupt alternation in summer based on daily precipitation as well as the spatial distribution and interdecadal variation of the frequency of dry wet abrupt alternation lonita et al 2015b investigated the spatial variability of dry wet alternation in the catchment area of the danube river by empirical orthogonal function and the temporal variability by wavelet power spectrum he et al 2015 explored the annual and seasonal trends of dry wet conditions in the huai river basin by m k test and the significant transitions of precipitation by non parametric pettitt test luca et al 2020 defined wet dry extremes using the monthly self calibrated palmer drought severity indicator based on the penman monteith model sc pdsi pm and calculated the percentage of total land area impacted by extreme wet dry neutral and wet dry events then two new indicators wet dry ratio and extreme transition time intervals were proposed the former was used to measure the relative occurrence of wet or dry extremes whereas the latter was used to quantify the average time interval between hydrological extremes with opposite signs wet to dry and dry to wet transitions for each grid cell chen et al 2020a used the convection permitting climate model to describe the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation and calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between dry wet abrupt alternation and climatic variables in the historical period ma et al 2018 analyzed the spatial distribution and the time series of the monthly precipitation anomaly when dry wet abrupt alternation occurred in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in 2011 and identified dry wet abrupt alternation using spectral nudging and re initialized simulations chen et al 2020b compared the total number of dry wet months between historical and future periods for each grid cell using multimodel ensemble simulations in order to examine the relative changes in wet and dry periods the frequency of dry wet alternation was estimated based on different categories and the percentage of grid cells i e land area within a specific category for the frequency of dry wet alternation was detected however it should be noted that the spatial and temporal variability of dry wet alternation are usually considered separately in previous studies as dry wet alternation is a spatially and temporally continuous process it should be considered in the three dimensional time and space domains some attempts have been made to investigate the spatio temporal evolution of drought in the three dimensional domain for instance guo et al 2018 investigated the spatio temporal characteristics of drought in central asia based on spei and three dimensional clustering on a monthly scale liu et al 2020 investigated the duration severity area characteristics of drought in eastern china using the three dimensional clustering and visualized the development of drought via the spatial expansion of drought patches and their transferring paths zhu et al 2019 obtained the time series of grid based standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indicator spei and standardized runoff indicator sri from the simulations of the variable infiltration capacity vic model in the yellow river basin and used the three dimensional time latitude longitude method to identify drought and used the copula function to construct the joint distribution of meteorological and hydrological droughts rulinda et al 2012a characterized and quantified the drought as a vague spatial phenomenon in east africa using ndvi data and visualized its evolution in space and time rulinda et al 2012b visualized and quantified the movement of drought using remote sensing data and geographic information system wang et al 2015 proposed the space time permutation scan statistic method to determine the spatio temporal clusters of drought which were grouped into five stages using the space time cube model for visualization as a result the evolution of high frequency drought areas could be depicted in the long temporal scale in short dry wet alternation is a complex phenomenon that includes abrupt transition coexistence and slow transition between drought and flood it is the result of uneven moisture distribution in the large scale atmospheric water vapor transport and evolves in both time and space a common limitation of extant studies is that they have treated the temporal and spatial domains separately in general the temporal variation and evolution of dry wet alternation is analyzed only in time domain and the spatial distribution is analyzed only in spatial domain however little is known about the three dimensional spatio temporal variation of dry wet alternation however it should be noted that dry wet alternation is characterized by the complex coupling of spatial and temporal scales rather than their simple combination for this reason it is impossible to grasp the whole picture of the variation and evolution characteristics of dry wet alternation in only time or space domain this study proposes an identification method of dry wet alternations and investigates their spatio temporal distribution and evolution in the three dimensional time latitude longitude domains first the three dimensional structure of single dry wet alternation is developed and the three dimensional structures of consecutive dry wet alternations are developed over a long time series and all dry wet alternations are identified next six indicators are proposed to quantify dry wet alternation including transition period area volume intensity and density of the three dimensional structure and transition rate finally the variation of these six indicators for the period 1961 2015 is analyzed to illustrate the evolution of dry wet alternation in time and space 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the huai river basin 111 55 121 25 e 30 55 36 36 n is located in eastern china and stretched from the yellow river basin in the north the yangtze river basin in the south and the yellow sea in the east it covers an area of about 0 27 million km2 and has two sub basins mainstream and yishusi river most parts of the basin are plains with mountains and hills only in the western margins and the northeast regions the study area is located in the eastern monsoon zone and the north south climate transition zone it has non uniform spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and the average annual precipitation is about 920 mm 63 of which occurs during the period from june to september 2 2 history drought and flood events historically drought and flood disasters occurred very frequently in the huai river basin because of variable climate and complex geographic and underlying surface conditions the region experienced drought flood alternation and continuous droughts or floods from time to time for instance severe droughts occurred in 1961 1962 and 1966 severe floods occurred in 1965 1968 and 1969 and drought flood abrupt alternation occurred in 1962 1965 and 1968 as shown in table 1 bureau 2014 commission 1990 2 3 study data the daily precipitation data for the period 1961 2015 are collected from china s ground precipitation 0 5 0 5 gridded dataset v2 0 https data cma cn which covers 2472 meteorological stations across the country and is the most widely used meteorological dataset in china mao et al 2016 pan et al 2017 ren et al 2015 zhong et al 2020 a total of 120 grids in the huai river basin are selected as shown in fig 1 3 methods 3 1 identification of dry wet alternation 3 1 1 framework dry wet alternation consists of dry to wet and wet to dry transition here the dry to wet transition is described as an example drought occurs when precipitation is lower than normal for an extended period however the impact of drought would be mitigated and flood may occur with the increase of precipitation amounts and successive occurrence of flood events in neighboring regions may lead to co existence of dry wet regions if precipitation continues or becomes more intense dry regions disappear and all regions become wet however it is also possible that dry to wet transition can be accomplished more rapidly in case of intense and concentrated precipitation in this study the identification of dry to wet transition is illustrated as an example first a monthly timescale is selected and the critical values of indicators are determined to determine the dry wet states of grids then two dimensional clustering is performed to cluster spatially homogeneous dry wet grids into dry wet regions and then three dimensional clustering is performed to cluster discrete dry wet regions into dry wet structures which are composed of homogeneous and temporally and spatially continuous grids after that three dimensional structures of consecutive dry wet alternations are developed finally all dry wet alternation events in a long time series are identified based on the outer envelope surface of each three dimensional structure and the beginning and ending times of each dry wet alternation and the time of dry wet coexistence are determined the flowchart for identification of dry wet alternation is shown in fig 2 3 1 2 step 1 selection of indicators here the drought flood abrupt alternation refers to the rapid transition from drought to flood within one month because of sudden heavy rainfall as the beginning and ending times of the drought to flood transition can be accurate to the day a daily timescale is often used in previous studies to determine the exact date at which drought to flood transition occurs however dry wet alternation involves successive drought flood abrupt transitions in neighboring regions and the transition period may overlap with each other it takes several months for dry wet alternation to occur for this reason it would be more appropriate to use a monthly timescale as no indicators are currently available to direct quantify dry wet alternation on a monthly scale some meteorological indicators that are universally applicable such as spi spei pdsi and z are used in this study the spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 is a useful measure of dry or wet conditions but calculation of spi for a specific time period requires a long term monthly precipitation database and a given probability distribution hayes et al 1997 as precipitation is considered the main driving force of dry wet alternation and the calculation is simple it is appropriate for decision making applications another advantage is that spi is spatially invariant and thus spis from different climate zones and regions are directly comparable given the non uniform spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the huai river basin the use of spi is considered to be appropriate the sensitivity of spi for identification of dry wet alternation is related to the timescale spi can be calculated on any timescales e g 1 3 6 12 and 48 months and a shorter timescale e g 1 and 3 months is more appropriate to identify and monitor meteorological drought as the huai river basin is located in warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate and the north south climate transition zone the dry wet alternation exhibits high seasonal variability thus the timescale of 3 months spi 3 is used in this study where spi 3 1 is the critical value for wet condition and spi 3 1 is the critical value for dry condition mckee et al 1995 the classification of spi 3 is shown in table 2 3 1 3 step 2 construction of three dimensional structures all dry wet grids are identified based on their spi 3 values those grids with spi 3 values lower than 1 are identified as having severely or extremely dry conditions while those grids with spi 3 values higher than 1 are identified as having severely or extremely wet conditions 1 two dimensional clustering two dimensional clustering is performed to cluster discrete dry wet grids into two dimensional dry wet patches each of which is composed of spatially homogeneous and continuous grids the shape of wet and dry patches formed by their projection on a 2d plane change continuously in response to the dynamic evolution of drought and flood in both time and space under the influence of various meteorological factors the dry wet alternation occurred in 1983 has an appropriate spatial two dimensional coverage clearly observable dynamic migration in the study area and a certain transition period that we can easily identify the transitional state and the start and end time of the dry wet alternation so take for example the dry wet alternation occurred in the period from february to december of 1983 fig 3 where the dry period is from february to september the wet period is from may to december and the concurrent dry and wet period is from may to september a dry region first appears in the upper reaches of the huai river and its area is reduced as it moves to the middle reaches in march april in may june the dry region moves from the southwest to the northeast and its area first increases and then decreases in july august the dry region is confined to the northern part of the basin and its area is kept almost constant finally it disappears in september the wet region first appears in the northwest part of the basin and then it moves westward and southward along the basin the area is small before september and increases from october to december finally the wet region disappears in the upper reaches of the huai river 2 three dimensional clustering voxler is a three dimensional scientific visualization program oriented primarily toward three dimensional data display and three dimensional space modeling and it has been widely used in hydrology meteorology and other fields the time dimension is added to the two dimensional latitude longitude space and discrete grid arrays are obtained in the three dimensional space then continuous grid lattices can be obtained after interpolation filtering of duplicates and meshing and the three dimensional structure composed of spatially and temporally homogeneous grids and enveloped by outer envelope surfaces with critical values of 1 and 1 is developed fig 4 a a series of three dimensional dry wet structures is obtained by three dimensional clustering so that the vague drought and flood alternation process can be visualized to display its spatio temporal distribution and the variation of drought and flood 3 1 4 step 3 identification of dry wet alternation the outer envelope surface of the three dimensional dry wet structure is a non closed irregular surface with a well defined boundary formed based on vague spatial data then the beginning and ending times of each dry wet alternation can be determined and then all consecutive dry wet alternations are extracted from the long time series for a given dry wet alternation the slices parallel to the time axis are obtained in the three dimensional space to determine the time of dry wet coexistence and the first and last slice corresponds to the beginning and ending time of dry wet transition respectively the duration of dry wet alternations may differ from one to another which can be roughly divided into two types the direct and transition here the direct type refers to the transition period from dry wet to wet dry within one month and the transitional type refers to the transition period from dry wet to wet dry for a longer period of time one month take for example the dry to wet transition from february to december in 1983 fig 4 b the first and last slices parallel to the time axis are obtained in may and september respectively thus it is the transitional type with a transition time of 5 months 3 2 indicators of dry wet alternation in order to characterize the spatio temporal distribution of dry wet alternation six indicators are proposed in this study to quantify the three dimensional dry wet structure and its evolution process 1 dry wet transition period t month the dry wet transition period is defined as the time from the beginning to the end of dry wet coexistence which is the height of the three dimensional dry wet structure 2 area of the three dimensional dry wet structure a km2 the area of the three dimensional dry wet structure is defined as the area impacted by a given dry wet alternation event which is the projected area of the three dimensional structure on the two dimensional plane 3 volume of the three dimensional dry wet structure v km 2 month the volume of the three dimensional dry wet structure is defined as the sphere of influence by a given dry wet alternation event 4 mass of the three dimensional dry wet structure m the intensity of the three dimensional dry wet structure is the measure of the severity of drought and flood for a given dry wet alternation event transition period in the three dimensional dry wet structure it is the sum of the absolute difference between the spi 3 values of all wet grids and the critical value s0 and the absolute difference between the spi 3 values of all dry grids and the critical value s1 1 m i 1 k sp i i s 0 j 1 w sp i j s 1 1 m sp i s 0 β 1 n sp i β s 1 where k is the total number of wet grids identified in the dry wet alternation s0 is the positive critical value 1 spii is the spi 3 value of wet grid i w is the total number of dry grids identified in the dry wet alternation s1 is the negative critical value 1 spij is the spi 3 value of dry grid j m is the total number of wet grids identified in the transition period spi is the spi 3 value of wet grid identified in the transition period n is the total number of dry grids identified in the transition period and spiβ is the spi 3 value of dry grid β identified in the transition period 5 density of the three dimensional dry wet structure ρ km 2 month 1 the density of the three dimensional dry wet structure is defined as the ratio of the intensity to the volume of the three dimensional dry wet structure which can indicate the intensity of one dry wet alternation 2 ρ m v where m and v are the mass and volume of the three dimensional dry wet structure respectively 6 dry wet transition rate vz month 1 the dry wet transition rate is defined as the ratio of the absolute difference between the mass one month before the transition period and one month after the transition period to the transition period which can indicate the transition speed 3 v z e 1 g m e f 1 q m f d a total of g dry or wet grids are identified one month after the transition period z and m e is the mass of grid e a total of q dry or wet grids are identified one month before the transition period z and mf is the mass of grid f 3 3 analysis methods 1 principal component analysis given that the six indicators used in this study are inter correlated a multivariate statistical technique principal component analysis pca is used for standardization of each variable and dimension reduction tipping and bishop 1999 the goals of pca are to extract the characteristic information from the data table and compress the size of the data set by keeping only important information this information is expressed as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components in general the number of selected principal components should explain more than 70 of total variation of the original variables jolliffe and cadima 2016 2 wavelet analysis as dry wet alternation can be considered as non stationary and intermittent signals that vary periodically with time the time series can be decomposed into time frequency domains by wavelet analysis to determine the dominant modes of variability and how these modes vary in time liang et al 2011 yang et al 2017 in this study the morlet wavelet is selected as the mother wavelet which is a non orthogonal complex function that can extract both phase and amplitude information of a time series eliminate the false oscillation and smooth the wavelet spectrum 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial distribution of dry wet alternation in this study a total of 24 dry wet alternations are identified in the huai river basin for the period 1961 2015 including 15 dry to wet transitions and 9 wet to dry transitions as shown in table 3 fig 5 shows the two dimensional season time time history diagram of dry wet alternation to illustrate the severity and seasonal variation fig 6 a shows the three dimensional latitude longitude time time history diagram of dry wet alternation to illustrate the variation of the spatial distribution of dry wet alternation with time fig 6 b shows the dry wet alternations extracted for the period 1961 2015 it is seen that dry wet alternation occurs every two years on average in the 1960s drought occurs mostly in autumn and winter and that occurred in 1967 1968 is very severe in the 1970s drought occurs mostly in autumn and winter and wet occurs mostly in spring and summer the dry period is always longer than the wet period in all dry wet alternations occurred around 1975 and the drought occurred in 1976 1977 is more severe in the 1980s dry wet alternation occurs most frequently about once a year and most of them are the direct type this may be attributed to changes in precipitation in the huai river basin in the 1980s and drought occurs mostly in spring autumn and winter and there is a higher frequency of drought in spring compared to the 1960s and 1970s in line with our finding jin et al 2014 have also reported that precipitation showed a decreasing trend in spring severe wetness occurs in the dry wet alternation in 1989 1990 dry wet alternation occurs once at the beginning middle and end of the 1990s respectively and wetness occurs mostly in winter spring and summer however precipitation shows an increasing trend in winter which is consistent with previous findings jin et al 2014 it is also found that the wetness in 1991 and 1995 1997 is severe and lasts a long time in the 2000s severe and persistent drought occurs only in 2002 however there is a high frequency of dry wet alternation with long duration of drought and wetness but drought is more severe 4 2 spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation the three dimensional spatio temporal evolution map of all dry wet alternations identified in this study and the spatial distribution of the transition rate are illustrated and that of each dry wet alternation are also investigated fig 7 shows the maps for eight typical dry to wet transitions that have long transition time widespread influence and high severity it is seen that the dry wet alternation pattern in the huai river basin is evolving and changing rather than static more specifically the spatio temporal distribution and influence range differ substantially at different times it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s wet in the west and dry in the east in the transitional period of the 1980s dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s transition is observed again in the 2010s this can be attributed to the high spatio temporal variability of precipitation as a result of monsoon anomalies in the case of weak summer monsoon near the huai river basin participation is concentrated in the southern part of the basin and it is lower in intensity and shorter in duration in the northern part of the basin the strength of the monsoon in early winter can also have an effect on the dry wet variation of the year sun et al 2019 in line with our study wang et al 2016 have also revealed that precipitation is decreased in the northern part of the huai river basin and the dry trend is intensified with the decrease of the annual maximum consecutive wet days while a wet trend is observed in the southern part with the increase of annual precipitation and decrease of annual maximum consecutive dry days it is noted that the trend is reversed in the 1960s 2000s as it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s but dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s however the trend may be reversed again with the advent of the transition period in the 2010s in dry wet alternation the basin is more likely to experience widespread almost across of the basin drought with a duration of about two months because of moisture deficit this is because unlike wet the flood is affected by precipitation of the current and previous days lu 2009 and only a series of consecutive or overlapping flood events can lead to widespread and long term wet thus the probability of widespread wet is much lower than that of drought 4 3 trend analysis the trends of the six indicators transition period transition rate area volume mass and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure are fitted to illustrate the annual variation of each indicator for a given month and the monthly variation of each indicator for a given year fig 8 from the interannual point of view it is seen that the transition period is longest in june july and it is increased from the beginning to the middle of the year and then decreased from the middle to the end of the year the longest transition period lasts for about 4 months from july to october the transition rate reaches a minimum in july august and a maximum in january the mass volume density and area of the three dimensional dry wet structure exhibit a declining trend since january however the mass volume and area especially the area exhibit an increasing trend since september october august and october november respectively while the density remains unchanged since july august a non uniform distribution of precipitation is observed from june to august especially in july in which the frequency of dry or wet extremes reaches a maximum no precipitation anomalies occur in january and december wang 2002 this is probably the main reason for the significant variation of dry wet alternation within a year interannually the transition period is slightly decreased before 1976 and increased after 1978 similarly the mass volume and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure have been decreasing since the 1960s but increasing since 1982 1981 and 1979 respectively the area is increased before 2006 but slightly decreased after 2007 this is probably related to the transition of precipitation in the huai river basin in the 1980s the negative anomalies in winter and summer are changed into positive anomalies at the early and middle of the 1980s respectively while the precipitation in autumn begins to decrease since the early 1980s jin et al 2014 the transition rate has been increasing since 1960 until the maximum is reached in 2000 2001 and then it remains constant until a decreasing trend takes place in 2010 an obvious turning point is observed for the relationship between the pre winter north pacific oscillation npo and the summer precipitation in the huai river basin around 2000 as they are negatively correlated before 2000 but positively correlated after 2000 luo et al 2019 this may account for the high transition rate observed in 2000 2001 4 4 principal component analysis principal component analysis fig 9 is conducted to extract the principal components of the 6 dry wet alternation indicators and the cumulative variance and the percentage of the total variance explained are summarized in table 4 it is seen that the first three principal components account for 65 16 24 06 and 6 28 of the total variance respectively with a cumulative variance of 95 50 this implies that most of the information is captured and the three principal components can be used to adequately characterize the spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation table 5 shows the two dimensional biplot the three dimensional biplot and the eigenvector matrix of principal components it is found that the pc1 that is closely related to the volume mass and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure can be used to describe the severity of dry wet alternation the pc2 that is closely related to the transition period and transition rate can be used to describe the transition speed while the pc3 that is closely related to the area of three dimensional dry wet structure can used to describe the influence range 4 5 morlet wavelet analysis wavelet analysis is conducted on the time series of the three principal components severity transition speed and influence range to determine their variations at different timescales and to qualitatively analyze the future trend of dry wet alternation fig 10 four periods 6 8a 9 11a 15 17a and 20 22a are identified for the severity of dry wet alternation which are stable throughout the study period the 21a period is the first principal period in which the average period of the severity is 15a wang et al 2002 found that there was an oscillation period of about 8a for precipitation anomaly in the huai river basin and it was uniformly distributed over the entire time domain it was also found the absolute values of positive and negative wavelet coefficients were approximately the same and the period of 8a was associated with dry and wet extremes in the basin this study also reveals that the transition speed oscillates with periods of 8 10a 11 13a and 14 19a the highest oscillation is observed at a period of 9a at which the average period of the basin is 8a and there are 7 periods of dry wet alternation the influence range of dry wet alternation oscillates with periods of 7 9a 9 11a and 16 23a and the first peak corresponds to the period of 10a this is in agreement with the findings of jin et al 2014 that there was an oscillation period of 10a for summer precipitation in the huai river basin and 5 dry wet alternations with an average period of 11a were obtained 5 discussion previous studies have examined dry and wet events separately because of unique temporal and spatial characteristics and evaluation indicators however researchers have come to realize that both of them are closely related to precipitation anomalies he and sheffield 2020 although precipitation plays a critical role in mitigating the impact of drought sudden heavy rainfall is likely to cause severe flood and consequently the drought flood abrupt alternation because of its potential impacts on human life and property drought flood abrupt alternation has become a topic of extensive research in past decades espinoza et al 2012 hastenrath et al 2010 yoon et al 2018 there is a need to understand the occurrence and development of drought flood abrupt alternation many indicators e g ldfai sdfai and rdfai have been proposed to determine dry wet conditions but their shortcomings are quite obvious such as coarse timescale fixed time of drought flood alternation and difficulty in quantifying the duration of drought flood alternation thus some daily scale indicators such as dwaai are proposed which take into account the possibility of drought flood abrupt alternation at any time and thus make it possible to quantify the occurrence of drought flood abrupt alternation at a daily timescale a number of meteorological indicators such as spi he et al 2015 ionita et al 2015b spei huang et al 2017 wu et al 2020 pdsi de luca et al 2020 ssi wu et al 2017 and number of consecutive rainless days bi et al 2019 have also been proposed it should be noted that the duration of drought and flood is determined based on the precipitation of the current and previous days and these indicators may not be applicable to dry wet alternation that consists of abrupt alternation coexistence and slow transition of drought and flood because of the vague spatio temporal information in this study spatio temporal clustering is conducted based on spi to form a series of three dimensional dry wet structures enveloped by envelope surfaces which is non closed irregular surfaces with well defined boundaries and composed of spatially homogeneous and continuous grids the surface can be used to determine the beginning and ending time of each dry wet alternation in time and space so that the wet dry period and the number of dry wet alternation can be determined in order to obtain the complete dry wet alternation process in the long time series despite the recognition that dry wet alternation has both spatial and temporal characteristics its evolution in space and time is investigated independently in most previous studies for instance chen et al 2020 have investigated changes in the frequency of the average area of the dry wet alternation in different seasons and the total number of dry wet months between historical and future periods he et al 2015 explored the annual and seasonal trends of dry wet conditions in the huai river basin by m k test and the significant transitions of precipitation by non parametric pettitt test as dry wet alternation evolves in both time and space and has high spatial heterogeneity it would be inappropriate to explore the evolution in one dimension by keeping the other dimension constant based on the idea of controlling variables in this study the drought and flood are visualized to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution and evolution and dry wet alternation in the huai river basin is identified it is found that dry wet alternation occurs most frequently in the 1980s and then in the 1960s and there is an increase in the frequency of drought in spring and wet in winter consecutive slices are obtained at each unit time interval for each dry wet alternation in order to better understand the occurrence development migration and disappearance of dry wet alternation in the space domain there exists a transition in the spatial distribution of dry and wet regions in the 1960s 2000s as it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s but dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s it is also found that drought is more likely to have larger influence range and higher severity than wet however it is not enough to know the process of dry wet alternation because of its multiple characteristics shan et al 2018 proposed a dry wet abrupt alternation index considering the differences in dry and wet between earlier and later periods to precisely determine dry wet abrupt alternation luca et al 2020 used the dry wet ratio to measure the relative occurrence of wet and dry extremes and the extreme dry wet transition time intervals to quantify the average time interval between hydrological extremes with opposite signs wet to dry and dry to wet transitions for each grid cell the dry wet transition period and transition rate proposed in this study take into account more than dry wet abrupt alternation and dry wet extremes and they can be used to determine the time and speed of dry wet alternation it is found that the transition period and transition rate reach the maximum and minimum of the year in june august in the huai river basin respectively in addition the mass volume and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure are used to evaluate the severity of drought and flood the influence range and the strength of each dry wet alternation it is revealed that there is a turning point for the severity and influence range in about 1980 and both of them exhibit an increasing trend these indicators can be used to quantify the dry wet alternation from multiple dimensions perspectives and levels in order to understand the spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation the limitations of this study should be noted the envelope surface of the three dimensional dry wet structure is non closed and thus there may be some errors in the calculation of the volume and intensity 6 conclusions previous studies have focused on drought flood abrupt alternation in either time or space and the evaluation indicators are not applicable to dry wet alternation this study proposes an identification method of dry wet alternation the three dimensional structure is developed and consecutive dry wet alternations are extracted in the long time series the spatio temporal distribution and evolution of dry wet alternation are analyzed the three dimensional dry wet structure is developed by using three dimensional clustering and the dry wet period and alternation are identified based on the outer envelope surface the migration of dry wet alternation is simulated to determine its spatio temporal distribution six indicators are proposed to quantify the dry wet alternation and trend analysis principal component analysis and wavelet analysis are conducted to investigate the spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation the main conclusions are as follows 1 the method proposed in this study can be used to identify and extract consecutive dry wet alternations in the long time series the three dimensional dry wet structure is developed to simulate the evolution of dry wet alternation the time dimension is added into the two dimensional latitude longitude space to better describe dry wet alternation and extract dry wet alternation more completely it is found that dry wet alternation occurs most frequently in the 1980s and then in the 1960s and 2010s in the huai river basin and it becomes increasingly wetter in winter and drier in spring 2 in the three dimensional dry wet structure corresponding to one dry wet alternation consecutive slices are obtained at each unit time interval to better understand the occurrence development migration and disappearance of dry wet alternation in the space domain it is found that there exists a transition in the spatial distribution of dry wet regions in the huai river basin in the 1960s 2000s as it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s but dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s drought is more likely to have large influence range and high severity than wet 3 six indicators dry wet transition period transition rate area volume mass density of the three dimensional dry wet structure are used to quantify the spatio temporal evolution characteristics severity transition speed and influence range of dry wet alternation because of precipitation anomalies the transition period and transition rate reach the maximum in june august the severity and influence range exhibit an increasing trend since 1980s and the influence range remains unchanged since 2001 the dry wet alternation speed and influence range have a principal period of 8a and 10a respectively a future research direction is to explore the indicators that are generally applicable to dry wet abrupt alternation coexistence and slow alternation based on indicators for dry wet abrupt alternation and have different timescales for different types of dry wet alternation in order to identify dry wet alternation more quickly and accurately credit authorship contribution statement wen yi li writing original draft formal analysis xin wen conceptualization methodology software funding acquisition

3079,the dry wet alternation evolves in both time and space and it has the characteristics of both dry and wet events previous studies have focused more on dry wet abrupt alternation and little is known about dry wet alternation in larger time scale and space scales in addition previous studies have focused either on time or on space domain without considering spatio temporal continuity of dry wet alternation this study proposes an identification method of dry wet alternation which can be used to identify and extract successive dry wet alternations in a long time series a series of three dimensional dry wet structures is developed to visualize dry wet alternation and simulate the spatial temporal evolution the time dimension is added into the two dimensional latitude longitude space to better describe dry wet alternation and extract dry wet alternation more completely consecutive slices are obtained at each unit time interval to characterize the occurrence development migration and disappearance of dry wet alternation in the space domain in order to better understand the spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation six indicators transition period transition rate area volume intensity and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure are proposed to quantify the attributes of dry wet alternation such as the transition period and rate scope of influence and severity and statistical methods are used to analyze the complex spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation it is found that dry wet alternation occurs most frequently in the 1980s and then in the 1960s and 2010s in the huai river basin there exists a transition in the spatial distribution of dry wet regions in the huai river basin in the 1960s 2000s as it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s but dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s drought is more likely to have large influence range and high severity than wet the transition period and rate reach the extremum in june august and the severity and influence range exhibit an increasing trend since 1980s our study may contribute to better understanding the formation and development of dry wet alternation under environmental changes keywords dry wet alternation dry wet identification distribution pattern evolution characteristics 1 introduction drought is a climatic phenomenon that can occur in any part of the world as a result of water deficit for an extended period of time and it is usually a slow continuous and complex process with high spatio temporal variability and a wide spectrum of influence hao and singh 2015 in contrast flood is the result of prolonged or intense precipitation and it usually occurs abruptly and periodically and has high seasonal and regional variability wilby and keenan 2012 it is clear that continuous occurrence of flood events make the region susceptible to a long term wet spell the dry wet alternation is alternating occurrence of dry and wet extremes in a given period of time in recent years the frequency intensity and impacted areas of dry wet alternation have been increasing at an alarming rate elleder 2010 probably because the climate system becomes unstable in the context of global warming atmospheric circulation anomaly and accelerated hydrological cycle and as a consequence dry wet extremes such as rainstorms floods and droughts become more frequent and intense as dry wet alternation has the characteristics of both dry and wet extremes it would be expected to be more destructive to human life global food production and water cycle than single dry or wet extremes fussel 2009 ipcc 2013 this suggests the need for more quantitative studies of the spatio temporal variability and evolution characteristics of dry wet alternation in order to better understand the meteorological and hydrological evolution under climate change and to provide early warning for meteorological disasters the frequent and widespread occurrence of meteorological extremes such as drought and flood under climate change makes the study of dry wet alternation in a short period of time particularly relevant previous studies have investigated the characteristics and causes of the abrupt transition from extreme drought to flood in 2010 2011 in the amazonas river and tributaries espinoza et al 2012 coexistence of two contrasting seasonal extremes floods in amazonia and droughts in northeast brazil in tropical south america in 2012 marengo et al 2013 abrupt transition from long term extreme drought to flood with the occurrence of heavy rainfall in texas yoon et al 2018 the wetland area in response to drought flood abrupt alternation in the yangtze river basin tian et al 2014 and intense drought flood alternation in other regions of china ionita et al 2015a ji et al 2017 yan et al 2013 a number of quantitative methods have also been proposed to identify drought flood alternation for instance wu et al proposed the long or short cycle drought flood abrupt alternation indicator ldfai sdfai considering the precipitation difference in summer and then analyzed the relationship between long term drought flood abrupt alternation in summer and atmospheric circulation anomalies in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river considering the fixed time for drought flood alternation in ldfai sdfai zhang et al 2012 proposed the runoff drought flood abrupt alternation indicator rdfai based on runoff based on which the drought flood abrupt alternation during the main rainy season in the huai river basin was analyzed the dry wet abrupt alternation indicator dwaai was proposed to deal with the problems that could lead to inaccurate identification of drought flood abrupt alternation such as inappropriate timescale and lack of consideration of the duration and speed of drought flood alternation fan 2019 li et al 2017 shan et al 2018 shan et al 2017 some meteorological indicators for analysis of drought and flood are also used to identify drought flood alternation because of simple calculation and wide applicability for instance zhang et al 2019 found that the consecutive days of non effective precipitation and the accumulative effective precipitation in the flood period could accurately describe the evolution of drought flood abrupt alternation tian et al 2014 analyzed changes in wetland area in response to a sudden transition from drought to flood in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river based on the standard precipitation indicator spi huang et al 2020 analyzed the characteristics and variability of dry wet alternation by using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indicator spei it is noted that recent studies have focused more on the temporal or spatial distribution and evolution of dry wet alternation shan et al 2018 investigated the temporal distribution of dry wet abrupt alternation in summer based on daily precipitation as well as the spatial distribution and interdecadal variation of the frequency of dry wet abrupt alternation lonita et al 2015b investigated the spatial variability of dry wet alternation in the catchment area of the danube river by empirical orthogonal function and the temporal variability by wavelet power spectrum he et al 2015 explored the annual and seasonal trends of dry wet conditions in the huai river basin by m k test and the significant transitions of precipitation by non parametric pettitt test luca et al 2020 defined wet dry extremes using the monthly self calibrated palmer drought severity indicator based on the penman monteith model sc pdsi pm and calculated the percentage of total land area impacted by extreme wet dry neutral and wet dry events then two new indicators wet dry ratio and extreme transition time intervals were proposed the former was used to measure the relative occurrence of wet or dry extremes whereas the latter was used to quantify the average time interval between hydrological extremes with opposite signs wet to dry and dry to wet transitions for each grid cell chen et al 2020a used the convection permitting climate model to describe the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation and calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between dry wet abrupt alternation and climatic variables in the historical period ma et al 2018 analyzed the spatial distribution and the time series of the monthly precipitation anomaly when dry wet abrupt alternation occurred in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in 2011 and identified dry wet abrupt alternation using spectral nudging and re initialized simulations chen et al 2020b compared the total number of dry wet months between historical and future periods for each grid cell using multimodel ensemble simulations in order to examine the relative changes in wet and dry periods the frequency of dry wet alternation was estimated based on different categories and the percentage of grid cells i e land area within a specific category for the frequency of dry wet alternation was detected however it should be noted that the spatial and temporal variability of dry wet alternation are usually considered separately in previous studies as dry wet alternation is a spatially and temporally continuous process it should be considered in the three dimensional time and space domains some attempts have been made to investigate the spatio temporal evolution of drought in the three dimensional domain for instance guo et al 2018 investigated the spatio temporal characteristics of drought in central asia based on spei and three dimensional clustering on a monthly scale liu et al 2020 investigated the duration severity area characteristics of drought in eastern china using the three dimensional clustering and visualized the development of drought via the spatial expansion of drought patches and their transferring paths zhu et al 2019 obtained the time series of grid based standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indicator spei and standardized runoff indicator sri from the simulations of the variable infiltration capacity vic model in the yellow river basin and used the three dimensional time latitude longitude method to identify drought and used the copula function to construct the joint distribution of meteorological and hydrological droughts rulinda et al 2012a characterized and quantified the drought as a vague spatial phenomenon in east africa using ndvi data and visualized its evolution in space and time rulinda et al 2012b visualized and quantified the movement of drought using remote sensing data and geographic information system wang et al 2015 proposed the space time permutation scan statistic method to determine the spatio temporal clusters of drought which were grouped into five stages using the space time cube model for visualization as a result the evolution of high frequency drought areas could be depicted in the long temporal scale in short dry wet alternation is a complex phenomenon that includes abrupt transition coexistence and slow transition between drought and flood it is the result of uneven moisture distribution in the large scale atmospheric water vapor transport and evolves in both time and space a common limitation of extant studies is that they have treated the temporal and spatial domains separately in general the temporal variation and evolution of dry wet alternation is analyzed only in time domain and the spatial distribution is analyzed only in spatial domain however little is known about the three dimensional spatio temporal variation of dry wet alternation however it should be noted that dry wet alternation is characterized by the complex coupling of spatial and temporal scales rather than their simple combination for this reason it is impossible to grasp the whole picture of the variation and evolution characteristics of dry wet alternation in only time or space domain this study proposes an identification method of dry wet alternations and investigates their spatio temporal distribution and evolution in the three dimensional time latitude longitude domains first the three dimensional structure of single dry wet alternation is developed and the three dimensional structures of consecutive dry wet alternations are developed over a long time series and all dry wet alternations are identified next six indicators are proposed to quantify dry wet alternation including transition period area volume intensity and density of the three dimensional structure and transition rate finally the variation of these six indicators for the period 1961 2015 is analyzed to illustrate the evolution of dry wet alternation in time and space 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the huai river basin 111 55 121 25 e 30 55 36 36 n is located in eastern china and stretched from the yellow river basin in the north the yangtze river basin in the south and the yellow sea in the east it covers an area of about 0 27 million km2 and has two sub basins mainstream and yishusi river most parts of the basin are plains with mountains and hills only in the western margins and the northeast regions the study area is located in the eastern monsoon zone and the north south climate transition zone it has non uniform spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and the average annual precipitation is about 920 mm 63 of which occurs during the period from june to september 2 2 history drought and flood events historically drought and flood disasters occurred very frequently in the huai river basin because of variable climate and complex geographic and underlying surface conditions the region experienced drought flood alternation and continuous droughts or floods from time to time for instance severe droughts occurred in 1961 1962 and 1966 severe floods occurred in 1965 1968 and 1969 and drought flood abrupt alternation occurred in 1962 1965 and 1968 as shown in table 1 bureau 2014 commission 1990 2 3 study data the daily precipitation data for the period 1961 2015 are collected from china s ground precipitation 0 5 0 5 gridded dataset v2 0 https data cma cn which covers 2472 meteorological stations across the country and is the most widely used meteorological dataset in china mao et al 2016 pan et al 2017 ren et al 2015 zhong et al 2020 a total of 120 grids in the huai river basin are selected as shown in fig 1 3 methods 3 1 identification of dry wet alternation 3 1 1 framework dry wet alternation consists of dry to wet and wet to dry transition here the dry to wet transition is described as an example drought occurs when precipitation is lower than normal for an extended period however the impact of drought would be mitigated and flood may occur with the increase of precipitation amounts and successive occurrence of flood events in neighboring regions may lead to co existence of dry wet regions if precipitation continues or becomes more intense dry regions disappear and all regions become wet however it is also possible that dry to wet transition can be accomplished more rapidly in case of intense and concentrated precipitation in this study the identification of dry to wet transition is illustrated as an example first a monthly timescale is selected and the critical values of indicators are determined to determine the dry wet states of grids then two dimensional clustering is performed to cluster spatially homogeneous dry wet grids into dry wet regions and then three dimensional clustering is performed to cluster discrete dry wet regions into dry wet structures which are composed of homogeneous and temporally and spatially continuous grids after that three dimensional structures of consecutive dry wet alternations are developed finally all dry wet alternation events in a long time series are identified based on the outer envelope surface of each three dimensional structure and the beginning and ending times of each dry wet alternation and the time of dry wet coexistence are determined the flowchart for identification of dry wet alternation is shown in fig 2 3 1 2 step 1 selection of indicators here the drought flood abrupt alternation refers to the rapid transition from drought to flood within one month because of sudden heavy rainfall as the beginning and ending times of the drought to flood transition can be accurate to the day a daily timescale is often used in previous studies to determine the exact date at which drought to flood transition occurs however dry wet alternation involves successive drought flood abrupt transitions in neighboring regions and the transition period may overlap with each other it takes several months for dry wet alternation to occur for this reason it would be more appropriate to use a monthly timescale as no indicators are currently available to direct quantify dry wet alternation on a monthly scale some meteorological indicators that are universally applicable such as spi spei pdsi and z are used in this study the spi proposed by mckee et al 1993 is a useful measure of dry or wet conditions but calculation of spi for a specific time period requires a long term monthly precipitation database and a given probability distribution hayes et al 1997 as precipitation is considered the main driving force of dry wet alternation and the calculation is simple it is appropriate for decision making applications another advantage is that spi is spatially invariant and thus spis from different climate zones and regions are directly comparable given the non uniform spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation in the huai river basin the use of spi is considered to be appropriate the sensitivity of spi for identification of dry wet alternation is related to the timescale spi can be calculated on any timescales e g 1 3 6 12 and 48 months and a shorter timescale e g 1 and 3 months is more appropriate to identify and monitor meteorological drought as the huai river basin is located in warm temperate semi humid monsoon climate and the north south climate transition zone the dry wet alternation exhibits high seasonal variability thus the timescale of 3 months spi 3 is used in this study where spi 3 1 is the critical value for wet condition and spi 3 1 is the critical value for dry condition mckee et al 1995 the classification of spi 3 is shown in table 2 3 1 3 step 2 construction of three dimensional structures all dry wet grids are identified based on their spi 3 values those grids with spi 3 values lower than 1 are identified as having severely or extremely dry conditions while those grids with spi 3 values higher than 1 are identified as having severely or extremely wet conditions 1 two dimensional clustering two dimensional clustering is performed to cluster discrete dry wet grids into two dimensional dry wet patches each of which is composed of spatially homogeneous and continuous grids the shape of wet and dry patches formed by their projection on a 2d plane change continuously in response to the dynamic evolution of drought and flood in both time and space under the influence of various meteorological factors the dry wet alternation occurred in 1983 has an appropriate spatial two dimensional coverage clearly observable dynamic migration in the study area and a certain transition period that we can easily identify the transitional state and the start and end time of the dry wet alternation so take for example the dry wet alternation occurred in the period from february to december of 1983 fig 3 where the dry period is from february to september the wet period is from may to december and the concurrent dry and wet period is from may to september a dry region first appears in the upper reaches of the huai river and its area is reduced as it moves to the middle reaches in march april in may june the dry region moves from the southwest to the northeast and its area first increases and then decreases in july august the dry region is confined to the northern part of the basin and its area is kept almost constant finally it disappears in september the wet region first appears in the northwest part of the basin and then it moves westward and southward along the basin the area is small before september and increases from october to december finally the wet region disappears in the upper reaches of the huai river 2 three dimensional clustering voxler is a three dimensional scientific visualization program oriented primarily toward three dimensional data display and three dimensional space modeling and it has been widely used in hydrology meteorology and other fields the time dimension is added to the two dimensional latitude longitude space and discrete grid arrays are obtained in the three dimensional space then continuous grid lattices can be obtained after interpolation filtering of duplicates and meshing and the three dimensional structure composed of spatially and temporally homogeneous grids and enveloped by outer envelope surfaces with critical values of 1 and 1 is developed fig 4 a a series of three dimensional dry wet structures is obtained by three dimensional clustering so that the vague drought and flood alternation process can be visualized to display its spatio temporal distribution and the variation of drought and flood 3 1 4 step 3 identification of dry wet alternation the outer envelope surface of the three dimensional dry wet structure is a non closed irregular surface with a well defined boundary formed based on vague spatial data then the beginning and ending times of each dry wet alternation can be determined and then all consecutive dry wet alternations are extracted from the long time series for a given dry wet alternation the slices parallel to the time axis are obtained in the three dimensional space to determine the time of dry wet coexistence and the first and last slice corresponds to the beginning and ending time of dry wet transition respectively the duration of dry wet alternations may differ from one to another which can be roughly divided into two types the direct and transition here the direct type refers to the transition period from dry wet to wet dry within one month and the transitional type refers to the transition period from dry wet to wet dry for a longer period of time one month take for example the dry to wet transition from february to december in 1983 fig 4 b the first and last slices parallel to the time axis are obtained in may and september respectively thus it is the transitional type with a transition time of 5 months 3 2 indicators of dry wet alternation in order to characterize the spatio temporal distribution of dry wet alternation six indicators are proposed in this study to quantify the three dimensional dry wet structure and its evolution process 1 dry wet transition period t month the dry wet transition period is defined as the time from the beginning to the end of dry wet coexistence which is the height of the three dimensional dry wet structure 2 area of the three dimensional dry wet structure a km2 the area of the three dimensional dry wet structure is defined as the area impacted by a given dry wet alternation event which is the projected area of the three dimensional structure on the two dimensional plane 3 volume of the three dimensional dry wet structure v km 2 month the volume of the three dimensional dry wet structure is defined as the sphere of influence by a given dry wet alternation event 4 mass of the three dimensional dry wet structure m the intensity of the three dimensional dry wet structure is the measure of the severity of drought and flood for a given dry wet alternation event transition period in the three dimensional dry wet structure it is the sum of the absolute difference between the spi 3 values of all wet grids and the critical value s0 and the absolute difference between the spi 3 values of all dry grids and the critical value s1 1 m i 1 k sp i i s 0 j 1 w sp i j s 1 1 m sp i s 0 β 1 n sp i β s 1 where k is the total number of wet grids identified in the dry

statistical technique principal component analysis pca is used for standardization of each variable and dimension reduction tipping and bishop 1999 the goals of pca are to extract the characteristic information from the data table and compress the size of the data set by keeping only important information this information is expressed as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components in general the number of selected principal components should explain more than 70 of total variation of the original variables jolliffe and cadima 2016 2 wavelet analysis as dry wet alternation can be considered as non stationary and intermittent signals that vary periodically with time the time series can be decomposed into time frequency domains by wavelet analysis to determine the dominant modes of variability and how these modes vary in time liang et al 2011 yang et al 2017 in this study the morlet wavelet is selected as the mother wavelet which is a non orthogonal complex function that can extract both phase and amplitude information of a time series eliminate the false oscillation and smooth the wavelet spectrum 4 results 4 1 temporal and spatial distribution of dry wet alternation in this study a total of 24 dry wet alternations are identified in the huai river basin for the period 1961 2015 including 15 dry to wet transitions and 9 wet to dry transitions as shown in table 3 fig 5 shows the two dimensional season time time history diagram of dry wet alternation to illustrate the severity and seasonal variation fig 6 a shows the three dimensional latitude longitude time time history diagram of dry wet alternation to illustrate the variation of the spatial distribution of dry wet alternation with time fig 6 b shows the dry wet alternations extracted for the period 1961 2015 it is seen that dry wet alternation occurs every two years on average in the 1960s drought occurs mostly in autumn and winter and that occurred in 1967 1968 is very severe in the 1970s drought occurs mostly in autumn and winter and wet occurs mostly in spring and summer the dry period is always longer than the wet period in all dry wet alternations occurred around 1975 and the drought occurred in 1976 1977 is more severe in the 1980s dry wet alternation occurs most frequently about once a year and most of them are the direct type this may be attributed to changes in precipitation in the huai river basin in the 1980s and drought occurs mostly in spring autumn and winter and there is a higher frequency of drought in spring compared to the 1960s and 1970s in line with our finding jin et al 2014 have also reported that precipitation showed a decreasing trend in spring severe wetness occurs in the dry wet alternation in 1989 1990 dry wet alternation occurs once at the beginning middle and end of the 1990s respectively and wetness occurs mostly in winter spring and summer however precipitation shows an increasing trend in winter which is consistent with previous findings jin et al 2014 it is also found that the wetness in 1991 and 1995 1997 is severe and lasts a long time in the 2000s severe and persistent drought occurs only in 2002 however there is a high frequency of dry wet alternation with long duration of drought and wetness but drought is more severe 4 2 spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation the three dimensional spatio temporal evolution map of all dry wet alternations identified in this study and the spatial distribution of the transition rate are illustrated and that of each dry wet alternation are also investigated fig 7 shows the maps for eight typical dry to wet transitions that have long transition time widespread influence and high severity it is seen that the dry wet alternation pattern in the huai river basin is evolving and changing rather than static more specifically the spatio temporal distribution and influence range differ substantially at different times it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s wet in the west and dry in the east in the transitional period of the 1980s dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s transition is observed again in the 2010s this can be attributed to the high spatio temporal variability of precipitation as a result of monsoon anomalies in the case of weak summer monsoon near the huai river basin participation is concentrated in the southern part of the basin and it is lower in intensity and shorter in duration in the northern part of the basin the strength of the monsoon in early winter can also have an effect on the dry wet variation of the year sun et al 2019 in line with our study wang et al 2016 have also revealed that precipitation is decreased in the northern part of the huai river basin and the dry trend is intensified with the decrease of the annual maximum consecutive wet days while a wet trend is observed in the southern part with the increase of annual precipitation and decrease of annual maximum consecutive dry days it is noted that the trend is reversed in the 1960s 2000s as it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s but dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s however the trend may be reversed again with the advent of the transition period in the 2010s in dry wet alternation the basin is more likely to experience widespread almost across of the basin drought with a duration of about two months because of moisture deficit this is because unlike wet the flood is affected by precipitation of the current and previous days lu 2009 and only a series of consecutive or overlapping flood events can lead to widespread and long term wet thus the probability of widespread wet is much lower than that of drought 4 3 trend analysis the trends of the six indicators transition period transition rate area volume mass and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure are fitted to illustrate the annual variation of each indicator for a given month and the monthly variation of each indicator for a given year fig 8 from the interannual point of view it is seen that the transition period is longest in june july and it is increased from the beginning to the middle of the year and then decreased from the middle to the end of the year the longest transition period lasts for about 4 months from july to october the transition rate reaches a minimum in july august and a maximum in january the mass volume density and area of the three dimensional dry wet structure exhibit a declining trend since january however the mass volume and area especially the area exhibit an increasing trend since september october august and october november respectively while the density remains unchanged since july august a non uniform distribution of precipitation is observed from june to august especially in july in which the frequency of dry or wet extremes reaches a maximum no precipitation anomalies occur in january and december wang 2002 this is probably the main reason for the significant variation of dry wet alternation within a year interannually the transition period is slightly decreased before 1976 and increased after 1978 similarly the mass volume and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure have been decreasing since the 1960s but increasing since 1982 1981 and 1979 respectively the area is increased before 2006 but slightly decreased after 2007 this is probably related to the transition of precipitation in the huai river basin in the 1980s the negative anomalies in winter and summer are changed into positive anomalies at the early and middle of the 1980s respectively while the precipitation in autumn begins to decrease since the early 1980s jin et al 2014 the transition rate has been increasing since 1960 until the maximum is reached in 2000 2001 and then it remains constant until a decreasing trend takes place in 2010 an obvious turning point is observed for the relationship between the pre winter north pacific oscillation npo and the summer precipitation in the huai river basin around 2000 as they are negatively correlated before 2000 but positively correlated after 2000 luo et al 2019 this may account for the high transition rate observed in 2000 2001 4 4 principal component analysis principal component analysis fig 9 is conducted to extract the principal components of the 6 dry wet alternation indicators and the cumulative variance and the percentage of the total variance explained are summarized in table 4 it is seen that the first three principal components account for 65 16 24 06 and 6 28 of the total variance respectively with a cumulative variance of 95 50 this implies that most of the information is captured and the three principal components can be used to adequately characterize the spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation table 5 shows the two dimensional biplot the three dimensional biplot and the eigenvector matrix of principal components it is found that the pc1 that is closely related to the volume mass and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure can be used to describe the severity of dry wet alternation the pc2 that is closely related to the transition period and transition rate can be used to describe the transition speed while the pc3 that is closely related to the area of three dimensional dry wet structure can used to describe the influence range 4 5 morlet wavelet analysis wavelet analysis is conducted on the time series of the three principal components severity transition speed and influence range to determine their variations at different timescales and to qualitatively analyze the future trend of dry wet alternation fig 10 four periods 6 8a 9 11a 15 17a and 20 22a are identified for the severity of dry wet alternation which are stable throughout the study period the 21a period is the first principal period in which the average period of the severity is 15a wang et al 2002 found that there was an oscillation period of about 8a for precipitation anomaly in the huai river basin and it was uniformly distributed over the entire time domain it was also found the absolute values of positive and negative wavelet coefficients were approximately the same and the period of 8a was associated with dry and wet extremes in the basin this study also reveals that the transition speed oscillates with periods of 8 10a 11 13a and 14 19a the highest oscillation is observed at a period of 9a at which the average period of the basin is 8a and there are 7 periods of dry wet alternation the influence range of dry wet alternation oscillates with periods of 7 9a 9 11a and 16 23a and the first peak corresponds to the period of 10a this is in agreement with the findings of jin et al 2014 that there was an oscillation period of 10a for summer precipitation in the huai river basin and 5 dry wet alternations with an average period of 11a were obtained 5 discussion previous studies have examined dry and wet events separately because of unique temporal and spatial characteristics and evaluation indicators however researchers have come to realize that both of them are closely related to precipitation anomalies he and sheffield 2020 although precipitation plays a critical role in mitigating the impact of drought sudden heavy rainfall is likely to cause severe flood and consequently the drought flood abrupt alternation because of its potential impacts on human life and property drought flood abrupt alternation has become a topic of extensive research in past decades espinoza et al 2012 hastenrath et al 2010 yoon et al 2018 there is a need to understand the occurrence and development of drought flood abrupt alternation many indicators e g ldfai sdfai and rdfai have been proposed to determine dry wet conditions but their shortcomings are quite obvious such as coarse timescale fixed time of drought flood alternation and difficulty in quantifying the duration of drought flood alternation thus some daily scale indicators such as dwaai are proposed which take into account the possibility of drought flood abrupt alternation at any time and thus make it possible to quantify the occurrence of drought flood abrupt alternation at a daily timescale a number of meteorological indicators such as spi he et al 2015 ionita et al 2015b spei huang et al 2017 wu et al 2020 pdsi de luca et al 2020 ssi wu et al 2017 and number of consecutive rainless days bi et al 2019 have also been proposed it should be noted that the duration of drought and flood is determined based on the precipitation of the current and previous days and these indicators may not be applicable to dry wet alternation that consists of abrupt alternation coexistence and slow transition of drought and flood because of the vague spatio temporal information in this study spatio temporal clustering is conducted based on spi to form a series of three dimensional dry wet structures enveloped by envelope surfaces which is non closed irregular surfaces with well defined boundaries and composed of spatially homogeneous and continuous grids the surface can be used to determine the beginning and ending time of each dry wet alternation in time and space so that the wet dry period and the number of dry wet alternation can be determined in order to obtain the complete dry wet alternation process in the long time series despite the recognition that dry wet alternation has both spatial and temporal characteristics its evolution in space and time is investigated independently in most previous studies for instance chen et al 2020 have investigated changes in the frequency of the average area of the dry wet alternation in different seasons and the total number of dry wet months between historical and future periods he et al 2015 explored the annual and seasonal trends of dry wet conditions in the huai river basin by m k test and the significant transitions of precipitation by non parametric pettitt test as dry wet alternation evolves in both time and space and has high spatial heterogeneity it would be inappropriate to explore the evolution in one dimension by keeping the other dimension constant based on the idea of controlling variables in this study the drought and flood are visualized to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution and evolution and dry wet alternation in the huai river basin is identified it is found that dry wet alternation occurs most frequently in the 1980s and then in the 1960s and there is an increase in the frequency of drought in spring and wet in winter consecutive slices are obtained at each unit time interval for each dry wet alternation in order to better understand the occurrence development migration and disappearance of dry wet alternation in the space domain there exists a transition in the spatial distribution of dry and wet regions in the 1960s 2000s as it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s but dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s it is also found that drought is more likely to have larger influence range and higher severity than wet however it is not enough to know the process of dry wet alternation because of its multiple characteristics shan et al 2018 proposed a dry wet abrupt alternation index considering the differences in dry and wet between earlier and later periods to precisely determine dry wet abrupt alternation luca et al 2020 used the dry wet ratio to measure the relative occurrence of wet and dry extremes and the extreme dry wet transition time intervals to quantify the average time interval between hydrological extremes with opposite signs wet to dry and dry to wet transitions for each grid cell the dry wet transition period and transition rate proposed in this study take into account more than dry wet abrupt alternation and dry wet extremes and they can be used to determine the time and speed of dry wet alternation it is found that the transition period and transition rate reach the maximum and minimum of the year in june august in the huai river basin respectively in addition the mass volume and density of the three dimensional dry wet structure are used to evaluate the severity of drought and flood the influence range and the strength of each dry wet alternation it is revealed that there is a turning point for the severity and influence range in about 1980 and both of them exhibit an increasing trend these indicators can be used to quantify the dry wet alternation from multiple dimensions perspectives and levels in order to understand the spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation the limitations of this study should be noted the envelope surface of the three dimensional dry wet structure is non closed and thus there may be some errors in the calculation of the volume and intensity 6 conclusions previous studies have focused on drought flood abrupt alternation in either time or space and the evaluation indicators are not applicable to dry wet alternation this study proposes an identification method of dry wet alternation the three dimensional structure is developed and consecutive dry wet alternations are extracted in the long time series the spatio temporal distribution and evolution of dry wet alternation are analyzed the three dimensional dry wet structure is developed by using three dimensional clustering and the dry wet period and alternation are identified based on the outer envelope surface the migration of dry wet alternation is simulated to determine its spatio temporal distribution six indicators are proposed to quantify the dry wet alternation and trend analysis principal component analysis and wavelet analysis are conducted to investigate the spatio temporal evolution of dry wet alternation the main conclusions are as follows 1 the method proposed in this study can be used to identify and extract consecutive dry wet alternations in the long time series the three dimensional dry wet structure is developed to simulate the evolution of dry wet alternation the time dimension is added into the two dimensional latitude longitude space to better describe dry wet alternation and extract dry wet alternation more completely it is found that dry wet alternation occurs most frequently in the 1980s and then in the 1960s and 2010s in the huai river basin and it becomes increasingly wetter in winter and drier in spring 2 in the three dimensional dry wet structure corresponding to one dry wet alternation consecutive slices are obtained at each unit time interval to better understand the occurrence development migration and disappearance of dry wet alternation in the space domain it is found that there exists a transition in the spatial distribution of dry wet regions in the huai river basin in the 1960s 2000s as it is wet in the north and dry in the south in the 1960s 1970s but dry in the north and wet in the south in the 1990s 2000s drought is more likely to have large influence range and high severity than wet 3 six indicators dry wet transition period transition rate area volume mass density of the three dimensional dry wet structure are used to quantify the spatio temporal evolution characteristics severity transition speed and influence range of dry wet alternation because of precipitation anomalies the transition period and transition rate reach the maximum in june august the severity and influence range exhibit an increasing trend since 1980s and the influence range remains unchanged since 2001 the dry wet alternation speed and influence range have a principal period of 8a and 10a respectively a future research direction is to explore the indicators that are generally applicable to dry wet abrupt alternation coexistence and slow alternation based on indicators for dry wet abrupt alternation and have different timescales for different types of dry wet alternation in order to identify dry wet alternation more quickly and accurately credit authorship contribution statement wen yi li writing original draft formal analysis xin wen conceptualization methodology software funding acquisition
