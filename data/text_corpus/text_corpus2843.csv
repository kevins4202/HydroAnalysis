14215,pollution of water resources and the environment by different antibiotics as emerging pollutants is one of the most concerning environmental issues in this respect this study investigates catalytic ozonation of ciprofloxacin as a common antibiotic using γ al2o3 nanoparticles the proposed treatment system can provide 93 removal efficiency at ph pf 9 5 and 10 mg l 1 initial ciprofloxacin concentration within 60 min contact time based on the results ozonation is responsible for 88 of the ciprofloxacin removal efficiency at this condition it is while the removal efficiency of the catalytic ozonation process for real wastewaters is in the range of 14 41 18 due to the scavenging effect of the other contaminants in general the γ al2o3 based catalytic ozonation process efficiency was a little more effective than ozonation process on degradation of ciprofloxacin in both synthetic and real wastewaters furthermore the pseudo first order kinetics model r2 0 97 presents the best fit of the experimental degradation data keywords catalytic ozonation ozonation antibiotics pseudo first order kinetics ciprofloxacin 1 introduction one of the most concerning issues that has attracted much attention during the last decades is related to water pollution by heavy metals and various organic and inorganic compounds through discharge of industrial and municipal wastewaters 1 3 specifically emerging pollutants have gained much interest since they threaten water resources and the environment 4 antibiotics are classified as emerging pollutants due to their continuous input and the suspected link between their environmental occurrence and persistence 4 5 discharge of untreated incompletely treated wastewaters of pharmaceutical industries incomplete uptake and metabolism of antibiotics in patients and disposal of discarded antibiotics into municipal wastes are the most common pathways of antibiotic emission to the environment 6 7 the presence of antibiotics in ecosystems can cause development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and put human health at risk as a consequence of disease increase 8 ciprofloxacin cpf which is one of the most common antibiotics in human and veterinary treatment and active against a broad spectrum of bacteria is categorized as the second generation of ﬂuoroquinolone antibiotics 5 6 9 the existence of this pollutant in water and the wastewater of urban areas hospitals and drug production units has been previously reported 5 8 10 this pollutant is a hardly biodegradable compound that traditional wastewater treatment technologies can just transfer it from one phase to another without degrading it therefore it can enter the environment through the effluents of traditional wastewater treatment units 11 due to the toxicity of cpf towards the nervous system heart and the blood stream and inducing expression of resistant genes in microorganisms it is necessary to develop novel treatment technologies for degradation of cpf 11 the structure of cpf is shown in fig 1 various technologies have been studied for removal of cpf from water and wastewater including the adsorption 12 biodegradation 13 algal treatment 5 electro coagulation 14 and advanced oxidation processes aops including photocatalytic degradation 9 photochemical oxidation 15 electro fenton 16 photo fenton 10 and catalytic ozonation 11 processes among aops heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has attracted more attention due to its strong oxidative capacity high mineralization rate producing no secondary pollutant application convenience and high removal efficiency 11 17 to date various catalysts have been studied for catalytic ozonation 18 for instance catalytic ozonation using alumina oxides has been reported as an effective process of water treatment 18 porous materials such as γ al2o3 are able to generate free radicals through interaction between their hydroxyl groups and ozone 19 γ al2o3 nanoparticles nps have been widely used as the catalyst of ozonation processes for treatment of landﬁll leachates reverse osmosis concentrates 20 bromaminic acid 21 2 isopropyl 3 methoxypyrazine 18 4 chlorophenol 17 benzene 22 and 2 4 dimethylphenol 19 however there is a lack of information about efficiency of γ al2o3 nps for catalytic ozonation of cpf aqueous solutions according to the importance of antibiotic removal from wastewaters this study investigates degradation of cpf as an antibiotic model by catalytic ozonation using γ al2o3 nps as a heterogeneous catalyst the process was applied to both synthetic and real wastewaters 2 materials and methods analytical grade ciprofloxacin was supplied by the darou pakhsh pharmaceutical company iran and used without further purification potassium iodide sulfuric acid hydrochloric acid sodium thiosulfate chloroform ethanol methanol acetic acid oxalic acid and were purchased from the merck company germany acetonitrile was purchased from scharlau chemicals spain 2 1 catalyst the γ al2o3 nps with 99 8 purity were purchased from the iranian nanomaterials pioneers company the surface morphology of the γ al2o3 nps was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and transition electron microscopy tem by the supplier fig 2 the x ray powder diffraction xrd pattern of the nps was also provided by the supplier to confirm the γ al2o3 structure 2 2 ozonation a lab scale ozone generator anyzone gold bio 2002a was used for ozone production the ozonation capacity of the ozone generator and the amount of ozone injected to the system were determined based on the potassium iodide test briefly the produced ozone gas was passed through two series gas washing bottles containing 250 ml aqueous potassium iodide for 10 min then 10 ml sulfuric acid 2 n was added to 200 ml of the potassium iodide solution in an erlenmeyer the resultant solution was titrated by 0 005 n sodium thiosulfate until a colorless solution was achieved the titration process was continued after addition of 1 2 drops of a starch solution finally the amount of the generated ozone gas was determined by the following equation 1 o 3 m g l m i n a b n 24 t where a and b are the utilized titrant volumes ml in the first and second gas washing bottles t min is time and n represents normality of the sodium thiosulfate solution based on this test the amount of ozone input to the catalytic system was equal to 1 4 mg l 1 min 1 2 3 catalytic ozonation the catalytic ozonation process was carried out in the batch mode firstly the stock cpf solution 1000 mg l 1 was prepared by dissolving 0 1 g ciprofloxacin hydrochloride in 100 ml deionized water then the catalytic ozonation experiments were performed by preparing 1000 ml of the cpf working solutions with different initial cpf concentrations through diluting the stock solution the ph of the working solution was adjusted at the desired value using 0 1 n naoh and 0 1 n h2so4 the working solution was transferred to the ozonation reactor and placed on a magnetic stirrer after adding 0 55 g l 1 γ al2o3 nps to the solution ozone was injected into the system at the rate of 1 4 mg l 1 min 1 and the reaction mixture was stirred at 250 rpm for the desired time the experimental set up has shown in fig 3 at different intervals a sample was taken from the reaction solution and the catalyst nps were separated by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 15 min followed by filtration using a 0 22 μm syringe filter to determine the cpf concentration the efficiency of cpf removal was calculated based on eq 2 in which c0 and ct are the concentration of cpf mg l 1 at the start of the process and contact time t respectively 23 2 r c 0 c t c 0 100 the effects of ph 5 5 7 5 and 9 5 contact time 2 to 60 min and initial cpf concentration 10 to 50 mg l 1 on the catalytic ozonation process were investigated in order to evaluate the efficiency of the catalytic process in removing cpf in the presence of organic matter the catalytic ozonation process was also performed on several real wastewater samples containing cpf for this purpose the wastewater of the ghaem hospital mashhad iran was sampled before entering any treatment system 200 ml of the samples were used in the catalytic ozonation process after 48 h settlement the initial cpf concentration of the hospital wastewater samples and their final cpf concentrations were determined to calculate the efficiency of the catalytic ozonation process in removing cpf from real samples 2 4 ciprofloxacin analysis to extract cpf 1 ml of the sample aliquot was transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene tube then a 5 ml absolute ethanol water extraction solution containing 1 hac with a volume ratio of 99 1 and 0 8 g sodium sulfate were added to the tube the mixture was vortexed vigorously for 15 s and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was transferred to another polypropylene tube and another extraction process was carried out on the residual sediment by adding 5 ml of the extracting solution the two supernatants obtained from the previous steps were combined and centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for 5 min finally the sample was filtered for injection into the high performance liquid chromatography hplc system 24 the concentration of cpf was determined by the hplc system that was coupled with uv detection knauer gmbh smartline uv detector 2500 at 280 nm and equipped with an ods column 150c18 4 6 μm the mobile phase was a mixture of orthophosphoric acid 0 025 m methanol and acetonitrile with the volume ratio of 75 13 12 the ph of the mobile phase was adjusted to 3 0 using triethylamine and its ﬂow rate was set to 1 0 ml min 1 the mobile phase was degassed by ultrasonication prior to use 25 3 results and discussion 3 1 γ al2o3 nanoparticles fig 3 shows the surface morphology of the γ al2o3 nps as it can be seen in the tem and sem images the γ al2o3 nps have an approximately uniform size less than 100 nm and are in nearly spherical shape based on the information supplied by the manufacturer the average particle size of the utilized γ al2o3 nps is 20 nm 3 2 effect of ph and initial concentration one of the most important operational parameters in catalytic ozonation processes is initial ph of the reaction solution indeed the surface charge of the catalyst and speciation of the pollutants change as a function of ph 26 fig 4 shows the effect of ph and initial cpf concentration on the efficiency of cpf removal through the ozonation process catalyzed by γ al2o3 as fig 4 displays the removal efficiency increases from 71 8 to 93 by changing the ph status from 5 25 to 9 5 at the initial cpf concentration of 10 mg l 1 also the effect of ph on the removal efficiency of all initial cpf concentrations is similar however this effect is more evident for higher initial cpf concentrations so that the removal efficiency reaches from 38 to 55 1 by changing the ph condition from 5 25 to 9 5 at the initial cpf concentration of 50 mg l 1 according to previous studies solution ph affect the electronic properties of metal oxides their surface charge ion speciation of the target pollutant and attraction of the degradation byproducts to their surface 27 cpf is known as a zwitterionic compound and has two pka values at 6 1 and 8 7 in acidic mediums ph 6 1 cpf is present in its cationic form whereas it is present in its anionic form in alkaline mediums ph 8 7 4 cpf molecules are mostly in a zwitterionic form at ph 6 1 8 7 based on the ozone decomposition model proposed by staehelin et al 28 the higher degree of cpf protonation which leads to lower direct ozonation and reduced formation of hydroxyl radicals are the two main reasons for the observed decrease in the cpf removal efficiency at lower ph values on the other hand the zero point charge of γ al2o3 is reported to be around 8 9 29 accordingly when the ph of the solution is lower than 6 1 cpf exists mainly in its cationic form meanwhile the surface of the γ al2o3 nps is positively charged therefore the electrostatic repulsion force restricts adsorption of cpf on the surface of the nps at lower ph values it is while the increase of ph results in a decrease in the cationic form of cpf and weakens the electrostatic repulsion force consequently more cpf molecules can diffuse towards the surface of the nps and a higher extent of cpf ozonation can be expected furthermore ozonation efficiency increase with increase of ph of solution as a result of increase of the concentration of oh ions as the initiator of radical chain reaction to form hydroxyl radicals 30 in agreement with this study witte et al 28 reported that the highest degree of cpf ozonation in the effluent of their case hospital wastewater treatment plant is related to its direct ozonation on the unprotonated surface of their catalyst at ph 10 witte et al determined the amount of ozone consumption at ph 3 7 and 10 and found out that ozone consumption is higher at higher ph values this result might be due to the higher rate of ozone decomposition at alkaline conditions as an outcome of ozone reaction with hydroxide ions this reaction leads to the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals 31 therefore the increase of removal efficiency at alkaline ph of 9 5 conditions can be attributed to this phenomenon 3 3 effect of contact time and initial concentration the effect of contact time and initial cpf concentration on the efficiency of the removal process at ph of 9 5 was evaluated the results are exhibited in fig 5 according to fig 5 the initial concentration of cpf has a negative effect on the removal efficiency so that the efficiency of the process decreases from 93 to 87 with the increase of the initial cpf concentration from 10 to 20 mg l 1 this result is consistent with that of sui et al who reported the complete degradation of 3 0 μm cpf within 7 min and stated that the degradation efficiency decreases to 56 7 for the initial cpf concentration of 42 8 μm and 15 min treatment 32 contact time has also a considerable impact on the removal efficiency of cpf as it can be seen in fig 5 the removal efficiency of cpf increases with time the rate of cpf removal is fast from 2 to 30 min and it continues with a slower rate up to 60 min at the initial cpf concentration of 10 mg l 1 the removal efficiency increases from 25 to 93 with the increase of contact time from 2 to 60 min 3 4 catalytic ozonation kinetics the pseudo first order kinetics model has been widely used to describe kinetics of different aops 2 3 33 37 the plots of ln c0 c versus time for all initial cpf concentrations are illustrated in fig 5 furthermore the degradation rate constants k for catalytic ozonation of cpf are presented in table 1 based on the determination coefficients r2 listed in table 1 the experimental data fit into the pseudo first order kinetics model confidently this finding is in agreement with the results reported by ndolomingo and meijboom 34 about catalytic degradation of methylene blue over γ al2o3 supported copper nps the highest degradation rate constant 0 041 min 1 refers to the initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 also witte et al 31 explored kinetics of cpf degradation by an ozonation process at the initial concentrations of 22 64 135 81 μm and attributed the fastest cpf degradation k 0 0940 0 0075 min 1 to their lowest initial cpf concentration 22 64 μm 3 5 catalytic ozonation in comparison ozonation the efficiencies of ciproﬂoxacin removal through ozonation by the γ al2o3 catalyst and catalyst free ozonation are compared in fig 6 the results reveal that the use of the γ al2o3 nps as the catalyst in the ozonation process leads to an increase in the removal efficiency of cpf this improvement in the effectiveness of the ozonation process is more obvious at lower initial cpf concentrations for example the conducted ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes provide 88 and 93 removal efficiency at the initial cpf concentration of 10 mg l 1 respectively similarly yang et al reported that their applied catalytic ozonation process and ozonation using β feooh ma demonstrate similar effectiveness extents in removal of cpf however their catalytic ozonation method showed 88 toc removal while ozonation removed only 30 toc at the initial cpf concentration of 10 mg l 1 within 40 min at the same condition the adsorption of cpf was equal to 12 toc 38 also vittenet et al 19 reported complete removal of 2 4 dimethylphenol by catalyst free ozonation after 25 min while they observed that catalytic ozonation using 2 g l 1 γ al2o3 nps decreases the time to 23 min in another study guzman perez et al 39 reported a similar observation and stated that the improvement of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d ozonation from 60 to 80 in the presence of γ al2o3 is due to the greater decomposition of o3 on the surface of γ al2o3 meanwhile they detected 40 adsorption of the 2 4 d content on their γ al2o3 catalyst 4 g l 1 in the absence of ozonation 3 6 treatment of real wastewater as several contaminants including organic and inorganic pollutants exist in wastewaters along with the target pollutant evaluating the removal process of cpf from real wastewater is essential in this respect several real wastewater samples containing cpf were treated by catalytic ozonation using the γ al2o3 catalyst and the performance of the catalytic process was compared with the activity of the adsorption and ozonation processes the initial concentration of cpf in the sampled hospital wastewater varied from 2 88 to 6 81 mg l 1 as fig 7 depicts the efficiency of cpf removal is the highest at ph of 9 5 for all three processes which is in consistence with the results obtained for the synthetic wastewater fig 4 however application of the γ al2o3 nps in the ozonation process was not so effective on improving the efficiency of cpf removal from the real wastewater in the case of the real wastewater the ozonation efficiency of cpf was 11 35 36 06 and 39 66 at ph of 5 25 7 5 and 9 5 conditions while these values were equal to 14 37 08 and 41 18 for the catalytic ozonation efficiency respectively it means that the removal efficiency of cpf under actual conditions and in the presence of various organic matters is lower than that of the synthetic wastewater the reason can be related to the scavenging effect of the other organic and inorganic pollutants such as humic acid phosphates no2 hco3 no3 and co3 2 that compete with the cpf molecules to react with the generated oh radicals and electrons and consequently inhibit removal of cpf from the real wastewater 33 40 a study on ozonating the cpf content of hospital wastewater treatment efﬂuents confirmed that the fastest ozonation reaction occurs at ph 10 and provides the cpf half life of 19 min while the half lives related to ph 7 and 3 were reported as 29 and 27 min respectively 28 4 conclusion in this study catalytic ozonation of ciprofloxacin as a common antibiotic was investigated by applying γ al2o3 nanoparticles to synthetic and real wastewaters the results of this study showed that the efficiency of the catalytic ozonation process is lower at ph of 5 25 and the highest at ph of 9 5 conditions the operational variable of contact time demonstrated a direct relationship with the efficiency of catalytic ozonation however the initial concentration of ciprofloxacin posed a negative effect on the efficiency of the catalyzed process according to the determination coefficients kinetics of the degradation process follows the pseudo first order kinetics model at the initial ciprofloxacin concentrations of 10 to 50 mg l 1 it was found out that the efficiency of ciprofloxacin removal from real wastewaters is lower than that of synthetic samples due to the scavenging effect of the organic and inorganic pollutants that are present in real wastewaters in general the ozonation process catalyzed by γ al2o3 nanoparticles is effective on degradation of ciprofloxacin in both synthetic and real wastewaters acknowledgements the authors

cpf concentration of 10 mg l 1 within 40 min at the same condition the adsorption of cpf was equal to 12 toc 38 also vittenet et al 19 reported complete removal of 2 4 dimethylphenol by catalyst free ozonation after 25 min while they observed that catalytic ozonation using 2 g l 1 γ al2o3 nps decreases the time to 23 min in another study guzman perez et al 39 reported a similar observation and stated that the improvement of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d ozonation from 60 to 80 in the presence of γ al2o3 is due to the greater decomposition of o3 on the surface of γ al2o3 meanwhile they detected 40 adsorption of the 2 4 d content on their γ al2o3 catalyst 4 g l 1 in the absence of ozonation 3 6 treatment of real wastewater as several contaminants including organic and inorganic pollutants exist in wastewaters along with the target pollutant evaluating the removal process of cpf from real wastewater is essential in this respect several real wastewater samples containing cpf were treated by catalytic ozonation using the γ al2o3 catalyst and the performance of the catalytic process was compared with the activity of the adsorption and ozonation processes the initial concentration of cpf in the sampled hospital wastewater varied from 2 88 to 6 81 mg l 1 as fig 7 depicts the efficiency of cpf removal is the highest at ph of 9 5 for all three processes which is in consistence with the results obtained for the synthetic wastewater fig 4 however application of the γ al2o3 nps in the ozonation process was not so effective on improving the efficiency of cpf removal from the real wastewater in the case of the real wastewater the ozonation efficiency of cpf was 11 35 36 06 and 39 66 at ph of 5 25 7 5 and 9 5 conditions while these values were equal to 14 37 08 and 41 18 for the catalytic ozonation efficiency respectively it means that the removal efficiency of cpf under actual conditions and in the presence of various organic matters is lower than that of the synthetic wastewater the reason can be related to the scavenging effect of the other organic and inorganic pollutants such as humic acid phosphates no2 hco3 no3 and co3 2 that compete with the cpf molecules to react with the generated oh radicals and electrons and consequently inhibit removal of cpf from the real wastewater 33 40 a study on ozonating the cpf content of hospital wastewater treatment efﬂuents confirmed that the fastest ozonation reaction occurs at ph 10 and provides the cpf half life of 19 min while the half lives related to ph 7 and 3 were reported as 29 and 27 min respectively 28 4 conclusion in this study catalytic ozonation of ciprofloxacin as a common antibiotic was investigated by applying γ al2o3 nanoparticles to synthetic and real wastewaters the results of this study showed that the efficiency of the catalytic ozonation process is lower at ph of 5 25 and the highest at ph of 9 5 conditions the operational variable of contact time demonstrated a direct relationship with the efficiency of catalytic ozonation however the initial concentration of ciprofloxacin posed a negative effect on the efficiency of the catalyzed process according to the determination coefficients kinetics of the degradation process follows the pseudo first order kinetics model at the initial ciprofloxacin concentrations of 10 to 50 mg l 1 it was found out that the efficiency of ciprofloxacin removal from real wastewaters is lower than that of synthetic samples due to the scavenging effect of the organic and inorganic pollutants that are present in real wastewaters in general the ozonation process catalyzed by γ al2o3 nanoparticles is effective on degradation of ciprofloxacin in both synthetic and real wastewaters acknowledgements the authors

14216,a large quantity of oily and saline wastewater produced from the oil spill and oil gas production is posing severe ecological and environmental issues conventional techniques for oil removal such as floating booms hydrocyclones and chemical dispersant are inefficient in removing emulsified oil and could generate secondary environmental pollution in this paper we report a novel approach for fast and efficient separation of oil water emulsions in saline environments with a new flexible and hierarchically structured inorganic membrane this new membrane is constructed with micro nanostructured zno microspheres and carbon nanotubes the new membrane has proven experimentally to separate oil water emulsions in saline environments with an oil rejection rate of over 99 5 and high water flux of 3844 l m2 h bar under low operating pressure thanks to their hierarchical micro nano structures the separation performances of the membranes were relatively constant after multiple cycles of reuse which suggest its superior anti oil fouling property of this membrane due to its excellent underwater oleophobicity the carbon nanotubes function as an inorganic binder that binds zno microspheres together and hence gives this inorganic membrane mechanical flexibility this study provides a simple and cost effective solution for fast and efficient oil water separation in saline environments keywords oil water separation anti fouling membrane micro nano structures membrane 1 introduction the increasing frequency of oil spills in the sea and rapid expansion of oil gas production industry have generated a large quantity of oily and saline wastewater 1 4 which pose severe environmental threats on marine ecosystems 5 7 the oil spill cleanup in the sea is often exacerbated by the presence of high waves and currents that break oil slicks into tiny oil water emulsions these oil water emulsions are very stable in marine environment and remains a worldwide challenge to separate them from the water resources 8 conventional oil cleanup techniques still cannot effectively address this challenge for example floating booms are not able to remove emulsified oil while chemical dispersants can cause secondary environmental pollution 9 therefore the new solution for effective oil water separation in saline environments is in critical demand in recent years great attention has been drawn to membrane separation technology for oil water separation because of its ease of operation and small footprint 10 however most of the commercial membranes are made of oleophilic polymers polyvinylidene fluoride polypropylene etc which are prone to be fouled by oil and lead to reduced separation efficiency ceramic membranes with hollow fiber configuration were also demonstrated as good candidates for oil water separation while these ceramic membranes normally require high temperature sintering for the manufacturing process 11 13 at the same time some polyethersulfone pes membranes using carbon nanotube or zno as fillers have been fabricated using conventional phase inversion method however these pes based membranes still face the common problem of segregated foam like pore structure within pes matrix due to the phase inversion process 14 15 recently the development of underwater superoleophobic surfaces for oil water separation have been influenced by nature where researchers have imitated the hydrophilic mucus of fish scale to increase water affinity 16 17 this feature can effectively prevent oil adhesion leading to a superoleophobic and low oil adhesive surface 18 therefore many recent works have focused on fabricating super wetting membranes by adjusting surface chemistry and roughness for example diatomite powders were spray coated on stainless steel meshes for separating immiscible oil water mixtures 19 photo responsive zno nano rods were coated on stainless steel meshes for the separation of oil water mixtures 20 polyacrylamide hydrogel was coated on stainless steel meshes for the separation of oil water mixture 21 and inorganic nanowires were grown on copper mesh for separating both oil water mixtures and oil water emulsions 22 however those artificial surface modifications suffer from tedious coating procedures and loss of coated layers from their substrates after long term operation in this study a new approach to construct flexible inorganic membranes with intrinsic underwater surface oleophobicity and hierarchical porous structures is presented for fast and efficient separation of oil water emulsions this new membrane made of hierarchically structured zno microspheres and carbon nanotubes is deposited using a facile and low cost method the micro nanoscale pore structures of the membranes ensure a high oil rejection rate high water permeation flux as well as superior oil repelling property in order to address the weakness of zno microspheres in membrane formation one dimensional carbon nanotubes were added as an inorganic binder to retain the zno microspheres together to offer mechanical flexibility for this new membrane this is the first study with a flexible and oil repelling inorganic membrane for fast and effective separation of oil water emulsion in saline environments 2 material and methods 2 1 materials in this study we have used whatman grade 42 ashless filter papers nominal particle retention rating of 2 5 μm as the support layer of the synthesized membranes all the chemicals used in this study zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no3 2 6h2o potassium hydroxide koh multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt 6 9 nm od 5 μm l 95 carbon and sodium dodecyl sulfate were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 preparation of zno mwcnt membrane zinc oxide microspheres were prepared by titrating 50 ml of 0 2 m zn no3 2 6h2o into 50 ml of 1 m koh the solution was continuously stirred at room temperature during the 30 min titration process the formed zinc oxide zno microspheres were then washed multiple times to reduce the ph of the solution to a neutral condition on the other hand mwcnt nanoparticle solution was prepared by adding 10 mg of mwcnt to 50 ml of 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution 23 the solution was homogenized using a probe sonicator for 15 min and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm the resulting supernatant was used as the stock solution of mwcnt nanoparticles the composite zno mwcnt membranes were finally prepared by adding a various amount of mwcnt solution into 6 ml of zno solution the mixtures were rapidly stirred prior to deposition on 2 5 μm cellulose filters using a vacuum filtration set up the newly coated membranes were then washed repeatedly using deionized water to remove excess sds and other impurities 2 3 oil in water emulsion preparation a stable 1 v v oil water emulsion feed was prepared as described by wang et al 24 more specifically the feed was prepared by sonicating 10 ml of sunflower oil in 90 ml of deionized water for five minutes the sonicated solution was further diluted to 1000 ml to achieve the required concentration of 1 v v oil the oil water emulsion used in this study has a feed toc concentration of 886 mg l with a mean droplet size of 3 5 μm 2 4 membrane characterization environmental scanning electron microscope fei quanta 400 was used to analyze the surface morphological properties of the membranes the top surface pore size distributions of the membrane were obtained using an image treatment software namely image j national institutes of health bethesda maryland usa the overall porosity of the membrane was determined using gravimetric method 25 while cross sectional sem images of the membranes were used to measure the thickness of coatings the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of the membranes was obtained using an advanced goniometer rame hart model 500 x ray diffraction spectra of the zno2 were examined using rigaku ultima iv multipurpose x ray diffractometer 2 5 filtration performance testing the performance of the membranes was evaluated using a vacuum filtration set up all the filtration studies were conducted at a constant differential pressure of 30 kpa oil rejection rates were calculated using the differences in the total organic carbon toc values of the feed and permeate on the other hand the flux of the membrane was calculated based on the permeate volume obtained at a fixed filtration time 3 results and discussions fig 1 shows the photographs of the zno and zno mwcnt membranes after deposition on the cellulose substrate poor deposition of zno was evident in fig 1 a c where huge gaps and cracks can be observed throughout the substrate significant portions of zno particles fell off when the substrate was folded thus clearly indicating the poor flexibility of the membrane the sem image shown in fig 1 c clearly shows that the zno was poorly interlinked and distributed where the cellulose substrate can be seen on the other hand the moderate addition of mwcnt to zno prior to deposition significantly improved the integrity of the coating a uniform coating with no cracks or loose particles were observed for this composite membrane the poor connectivity among the zno spheres can be easily visualized in the sem images shown in fig 2 from the fig 2 a b it can be seen that zno microspheres are loosely packed with no linkage or interconnection between them the lack of connectivity contributes to the poor flexibility and cracks however this issue was circumvented in our study by adding mwcnt in order to improve the structural integrity and flexibility of the membrane by cross linking the zno microspheres together fig 2 c f clearly demonstrate the formation of bridging networks between zno particles by mwcnt nanorods the amount of mwcnt required to improve the membrane integrity needs to be optimized in order not to sacrifice the permeate flux excessive addition of mwcnt nanorods can be detrimental due to a possible reduction in pore size 26 the optimization of mwcnt is discussed in the subsequent sections of this manuscript the variations in pore size distribution porosity and coating thickness with respect to different mwcnt loadings are shown in fig 3 the top pore size distribution of the pristine zno membrane ranged from 0 5 μm to 2 5 μm while the distribution shrank between 0 3 μm to 1 5 μm with the maximum addition volume of 0 8 ml mwcnt it can be also seen that the average top surface pore size of the composite membranes reduced from 1 290 μm to 0 887 μm as mwcnt deposition volume was increased to 0 8 ml a similar trend was noticed in the porosity profiles where the overall porosity of the membrane reduced from 87 1 to 72 6 with the addition of mwcnt as shown in fig 3 c for the measurements of membrane thicknesses based on sem cross sectional images the thicknesses of the composite membranes vary from 20 50 to 20 94 μm as a function of mwcnt incorporation volumes it indicates that mwcnt incorporation does not significantly affect the thicknesses of the composite membranes and this could be because most of the incorporated mwcnt were dispersed in between the pores gaps of the composite membranes the powder xrd spectra of the cellulose membrane coated with mwcnt and zno is reported in fig 4 as it can be seen that the first three peaks at 15 16 6 and 22 in the spectra are identified corresponding to cellulose 101 101 and 002 reflections the rest of the peaks between 30 90 degrees are found to match with zno icdd pdf reference number 00 005 06644 no unidentified peaks are observed thus it is concluded that the synthesis of pure zno was successful although a small amount of mwcnt was mixed with zno due to the detection limit of xrd and also interference by the cellulose xrd peaks it was not possible to observe the carbon nanotube main peak from eds result in fig 4 b it also can be observed that the zn o and carbon elements exist inside the zno mwcnt composite membranes one of the important parameters that govern the performance of oil water separation membrane is surface hydrophobicity superhydrophillic and underwater superoleophobic membranes are highly desired due to their greater anti fouling performance 22 27 fig 5 shows the water contact angle and underwater oil contact angle measurements for one of the composite membranes zno 0 4 ml mwcnt the water contact angle of the membrane was zero thus indicating the superhydrophilicity of the membrane as for underwater oil contact angle measurements the membrane was submerged in water and subjected to a tiny sunflower oil droplet the underwater oil contact angle for the membrane was 151 1 hence confirming the underwater superoleophobic properties of the membrane the effect of mwcnt loading on the membrane hydrophilicity is shown in table 1 it can be seen that the water contact angle readings slightly increased from 0 to 8 2 when the mwcnt volume was increased to 0 8 ml on the other hand the underwater oil contact angle decreased by 7 1 to 141 2 with the addition of mwcnt it can be confirmed the moderate addition of mwcnt to crosslink the zno particles did not significantly alter the hydrophilicity and underwater oil oleophobicity of the composite membranes the oil droplet size distributions were measured using size jorin vipa b hiflow leicestershire uk visual process analyzer fig 6 shows the measured oil droplet size ranged from 0 to 14 μm with a mean droplet size of 3 5 μm additional statistical analyses showed that majority of the emulsified oil droplets were below 6 0 μm where the calculate d50 and d90 were 2 89 μm and 5 30 μm respectively the performance of the composite membrane with respect to the addition of mwcnt is shown in fig 7 this optimization study was conducted using 1 v v of sunflower oil water feed with a salinity of 3 5 it can be noted that without the addition of mwcnt as physical cross linkers the zno coated membrane displayed a relatively higher flux than the zno mwcnt membrane this is highly misleading as it was observed during the experimental studies that zno microspheres were unable to uniformly coat the surface of cellulose substrate due to their loose assembly as a result the oily feed water bypassed the zno coating layer and was instead directly filtered by the 2 5 μm cellulose substrate additional experimental studies using a 2 5 μm cellulose substrate as the only active filtration layer yielded similar flux rates hence confirming the above observations the improvement in the oil rejection ratio with the addition of mwcnt to zno can be clearly seen in fig 7 the oil rejection ratio improved beyond 99 with the addition of 0 2 ml of mwcnt solution further addition of mwcnt resulted in almost 100 oil rejection ratio nevertheless further addition led to flux decline due to possible reduction in the porosity and pore size as confirmed in fig 3 decline in the flux profile of the membrane can be observed when the mwcnt volume was increased beyond 0 4 ml the flux dropped significantly from 3844 l m2 h bar to 2557 l m2 h bar when the mwcnt volume was doubled from 0 4 ml to 0 8 ml the clarity of emulsified oil feed treated by zno mwcnt can be observed in fig 7b in contrast to the emulsified oil feed no apparent oil droplet can be viewed under the optical microscope after the membrane filtration process apart from sunflower oil the zno mwcnt membranes were also tested using different types of emulsion feed such as hexane gasoline and diesel the performance chart shown in fig 8 indicated that the oil rejection ratio and water flux of different oil types were more or less similar to the results obtained using sunflower oil e g flux 3844 l m2 h bar and oil rejection ratio 99 the zno mwcnt also displayed high and consistent oil rejection ratio when tested against oil water emulsion of different salinity ranging from deionized water to brine salinity of the sunflower oil feed was varied by adding sodium chloride as shown in fig 9 the oil rejection of the membrane is well over 99 5 for all the cases this clearly demonstrates the versatility of the composite membrane in treating oily water of different salinity the reusability and anti fouling performance of the zno mwcnt was tested over ten cycles of filtration in each filtration cycle the membrane was filtered with 1 v v emulsified sunflower oil corresponding to a feed toc value of 886 mg l at a fixed filtration time the permeate volume of each cycle was weighed and analyzed to obtain the flux and toc respectively prior to the next filtration cycle the membrane was flushed with 50 ml of hot water 50 60 c the performance of zno mwcnt membrane throughout the ten filtration cycles is shown in fig 10 it can be clearly observed that the membrane was capable of achieving close to 100 oil rejection ratio throughout the filtration cycles similarly a consistent flux with an average value of 3854 3 364 l m2 h bar was produced by the membrane during these operating cycles the ability of the membrane to produce a consistent flux despite being challenged with a high concentration of emulsified oil clearly demonstrates the superior anti fouling performance and excellent recyclability of the membrane the underwater superoleophobicity characteristic of the membrane plays a significant role in minimizing the adsorption of oil droplets on the surface membrane and hence lowering the oil fouling tendencies 28 the capability of the membrane in recovering its flux after the simple hot flush procedure in between the filtration cycles also indicates that the membrane only suffers from irreversible fouling 4 conclusion in this study a novel approach for fast and efficient oil water separation was demonstrated with a zno mwcnt inorganic membrane of hierarchical micro nanostructure and excellent oil repelling property the proposed membrane has high oil rejection rate of over 99 5 and high water flux of 3844 l m2 h bar under saline environments the addition of mwcnt helps to improve the mechanical flexibility of the membrane by binding the zno microspheres together the membrane also displays good reusability with minimal oil fouling due to its underwater superoleophobicity the current study provides a simple yet cost effective way for oil spill cleanup and produced water treatment acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of dr kui wang central south university china for measuring the top pore size distributions of the composite membranes

filtration cycle the membrane was filtered with 1 v v emulsified sunflower oil corresponding to a feed toc value of 886 mg l at a fixed filtration time the permeate volume of each cycle was weighed and analyzed to obtain the flux and toc respectively prior to the next filtration cycle the membrane was flushed with 50 ml of hot water 50 60 c the performance of zno mwcnt membrane throughout the ten filtration cycles is shown in fig 10 it can be clearly observed that the membrane was capable of achieving close to 100 oil rejection ratio throughout the filtration cycles similarly a consistent flux with an average value of 3854 3 364 l m2 h bar was produced by the membrane during these operating cycles the ability of the membrane to produce a consistent flux despite being challenged with a high concentration of emulsified oil clearly demonstrates the superior anti fouling performance and excellent recyclability of the membrane the underwater superoleophobicity characteristic of the membrane plays a significant role in minimizing the adsorption of oil droplets on the surface membrane and hence lowering the oil fouling tendencies 28 the capability of the membrane in recovering its flux after the simple hot flush procedure in between the filtration cycles also indicates that the membrane only suffers from irreversible fouling 4 conclusion in this study a novel approach for fast and efficient oil water separation was demonstrated with a zno mwcnt inorganic membrane of hierarchical micro nanostructure and excellent oil repelling property the proposed membrane has high oil rejection rate of over 99 5 and high water flux of 3844 l m2 h bar under saline environments the addition of mwcnt helps to improve the mechanical flexibility of the membrane by binding the zno microspheres together the membrane also displays good reusability with minimal oil fouling due to its underwater superoleophobicity the current study provides a simple yet cost effective way for oil spill cleanup and produced water treatment acknowledgment the authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of dr kui wang central south university china for measuring the top pore size

in this matter the main goal of this study was to investigate the catalytic activity of the magnetite fe2 fe2 3 o4 2 fefe2o4 or fe3o4 nanoparticles nps coated borosilicate glass on the color removal of basic red 18 br18 and acid red 8 ar88 azo dyes by adsorption and fenton oxidation reaction the efficiency of powder magnetite nps was also tested to compare to magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass the effect of solution ph 2 5 9 0 catalyst loading 0 25 3 0 g l and dye concentration 0 1 0 3 mm were tested to achieve maximum color removal efficiency using powder magnetite nps the color removal efficiencies were measured 44 at ph 9 0 and 76 at ph 3 5 for adsorption and fenton oxidation of br18 dye 0 1 mm moreover the color removal efficiencies were measured 81 at ph 3 5 and 100 at ph 6 0 for adsorption and fenton oxidation of ar88 dye 0 1 mm the effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentration 2 5 25 mm was also optimized and 10 mm was found optimum h2o2 dosage for fenton oxidation however magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass enhanced maximum 77 and 82 color removal efficiencies for adsorption and fenton oxidation of br18 dye maximum 86 and 100 color removal efficiencies were obtained for adsorption and fenton oxidation of ar88 dye stability of the powder magnetite nps and magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass catalyst was also investigated the reusability of the catalyst showed that magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass could be used at least 3 times without significant loss of activity compared to powder magnetite nps for fenton oxidation the characterization of the catalyst was carried out using scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx x ray powder diffraction xrd and zeta potential analyses before and after adsorption keywords magnetite nanoparticles deposition adsorption fenton oxidation dye decolorization textile wastewater treatment 1 introduction industrial wastewater remains a major global problem due to negative effects on the environment 1 textile industry is one of the industry which consumes excessive amounts of water and chemicals in the processes and produces a huge amount of environmentally hazardous wastewater 2 the water used in the processes is contaminated by heavy metals azodyes bisphenol a bpa suspended solids high chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod due to used additive chemicals 3 conventional biological treatments can remain insufficient for complete treatment of wastewater and non biodegradable pollutants thus developing different treatment technologies are required for improving discharged water qualities 4 so far various methods have been developed for textile wastewater treatment such as membrane 5 membrane bioreactors 6 coagulation 7 advanced oxidation technologies 8 and adsorption 9 adsorption is also one of the most widely used methods for the removal of dyes 10 recently several approaches have been studied for the development of cheaper and effective adsorbents especially a combination of biological treatment and adsorption on activated carbon as well as low cost adsorbents are becoming more common for removal of dyes from wastewater 11 for example activated lignin chitosan extruded pellets with controlled particle size distribution was produced for efficient methylene blue adsorption the produced adsorbent supplied a maximum adsorption capacity of 36 25 mg g 12 however desorption of methylene blue mb dye from brown macroalga nizamuddinia zanardinii was investigated by daneshvar et al 13 seventeen eluents were tested and hydrochloric acid was found to be the most effective eluent for dye desorption reusability of the brown macroalga was also investigated they were reported that the dye sorption efficiency decreased from 96 99 0 90 to 48 16 1 98 and the dye desorption efficiency decreased from 68 70 2 03 to 46 83 1 49 after five sorption desorption cycles 14 amino functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes nh2 mwcnts were prepared and the magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 were embedded with nh2 mwcnts to develop magnetic carbon nanotube nh2 mwcnts fe3o4 15 the prepared new adsorbent enhanced 178 5 mg g maximum adsorption capacity from the langmuir isotherm equation for mb removal it was noted that after six repetitive cycles the adsorption capacity of nh2 mwcnts fe3o4 was 80 of the original value advanced oxidation processes aop are efficient methods for removal of bio persistent toxic pollutants in textile wastewater 16 17 aop is based on chemical oxidation of organic pollutants by several reaction mechanisms using ozonation electrocatalysis electrocatalytic oxidation photocatalysis and fenton like processes 18 reaction mechanism of these methods are based on generating reactive oxygen species i e oh ooh and o2 with high oxidation potential 1 8 2 8 v 19 this process involves mainly hydroxyl radicals oh 2 80 v which are highly reactive and non selective for degradation of main pollutants to secondary pollutants co2 and h2o 20 21 among these processes fenton process is considered to be a more effective approach for generating hydroxyl radicals which can increase the reaction rate and time for textile wastewater 22 fenton degradation is a catalytic process for generating oh radicals in the presence of a ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in aqueous solution 23 oh radicals in the reaction medium decompose toxic pollutants to h2o co2 non toxic end products and complete mineralization can be achieved for these kinds of reactions 24 however even partial degradation of the resistant organic compounds is adequate as a chemical pre treatment stage using aops developing heterogeneous catalysts for fenton like reactions has gained significant research interest in order to improve overall reaction efficiency and to minimize negative effects of the processes on the environment and water qualities 25 developing advanced nano sized catalysts for aops are crucial to minimize environmental impacts of wastewater studies in the literature indicate that nano sized iron based catalysts are perfect candidates for oxidation reactions due to their strong catalytic and photochemical properties 26 however the corrosion of catalyst in fenton reaction remains as an obstacle for large scale industrial applications and uneasy catalyst recovery does not provide system permanency catalyst recovery and reusability are desirable in terms of sustainability of the system and economic viewpoint 27 to overcome these problems mentioned above magnetite nps was deposited onto borosilicate glass which was an inert surface to eliminate the difficult catalyst recovery step and to prevent aggregation of the nps the objective of this study was to synthesize magnetite fe3o4 catalyst and to evaluate the catalytic performance in fenton like reactions for decolorization of br18 and ar88 dyes synthesized materials were characterized by sem edx xrd

precipitation of ferric chloride fe3 ions and ferrous sulfate fe2 ions in aqueous solution as previously described 28 ferric chloride 40 ml 1 m and ferrous sulfate 10 ml 2 m in hcl 2 m solutions were mixed and were added to ammonia solution 500 ml 0 7 m the ph of the aqueous solution was adjusted to 10 by naoh or hcl 0 1 n and it was stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer the black precipitate was collected washed three times 3 250 ml deionized water and finally dried in the oven at 105 c for overnight a photograph of ferromagnetic liquid and solid form attracted by an external magnetic field is presented in fig 1 2 3 preparation of magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass substrate the objective of the coating step was to prevent aggregation and to enhance catalytic activity by increasing the surface area magnetite fe3o4 nps oleic acid mixture is synthesized by slightly modified method of ocakoglu et al 29 the fe3o4 500 mg was mixed with oleic acid 800 mg and heated at 125 c for 2 h to obtain a red brown viscous liquid mixture then it was cooled for 12 h at 25 1 c and subsequently treated with 5 ml of tetrahydrofuran thf the mixture was stirred and the precipitates were separated from the solution by centrifugation 7000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was recovered for coating process the fe3o4 coated substrate was prepared by drop casting of the supernatant onto a borosilicate glass substrate followed by annealing at 500 c for 1 h in air 2 4 adsorption and fenton experiments the adsorption and fenton oxidation experiments of magnetite nps were carried out in a 100 ml conical flask containing 50 ml of dye solution the effects of ph magnetite loading and dye concentration were suited for adsorption experiments additionally the effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 dosage was studied for fenton oxidation experiments the adsorption and fenton oxidation experiments of magnetite coated glass substrate were carried out in a petri dish containing 25 ml of dye solution all the experiments were carried out under constant shaking 250 rpm for 180 min at 25 1 c powder samples were separated by centrifugation 6000 rpm 10 min and analyzed versus time to determine residual dye concentration all samples were tested in triplicate and average values were presented removal efficiencies of color was calculated by eq 1 2 r e 1 c f c i 100 where ci mg l and cf mg l are initial and final dye concentration in the solution respectively 2 5 characterization methods the morphological characterization of the composite materials was investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem the surface chemical composition of the fe3o4 coated glass substrate was determined via energy dispersive spectroscopy eds attached to the sem images were taken by applying electron beam having an acceleration voltage of 15 00 kv a zeta sizer malvern zetasizer equipped with mpt 2 titrator nano zs was used to measure the zeta potential of magnetite borosilicate glass magnetite coated glass and azo dyes using a refractive index of 1 5 the measurements were carried out at 25 1 c in triplicate using disposable cuvettes the velocity of the particle was measured using laser doppler electrophoresis which is proportional to the field strength and the zeta potential the structural properties of magnetite coated borosilicate glass substrate were analyzed by an x ray diffractometer bruker d8 advanced series 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of powder magnetite nps and magnetite coated glass substrate agglomeration is one of the important problems in different applications of powder nanoparticles 30 the aggregation behavior of these particles is a decisive factor in the success of the study this feature can be minimized or completely eliminated by optimizing ph and viscosity or using surfactants 31 in the synthesis step of the nanoparticles some critical processes can be performed to minimize possible agglomeration of the material one of these methods is to use oleic acid the surface of the magnetite nps can be easily decorated by oleic acid for high colloidal stability against precipitation and agglomeration the previous studies proved the strong chemical bond formed between the carboxylic acid and the iron oxide nanoparticles 32 after coating process with oleic acid the material can be easily mixed with an organic solvent by this way the supernatant which contains nps bearing oleic acid are separated from the precipitates and this homogeneous organic mixture can be easily used for coating process onto a desired substrate in this study we preferred to use oleic acid for magnetite nps coating on the borosilicate glass surface 3 1 1 sem and edx analysis the morphology of the coated thin film magnetite was examined by scanning electron microscopy sem it was found that thin film magnetite was formed homogeneously on the borosilicate glass and was mostly cracked free surface as can be seen in fig 2 a and b magnetite nps were formed by a combination of self assembled spherical nanoparticles before coating the borosilicate glass substrate showed mostly a homogenous surface fig 2c thin film image of coated glass substrate after the coating process is given in fig 2d thin film consisted of spherical nanoparticle layers furthermore the size of the magnetite nanoparticles 5 nm was found to be almost same with the exposure time of the annealing steps moreover it was observed that an uneven aggregation was prevented in the resulting coating and nanoparticles were uniformly distributed inside the film the energy dispersive x ray analysis edx spectrum of synthesized magnetite nanoparticles is shown in fig 3 the edx spectrum demonstrated that the iron oxide structures were composed of fe and o only edx spectrum proved the existence of fe3o4 nps by oxygen and iron peaks fe element peaks were appeared around 0 6 6 3 and 7 kev besides the edx spectra of the fe3o4 nps verified the presence of elemental fe without any external peaks however a small percentage of si was detected in the spectrum which came from glass substrate 3 1 2 xrd analysis x ray diffraction analysis was used to obtain structural information of magnetite nps which were treated with oleic acid then coated on the borosilicate glass substrate the xrd pattern of the magnetite nps form exactly matched with the cubic phase of fe3o4 jcpdf 82 1533 fig 4 the lattice parameter of the particles was a 8 502 å there was a broad peak around 2θ 23 24 the d spacing of the fe3o4 nanoparticles was found to be 2 2 å our result confirmed that magnetite nps were successfully coated on the glass substrate 3 1 3 zeta potential the electrical state of an adsorbent s surface in solution is usually characterized by either the point of zero charge pzc or the isoelectric point iep the pzc is defined as the surface charge density equals zero the iep occurs when the electrokinetic ζ potential at the shear plane equals zero iep values clearly represent only the external surface charge of particles in solution whereas the pzc varies in response to the net total external and internal surface charge of the adsorbent as the characteristic of amphoteric surfaces 33 the change of zeta potential depending on ph between 2 9 is given in fig 5 solutions were prepared in nacl 1 mm salt the zeta potential of magnetite nanoparticles decreased with the increased ph values which was positively charged about below 6 4 which was consistent with the literature value of ph 6 7 34 when the zeta potential of the glass substrate was examined it was observed that the zeta potential was almost negatively charged for all ph values except of ph 2 which was close to isoelectric point iep therefore the coating of fe3o4 nanoparticles on glass substrate caused a decline in zeta potential of fe3o4 nanoparticles from about 42 mv to 0 mv at ph 2 which was iep of magnetite coated glass substrate and they had almost same zeta potential values at ph 9 26 mv however the zeta potentials of the glass substrate were higher than the glass substrate without magnetite but still all of them were negatively charged after magnetite coating when azo dyes used in the experiments were analyzed ar88 and br18 dyes were found to be negatively and positively charged at almost all ph values respectively therefore the adsorption capacity of magnetite nanoparticles for anionic dyes are more sensitive to ph values below 6 4 35 3 2 the effect of solution ph on adsorption and fenton oxidation the ph of the solution also plays a key role during the adsorption of metal ions because it affects the surface charge of the adsorbent as well as dissociates the functional groups on the active sites 36 in this study the impact of solution ph during the adsorption of azo dyes using magnetite nps was investigated in ph range of 2 5 9 0 fig 6 shows the influence of ph on both adsorption and fenton oxidation processes for the removal of color from br18 and ar88 azo dye solutions the adsorption experiments were carried out using 0 1 mm initial azo dye concentration 1 g l magnetite nps dosage 250 rpm stirring speed and 25 1 c the conditions of fenton oxidation experiments were same as adsorption experiments but differently h2o2 10 mm was added into the dye solution firstly the adsorption of azo dye molecules on magnetite nps was investigated without addition of h2o2 for positively charged br18 azo dye solution the removal efficiencies via adsorption mechanism was not high enough due to the strong electrostatic repulsions between magnetite nanoparticles and positively charged dye molecules which have the same surface charges 37 since the magnetite was positively charged below ph 6 4 a higher dye removal efficiency via adsorption mechanism was obtained for ar88 azo dye solution due to the electrostatic attractions between the positively charged surfaces of fe3o4 nanoparticles and negatively charged of ar88 azo dye molecules but above ph 4 0 the removal efficiency of ar88 was decreased below 40 due to a decline trend of zeta potential for both ar88 and magnetite the results obtained from the removal efficiency of azo dyes by adsorption mechanism were in a good agreement with the other studies 38 39 after the adsorption mechanism was examined the same experiments were repeated at different ph values by adding h2o2 and dye removal by the fenton oxidation mechanism was investigated it is well known by the literature that ph value has a considerable effect on the fenton process 40 41 the optimum ph value improves the catalysis efficiency and prevents the interferences from wastewater matrix 40 for positively charged br18 azo dye the highest dye removal efficiencies were achieved 25 and 51 at ph 9 0 and 3 5 for adsorption and fenton oxidation respectively fig 6a above the ph 3 5 for fenton oxidation the removal efficiency of br18 was decreased sharply which was similar to another study 42 at ph 3 5 the azo dye molecules were destructed by oh radicals effectively with breaking down of h2o2 in addition to this the potential of oh h2o redox pair oxidation is higher at acidic ph values that enhance higher removal efficiency for higher ph values the effect of oh radicals decreases due to chemical reactions between h2o2 and oh radicals according to eq 2 and eq 3 42 2 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o 3 h o 2 o h o 2 h 2 o the highest removal efficiency was obtained 71 and 95 at ph 3 5 and 6 0 for adsorption and fenton oxidation respectively for the negatively charged ar88 dye solution fig 6b additionally removal efficiency was decreased at higher ph values for fenton oxidation probable causation can be the generation of fe oh 3 precipitation which reduced the fenton catalyst activity 43 in contrast to br18 dye the removal efficiency of ar88 azo dye decreased sharply after ph 6 0 to understand that effect the iep value of the magnetite 6 4 should be considered at lower ph values the magnetite was positively charged which enhanced adsorption of negatively charged ar88 molecules on nanoparticles in this way the decomposition of h2o2 to o2 and h2o on the surface of magnetite was delayed and this caused oh radicals to continue its effects on the removal efficiency of dye molecules 44 therefore the optimum operating ph values for the fenton oxidation reaction were determined as ph 3 5 and ph 6 0 for br18 fig 6a and ar88 azo dyes fig 6b respectively whereas the optimum ph s were determined as 9 0 fig 6a and 3 5 fig 6b for the adsorption mechanism a novel nano composite cation exchanger sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide zr iv selenite sds azs was developed by naushad 45 and was used for the removal of toxic pb2 from aqueous medium the effect of ph for the adsorption of pb2 onto sds azs was tested in the ph range 2 10 the optimum ph for the maximum removal of pb2 was found 6 0 at lower ph the removal of pb2 was very low because of increasing of h ions which dominated over the adsorption process 3 3 the effect of magnetite loading on adsorption and fenton oxidation the effect of magnetite loading on both adsorption and fenton oxidation mechanisms is given in fig 7 all experiments were carried out at optimized ph values which were ph 9 0 and ph 3 5 for adsorption and ph 3 5 and ph 6 0 for fenton oxidation for br18 and ar88 azo dyes respectively the removal efficiency of azo dyes by adsorption was improved by increasing magnetite loading because of the increased active adsorbent sites of magnetite however the removal efficiency 48 was the lowest for br18 azo dye due to the low electrostatic attractions between magnetite and dye molecules at ph 9 0 fig 7a for ar88 dye solution fig 7b it was observed that the magnetite loading had a higher effect on removal efficiency due to strong molecular interactions between magnetite and dye molecules which were oppositely charged at ph 3 5 37 the removal efficiencies of azo dyes by fenton oxidation were increased up to 80 and 100 for br18 fig 7a and ar88 fig 7b azo dyes when the magnetite loading was increased up to 3 g fe3o4 l the reason of the improvement in removal efficiency was probably due to the increase in the number of catalytically active sites of magnetite in the solution which promoted more decomposition of h2o2 to oh radicals 46 47 however the removal efficiency decreased at higher magnetite loading in which the effect of oh radicals was reduced due to the parallel chemical reactions of fe2 ions or present iron species with oh radicals as well as other radicals eq 4 7 46 48 we did not observe a significant difference in the removal efficiency between 2 and 3 g l of magnetite loading thus the optimum catalyst loading was chosen as 2 g l for both azo dyes 4 f e 2 o h f e 3 o h 5 f e o h o h 2 o h f e 3 6 f e 2 h o 2 f e 3 h o 2 7 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 h o 2 3 4 the effect of h2o2 concentration on fenton oxidation the removal efficiency of azo dyes at different concentrations of h2o2 is given in fig 8 during the experiments ph was kept constant at ph 3 5 and ph 6 0 while the magnetite loading was 2 g l for br18 and ar88 azo dyes respectively firstly the effect of different h2o2 concentrations on color removal efficiency was investigated without any magnetite addition fig 8 then the experiments were repeated with the addition of 2 g fe3o4 l for various h2o2 concentrations only a slight increase up to 25 and 6 for br18 and ar88 respectively was observed in removal efficiency when alone h2o2 concentration was increased up to 25 mm due to the released insignificant amount of hydroxyl radicals via illumination 49 at a constant initial magnetite loading the removal efficiency was increased to 76 and 100 for the addition of h2o2 up to 10 mm for br18 fig 8a and ar88 fig 8b azo dyes due to the formation of large amounts of hydroxyl radicals but the removal efficiency was decreased sharply from 76 to 15 for br18 dye fig 8a and from 100 to 35 for ar88 dye fig 8b for the higher h2o2 additions from 10 mm to 25 mm as mentioned before in the literature the effect of hydroxyl radicals on degradation of azo dye molecules is decreased due to the chemical reactions with excess h2o2 called as scavenging effect that causes to formation of less effective oxidative hydroxyls eqs 2 3 47 48 50 therefore the optimum h2o2 concentration was determined as 10 mm for the further experiments 3 5 the effect of dye concentration on adsorption and fenton oxidation the effect of initial azo dye concentrations on the color removal efficiency by adsorption and fenton oxidation is given in fig 9 the initial h2o2 concentration was adjusted to 10 mm and the catalyst loading was 2 g fe3o4 l the maximum removal efficiency for both azo dyes was reached after 60 min the removal efficiency of br18 and ar88 azo dyes decreased gradually from 44 to 23 fig 9a and from 81 to 67 fig 9b for 180 min respectively when the initial dye concentration was increased from 0 1 mm to 0 3 mm for adsorption the removal efficiency of br18 and ar88 azo dyes also decreased from 76 to 38 fig 9c and from 100 to 87 fig 9d for 180 min respectively when the initial dye concentration was increased from 0 1 mm to 0 3 mm for fenton oxidation because all experiments were performed with constant conditions the amount of magnetite and formed hydroxyl radicals were not enough to degrade higher amounts of azo dye concentrations similarly the amount of active adsorbent sites was not enough to adsorb higher initial concentrations of azo dyes 42 43 also the amount of effective hydroxyl radicals could be reduced due to the adsorption of high concentrations of dye molecules onto the active sites of magnetite nanoparticles 48 starch based nanocomposite starch sno2 was synthesized and used as an effective adsorbent for the removal of hg2 from aqueous medium at different concentrations 10 150 mg l where time and ph were kept 60 min and 6 respectively 51 it was reported that hg2 adsorption percentage was decreased from 99 5 to 72 5 with the increase in hg2 concentration from 10 to 150 mg l this decrease in the adsorption percentage was explained due to the less availability of adsorption sites at the surface of starch sno2 nanocomposite for the higher concentration of hg2 metal ion 3 6 deposition of magnetite nanoparticles on borosilicate glass substrate fig 10 shows the effect of magnetite nps coated glass substrate on the degradation of azo dye molecules by adsorption and fenton oxidation for different initial azo dye concentrations the initial h2o2 concentration was 10 mm and the catalyst loading was 2 g fe3o4 l for positively charged br18 azo dye the removal efficiency of 0 1 mm initial solution by adsorption was improved from 44 to 77 fig 10a due to the negatively charged surface of sio2 glass substrate that improved the electrostatic interactions between azo dye molecules and substrate however the removal efficiency of ar88 azo dye was slightly increased from 71 to 86 fig 10c compared to alone powder magnetite nps when initial azo dye concentrations was decreased from 0 3 mm to 0 1 mm because there were no strong molecular interactions between the negatively charged glass substrate and similarly charged ar88 azo dye molecules another reason for the increase in the removal efficiency by adsorption was that the agglomeration of powder magnetite nanoparticles might be prevented by the coating of magnetite nps onto sio2 containing borosilicate glass substrate thus more active adsorption sites could be reached for the same fe3o4 dosage 40 similar results were obtained in the removal efficiency by fenton oxidation for both types of azo dyes the removal efficiency decreased from 82 to 43 for br18 dye fig 10b and from 100 to 82 for ar88 dye fig 10d when initial dye concentration increased from 0 1 to 0 3 mm it was possible to achieve more catalytic active sites by inhibiting aggregation of magnetite nanoparticles after coating process as mentioned above so the removal efficiency of azo dye molecules by fenton oxidation was higher than alone powder magnetite nps loading due to the obtaining more amount of oxidative hydroxyl radicals the effect of nanomagnetite modification on textural characteristics of clay matrices and adsorption properties were investigated by dontsova et al 52 magnetic sorbents were modified with molybdenum disulphide which changed their adsorption and surface properties the sorption capacity of the triple magnetic composite with respect to the cationic dye increased from 350 mg g to 1100 mg g and to the anionic dye from 176 mg g to 1830 mg g the increase in the sorption capacity of modified magnetic sorbents for both dyes was explained due to the increase in the number of the lewis base sites and increase in the number of brönsted acid sites sorption properties of mgfe2o4 towards mn2 co2 ni2 cu2 ions were studied using one component model solutions by ivanets et al 53 the highest sorption capacity of mgfe2o4 was detected towards co2 2 30 mmol g and mn2 1 56 mmol g and the lowest towards ni2 0 89 mmol g and cu2 0 46 mmol g the phzpc of sorbent was calculated to be 6 58 at studied ph interval 3 0 7 0 the sorption capacity of mgfe2o4 was not significantly affected regeneration test suggested that mgfe2o4 magnetic sorbent can be efficiently used at least for four adsorption desorption cycles zno nanoparticles fixed on glass plates were used as photocatalysts for the degradation of acid red 88 ar88 dye in aquatic solution the results showed an increase in ar88 removal at the neutral ph of 7 0 79 but a decreased in acidic and alkaline ph values it was also reported that the removal efficiency decreased from 92 to 45 when the dye concentration increased from 10 to 100 mg l 54 3 7 repeated use number to observe the stability of magnetite during the experiments five cycles were performed at similar operating conditions for only powder magnetite dosage and magnetite coated glass substrate after each cycle the magnetite nps were separated from the treated dye solutions using a magnet and were prepared for the next cycles by washing with distilled water however magnetite coated glass plate was also washed with distilled water after each cycle the removal efficiencies of each azo dyes for five cycles are shown in fig 11 the removal efficiency decreased from 81 to 26 fig 11a and 44 to 13 fig 11b by adsorption when the powder magnetite nps was used for ar88 and br88 azo dyes respectively however the removal efficiency decreased from 96 to 38 fig 11a and 76 to 18 fig 11b by fenton oxidation after five cycles for ar88 and br88 azo dyes respectively magnetite nps were coated on borosilicate glass to prevent agglomeration of the nps and to increase catalytic efficiency the removal efficiency by adsorption decreased from 85 to 49 3 fig 11a and 76 5 to 9 45 fig 11b when the powder magnetite nps was used for ar88 and br88 azo dyes respectively however the removal efficiency by fenton oxidation decreased from 100 to 71 5 fig 11a and 81 7 to 60 7 fig 11b after five cycles for ar88 and br88 azo dyes respectively it was observed that the stability of the magnetite nps was higher than powder magnetite after five cycles when magnetite nps were coated on the borosilicate glass the reason might be explained since the active sites of the coated magnetite nps on glass plate were more open due to the prevention of agglomeration and the dye molecules could be adsorbed more easily to the open active sites therefore more dye molecules were adsorbed by open active areas and there were not enough active sites for the next cycles on the other hand due to the opposite charged electrostatic interactions at ph 9 0 the adsorption of dye molecules on glass substrate fig 11b was higher than powder magnetite nps fig 11a during five cycles however reusability of catalyst caused to decline in removal efficiency after first cycle due to the insufficient adsorption sites on magnetite nps coated glass substrate moreover iron leaching could lead to a decrease in the removal efficiency by adsorption and fenton oxidation for the next cycles 46 as a result experiments showed that magnetite nps coated on glass substrate could be used for several times for fenton oxidation compared to powder magnetite nps nickel ferrite bearing nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nife2o4 nc was used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of hg2 ion from aqueous medium 36 after four regeneration cycles using hcl solution 0 01 m nife2o4 nc still exhibited 92 5 of the original adsorption capacity of nife2o4 nc 3 8 real textile wastewater treatment in this paper powder and coated on borosilicate glass magnetite nps was evaluated as an adsorbent for adsorption and catalyst for fenton oxidation to treat a real textile wastewater sample textile wastewater contains innumerous types of dyes and several other components dispersed in the medium that can interfere in the adsorption and fenton oxidation process such as ions soaps and surfactants 55 the adsorption and fenton oxidation experiments were carried out at ph 3 5 considering the experiments with synthetic wastewater the zeta potential of magnetite coated glass fe3o4 sio2 fig 5a and textile wastewater were 3 87 and 5 35 mv at ph 3 5 respectively fig 5b regarding the experiments with real wastewater using powder magnetite nps the color removal efficiencies of the sample were 56 1 and 67 6 for adsorption and fenton oxidation respectively fig 12 a moreover the color removal efficiencies were obtained as 40 0 and 78 3 for adsorption and fenton oxidation respectively using magnetite nps coated on borosilicate glass fig 12b these results indicated the treatment of a real textile wastewater using magnetite nps as adsorbent and catalyst might be a viable alternative 4 conclusions in this study the activity of both powder magnetite nps and coated on glass substrate on the br18 and ar88 azo dyes removal efficiencies were investigated by adsorption and fenton oxidation it was observed that the initial ph of the solution was one of the most significant effects on the color removal efficiency by both adsorption and fenton oxidation the solution ph affected the amount of reactive oxygen species and the molecular interactions between azo dye molecules and magnetite nanoparticles the optimum solution ph was determined 9 0 and 3 5 for adsorption experiments whereas ph was 3 5 and 6 0 for fenton oxidation experiments for br18 and ar88 dyes respectively only the use of h2o2 in the fenton oxidation did not have much effect on color removal efficiency however a great improvement was achieved by the addition of the magnetite nps catalyst for fenton oxidation in which optimum dye concentration h2o2 concentration and magnetite loading were determined as 0 1 mm 10 mm and 2 g l respectively due to obtaining an adequate oxidative radical formations and elimination of the scavenging effects the color removal efficiencies by adsorption and fenton oxidation were improved by coating the magnetite nanoparticles onto the borosilicate glass substrate due to the prevention of the agglomeration magnetite nps and additional adsorption surface of glass substrate 100 and 81 7 color removal of ar88 and br18 dyes were obtained by fenton oxidation and coated magnetite nps were protected their stability better than powder magnetite nps after five consecutive use the results of this study confirmed that magnetite nps coated on glass substrate which was low cost and easy available adsorbent is an efficient method for the removal of textile dyes from aqueous solution 
14217,fenton oxidation is an efficient and useful method for wastewater treatment to increase overall reaction efficiencies and inhibit environmental impacts developing advanced catalysts are crucial in this matter the main goal of this study was to investigate the catalytic activity of the magnetite fe2 fe2 3 o4 2 fefe2o4 or fe3o4 nanoparticles nps coated borosilicate glass on the color removal of basic red 18 br18 and acid red 8 ar88 azo dyes by adsorption and fenton oxidation reaction the efficiency of powder magnetite nps was also tested to compare to magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass the effect of solution ph 2 5 9 0 catalyst loading 0 25 3 0 g l and dye concentration 0 1 0 3 mm were tested to achieve maximum color removal efficiency using powder magnetite nps the color removal efficiencies were measured 44 at ph 9 0 and 76 at ph 3 5 for adsorption and fenton oxidation of br18 dye 0 1 mm moreover the color removal efficiencies were measured 81 at ph 3 5 and 100 at ph 6 0 for adsorption and fenton oxidation of ar88 dye 0 1 mm the effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 concentration 2 5 25 mm was also optimized and 10 mm was found optimum h2o2 dosage for fenton oxidation however magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass enhanced maximum 77 and 82 color removal efficiencies for adsorption and fenton oxidation of br18 dye maximum 86 and 100 color removal efficiencies were obtained for adsorption and fenton oxidation of ar88 dye stability of the powder magnetite nps and magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass catalyst was also investigated the reusability of the catalyst showed that magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass could be used at least 3 times without significant loss of activity compared to powder magnetite nps for fenton oxidation the characterization of the catalyst was carried out using scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx x ray powder diffraction xrd and zeta potential analyses before and after adsorption keywords magnetite nanoparticles deposition adsorption fenton oxidation dye decolorization textile wastewater treatment 1 introduction industrial wastewater remains a major global problem due to negative effects on the environment 1 textile industry is one of the industry which consumes excessive amounts of water and chemicals in the processes and produces a huge amount of environmentally hazardous wastewater 2 the water used in the processes is contaminated by heavy metals azodyes bisphenol a bpa suspended solids high chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod due to used additive chemicals 3 conventional biological treatments can remain insufficient for complete treatment of wastewater and non biodegradable pollutants thus developing different treatment technologies are required for improving discharged water qualities 4 so far various methods have been developed for textile wastewater treatment such as membrane 5 membrane bioreactors 6 coagulation 7 advanced oxidation technologies 8 and adsorption 9 adsorption is also one of the most widely used methods for the removal of dyes 10 recently several approaches have been studied for the development of cheaper and effective adsorbents especially a combination of biological treatment and adsorption on activated carbon as well as low cost adsorbents are becoming more common for removal of dyes from wastewater 11 for example activated lignin chitosan extruded pellets with controlled particle size distribution was produced for efficient methylene blue adsorption the produced adsorbent supplied a maximum adsorption capacity of 36 25 mg g 12 however desorption of methylene blue mb dye from brown macroalga nizamuddinia zanardinii was investigated by daneshvar et al 13 seventeen eluents were tested and hydrochloric acid was found to be the most effective eluent for dye desorption reusability of the brown macroalga was also investigated they were reported that the dye sorption efficiency decreased from 96 99 0 90 to 48 16 1 98 and the dye desorption efficiency decreased from 68 70 2 03 to 46 83 1 49 after five sorption desorption cycles 14 amino functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes nh2 mwcnts were prepared and the magnetic nanoparticles fe3o4 were embedded with nh2 mwcnts to develop magnetic carbon nanotube nh2 mwcnts fe3o4 15 the prepared new adsorbent enhanced 178 5 mg g maximum adsorption capacity from the langmuir isotherm equation for mb removal it was noted that after six repetitive cycles the adsorption capacity of nh2 mwcnts fe3o4 was 80 of the original value advanced oxidation processes aop are efficient methods for removal of bio persistent toxic pollutants in textile wastewater 16 17 aop is based on chemical oxidation of organic pollutants by several reaction mechanisms using ozonation electrocatalysis electrocatalytic oxidation photocatalysis and fenton like processes 18 reaction mechanism of these methods are based on generating reactive oxygen species i e oh ooh and o2 with high oxidation potential 1 8 2 8 v 19 this process involves mainly hydroxyl radicals oh 2 80 v which are highly reactive and non selective for degradation of main pollutants to secondary pollutants co2 and h2o 20 21 among these processes fenton process is considered to be a more effective approach for generating hydroxyl radicals which can increase the reaction rate and time for textile wastewater 22 fenton degradation is a catalytic process for generating oh radicals in the presence of a ferrous ion and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in aqueous solution 23 oh radicals in the reaction medium decompose toxic pollutants to h2o co2 non toxic end products and complete mineralization can be achieved for these kinds of reactions 24 however even partial degradation of the resistant organic compounds is adequate as a chemical pre treatment stage using aops developing heterogeneous catalysts for fenton like reactions has gained significant research interest in order to improve overall reaction efficiency and to minimize negative effects of the processes on the environment and water qualities 25 developing advanced nano sized catalysts for aops are crucial to minimize environmental impacts of wastewater studies in the literature indicate that nano sized iron based catalysts are perfect candidates for oxidation reactions due to their strong catalytic and photochemical properties 26 however the corrosion of catalyst in fenton reaction remains as an obstacle for large scale industrial applications and uneasy catalyst recovery does not provide system permanency catalyst recovery and reusability are desirable in terms of sustainability of the system and economic viewpoint 27 to overcome these problems mentioned above magnetite nps was deposited onto borosilicate glass which was an inert surface to eliminate the difficult catalyst recovery step and to prevent aggregation of the nps the objective of this study was to synthesize magnetite fe3o4 catalyst and to evaluate the catalytic performance in fenton like reactions for decolorization of br18 and ar88 dyes synthesized materials were characterized by sem edx xrd

precipitation of ferric chloride fe3 ions and ferrous sulfate fe2 ions in aqueous solution as previously described 28 ferric chloride 40 ml 1 m and ferrous sulfate 10 ml 2 m in hcl 2 m solutions were mixed and were added to ammonia solution 500 ml 0 7 m the ph of the aqueous solution was adjusted to 10 by naoh or hcl 0 1 n and it was stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer the black precipitate was collected washed three times 3 250 ml deionized water and finally dried in the oven at 105 c for overnight a photograph of ferromagnetic liquid and solid form attracted by an external magnetic field is presented in fig 1 2 3 preparation of magnetite nps coated borosilicate glass substrate the objective of the coating step was to prevent aggregation and to enhance catalytic activity by increasing the surface area magnetite fe3o4 nps oleic acid mixture is synthesized by slightly modified method of ocakoglu et al 29 the fe3o4 500 mg was mixed with oleic acid 800 mg and heated at 125 c for 2 h to obtain a red brown viscous liquid mixture then it was cooled for 12 h at 25 1 c and subsequently treated with 5 ml of tetrahydrofuran thf the mixture was stirred and the precipitates were separated from the solution by centrifugation 7000 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was recovered for coating process the fe3o4 coated substrate was prepared by drop casting of the supernatant onto a borosilicate glass substrate followed by annealing at 500 c for 1 h in air 2 4 adsorption and fenton experiments the adsorption and fenton oxidation experiments of magnetite nps were carried out in a 100 ml conical flask containing 50 ml of dye solution the effects of ph magnetite loading and dye concentration were suited for adsorption experiments additionally the effect of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 dosage was studied for fenton oxidation experiments the adsorption and fenton oxidation experiments of magnetite coated glass substrate were carried out in a petri dish containing 25 ml of dye solution all the experiments were carried out under constant shaking 250 rpm for 180 min at 25 1 c powder samples were separated by centrifugation 6000 rpm 10 min and analyzed versus time to determine residual dye concentration all samples were tested in triplicate and average values were presented removal efficiencies of color was calculated by eq 1 2 r e 1 c f c i 100 where ci mg l and cf mg l are initial and final dye concentration in the solution respectively 2 5 characterization methods the morphological characterization of the composite materials was investigated by scanning electron microscopy sem the surface chemical composition of the fe3o4 coated glass substrate was determined via energy dispersive spectroscopy eds attached to the sem images were taken by applying electron beam having an acceleration voltage of 15 00 kv a zeta sizer malvern zetasizer equipped with mpt 2 titrator nano zs was used to measure the zeta potential of magnetite borosilicate glass magnetite coated glass and azo dyes using a refractive index of 1 5 the measurements were carried out at 25 1 c in triplicate using disposable cuvettes the velocity of the particle was measured using laser doppler electrophoresis which is proportional to the field strength and the zeta potential the structural properties of magnetite coated borosilicate glass substrate were analyzed by an x ray diffractometer bruker d8 advanced series 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of powder magnetite nps and magnetite coated glass substrate agglomeration is one of the important problems in different applications of powder nanoparticles 30 the aggregation behavior of these particles is a decisive factor in the success of the study this feature can be minimized or completely eliminated by optimizing ph and viscosity or using surfactants 31 in the synthesis step of the nanoparticles some critical processes can be performed to minimize possible agglomeration of the material one of these methods is to use oleic acid the surface of the magnetite nps can be easily decorated by oleic acid for high colloidal stability against precipitation and agglomeration the previous studies proved the strong chemical bond formed between the carboxylic acid and the iron oxide nanoparticles 32 after coating process with oleic acid the material can be easily mixed with an organic solvent by this way the supernatant which contains nps bearing oleic acid are separated from the precipitates and this homogeneous organic mixture can be easily used for coating process onto a desired substrate in this study we preferred to use oleic acid for magnetite nps coating on the borosilicate glass surface 3 1 1 sem and edx analysis the morphology of the coated thin film magnetite was examined by scanning electron microscopy sem it was found that thin film magnetite was formed homogeneously on the borosilicate glass and was mostly cracked free surface as can be seen in fig 2 a and b magnetite nps were formed by a combination of self assembled spherical nanoparticles before coating the borosilicate glass substrate showed mostly a homogenous surface fig 2c thin film image of coated glass substrate after the coating process is given in fig 2d thin film consisted of spherical nanoparticle layers furthermore the size of the magnetite nanoparticles 5 nm was found to be almost same with the exposure time of the annealing steps moreover it was observed that an uneven aggregation was prevented in the resulting coating and nanoparticles were uniformly distributed inside the film the energy dispersive x ray analysis edx spectrum of synthesized magnetite nanoparticles is shown in fig 3 the edx spectrum demonstrated that the iron oxide structures were composed of fe and o only edx spectrum proved the existence of fe3o4 nps by oxygen and iron peaks fe element peaks were appeared around 0 6 6 3 and 7 kev besides the edx spectra of the fe3o4 nps verified the presence of elemental fe without any external peaks however a small percentage of si was detected in the spectrum which came from glass substrate 3 1 2 xrd analysis x ray diffraction analysis was used to obtain structural information of magnetite nps which were treated with oleic acid then coated on the borosilicate glass substrate the xrd pattern of the magnetite nps form exactly matched with the cubic phase of fe3o4 jcpdf 82 1533 fig 4 the lattice parameter of the particles was a 8 502 å there was a broad peak around 2θ 23 24 the d spacing of the fe3o4 nanoparticles was found to be 2 2 å our result confirmed that magnetite nps were successfully coated on the glass substrate 3 1 3 zeta potential the electrical state of an adsorbent s surface in solution is usually characterized by either the point of zero charge pzc or the isoelectric point iep the pzc is defined as the surface charge density equals zero the iep occurs when the electrokinetic ζ potential at the shear plane equals zero iep values clearly represent only the external surface charge of particles in solution whereas the pzc varies in response to the net total external and internal surface charge of the adsorbent as the characteristic of amphoteric surfaces 33 the change of zeta potential depending on ph between 2 9 is given in fig 5 solutions were prepared in nacl 1 mm salt the zeta potential of magnetite nanoparticles decreased with the increased ph values which was positively charged about below 6 4 which was consistent with the literature value of ph 6 7 34 when the zeta potential of the glass substrate was examined it was observed that the zeta potential was almost negatively charged for all ph values except of ph 2 which was close to isoelectric point iep therefore the coating of fe3o4 nanoparticles on glass substrate caused a decline in zeta potential of fe3o4 nanoparticles from about 42 mv to 0 mv at ph 2 which was iep of magnetite coated glass substrate and they had almost same zeta potential values at ph 9 26 mv however the zeta potentials of the glass substrate were higher than the glass substrate without magnetite but still all of them were negatively charged after magnetite coating when azo dyes used in the experiments were analyzed ar88 and br18 dyes were found to be negatively and positively charged at almost all ph values respectively therefore the adsorption capacity of magnetite nanoparticles for anionic dyes are more sensitive to ph values below 6 4 35 3 2 the effect of solution ph on adsorption and fenton oxidation the ph of the solution also plays a key role during the adsorption of metal ions because it affects the surface charge of the adsorbent as well as dissociates the functional groups on the active sites 36 in this study the impact of solution ph during the adsorption of azo dyes using magnetite nps was investigated in ph range of 2 5 9 0 fig 6 shows the influence of ph on both adsorption and fenton oxidation processes for the removal of color from br18 and ar88 azo dye solutions the adsorption experiments were carried out using 0 1 mm initial azo dye concentration 1 g l magnetite nps dosage 250 rpm stirring speed and 25 1 c the conditions of fenton oxidation experiments were same as adsorption experiments but differently h2o2 10 mm was added into the dye solution firstly the adsorption of azo dye molecules on magnetite nps was investigated without addition of h2o2 for positively charged br18 azo dye solution the removal efficiencies via adsorption mechanism was not high enough due to the strong electrostatic repulsions between magnetite nanoparticles and positively charged dye molecules which have the same surface charges 37 since the magnetite was positively charged below ph 6 4 a higher dye removal efficiency via adsorption mechanism was obtained for ar88 azo dye solution due to the electrostatic attractions between the positively charged surfaces of fe3o4 nanoparticles and negatively charged of ar88 azo dye molecules but above ph 4 0 the removal efficiency of ar88 was decreased below 40 due to a decline trend of zeta potential for both ar88 and magnetite the results obtained from the removal efficiency of azo dyes by adsorption mechanism were in a good agreement with the other studies 38 39 after the adsorption mechanism was examined the same experiments were repeated at different ph values by adding h2o2 and dye removal by the fenton oxidation mechanism was investigated it is well known by the literature that ph value has a considerable effect on the fenton process 40 41 the optimum ph value improves the catalysis efficiency and prevents the interferences from wastewater matrix 40 for positively charged br18 azo dye the highest dye removal efficiencies were achieved 25 and 51 at ph 9 0 and 3 5 for adsorption and fenton oxidation respectively fig 6a above the ph 3 5 for fenton oxidation the removal efficiency of br18 was decreased sharply which was similar to another study 42 at ph 3 5 the azo dye molecules were destructed by oh radicals effectively with breaking down of h2o2 in addition to this the potential of oh h2o redox pair oxidation is higher at acidic ph values that enhance higher removal efficiency for higher ph values the effect of oh radicals decreases due to chemical reactions between h2o2 and oh radicals according to eq 2 and eq 3 42 2 h 2 o 2 o h h o 2 h 2 o 3 h o 2 o h o 2 h 2 o the highest removal efficiency was obtained 71 and 95 at ph 3 5 and 6 0 for adsorption and fenton oxidation respectively for the negatively charged ar88 dye solution fig 6b additionally removal efficiency was decreased at higher ph values for fenton oxidation probable causation can be the generation of fe oh 3 precipitation which reduced the fenton catalyst activity 43 in contrast to br18 dye the removal efficiency of ar88 azo dye decreased sharply after ph 6 0 to understand that effect the iep value of the magnetite 6 4 should be considered at lower ph values the magnetite was positively charged which enhanced adsorption of negatively charged ar88 molecules on nanoparticles in this way the decomposition of h2o2 to o2 and h2o on the surface of magnetite was delayed and this caused oh radicals to continue its effects on the removal efficiency of dye molecules 44 therefore the optimum operating ph values for the fenton oxidation reaction were determined as ph 3 5 and ph 6 0 for br18 fig 6a and ar88 azo dyes fig 6b respectively whereas the optimum ph s were determined as 9 0 fig 6a and 3 5 fig 6b for the adsorption mechanism a novel nano composite cation exchanger sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide zr iv selenite sds azs was developed by naushad 45 and was used for the removal of toxic pb2 from aqueous medium the effect of ph for the adsorption of pb2 onto sds azs was tested in the ph range 2 10 the optimum ph for the maximum removal of pb2 was found 6 0 at lower ph the removal of pb2 was very low because of increasing of h ions which dominated over the adsorption process 3 3 the effect of magnetite loading on adsorption and fenton oxidation the effect of magnetite loading on both adsorption and fenton oxidation mechanisms is given in fig 7 all experiments were carried out at optimized ph values which were ph 9 0 and ph 3 5 for adsorption and ph 3 5 and ph 6 0 for fenton oxidation for br18 and ar88 azo dyes respectively the removal efficiency of azo dyes by adsorption was improved by increasing magnetite loading because of the increased active adsorbent sites of magnetite however the removal efficiency 48 was the lowest for br18 azo dye due to the low electrostatic attractions between magnetite and dye molecules at ph 9 0 fig 7a for ar88 dye solution fig 7b it was observed that the magnetite loading had a higher effect on removal efficiency due to strong molecular interactions between magnetite and dye molecules which were oppositely charged at ph 3 5 37 the removal efficiencies of azo dyes by fenton oxidation were increased up to 80 and 100 for br18 fig 7a and ar88 fig 7b azo dyes when the magnetite loading was increased up to 3 g fe3o4 l the reason of the improvement in removal efficiency was probably due to the increase in the number of catalytically active sites of magnetite in the solution which promoted more decomposition of h2o2 to oh radicals 46 47 however the removal efficiency decreased at higher magnetite loading in which the effect of oh radicals was reduced due to the parallel chemical reactions of fe2 ions or present iron species with oh radicals as well as other radicals eq 4 7 46 48 we did not observe a significant difference in the removal efficiency between 2 and 3 g l of magnetite loading thus the optimum catalyst loading was chosen as 2 g l for both azo dyes 4 f e 2 o h f e 3 o h 5 f e o h o h 2 o h f e 3 6 f e 2 h o 2 f e 3 h o 2 7 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 h o 2 3 4 the effect of h2o2 concentration on fenton oxidation the removal efficiency of azo dyes at different concentrations of h2o2 is given in fig 8 during the experiments ph was kept constant at ph 3 5 and ph 6 0 while the magnetite loading was 2 g l for br18 and ar88 azo dyes respectively firstly the effect of different h2o2 concentrations on color removal efficiency was investigated without any magnetite addition fig 8 then the experiments were repeated with the addition of 2 g fe3o4 l for various h2o2 concentrations only a slight increase up to 25 and 6 for br18 and ar88 respectively was observed in removal efficiency when alone h2o2 concentration was increased up to 25 mm due to the released insignificant amount of hydroxyl radicals via illumination 49 at a constant initial magnetite loading the removal efficiency was increased to 76 and 100 for the addition of h2o2 up to 10 mm for br18 fig 8a and ar88 fig 8b azo dyes due to the formation of large amounts of hydroxyl radicals but the removal efficiency was decreased sharply from 76 to 15 for br18 dye fig 8a and from 100 to 35 for ar88 dye fig 8b for the higher h2o2 additions from 10 mm to 25 mm as mentioned before in the literature the effect of hydroxyl radicals on degradation of azo dye molecules is decreased due to the chemical reactions with excess h2o2 called as scavenging effect that causes to formation of less effective oxidative hydroxyls eqs 2 3 47 48 50 therefore the optimum h2o2 concentration was determined as 10 mm for the further experiments 3 5 the effect of dye concentration on adsorption and fenton oxidation the effect of initial azo dye concentrations on the color removal efficiency by adsorption and fenton oxidation is given in fig 9 the initial h2o2 concentration was adjusted to 10 mm and the catalyst loading was 2 g fe3o4 l the maximum removal efficiency for both azo dyes was reached after 60 min the removal efficiency of br18 and ar88 azo dyes decreased gradually from 44 to 23 fig 9a and from 81 to 67 fig 9b for 180 min respectively when the initial dye concentration was increased from 0 1 mm to 0 3 mm for adsorption the removal efficiency of br18 and ar88 azo dyes also decreased from 76 to 38 fig 9c and from 100 to 87 fig 9d for 180 min respectively when the initial dye concentration was increased from 0 1 mm to 0 3 mm for fenton oxidation because all experiments were performed with constant conditions the amount of magnetite and formed hydroxyl radicals were not enough to degrade higher amounts of azo dye concentrations similarly the amount of active adsorbent sites was not enough to adsorb higher initial concentrations of azo dyes 42 43 also the amount of effective hydroxyl radicals could be reduced due to the adsorption of high concentrations of dye molecules onto the active sites of magnetite nanoparticles 48 starch based nanocomposite starch sno2 was synthesized and used as an effective adsorbent for the removal of hg2 from aqueous medium at different concentrations 10 150 mg l where time and ph were kept 60 min and 6 respectively 51 it was reported that hg2 adsorption percentage was decreased from 99 5 to 72 5 with the increase in hg2 concentration from 10 to 150 mg l this decrease in the adsorption percentage was explained due to the less availability of adsorption sites at the surface of starch sno2 nanocomposite for the higher concentration of hg2 metal ion 3 6 deposition of magnetite nanoparticles on borosilicate glass substrate fig 10 shows the effect of magnetite nps coated glass substrate on the degradation of azo dye molecules by adsorption and fenton oxidation for different initial azo dye concentrations the initial h2o2 concentration was 10 mm and the catalyst loading was 2 g fe3o4 l for positively charged br18 azo dye the removal efficiency of 0 1 mm initial solution by adsorption was improved from 44 to 77 fig 10a due to the negatively charged surface of sio2 glass substrate that improved the electrostatic interactions between azo dye molecules and substrate however the removal efficiency of ar88 azo dye was slightly increased from 71 to 86 fig 10c compared to alone powder magnetite nps when initial azo dye concentrations was decreased from 0 3 mm to 0 1 mm because there were no strong molecular interactions between the negatively charged glass substrate and similarly charged ar88 azo dye molecules another reason for the increase in the removal efficiency by adsorption was that the agglomeration of powder magnetite nanoparticles might be prevented by the coating of magnetite nps onto sio2 containing borosilicate glass substrate thus more active adsorption sites could be reached for the same fe3o4 dosage 40 similar results were obtained in the removal efficiency by fenton oxidation for both types of azo dyes the removal efficiency decreased from 82 to 43 for br18 dye fig 10b and from 100 to 82 for ar88 dye fig 10d when initial dye concentration increased from 0 1 to 0 3 mm it was possible to achieve more catalytic active sites by inhibiting aggregation of magnetite nanoparticles after coating process as mentioned above so the removal efficiency of azo dye molecules by fenton oxidation was higher than alone powder magnetite nps loading due to the obtaining more amount of oxidative hydroxyl radicals the effect of nanomagnetite modification on textural characteristics of clay matrices and adsorption properties were investigated by dontsova et al 52 magnetic sorbents were modified with molybdenum disulphide which changed their adsorption and surface properties the sorption capacity of the triple magnetic composite with respect to the cationic dye increased from 350 mg g to 1100 mg g and to the anionic dye from 176 mg g to 1830 mg g the increase in the sorption capacity of modified magnetic sorbents for both dyes was explained due to the increase in the number of the lewis base sites and increase in the number of brönsted acid sites sorption properties of mgfe2o4 towards mn2 co2 ni2 cu2 ions were studied using one component model solutions by ivanets et al 53 the highest sorption capacity of mgfe2o4 was detected towards co2 2 30 mmol g and mn2 1 56 mmol g and the lowest towards ni2 0 89 mmol g and cu2 0 46 mmol g the phzpc of sorbent was calculated to be 6 58 at studied ph interval 3 0 7 0 the sorption capacity of mgfe2o4 was not significantly affected regeneration test suggested that mgfe2o4 magnetic sorbent can be efficiently used at least for four adsorption desorption cycles zno nanoparticles fixed on glass plates were used as photocatalysts for the degradation of acid red 88 ar88 dye in aquatic solution the results showed an increase in ar88 removal at the neutral ph of 7 0 79 but a decreased in acidic and alkaline ph values it was also reported that the removal efficiency decreased from 92 to 45 when the dye concentration increased from 10 to 100 mg l 54 3 7 repeated use number to observe the stability of magnetite during the experiments five cycles were performed at similar operating conditions for only powder magnetite dosage and magnetite coated glass substrate after each cycle the magnetite nps were separated from the treated dye solutions using a magnet and were prepared for the next cycles by washing with distilled water however magnetite coated glass plate was also washed with distilled water after each cycle the removal efficiencies of each azo dyes for five cycles are shown in fig 11 the removal efficiency decreased from 81 to 26 fig 11a and 44 to 13 fig 11b by adsorption when the powder magnetite nps was used for ar88 and br88 azo dyes respectively however the removal efficiency decreased from 96 to 38 fig 11a and 76 to 18 fig 11b by fenton oxidation after five cycles for ar88 and br88 azo dyes respectively magnetite nps were coated on borosilicate glass to prevent agglomeration of the nps and to increase catalytic efficiency the removal efficiency by adsorption decreased from 85 to 49 3 fig 11a and 76 5 to 9 45 fig 11b when the powder magnetite nps was used for ar88 and br88 azo dyes respectively however the removal efficiency by fenton oxidation decreased from 100 to 71 5 fig 11a and 81 7 to 60 7 fig 11b after five cycles for ar88 and br88 azo dyes respectively it was observed that the stability of the magnetite nps was higher than powder magnetite after five cycles when magnetite nps were coated on the borosilicate glass the reason might be explained since the active sites of the coated magnetite nps on glass plate were more open due to the prevention of agglomeration and the dye molecules could be adsorbed more easily to the open active sites therefore more dye molecules were adsorbed by open active areas and there were not enough active sites for the next cycles on the other hand due to the opposite charged electrostatic interactions at ph 9 0 the adsorption of dye molecules on glass substrate fig 11b was higher than powder magnetite nps fig 11a during five cycles however reusability of catalyst caused to decline in removal efficiency after first cycle due to the insufficient adsorption sites on magnetite nps coated glass substrate moreover iron leaching could lead to a decrease in the removal efficiency by adsorption and fenton oxidation for the next cycles 46 as a result experiments showed that magnetite nps coated on glass substrate could be used for several times for fenton oxidation compared to powder magnetite nps nickel ferrite bearing nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon nife2o4 nc was used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of hg2 ion from aqueous medium 36 after four regeneration cycles using hcl solution 0 01 m nife2o4 nc still exhibited 92 5 of the original adsorption capacity of nife2o4 nc 3 8 real textile wastewater treatment in this paper powder and coated on borosilicate glass magnetite nps was evaluated as an adsorbent for adsorption and catalyst for fenton oxidation to treat a real textile wastewater sample textile wastewater contains innumerous types of dyes and several other components dispersed in the medium that can interfere in the adsorption and fenton oxidation process such as ions soaps and surfactants 55 the adsorption and fenton oxidation experiments were carried out at ph 3 5 considering the experiments with synthetic wastewater the zeta potential of magnetite coated glass fe3o4 sio2 fig 5a and textile wastewater were 3 87 and 5 35 mv at ph 3 5 respectively fig 5b regarding the experiments with real wastewater using powder magnetite nps the color removal efficiencies of the sample were 56 1 and 67 6 for adsorption and fenton oxidation respectively fig 12 a moreover the color removal efficiencies were obtained as 40 0 and 78 3 for adsorption and fenton oxidation respectively using magnetite nps coated on borosilicate glass fig 12b these results indicated the treatment of a real textile wastewater using magnetite nps as adsorbent and catalyst might be a viable alternative 4 conclusions in this study the activity of both powder magnetite nps and coated on glass substrate on the br18 and ar88 azo dyes removal efficiencies were investigated by adsorption and fenton oxidation it was observed that the initial ph of the solution was one of the most significant effects on the color removal efficiency by both adsorption and fenton oxidation the solution ph affected the amount of reactive oxygen species and the molecular interactions between azo dye molecules and magnetite nanoparticles the optimum solution ph was determined 9 0 and 3 5 for adsorption experiments whereas ph was 3 5 and 6 0 for fenton oxidation experiments for br18 and ar88 dyes respectively only the use of h2o2 in the fenton oxidation did not have much effect on color removal efficiency however a great improvement was achieved by the addition of the magnetite nps catalyst for fenton oxidation in which optimum dye concentration h2o2 concentration and magnetite loading were determined as 0 1 mm 10 mm and 2 g l respectively due to obtaining an adequate oxidative radical formations and elimination of the scavenging effects the color removal efficiencies by adsorption and fenton oxidation were improved by coating the magnetite nanoparticles onto the borosilicate glass substrate due to the prevention of the agglomeration magnetite nps and additional adsorption surface of glass substrate 100 and 81 7 color removal of ar88 and br18 dyes were obtained by fenton oxidation and coated magnetite nps were protected their stability better than powder magnetite nps after five consecutive use the results of this study confirmed that magnetite nps coated on glass substrate which was low cost and easy available adsorbent is an efficient method for the removal of textile dyes from aqueous solution 
14218,an osa oxic settling anaerobic pilot plant preliminarly ran as a conventional activated sludge cas system was managed under several operating conditions for 16 months the aim was to evaluate the reduction of excess sludge production due to the recirculation of activated sludge trough the sludge holding tank sht the sludge retention time varied from 37 to 406 days according to the excess sludge wastage the oxidation reduction potential orp inside the sludge holding tank was of 248 133 mv the observed sludge yield obtained by feeding the system with real wastewater varied from 0 112 to 0 465 gtss gcod with a reduction of the excess sludge production of 49 6 20 7 compared to the cas system the recirculation of the sludge through the sht favoured the cod and ammonia nitrogen solubilization connected to the sludge decay the release of soluble phosphorus due to the phosphorus accumulating organisms metabolism was also noticed keywords osa process excess sludge reduction sludge holding tank phosphorus accumulating organisms wastewater treatment 1 introduction there is a general consensus that the excess sludge production is one of the most critical issues in the conventional activated sludge cas process due to the problems associated with its final disposal high operational costs potential risk to the public health and difficulty in finding suitable landfilling sites in densely popolated areas 1 7 it has been reported that the management and disposal of excess sludge accounts for 25 60 of the total plant operation costs 8 hence the strategies for the minimization of the excess sludge production are becoming attractive from an environmental and economical point of view as reported by coma et al 9 two main strategies may be followed to reduce the excess sludge to be disposed of i post treatment methods applying extra technologies to the wasted sludge stream or ii process reduction methods by applying devoted technologies in the water line itself this second way is reported as the more suitable by various authors 10 12 there are several studies demonstrating that the insertion of an anaerobic tank called sludge holding tank sht or anaerobic side stream reactor assr depending on the percentage of the return sludge treated into the return activated sludge ras flow of the activated sludge process can reduce the excess sludge production from 10 to 60 inter alia 2 4 7 10 11 12 this plant configuration first named oxic settling anaerobic osa by chudoba et al 13 also appears very suitable at a low cost since it can be readily retrofitted to existing plants 5 and does not require any additional physical or chemical treatment 1 the mechanisms involved in the sludge reduction achieved by applying osa processes are still under investigation semblante et al 5 summarizing the hypothesysis reported in literature i e enhanced endogenous decay eps destruction biomass feasting fasting energy uncoupling spilling slow growing bacteria selection and predation on bacteria by higher organisms pointed out that it is difficult to isolate a single cause because it is possible that these mechanisms are overlapping recently foladori et al 14 have proposed that there are two indipendent mechanisms contributing equally to sludge reduction i the anaerobic sludge hydrolysis taking place into the anaerobic side stream reactor and ii the aerobic cell lysis occurring into the aerobic tank where the sludge is recirculated in it has found that the periodic passageway of the sludge through the sludge holding tank promotes the selection of the phosphorus accumulating organisms pao 7 13 these bacteria are able to accumulate pholyphosphate poly p into the cells under aerobic conditions and subsequently release them in anaerobic conditions in order to gain energy for storage of polyhydroxy alkanoates pha and polyhydroxy butyrate phb the paos methabolism is usually exploited in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr system in order to achieve high phosphorus removal by favouring its intracellular storage into the sludge that is periodically wasted as reported by chudoba et al 13 the selection of poly p bacteria in osa system may contribute to the reduction of excess sludge production since these organisms naturally favour catabolic pathways the aim of the present study was to evaluate the long term performance of an osa pilot plant fed with real wastewater to the purpose a pilot plant having a total volume of about 4 0 m3 was designed built and put in operation close to a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp being fed with the real incoming sewage during the experimental campaign lasting 16 months the operating parameters were changed several times in order to study the plant in various conditions stressfull situations were also experienced due to environmental conditions and managing problems the plant was monitored with regard to cod and nutrients removal performances and to sludge production laboratory batch experiments were also performed in order to focus the hydrolysis and release phenomena occurring inside the sludge holding tank to our knoledge the present study is one of the few field experimentations performed with real wastewater under several operating conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 osa pilot plant the osa pilot plant was designed and built in cooperation with c a f c consorzio acquedotti friuli centrale s p a a company managing the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp of 83 towns of the udine province friuli venezia giulia region italy it was realized close to the terenzano ud wwtp a plant which had been studied and characterized previously 15 and was supplied with the real incoming sewage after grit pretreatment it consisted of an aerobic reactor having a variable volume of 0 5 1 08 m3 and being continuously fed by gravity from an influent reservoir with a volume of 0 373 m3 a settling tank having a volume of 0 8 m3 and an anoxic anaerobic sludge holding tank sht of 2 0 m3 where the total sludge flow from the settler is recirculated the clean effluent was collected into a 0 2 m3 tank before its final discharge the pilot plant was equipped with ph orp temperature and dissolved oxygen do probes and a programmable logic controller plc the do set point concentration was 4 0 mg o2 l the other parameters were free to vary and were only monitored all the tanks were made of stainless steel and were placed into a small hangar in order to avoid the use of any thermostatic system and to preserve the control panel the schematic diagram of the osa pilot plant is presented in fig 1 while its picture is provided in the supplementary material the plant operated for 16 months from august 12 2016 to december 4 2017 during which the operating parameters were changed several times in order to study the system under several conditions as resumed in table 1 the manipulated parameters were the sludge recirculation flowrate qr from 3 02 m3 d to 2 04 m3 d and the volume of the aerobic reactor from 0 50 m3 to 0 88 m3 in order to change the hydraulic retention times hrt of the tanks and the volume of periodically wasted sludge to vary the solid retention time srt of the system in periods i and vi no excess sludge was withdrawn from the plant except for the analysis purpose sampled sludge resulting in very high srt values in these mentioned periods a complete solids retention can be assumed before starting the osa configuration the pilot plant operated 3 months as cas system the last month from july 4 to august 12 2016 was considered to compare the cas performances with the osa ones 2 2 sampling and analysis during the operation the pilot plant was inspected almost every day with samples taken once twice a week the sampling points were the influent tank the inner of the aerobic reactor the effluent tank the recirculation pipe from the settler to the sludge holding tank the sht input and the recirculation pipe from the sht to the aerobic reactor the sht output the samples were then delivered to the chemical plants laboratory of the engineering and architecture department at the university of trieste and analyzed in order to detect the concentration of tss total suspended solids vss volatile suspended solids cod total and soluble ammonia nitrate and soluble phosphorus tss and vss were determined in agreement with standard methods 16 whereas the chemical parameters were achieved by using hach test cuvettes 17 chemical oxygen demand was determined according with the reactor digestion method approved by usepa the ammonia nitrogen according with salicylate method 10031 the nitrate nitrogen according with the chromotropic acid method 10020 and the soluble phosphorus according with the molybdovanadate method 8114 17 except for total cod all the samples were filtered at 0 45μm before chemical analysis the gas produced inside the sludge holding tank was also measured by using a 1 liter plastic gasometer located over the sealed cover of the anoxic anaerobic sht a gas analyser ga 2000 plus geotechnical instruments was used to analyze the gas samples in order to detect the production of ch4 if any the settling characteristics of the activated sludge were monitored by periodic evaluation of the sludge volume index svi according with standard methods 16 2 3 laboratory batch tests in addition to the continuous monitoring of the pilot plant performances several batch tests were performed in order to study in depth the phenomena occurring into the sludge holding tank the trials were carried out in an experimental apparatus described in literature 18 thermally controlled and connected to a data logger acquisition unit the sludge ras samples were maintained for 2 3 days into the batch reactor without providing oxygen neither exogenous substrate and the concentration of soluble cod nitrate nitrogen ammonia nitrogen soluble phosphorus as well as the redox potential value were monitored at the end of the anaerobic phase i e when no more appreciable p release was noticed the aeration was started and the system was monitored for almost 1 day the sludge samples were distinguished according to the sampling point sludge collected in the stream from the settling tank to the sht settled sludge sludge collected in the stream from the sht to the aerobic tank sht sludge the mean vss concentrations were 4567 1735 mg vss l for the settled sludge experiments and 3220 368 mg vss l for the sht sludge experiments the respective temperature values were of 20 0 0 7 c and 20 3 0 4 c the test were carried out regularly from november 2016 to november 2017 sporadically anoxic anaerobic batch tests with substrate addition sodium acetate solution feeding to achieve an initial cod concentration of 110 150 mg l were performed 2 4 calculations the srt of the whole osa system was calculated as 1 s r t d x a e r v a e r x s h t v s h t x w q w x e

incoming cod and the soluble effluent cod respectively the yobs was obtained as the slope of the regression line of the cumulative generated sludge versus the cumulative consumed substrate 3 results and discussions 3 1 general plant performances as before mentioned the pilot plant operated preliminarily as a conventional activated sludge system with an influent flowrate of 1 42 m3 d and a ras flowrate of 5 70 m3 d the plant was fed as the whole osa operation with the real wastewater incoming to the terenzano municipal wwtp having the following characteristics codin 238 4 142 6 mg cod l n nh4in 22 7 9 5 mg n l n no3in 0 8 0 8 mg n l p po4in 4 3 2 1 mg p l and ssin 144 0 65 4 mg ss l the temperature measured inside the aerobic reactor was 27 9 1 7 c the concentration of dissolved oxygen 3 6 0 7 mg do l and the orp 227 18 mv the removal efficiency of cod and ammonia nitrogen was high and equal on average to 84 9 and 94 4 respectively very low phosphorus removal equal to 5 1 was noticed also the solid removal was scarce with a mean efficiency of 22 once the cas system was stabilized the configuration was changed and the osa plant was put into operation according to the parameters reported in table 1 the general plant performances were evaluated with respect to the pollutants removal calculated by mass balances according to the eq 2 the concentrations of cod n nh4 n no3 and p po4 detected in both influent and effluent flows and in the aerobic reactor and sludge holding tank are reported in fig 2 the data concerning the influent characterization and the removal performances are summarized in table 2 as it can be seen good performances were observed in the cod removal process with efficiency higher than 80 except for the third period when the removal efficiency was of 69 9 during the entire period of the study the effluent cod concentration was lower than the italian legal limit 125 mg l with a mean value of 39 mg l as regards the ammonia removal after the good performances obtained in the first period of the study a progressive worsening of the process was noticed during the second phase culminated with an ammonia accumulation into the aerobic reactor the nitrification failure occurred together with a change of the srt value from complete solids retention to 37 d and with a decrease of temperature inside the aerobic reactor that reached the minimum value of 6 6 c furthermore it should be added that a stable ammonia release took place into the sludge holding tank as better debated in the next section contributing to the n nh4 load in the aerobic reactor due to the ras flow it is likely that the overlapping of several issues such as the ammonia release into the sht the decrease of the srt and the winter temperatures caused a shock to the metabolism of autotrophic biomass resulting in the aforementioned ammonia accumulation to fix the problem the volume of the aerobic reactor was raised from 0 50 m3 to 0 88 m3 in order to increase the hrt as a result of this modification the ammonia removal became high again scarce performances were obtained in phosphorus removal as shown in fig 2 the effluent p concentrations were higher than the influent ones most of the time the reason of this behavior could be the high amount of soluble p recirculated into the aerobic reactor from the sludge holding tank as reported in table 2 fig 3 shows the contribution due to the recirculation flow to the total pollutant mass entering the aerobic reactor expressed as ratio between the recirculated load g d and the sum of the influent and recirculated load g d specifically the mean ratios were 0 26 as regards the cod 0 33 for the ammonia nitrogen and even 0 75 for the soluble p i e the recirculated phosphorous accounted for the 75 of the overall influent recirculated soluble p flowing into the aerobic reactor it is well known indeed that several phenomena such as enhanced biomass decay hydrolysis of particulate organic matter and the pao related processes take place inside the sht causing a significant increase in soluble cod ammonia and phosphorus 7 19 to take into account the load recirculated from the sludge holding tank a mass balance around the aerobic tank was done and then the efficiency including the recirculation flow was calculated as 4 r e c e f f c i i n q i n c i r q r c i o u t a e r q i n q r c i i n q i n c i r q r 100 where ci r is the concentration of generic substance in the return flow ci out aer is the concentration of the generic substance leaving the aerobic reactor and qr is the recirculation flowrate the removal efficiencies for n nh4 and p po4 including the ras loads are summarized in table 2 where significant differences regarding the phosphorus removal appear several authors 2 11 12 20 agree that the insertion of a sludge holding tank in the recirculation line from the settling tank to the aerobic reactor worsens the phosphorus removal chudoba et al 13 stated that in system osa type a phosphate removal higher than about 50 cannot be expected furthermore in the present study the high p concentration of the effluent can be explained by the sludge withdrawn modality as it is known in the ebpr enhanced biological phosphorus removal system the enhanced p removal is obtained by wasting from the bottom of the settling tank the excess sludge where the phosphorus has accumulated in due to the enrichment of pao during the present study due to operating problems with the settling tank the periodic sludge withdrawn was done from the sht after which the phosphorus release took place therefore wasted sludge leaked a certain amount of phosphorus previously accumulated in contrast with the basics of ebpr however as shown in table 2 when calculating the soluble p mass balance around the aerobic tank removal efficiencies ranging from 16 8 to 91 0 can be noticed 3 2 phenomena occurring into the sludge holding tank the fig 4 shows the concentrations of cod n nh4 n no3 and p po4 in the recirculation sludge before and after its passage into the sht the denitrification efficiences and the mean values of released scod ammonia and phosphorus are reported in table 3 one of the first phenomenon standing out is the accomplishment of the denitrification process except for the third period when a very low amount of nitrate was fed to the sht due to the nitrification inhibition in the aerobic reactor the denitrification occurred continuously with an efficiency ranging from 48 4 to 78 6 the nitrate reduction without an exogenous carbon feed is a phenomenon noticed by several authors in system osa like 2 12 21 in agreement with foladori et al 14 and jiang et al 21 the source of biodegradable cod for the denitrification reaction could originate from the hydrolysis of the particulate organic matter that constitutes the sludge matrix one other important finding was the release of soluble phosphorus that ranged from a minimum mean value of 1 2 g p d for the last period to a maximum mean value of 56 g p d detected in the third period the p release was probably due to the metabolism of phosphorus accumulating organisms that proliferated inside the sludge mixed culture due to the cyclic transitions from aerobic conditions to anoxic anaerobic conditions chudoba et al 13 found that the fraction of poly p bacteria in the mixed culture had increased from 5 10 to 50 60 when the cas system was converted to the osa system it is worthy to note that no strict anaerobic conditions were detected inside the sludge holding tank during the period of the study the n no3 concentration detected in the samples from sht varied from 0 0 to 5 5 mg n l with an overall average of 2 2 mg n l indicating that a transition from anoxic to anaerobic conditions occurred similarly the values of orp continuously detected and recorded varied throughout the day depending on whether the occurring process was denitrification or p release it must be underlined that except for the isolated value of 105 g p d recorded the 3 april 2017 the maximum phosphorus release occurred during the third period of the study when small amounts of nitrate were fed to the sludge holding tank several authors report that the presence of nitrate could inhibit the p release that only occur after nitrate depletion 22 24 a reason could be that the ordinary denitrifiers compete against paos for the uptake of readily biodegradable cod 23 24 the soluble cod release was calculated by mass balance between the input and the output streams of the sht results showed that the increase of scod after passing through the sht ranged from a value close to zero in the last period to 46 4 g cod d in the third period actually it is likely that the amount of released soluble cod was underestimated due to its simultaneous uptake as electron donor for the denitrification reactions and its storage as pha in the internal cell of the phosphorus accumulating bacteria 7 20 25 if according to an and chen 25 the amounts of cod consumed were 4 46 g cod g n no3 reduced and 2 g cod g p released the not detectable scod was in the range of 38 5 112 0 g cod d an amount much greater than the remaining detectable one the solubilization of ammonia nitrogen was also noticed the amount of released n nh4 during the study varied from 2 2 g n nh4 d for the fifth period to 14 0 g n nh4 d for the third one according to novak et al 3 the increase in ammonia concentration is due to the degradation of protein released by the solubilization under anaerobic conditions of the iron bound organic matter the solubilization of organic matter inside the sht and its subsequent consumption into the aerobic reactor also known as cryptic growth is generally considered as the major reason for the reduction in sludge production in osa type systems 2 3 14 21 25 when referring to mechanism of sludge decay foladori et al 14 emphasize that the sludge is a complex matrix composed of both bacterial biomass and non bacterial material so two pathways should be distinguished the hydrolysis of particulate non bacterial material and the cell lysis of bacterial biomass in particular the authors found that the solubilization of cod under anaerobic conditions was due to the hydrolysis of the non bacterial portion of the organic matter or to the fermentation of high molecular weight substances in a previous study chen et al 1 found that the number of bacteria of the sludge from an osa system remained almost unchanged after an anoxic exposure of 16 h but the floc size decreased during the batch test in a recent paper jiang et al 21 confirmed the predominance of the hydrolysis of the non bacterial material in sludge decay mechanism the authors moreover pointed out the contribution of the real wastewater to the particulate organic matter of the sludge matrix 3 3 batch tests as described in paragraph 2 3 from november 2016 to november 2017 several batch tests were carried out in order to study the phenomena occurring into the sludge holding tank in more detail in the tests performed without substrate addition the sludge samples were starved for 2 3 days without aeration and then aerated for almost 1 day the obtained results are summarized in table 4 in addition as an example the concentration profiles and the orp trend concerning a test with settled sludge performed in july 2017 are reported in fig 5 regarding the general results of all the tests the denitrification process took place without any exogenous substrate addition with an efficiency higher than 70 0 for both sludge types the specific denitrification rates were 0 22 mg n g vss h for the settled sludge and 0 55 mg n g vss h for the sht sludge values slightly lower than that reported by xu et al 26 for post denitrification process the denitrification rate obtained in batch test with acetate addition was obviously higher and equal to 1 28 mg n gvss h with a removal efficiency of 97 8 the increase of soluble cod was noticed in all tests for example the scod profile is visible in fig 5 the measured cod was most likely lower than that actually released due to its simultaneous consumption in denitrification process and in phosphorus release in general no phosphorous release took place when a nitrate concentration higher than 1 0 1 5 mg n l was present inside the batch reactor it is well known that nitrate inhibits the phosphorus release process 22 24 as before introduced one reason could be the competition for biodegradable cod between ordinary denitrifiers and paos the remaining nitrate could be used as an electron acceptor for the growth of non poly p heterotrophs leading to less substrate available for pha storage by the paos 22 24 another explanation might be the proven fact that some of the paos can denitrify the nitrate could be used as a final electron acceptor instead of oxygen by the denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos leading to a simultaneous n no3 and p po4 removal 22 23 27 however among the several experiments performed during the present study the anoxic phosphorus uptake was noticed just once with a specific p removal rate of 0 22 mg p vss h in all the other tests a trend similar to the one described in the fig 5 was found i e the concentration of soluble phosphorous was almost constant during the initial denitrification step with a sudden increase after the denitrification has stopped in fig 5 the transition from the anoxic condition to the anaerobic condition is well underlined by the orp profile showing the characteristic nitrate knee it is worthy to note however that this characteristic zone was not detected in all the trials depending on the initial concentration of n no3 the average p release rate was similar for both the type of batch test 0 22 mg p gvss h for settled sludge and 0 21 mg p gvss h for sht sludge these values are in the same order of magnitude than those found by romero pareja et al 12 in the anaerobic tank of an osa system and considerably lower than those observed by zou et al 23 and by xu et al 26 in a sequence batch reactor with cod addition it is possible that not all stored phosphorus was released into the bulk liquid in a past study kuba et al 28 found that about the 46 of phosphorus content of the biomass in their anaerobic anoxic sbr was releasable phosphorus and only the 43 of the releasable p was effectively released during the sbr operation the ammonia nitrogen release was noticed in all the batch experiments with a specific release rate of 0 04 mg n gvss h for the settled sludge and of 0 08 mg n gvss h for the sht sludge values similar to those found by romero pareja et al 12 as mentioned before the batch tests were concluded with an aerobic phase starting when no appreciable p release was noticed at the restoring of aerobic condition the orp values as also shown in the fig 5 had a rapid increase and the aerobic removal processes took place the aerobic p removal rates had the mean values of 0 88 mg p gvss h for the settled sludge with an efficiency of 80 7 and of 4 07 mg p gvss h for the sht sludge with an efficiency of 94 4 the ammonia uptake rates were of 1 16 mg gvss h and of 1 51 mg gvss h for the settled sludge and sht sludge with the corresponding removal efficiency of 68 8 and 94 9 the scod removal was lower with efficiency of 35 0 and 49 4 for the settled sludge and sht sludge respectively probably this lower removal was due to the fact that most of the soluble biodegradable cod was consumed in denitrification and pha phb storage therefore the remaining concentration contained a considerable amount of inert cod finally in fig 6 the outcomes of a batch test performed with acetate addition are depicted in the presence of biodegradable cod simultaneous denitrification and p release took place with substrate removal of 85 4 in this case no competition occurred between ordinary heterotrophs and paos since the amount of added carbon was enough to be both electron donor for denitrification and substrate available for pha storage 3 4 sludge production the sludge production was evaluated by calculating the observed yield yobs according with the eq 3 in fig 7 concerning the overall experimental campaign the cumulative generated sludge vs the cumulative removed cod is reported the observed yields of the six operation periods were calculated individually by the slope of the relative regression lines in order to compare the experimental results obtained in a wide range of the water line temperature 11 5 27 7 c the yobs values were normalized according to coma et al 9 to 20 c using the arrhenius equation y o b s t y o b s 20 θ 20 t where θ 1 029 the observed yields with the values of the regression coefficient r2 are shown in table 5 as can be seen they were comparable with those found in previous works reported in table 6 it has to be pointed out that the present work refers to a system fed with real wastewater therefore the excess sludge production was affected by the particulate materials contained in it 6 9 in order to evaluate the excess sludge reduction due to the insertion of the sludge holding tank the yobs of the cas period was calculated by the eq 3 and its value was used for comparison the observed yield relative to the cas operation was 0 518 g tss g cod at a mean temperature of 27 9 c therefore its normalized value at 20 c was 0 649 g tss g cod this value greater than those obtained in the osa configuration was due largely to the solids losses in the effluent the results of the comparison are reported in table 5 as it can be seen the remarkable excess sludge reduction due to the insertion of the sht ranged from 28 5 to 82 7 finally the overall observed yield measured in the 16 months operation was 0 358 gtss gcod with a r2 of 0 88 3 5 sludge settleability the settling properties of the sludge were evaluated by settling tests and calculating the sludge volumetric index svi the mean values of the svi for the cas configuration and for the osa operation including acclimatization period are depicted in fig 8 values of svi lower than 100 ml gtss are reported as desirable in wwtps while values higher than 150 ml gtss are usually associated with the presence of filamentous bacteria 30 the mean svi measured during the preliminary cas operation was 99 ml gtss the svi had a slight increment during the acclimatization period from the cas to osa configuration and then was restabilized to 98 ml gtss in the first osa period the svi rose again during the next phases of the study reaching a mean value of 237 ml gtss in the period iii discordant results concerning the effects of the osa system on the settling properties of the sludge have been reported some authors found that the insertion of the sht or the ssr in the ras of their systems improved the sludge settleability 2 9 12 on the contrary velho et al 6 found that the average svi values had a significant increase after the implementation of the anaerobic side stream reactor torregrossa et al 4 noticed a worsening of the sludge settling properties during the transition phase from the cas configuration to the osa one as regards the present study after reaching the maximum value in the period iii the svi decreased to values lower than 100 ml gtss in the last two periods of the study novak et al 3 reported that the flocculation in the activated sludge system is linked to the presence of eps therefore it was possible that during the period ii iv the eps released from the flocs were degraded inside the sht and were not adequately regenerated inside the aeration tank causing a deterioration of the flocculation and then of the settling process however even though the high values of svi the osa system always operated with good settleability and with no appreciable solid loss in the effluent 4 conclusions the operation of an osa pilot plant with a total volume of about 4 0 m3 fed with real wastewater was monitored for 16 months during the experimental campaign the operational parameters were changed several times in order to study the system under different conditions the observed yield normalized to a temperature of 20 c varied between 0 112 and 0 465 g tss g cod showing that the excess sludge reduction due to the insertion of the sludge holding tank was of 49 6 20 7 compared to the conventional cas system the passageway of the sludge through the sht promoted the solubilization of cod and ammonia and the release of soluble phosphorus the solubilized cod was used as an electron donor into the sht to accomplish the biological denitrification with an efficiency of 63 8 11 4 the batch test performed without providing oxygen neither exogenous substrate showed that there was a competition for biodegradable cod between pao and ordinary denitrifiers no solids loss was detected in the effluent despite the increase of the value of the sludge volume index during the middle phase of the study the pilot plant responded to the induced modification anthropic and environmental in a reasonable time the major drawback concerned the

14218,an osa oxic settling anaerobic pilot plant preliminarly ran as a conventional activated sludge cas system was managed under several operating conditions for 16 months the aim was to evaluate the reduction of excess sludge production due to the recirculation of activated sludge trough the sludge holding tank sht the sludge retention time varied from 37 to 406 days according to the excess sludge wastage the oxidation reduction potential orp inside the sludge holding tank was of 248 133 mv the observed sludge yield obtained by feeding the system with real wastewater varied from 0 112 to 0 465 gtss gcod with a reduction of the excess sludge production of 49 6 20 7 compared to the cas system the recirculation of the sludge through the sht favoured the cod and ammonia nitrogen solubilization connected to the sludge decay the release of soluble phosphorus due to the phosphorus accumulating organisms metabolism was also noticed keywords osa process excess sludge reduction sludge holding tank phosphorus accumulating organisms wastewater treatment 1 introduction there is a general consensus that the excess sludge production is one of the most critical issues in the conventional activated sludge cas process due to the problems associated with its final disposal high operational costs potential risk to the public health and difficulty in finding suitable landfilling sites in densely popolated areas 1 7 it has been reported that the management and disposal of excess sludge accounts for 25 60 of the total plant operation costs 8 hence the strategies for the minimization of the excess sludge production are becoming attractive from an environmental and economical point of view as reported by coma et al 9 two main strategies may be followed to reduce the excess sludge to be disposed of i post treatment methods applying extra technologies to the wasted sludge stream or ii process reduction methods by applying devoted technologies in the water line itself this second way is reported as the more suitable by various authors 10 12 there are several studies demonstrating that the insertion of an anaerobic tank called sludge holding tank sht or anaerobic side stream reactor assr depending on the percentage of the return sludge treated into the return activated sludge ras flow of the activated sludge process can reduce the excess sludge production from 10 to 60 inter alia 2 4 7 10 11 12 this plant configuration first named oxic settling anaerobic osa by chudoba et al 13 also appears very suitable at a low cost since it can be readily retrofitted to existing plants 5 and does not require any additional physical or chemical treatment 1 the mechanisms involved in the sludge reduction achieved by applying osa processes are still under investigation semblante et al 5 summarizing the hypothesysis reported in literature i e enhanced endogenous decay eps destruction biomass feasting fasting energy uncoupling spilling slow growing bacteria selection and predation on bacteria by higher organisms pointed out that it is difficult to isolate a single cause because it is possible that these mechanisms are overlapping recently foladori et al 14 have proposed that there are two indipendent mechanisms contributing equally to sludge reduction i the anaerobic sludge hydrolysis taking place into the anaerobic side stream reactor and ii the aerobic cell lysis occurring into the aerobic tank where the sludge is recirculated in it has found that the periodic passageway of the sludge through the sludge holding tank promotes the selection of the phosphorus accumulating organisms pao 7 13 these bacteria are able to accumulate pholyphosphate poly p into the cells under aerobic conditions and subsequently release them in anaerobic conditions in order to gain energy for storage of polyhydroxy alkanoates pha and polyhydroxy butyrate phb the paos methabolism is usually exploited in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr system in order to achieve high phosphorus removal by favouring its intracellular storage into the sludge that is periodically wasted as reported by chudoba et al 13 the selection of poly p bacteria in osa system may contribute to the reduction of excess sludge production since these organisms naturally favour catabolic pathways the aim of the present study was to evaluate the long term performance of an osa pilot plant fed with real wastewater to the purpose a pilot plant having a total volume of about 4 0 m3 was designed built and put in operation close to a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp being fed with the real incoming sewage during the experimental campaign lasting 16 months the operating parameters were changed several times in order to study the plant in various conditions stressfull situations were also experienced due to environmental conditions and managing problems the plant was monitored with regard to cod and nutrients removal performances and to sludge production laboratory batch experiments were also performed in order to focus the hydrolysis and release phenomena occurring inside the sludge holding tank to our knoledge the present study is one of the few field experimentations performed with real wastewater under several operating conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 osa pilot plant the osa pilot plant was designed and built in cooperation with c a f c consorzio acquedotti friuli centrale s p a a company managing the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp of 83 towns of the udine province friuli venezia giulia region italy it was realized close to the terenzano ud wwtp a plant which had been studied and characterized previously 15 and was supplied with the real incoming sewage after grit pretreatment it consisted of an aerobic reactor having a variable volume of 0 5 1 08 m3 and being continuously fed by gravity from an influent reservoir with a volume of 0 373 m3 a settling tank having a volume of 0 8 m3 and an anoxic anaerobic sludge holding tank sht of 2 0 m3 where the total sludge flow from the settler is recirculated the clean effluent was collected into a 0 2 m3 tank before its final discharge the pilot plant was equipped with ph orp temperature and dissolved oxygen do probes and a programmable logic controller plc the do set point concentration was 4 0 mg o2 l the other parameters were free to vary and were only monitored all the tanks were made of stainless steel and were placed into a small hangar in order to avoid the use of any thermostatic system and to preserve the control panel the schematic diagram of the osa pilot plant is presented in fig 1 while its picture is provided in the supplementary material the plant operated for 16 months from august 12 2016 to december 4 2017 during which the operating parameters were changed several times in order to study the system under several conditions as resumed in table 1 the manipulated parameters were the sludge recirculation flowrate qr from 3 02 m3 d to 2 04 m3 d and the volume of the aerobic reactor from 0 50 m3 to 0 88 m3 in order to change the hydraulic retention times hrt of the tanks and the volume of periodically wasted sludge to vary the solid retention time srt of the system in periods i and vi no excess sludge was withdrawn from the plant except for the analysis purpose sampled sludge resulting in very high srt values in these mentioned periods a complete solids retention can be assumed before starting the osa configuration the pilot plant operated 3 months as cas system the last month from july 4 to august 12 2016 was considered to compare the cas performances with the osa ones 2 2 sampling and analysis during the operation the pilot plant was inspected almost every day with samples taken once twice a week the sampling points were the influent tank the inner of the aerobic reactor the effluent tank the recirculation pipe from the settler to the sludge holding tank the sht input and the recirculation pipe from the sht to the aerobic reactor the sht output the samples were then delivered to the chemical plants laboratory of the engineering and architecture department at the university of trieste and analyzed in order to detect the concentration of tss total suspended solids vss volatile suspended solids cod total and soluble ammonia nitrate and soluble phosphorus tss and vss were determined in agreement with standard methods 16 whereas the chemical parameters were achieved by using hach test cuvettes 17 chemical oxygen demand was determined according with the reactor digestion method approved by usepa the ammonia nitrogen according with salicylate method 10031 the nitrate nitrogen according with the chromotropic acid method 10020 and the soluble phosphorus according with the molybdovanadate method 8114 17 except for total cod all the samples were filtered at 0 45μm before chemical analysis the gas produced inside the sludge holding tank was also measured by using a 1 liter plastic gasometer located over the sealed cover of the anoxic anaerobic sht a gas analyser ga 2000 plus geotechnical instruments was used to analyze the gas samples in order to detect the production of ch4 if any the settling characteristics of the activated sludge were monitored by periodic evaluation of the sludge volume index svi according with standard methods 16 2 3 laboratory batch tests in addition to the continuous monitoring of the pilot plant performances several batch tests were performed in order to study in depth the phenomena occurring into the sludge holding tank the trials were carried out in an experimental apparatus described in literature 18 thermally controlled and connected to a data logger acquisition unit the sludge ras samples were maintained for 2 3 days into the batch reactor without providing oxygen neither exogenous substrate and the concentration of soluble cod nitrate nitrogen ammonia nitrogen soluble phosphorus as well as the redox potential value were monitored at the end of the anaerobic phase i e when no more appreciable p release was noticed the aeration was started and the system was monitored for almost 1 day the sludge samples were distinguished according to the sampling point sludge collected in the stream from the settling tank to the sht settled sludge sludge collected in the stream from the sht to the aerobic tank sht sludge the mean vss concentrations were 4567 1735 mg vss l for the settled sludge experiments and 3220 368 mg vss l for the sht sludge experiments the respective temperature values were of 20 0 0 7 c and 20 3 0 4 c the test were carried out regularly from november 2016 to november 2017 sporadically anoxic anaerobic batch tests with substrate addition sodium acetate solution feeding to achieve an initial cod concentration of 110 150 mg l were performed 2 4 calculations the srt of the whole osa system was calculated as 1 s r t d x a e r v a e r x s h t v s h t x w q w x e

incoming cod and the soluble effluent cod respectively the yobs was obtained as the slope of the regression line of the cumulative generated sludge versus the cumulative consumed substrate 3 results and discussions 3 1 general plant performances as before mentioned the pilot plant operated preliminarily as a conventional activated sludge system with an influent flowrate of 1 42 m3 d and a ras flowrate of 5 70 m3 d the plant was fed as the whole osa operation with the real wastewater incoming to the terenzano municipal wwtp having the following characteristics codin 238 4 142 6 mg cod l n nh4in 22 7 9 5 mg n l n no3in 0 8 0 8 mg n l p po4in 4 3 2 1 mg p l and ssin 144 0 65 4 mg ss l the temperature measured inside the aerobic reactor was 27 9 1 7 c the concentration of dissolved oxygen 3 6 0 7 mg do l and the orp 227 18 mv the removal efficiency of cod and ammonia nitrogen was high and equal on average to 84 9 and 94 4 respectively very low phosphorus removal equal to 5 1 was noticed also the solid removal was scarce with a mean efficiency of 22 once the cas system was stabilized the configuration was changed and the osa plant was put into operation according to the parameters reported in table 1 the general plant performances were evaluated with respect to the pollutants removal calculated by mass balances according to the eq 2 the concentrations of cod n nh4 n no3 and p po4 detected in both influent and effluent flows and in the aerobic reactor and sludge holding tank are reported in fig 2 the data concerning the influent characterization and the removal performances are summarized in table 2 as it can be seen good performances were observed in the cod removal process with efficiency higher than 80 except for the third period when the removal efficiency was of 69 9 during the entire period of the study the effluent cod concentration was lower than the italian legal limit 125 mg l with a mean value of 39 mg l as regards the ammonia removal after the good performances obtained in the first period of the study a progressive worsening of the process was noticed during the second phase culminated with an ammonia accumulation into the aerobic reactor the nitrification failure occurred together with a change of the srt value from complete solids retention to 37 d and with a decrease of temperature inside the aerobic reactor that reached the minimum value of 6 6 c furthermore it should be added that a stable ammonia release took place into the sludge holding tank as better debated in the next section contributing to the n nh4 load in the aerobic reactor due to the ras flow it is likely that the overlapping of several issues such as the ammonia release into the sht the decrease of the srt and the winter temperatures caused a shock to the metabolism of autotrophic biomass resulting in the aforementioned ammonia accumulation to fix the problem the volume of the aerobic reactor was raised from 0 50 m3 to 0 88 m3 in order to increase the hrt as a result of this modification the ammonia removal became high again scarce performances were obtained in phosphorus removal as shown in fig 2 the effluent p concentrations were higher than the influent ones most of the time the reason of this behavior could be the high amount of soluble p recirculated into the aerobic reactor from the sludge holding tank as reported in table 2 fig 3 shows the contribution due to the recirculation flow to the total pollutant mass entering the aerobic reactor expressed as ratio between the recirculated load g d and the sum of the influent and recirculated load g d specifically the mean ratios were 0 26 as regards the cod 0 33 for the ammonia nitrogen and even 0 75 for the soluble p i e the recirculated phosphorous accounted for the 75 of the overall influent recirculated soluble p flowing into the aerobic reactor it is well known indeed that several phenomena such as enhanced biomass decay hydrolysis of particulate organic matter and the pao related processes take place inside the sht causing a significant increase in soluble cod ammonia and phosphorus 7 19 to take into account the load recirculated from the sludge holding tank a mass balance around the aerobic tank was done and then the efficiency including the recirculation flow was calculated as 4 r e c e f f c i i n q i n c i r q r c i o u t a e r q i n q r c i i n q i n c i r q r 100 where ci r is the concentration of generic substance in the return flow ci out aer is the concentration of the generic substance leaving the aerobic reactor and qr is the recirculation flowrate the removal efficiencies for n nh4 and p po4 including the ras loads are summarized in table 2 where significant differences regarding the phosphorus removal appear several authors 2 11 12 20 agree that the insertion of a sludge holding tank in the recirculation line from the settling tank to the aerobic reactor worsens the phosphorus removal chudoba et al 13 stated that in system osa type a phosphate removal higher than about 50 cannot be expected furthermore in the present study the high p concentration of the effluent can be explained by the sludge withdrawn modality as it is known in the ebpr enhanced biological phosphorus removal system the enhanced p removal is obtained by wasting from the bottom of the settling tank the excess sludge where the phosphorus has accumulated in due to the enrichment of pao during the present study due to operating problems with the settling tank the periodic sludge withdrawn was done from the sht after which the phosphorus release took place therefore wasted sludge leaked a certain amount of phosphorus previously accumulated in contrast with the basics of ebpr however as shown in table 2 when calculating the soluble p mass balance around the aerobic tank removal efficiencies ranging from 16 8 to 91 0 can be noticed 3 2 phenomena occurring into the sludge holding tank the fig 4 shows the concentrations of cod n nh4 n no3 and p po4 in the recirculation sludge before and after its passage into the sht the denitrification efficiences and the mean values of released scod ammonia and phosphorus are reported in table 3 one of the first phenomenon standing out is the accomplishment of the denitrification process except for the third period when a very low amount of nitrate was fed to the sht due to the nitrification inhibition in the aerobic reactor the denitrification occurred continuously with an efficiency ranging from 48 4 to 78 6 the nitrate reduction without an exogenous carbon feed is a phenomenon noticed by several authors in system osa like 2 12 21 in agreement with foladori et al 14 and jiang et al 21 the source of biodegradable cod for the denitrification reaction could originate from the hydrolysis of the particulate organic matter that constitutes the sludge matrix one other important finding was the release of soluble phosphorus that ranged from a minimum mean value of 1 2 g p d for the last period to a maximum mean value of 56 g p d detected in the third period the p release was probably due to the metabolism of phosphorus accumulating organisms that proliferated inside the sludge mixed culture due to the cyclic transitions from aerobic conditions to anoxic anaerobic conditions chudoba et al 13 found that the fraction of poly p bacteria in the mixed culture had increased from 5 10 to 50 60 when the cas system was converted to the osa system it is worthy to note that no strict anaerobic conditions were detected inside the sludge holding tank during the period of the study the n no3 concentration detected in the samples from sht varied from 0 0 to 5 5 mg n l with an overall average of 2 2 mg n l indicating that a transition from anoxic to anaerobic conditions occurred similarly the values of orp continuously detected and recorded varied throughout the day depending on whether the occurring process was denitrification or p release it must be underlined that except for the isolated value of 105 g p d recorded the 3 april 2017 the maximum phosphorus release occurred during the third period of the study when small amounts of nitrate were fed to the sludge holding tank several authors report that the presence of nitrate could inhibit the p release that only occur after nitrate depletion 22 24 a reason could be that the ordinary denitrifiers compete against paos for the uptake of readily biodegradable cod 23 24 the soluble cod release was calculated by mass balance between the input and the output streams of the sht results showed that the increase of scod after passing through the sht ranged from a value close to zero in the last period to 46 4 g cod d in the third period actually it is likely that the amount of released soluble cod was underestimated due to its simultaneous uptake as electron donor for the denitrification reactions and its storage as pha in the internal cell of the phosphorus accumulating bacteria 7 20 25 if according to an and chen 25 the amounts of cod consumed were 4 46 g cod g n no3 reduced and 2 g cod g p released the not detectable scod was in the range of 38 5 112 0 g cod d an amount much greater than the remaining detectable one the solubilization of ammonia nitrogen was also noticed the amount of released n nh4 during the study varied from 2 2 g n nh4 d for the fifth period to 14 0 g n nh4 d for the third one according to novak et al 3 the increase in ammonia concentration is due to the degradation of protein released by the solubilization under anaerobic conditions of the iron bound organic matter the solubilization of organic matter inside the sht and its subsequent consumption into the aerobic reactor also known as cryptic growth is generally considered as the major reason for the reduction in sludge production in osa type systems 2 3 14 21 25 when referring to mechanism of sludge decay foladori et al 14 emphasize that the sludge is a complex matrix composed of both bacterial biomass and non bacterial material so two pathways should be distinguished the hydrolysis of particulate non bacterial material and the cell lysis of bacterial biomass in particular the authors found that the solubilization of cod under anaerobic conditions was due to the hydrolysis of the non bacterial portion of the organic matter or to the fermentation of high molecular weight substances in a previous study chen et al 1 found that the number of bacteria of the sludge from an osa system remained almost unchanged after an anoxic exposure of 16 h but the floc size decreased during the batch test in a recent paper jiang et al 21 confirmed the predominance of the hydrolysis of the non bacterial material in sludge decay mechanism the authors moreover pointed out the contribution of the real wastewater to the particulate organic matter of the sludge matrix 3 3 batch tests as described in paragraph 2 3 from november 2016 to november 2017 several batch tests were carried out in order to study the phenomena occurring into the sludge holding tank in more detail in the tests performed without substrate addition the sludge samples were starved for 2 3 days without aeration and then aerated for almost 1 day the obtained results are summarized in table 4 in addition as an example the concentration profiles and the orp trend concerning a test with settled sludge performed in july 2017 are reported in fig 5 regarding the general results of all the tests the denitrification process took place without any exogenous substrate addition with an efficiency higher than 70 0 for both sludge types the specific denitrification rates were 0 22 mg n g vss h for the settled sludge and 0 55 mg n g vss h for the sht sludge values slightly lower than that reported by xu et al 26 for post denitrification process the denitrification rate obtained in batch test with acetate addition was obviously higher and equal to 1 28 mg n gvss h with a removal efficiency of 97 8 the increase of soluble cod was noticed in all tests for example the scod profile is visible in fig 5 the measured cod was most likely lower than that actually released due to its simultaneous consumption in denitrification process and in phosphorus release in general no phosphorous release took place when a nitrate concentration higher than 1 0 1 5 mg n l was present inside the batch reactor it is well known that nitrate inhibits the phosphorus release process 22 24 as before introduced one reason could be the competition for biodegradable cod between ordinary denitrifiers and paos the remaining nitrate could be used as an electron acceptor for the growth of non poly p heterotrophs leading to less substrate available for pha storage by the paos 22 24 another explanation might be the proven fact that some of the paos can denitrify the nitrate could be used as a final electron acceptor instead of oxygen by the denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos leading to a simultaneous n no3 and p po4 removal 22 23 27 however among the several experiments performed during the present study the anoxic phosphorus uptake was noticed just once with a specific p removal rate of 0 22 mg p vss h in all the other tests a trend similar to the one described in the fig 5 was found i e the concentration of soluble phosphorous was almost constant during the initial denitrification step with a sudden increase after the denitrification has stopped in fig 5 the transition from the anoxic condition to the anaerobic condition is well underlined by the orp profile showing the characteristic nitrate knee it is worthy to note however that this characteristic zone was not detected in all the trials depending on the initial concentration of n no3 the average p release rate was similar for both the type of batch test 0 22 mg p gvss h for settled sludge and 0 21 mg p gvss h for sht sludge these values are in the same order of magnitude than those found by romero pareja et al 12 in the anaerobic tank of an osa system and considerably lower than those observed by zou et al 23 and by xu et al 26 in a sequence batch reactor with cod addition it is possible that not all stored phosphorus was released into the bulk liquid in a past study kuba et al 28 found that about the 46 of phosphorus content of the biomass in their anaerobic anoxic sbr was releasable phosphorus and only the 43 of the releasable p was effectively released during the sbr operation the ammonia nitrogen release was noticed in all the batch experiments with a specific release rate of 0 04 mg n gvss h for the settled sludge and of 0 08 mg n gvss h for the sht sludge values similar to those found by romero pareja et al 12 as mentioned before the batch tests were concluded with an aerobic phase starting when no appreciable p release was noticed at the restoring of aerobic condition the orp values as also shown in the fig 5 had a rapid increase and the aerobic removal processes took place the aerobic p removal rates had the mean values of 0 88 mg p gvss h for the settled sludge with an efficiency of 80 7 and of 4 07 mg p gvss h for the sht sludge with an efficiency of 94 4 the ammonia uptake rates were of 1 16 mg gvss h and of 1 51 mg gvss h for the settled sludge and sht sludge with the corresponding removal efficiency of 68 8 and 94 9 the scod removal was lower with efficiency of 35 0 and 49 4 for the settled sludge and sht sludge respectively probably this lower removal was due to the fact that most of the soluble biodegradable cod was consumed in denitrification and pha phb storage therefore the remaining concentration contained a considerable amount of inert cod finally in fig 6 the outcomes of a batch test performed with acetate addition are depicted in the presence of biodegradable cod simultaneous denitrification and p release took place with substrate removal of 85 4 in this case no competition occurred between ordinary heterotrophs and paos since the amount of added carbon was enough to be both electron donor for denitrification and substrate available for pha storage 3 4 sludge production the sludge production was evaluated by calculating the observed yield yobs according with the eq 3 in fig 7 concerning the overall experimental campaign the cumulative generated sludge vs the cumulative removed cod is reported the observed yields of the six operation periods were calculated individually by the slope of the relative regression lines in order to compare the experimental results obtained in a wide range of the water line temperature 11 5 27 7 c the yobs values were normalized according to coma et al 9 to 20 c using the arrhenius equation y o b s t y o b s 20 θ 20 t where θ 1 029 the observed yields with the values of the regression coefficient r2 are shown in table 5 as can be seen they were comparable with those found in previous works reported in table 6 it has to be pointed out that the present work refers to a system fed with real wastewater therefore the excess sludge production was affected by the particulate materials contained in it 6 9 in order to evaluate the excess sludge reduction due to the insertion of the sludge holding tank the yobs of the cas period was calculated by the eq 3 and its value was used for comparison the observed yield relative to the cas operation was 0 518 g tss g cod at a mean temperature of 27 9 c therefore its normalized value at 20 c was 0 649 g tss g cod this value greater than those obtained in the osa configuration was due largely to the solids losses in the effluent the results of the comparison are reported in table 5 as it can be seen the remarkable excess sludge reduction due to the insertion of the sht ranged from 28 5 to 82 7 finally the overall observed yield measured in the 16 months operation was 0 358 gtss gcod with a r2 of 0 88 3 5 sludge settleability the settling properties of the sludge were evaluated by settling tests and calculating the sludge volumetric index svi the mean values of the svi for the cas configuration and for the osa operation including acclimatization period are depicted in fig 8 values of svi lower than 100 ml gtss are reported as desirable in wwtps while values higher than 150 ml gtss are usually associated with the presence of filamentous bacteria 30 the mean svi measured during the preliminary cas operation was 99 ml gtss the svi had a slight increment during the acclimatization period from the cas to osa configuration and then was restabilized to 98 ml gtss in the first osa period the svi rose again during the next phases of the study reaching a mean value of 237 ml gtss in the period iii discordant results concerning the effects of the osa system on the settling properties of the sludge have been reported some authors found that the insertion of the sht or the ssr in the ras of their systems improved the sludge settleability 2 9 12 on the contrary velho et al 6 found that the average svi values had a significant increase after the implementation of the anaerobic side stream reactor torregrossa et al 4 noticed a worsening of the sludge settling properties during the transition phase from the cas configuration to the osa one as regards the present study after reaching the maximum value in the period iii the svi decreased to values lower than 100 ml gtss in the last two periods of the study novak et al 3 reported that the flocculation in the activated sludge system is linked to the presence of eps therefore it was possible that during the period ii iv the eps released from the flocs were degraded inside the sht and were not adequately regenerated inside the aeration tank causing a deterioration of the flocculation and then of the settling process however even though the high values of svi the osa system always operated with good settleability and with no appreciable solid loss in the effluent 4 conclusions the operation of an osa pilot plant with a total volume of about 4 0 m3 fed with real wastewater was monitored for 16 months during the experimental campaign the operational parameters were changed several times in order to study the system under different conditions the observed yield normalized to a temperature of 20 c varied between 0 112 and 0 465 g tss g cod showing that the excess sludge reduction due to the insertion of the sludge holding tank was of 49 6 20 7 compared to the conventional cas system the passageway of the sludge through the sht promoted the solubilization of cod and ammonia and the release of soluble phosphorus the solubilized cod was used as an electron donor into the sht to accomplish the biological denitrification with an efficiency of 63 8 11 4 the batch test performed without providing oxygen neither exogenous substrate showed that there was a competition for biodegradable cod between pao and ordinary denitrifiers no solids loss was detected in the effluent despite the increase of the value of the sludge volume index during the middle phase of the study the pilot plant responded to the induced modification anthropic and environmental in a reasonable time the major drawback concerned the operation of the settling tank which did not allow the proper wastage of the poly p rich sludge funding this work was supported by the wastewater treatment company cafc s p a italy declaration of

14219,urea removal from aqueous solutions is a challenge in many field applications most available technologies are either energy intensive or complicated novel membrane based processes such as forward osmosis fo present potentially desirable alternatives for energy efficient urea removal recently aquaporin based membranes abms gained attention due to their high water permeability and selectivity in this study a hollow fiber abm module was investigated for both urea and ammonia ammonium rejection under different conditions such as varying water recovery rates initial feed solute concentrations draw solution molarities and feed solution ph the amount of water recovery significantly impacted urea rejection as a result of feed concentration increase and draw dilution over time while only less than 37 of urea could be rejected for a water recovery rate of 80 the rejection of urea for water recovery rates of 25 was above 82 when rejection was calculated via overall mass balance however ammonium rejection at lower ph did exceed 90 even under high water recovery rates the increase of ammonium rejection at low ph is believed to be influenced by the decrease of bidirectional diffusion of sodium and ammonium cations favored by the less negative charge of carboxyl groups dominating the membrane surface s active layer since rejection for uncharged urea is rather poor chemical processes that transform urea into ammonia ammonium prior to the fo step should be considered in future studies to improve rejection keywords forward osmosis aquaporin based membrane hollow fiber module urea removal ammonium retention 1 introduction urea is excreted by mammals and is ubiquitous in many environments 1 2 urea is also a key molecule in many industrial synthesis pathways and can enter the environment via waste waters from industrial production facilities 2 4 effective strategies to remove urea from aqueous solutions such as urine are desirable especially in exploration of remote environments for instance water recovery from human liquid waste is necessary during long duration missions in space 5 furthermore effective strategies to remove urea from urine are desirable to minimize human impact in natural ecosystems where nitrogenous waste needs to be removed as for example during deep exploration of pristine caves 6 different methods for urea removal exist but most are still in the early stages of development 2 such strategies include hydrolysis biological and enzymatic decomposition adsorption and electrochemical oxidation 2 4 7 10 most of these technologies are either energy intense and therefore often only considerable for applications where energy consumption is not limited or require complex and segmental biological strategies 2 membrane based filtration processes such as reverse osmosis ro and nano filtration nf are possible alternative solutions ro as well as nf membranes have been studied regarding their rejection of small and uncharged molecules such as urea 11 14 however for most ro and nf membranes tested urea rejection rates did not exceed 50 13 14 furthermore high pressure filtration processes such as ro have several disadvantages including cost scaling limitations and the risk of membrane fouling 15 16 an alternative strategy to ro and nf is forward osmosis fo in fo an osmotic pressure gradient between a higher concentrated draw solution and a less concentrated feed solution is utilized to facilitate water transport across a semi permeable membrane which separates feed from draw solution and allows water molecules to pass while other solutes are being held back the osmotic pressure created by the draw solution pulls water from the feed stream through the membrane leading to the dilution of the draw solution while solutes in the feed stream are concentrated 17 since the composition of the draw solution can be tailored depending on application fo may have advantages when

from fisher chemical pittsburgh pennsylvania 2 5 experimental procedure and analytical method samples from feed and draw were taken before and after each experiment and were diluted in di water prior to analysis to match the detection range of the assay urea as well as ammonia ammonium was quantified by measuring total nitrogen tn concentration using the tntplus 826 assay from hach loveland colorado following the manufacturer recommended protocol a hach drb 200 heating reactor was used for a 30 min persulfate digestion at 120 c before tn concentration could be quantified via spectrophotometry at 345 nm using a hach dr 2800 spectrophotometer analyses were performed directly after each experiment in between experiments the membrane and tubing system was flushed with di water for about 30 min additionally the tubing system was rinsed with a 20 methanol solution without the membrane being connected according to a cleaning procedure we used in a previous study 36 when not in use the membrane module was filled with di water and kept in a refrigerator at around 2 c all experiments were performed in triplicates 2 6 rejection rate calculations statistical analysis for

concentrations was mg l while all volumes are in l since all composed feed solutions only contained one nitrogenous source urea or ammonia ammonium the determined tn rejection rates could directly be related to the rejection of either compound therefore tn concentration will be used as a proxy for urea and ammonia ammonium concentration hereinafter 3 r t n 1 v d e c d e v f i c f i 100 4 r t n 1 v d e c d e v t c f i c f e 2 100 formula 3 calculates rejection rates based on overall mass balance between feed and draw while formula 4 also considers the final concentration of the feed stream and quantifies solute rejection as the ratio of average permeate concentration to average feed concentration to verify statistical differences between means multivariate analysis of variance anova with a significant level α of 0 05 was performed for all computed rejection rates within an experimental series 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane performance the membrane module functioned above the manufacturer s specifications throughout the entire study qc tests conducted to test membrane performance in between experiments confirmed that the water flux was above the minimum standard of 12 l m2 h with an average flux of 12 41 l m2 h the specific salt flux draw solution loss per liter of output averaged 0 13 g l and was below the manufacturer s maximum value of 0 3 g l for every qc test performed 3 2 membrane rejection for urea fig 2 summarizes average rejection rates for urea depending on different parameter changes it can be seen from fig 2 a that rejection rates are similar for the different initial urea feed concentrations tested this means that within the tested concentration range about the same percentage of the initial urea amount in the feed stream passed the membrane into the draw solution we could also observe this in a recent study where an aquaporin based membrane was tested for its rejection of different trace organic contaminants 36 feed solution ph did also not have a significant impact on urea rejection fig 2 b as urea remains uncharged at all ph ranges tested and changes in molecular interactions between the membrane and the urea molecule can therefore be excluded similar rejection rates were expected overall urea rejection rates did not exceed 41 within the tested feed solution ph and initial urea feed concentration range draw solution molarity did significantly impact the rejection of urea anova p 0 0005 n 3 for values obtained from formula 3 as well as from formula 4 as shown in fig 2 c the data suggests that with increasing nacl concentration in the draw solution the rejection of urea increases reaching 52 49 se 2 29 on average if calculated using formula 4 when a 2 m nacl draw solution was being used the improvement of urea rejection with increasing draw solution concentration is most probably based on the variation of experimental time the higher the draw solution concentration the less experimental time is necessary to achieve a water recovery rate of 80 due to the higher water flux therefore less time remains for urea to pass the membrane to establish chemical equilibrium between feed and draw to test this we ran a 1 g l urea solution feed side of the membrane against di water draw side of the membrane and observed that the urea concentration in the feed decreased as the concentration in the draw increased until an equilibrium in urea concentration was obtained on both sides of the membrane our data therefore suggests that the chemical imbalance of urea between feed and draw is the primary driving force for urea flux over the membrane consequently in shorter duration experiments e g when high osmolarity draw solutions are being used less urea accumulates in the final draw solution over the course of the experiment as shown in fig 2 d changes in water recovery resulted in a significant variation of urea rejection anova p 0 0001 n 3 when rejection was calculated via overall mass balance formula 3 for a water recovery rate of 80 only 36 87 se 0 92 of urea could be rejected by the membrane on average while an average urea rejection rate of 82 91 se 2 15 could be achieved at a water recovery rate of 25 these findings suggest that a high volume reduction of urea streams is not feasible without compromising urea rejection by the membrane however when rejection rates were calculated using formula 4 urea rejection only ranged from around 43 to 44 showing no significant variation for different water recovery rates this is based on the consideration of the end feed tn concentration cfe in the denominator of formula 4 which compensates for the increase in draw solution tn concentration at higher water recovery in membrane specific studies eq 4 is usually being used to calculate rejection rates however the resulting data from eq 4 gives the impression that the tn concentration in the draw stream remained constant which was not the case as the draw solutions tn concentration increased with rising water recovery therefore formula 3 which bases rejection on overall mass balance may provide a clearer representation of overall tn rejection emphasizing the increased accumulation of tn in the draw solution at higher water recovery furthermore it has to be mentioned that rejection rates calculated by using formula 4 can be inaccurate if feed contaminants adsorb at the membrane which can result in mass imbalances due to lowered cfe values as we could observe in a recent study 36 even though modeling and experimental studies exist that describe the influence of different parameters on fo performance 42 45 we could not identify any past work that examined why solute rejection decreased with increasing water recovery rates when rejection was calculated via overall mass balance formula 3 we hypothesized that the decline in solute rejection was influenced by the solute concentration increase of the feed stream as well as the dilution of the draw stream as water flowed over the membrane over the course of the experiment to test this we set up two confirmation experiments in which we either controlled the urea concentration of the feed stream or the dilution of the nacl draw stream experimental details of these additional experiments can be found in the supplementary section the maximum feed volume reduction after the 10 min draw dilution controlled experiments averaged 83 06 se 0 21 n 3 while the water flux rate from feed to draw did not change significantly over the course of the experiment fig 3 a the tn concentration measured in the outlet reservoir of the draw stream did increase fig 3 c this trend is even more noticeable when looking at the increasing rate of tn flux from feed to draw over the course of the experiment fig 3 e the presented data therefore confirms that as a result of urea concentration increase in the feed stream data not shown the percentage of urea passing the membrane increases relatively to the transported water volume leading to an increase of tn concentration in the draw solution which resulted in lower rejection rates when calculations were done via overall mass balance it has to be mentioned that the feed concentration increase during the fo experiment should not be confused with the initial urea feed concentration fig 2 a variations in the initial feed concentration did not impact urea rejection while the increase in urea concentration in the feed stream during the experiment did this is not a contradiction as eq 3 only considers the initial feed and final draw concentration to calculate rejection thus under high water recovery rates more urea passes the membranes and accumulates in the draw solution due to the increased feed concentration the calculated ratio between the initial amount of urea in the feed stream and the final urea concentration in the draw solution does therefore decrease with increasing water recovery the results of the feed concentration controlled experiments are displayed in the right column of fig 3 it can be seen that the rate of tn flux from feed to draw only declined slightly throughout the experiment fig 3 f while the water flux rate decreased significantly as a result of draw dilution fig 3 b since therefore the water volume in the draw stream did not increase proportionally to the rate of tn flux the tn concentration in the draw stream fig 3 d increased throughout the experiment resulting in lower urea rejection if calculated using formula 3 in summary our results suggest that the decrease in mass balance based urea rejection at higher water recovery is due to the concentration increase of the feed stream as well as the declining rate in draw solution dilution over the course of the experiment overall our results show that urea rejection rates for the used membrane module are rather low especially when they are based on mass balance calculations under high water recovery rates calling into question rejection studies where relatively low water recovery rates are tested for instance a study by liu et al 23 reports 98 retention calculated using overall mass balance see formula 3 of urea for a flat sheet cta membrane however when considering the membrane size of the used membrane 29 5 cm2 the initial urine volume in the feed 0 6 l the maximum water flux from feed to draw 6 l m2 h as well as the experimental time of 2 h we calculated a water recovery rate of 5 9 such high rejection rates for urea are therefore not difficult to achieve when actual water recovery is low in a study by contés de jesús et al 22 average urea rejection rates of 94 4 were reported for a porifera flat sheet fo membrane the mentioned study however does also not contain sufficient information to allow other authors to estimate the achieved water recovery rates we suggest that more attention should be directed towards water recovery rates in fo rejection studies if rejection rates are being calculated via mass balance since high water recovery is key for most fo applications it has to be mentioned however that even for low water recovery rates urea rejection was not very high urea is however a small and uncharged molecule and its rejection based on steric hindrance and electrostatic or molecular interactions may be limited since enzymatic hydrolysis of urea into ammonium could be a feasible strategy to transform urea into a charged molecule which may enhance its rejection by the membrane we decided to also investigate the membrane s rejection capability for ammonia ammonium 3 3 membrane rejection for ammonia ammonium fig 4 shows the average rejection rates for ammonia ammonium under different feed solution ph ranges when feed solutions were adjusted to ph 9 solute rejection was only averaging 14 98 se 2 46 if calculated using formula 3 tn concentration in the feed did even decrease throughout the experiments at ph 9 this is based on the increasing water volume in the draw stream over the course of the experiment as the system tends to establish chemical equilibrium between feed and draw high amounts of ammonia have to diffuse into the draw solution to establish equal ammonia concentrations on both sides of the membrane which is enabled by the low rejection capability of the membrane at ph 9 due to the feed solute concentration decrease rejection rates were even negative when calculated using formula 4 which is based on the lower average feed concentration in the denominator in comparison to a higher average permeate concentration on the nominator of the equation we therefore set all negative rejection rates to zero star symbols in fig 4 however rejection rates increased significantly with decreasing ph anova p 0 0001 n 3 for values obtained from formula 3 as well as from formula 4 reaching 95 97 se 0 05 on average at ph 3 if rejection was calculated using formula 4 the results indicate that feed solution ph has a significant influence on the rejection rate of ammonia ammonium when using abms suggesting that ionic charge may play a role in solute rejection the ammonia ammonium ion pair has a pka of 9 25 thus at ph 9 the feed solution should also contain ammonia at ph 3 and 6 an excess of the protonated ammonium should be present due to the slightly negative charged tfc membrane molecular interactions between the membrane and ions may impact rejection as a result negatively charged anions may be repulsed from the membrane while positively charged cations such as ammonium may be attracted and immobilized to the tfc surface layer by electrostatic adhesion hindering the molecule to pass through the membrane nonetheless the proposed rejection mechanism does not explain the difference in rejection between a feed ph of 3 and 6 since both ph ranges are clearly below the pka of ammonia ammonium the protonated cation ammonium should be omnipresent in either feed solution at similar rates therefore rejection rates should also be in a similar range to explain the rejection differences changes of the membrane s surface charge at different ph levels have to be considered see table 1 for membrane zeta potentials at different ph for instance a study by lu et al 46 related the rejection of ammonia ammonium to the bidirectional diffusion of ammonium and sodium cations which is influenced by the surface chemistry of a tfc membrane the dominating functional groups of the tfc active layer are carboxyl groups with a pka value of 5 2 46 49 in feed solutions with a ph above 5 2 e g ph 6 deprotonated carboxylate groups coo dominate the membrane surface chemistry leading to a more negative surface charge while at lower ph e g ph 3 protonated carboxylic groups cooh dominate leading to a reduced negative surface charge on the membrane lu et al 46 observed an increase of bidirectional diffusion of na and nh4 cations when using a feed solution at ph 6 compared to a feed solution at ph 3 according to lu et al 46 the increase of bidirectional cation diffusion is promoted by the more negative surface charge of the tfc membrane the mechanism described by lu et al 46 could explain the observed rejection difference of ammonium at different feed solution ph at lower ph the bidirectional diffusion of nh4 and na is reduced based on the less negative surface charge of the membrane leading to a higher rejection of ammonium ions by the abm in the case of urea the ph of the feed solution did not influence solute rejection as urea does not carry a molecular charge at the ph ranges tested as a result the changes in membrane surface charge do not affect urea rejection as molecular interactions between urea molecules and carboxyl groups of the membrane s active layer can be excluded fig 5 provides an overview of the protonation deprotonation states of carboxyl groups ammonia ammonium and urea under the three tested feed solution ph ranges and highlights pka values for all three compounds functional groups 4 conclusions rejecting urea by using abms in fo is challenging due to the small size and uncharged nature of the molecule our data suggests that draw solution molarity impacts urea rejection while ph and initial feed solution concentration do not the amount of water recovery had the largest impact on urea rejection in our study when rejection rates were calculated over mass balance eq 3 urea rejection decreased with increasing water recovery which is primarily due to the feed solution concentration increase and the declining rate of draw solution dilution over the course of the fo experiment this trend was not observable when eq 4 was used to calculate rejection rates we believe that eq 3 overall provides a more appropriate representation of membrane rejection as eq 3 bases rejection on the initial concentration of the feed stream the resulting rejection rates provide a better representation of the amount of contaminant that actually ended up in the final draw solution furthermore eq 4 can be inaccurate if contaminants adsorb on the membrane or tubing system or if the feed concentration decreases throughout the fo experiment resulting in negative rejection rates rejection of ammonia ammonium was dramatically affected by feed solution ph and did increase the lower the ph of the feed was this trend has also been observed in other studies and can be explained by the decrease of bidirectional diffusion of sodium and ammonium cations favored by the less negative charge of carboxyl groups dominating the surface of the tfc active layer at low ph 46 50 51 in order to improve ammonium rejection when using tfc based membranes feed solutions could either be adjusted to lower ph prior to the fo step or depending on application alternative draw solutions e g sugar draw solutions that prevent cation exchanges across the membrane could be considered since the rejection of ammonia ammonium at low ph was significantly higher than the rejection of urea in our experiments we further suggest future explorations of alternative strategies where urea is being hydrolyzed into ammonia ammonium prior to the fo step for example the enzyme urease could be used to cleave urea into ammonia ammonium nonetheless changes in osmotic pressure limiting water recovery must be considered acknowledgements this work was supported by a grant to se from carlsbad caverns national park

14219,urea removal from aqueous solutions is a challenge in many field applications most available technologies are either energy intensive or complicated novel membrane based processes such as forward osmosis fo present potentially desirable alternatives for energy efficient urea removal recently aquaporin based membranes abms gained attention due to their high water permeability and selectivity in this study a hollow fiber abm module was investigated for both urea and ammonia ammonium rejection under different conditions such as varying water recovery rates initial feed solute concentrations draw solution molarities and feed solution ph the amount of water recovery significantly impacted urea rejection as a result of feed concentration increase and draw dilution over time while only less than 37 of urea could be rejected for a water recovery rate of 80 the rejection of urea for water recovery rates of 25 was above 82 when rejection was calculated via overall mass balance however ammonium rejection at lower ph did exceed 90 even under high water recovery rates the increase of ammonium rejection at low ph is believed to be influenced by the decrease of bidirectional diffusion of sodium and ammonium cations favored by the less negative charge of carboxyl groups dominating the membrane surface s active layer since rejection for uncharged urea is rather poor chemical processes that transform urea into ammonia ammonium prior to the fo step should be considered in future studies to improve rejection keywords forward osmosis aquaporin based membrane hollow fiber module urea removal ammonium retention 1 introduction urea is excreted by mammals and is ubiquitous in many environments 1 2 urea is also a key molecule in many industrial synthesis pathways and can enter the environment via waste waters from industrial production facilities 2 4 effective strategies to remove urea from aqueous solutions such as urine are desirable especially in exploration of remote environments for instance water recovery from human liquid waste is necessary during long duration missions in space 5 furthermore effective strategies to remove urea from urine are desirable to minimize human impact in natural ecosystems where nitrogenous waste needs to be removed as for example during deep exploration of pristine caves 6 different methods for urea removal exist but most are still in the early stages of development 2 such strategies include hydrolysis biological and enzymatic decomposition adsorption and electrochemical oxidation 2 4 7 10 most of these technologies are either energy intense and therefore often only considerable for applications where energy consumption is not limited or require complex and segmental biological strategies 2 membrane based filtration processes such as reverse osmosis ro and nano filtration nf are possible alternative solutions ro as well as nf membranes have been studied regarding their rejection of small and uncharged molecules such as urea 11 14 however for most ro and nf membranes tested urea rejection rates did not exceed 50 13 14 furthermore high pressure filtration processes such as ro have several disadvantages including cost scaling limitations and the risk of membrane fouling 15 16 an alternative strategy to ro and nf is forward osmosis fo in fo an osmotic pressure gradient between a higher concentrated draw solution and a less concentrated feed solution is utilized to facilitate water transport across a semi permeable membrane which separates feed from draw solution and allows water molecules to pass while other solutes are being held back the osmotic pressure created by the draw solution pulls water from the feed stream through the membrane leading to the dilution of the draw solution while solutes in the feed stream are concentrated 17 since the composition of the draw solution can be tailored depending on application fo may have advantages when

not in use the membrane module was filled with di water and kept in a refrigerator at around 2 c all experiments were performed in triplicates 2 6 rejection rate calculations statistical analysis for

significant level α of 0 05 was performed for all computed rejection rates within an experimental series 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane performance the membrane module functioned above the manufacturer s specifications throughout the entire study qc tests conducted to test membrane performance in between experiments confirmed that the water flux was above the minimum standard of 12 l m2 h with an average flux of 12 41 l m2 h the specific salt flux draw solution loss per liter of output averaged 0 13 g l and was below the manufacturer s maximum value of 0 3 g l for every qc test performed 3 2 membrane rejection for urea fig 2 summarizes average rejection rates for urea depending on different parameter changes it can be seen from fig 2 a that rejection rates are similar for the different initial urea feed concentrations tested this means that within the tested concentration range about the same percentage of the initial urea amount in the feed stream passed the membrane into the draw solution we could also observe this in a recent study where an aquaporin based membrane was tested for its rejection of different trace organic contaminants 36 feed solution ph did also not have a significant impact on urea rejection fig 2 b as urea remains uncharged at all ph ranges tested and changes in molecular interactions between the membrane and the urea molecule can therefore be excluded similar rejection rates were expected overall urea rejection rates did not exceed 41 within the tested feed solution ph and initial urea feed concentration range draw solution molarity did significantly impact the rejection of urea anova p 0 0005 n 3 for values obtained from formula 3 as well as from formula 4 as shown in fig 2 c the data suggests that with increasing nacl concentration in the draw solution the rejection of urea increases reaching 52 49 se 2 29 on average if calculated using formula 4 when a 2 m nacl draw solution was being used the improvement of urea rejection with increasing draw solution concentration is most probably based on the variation of experimental time the higher the draw solution concentration the less experimental time is necessary to achieve a water recovery rate of 80 due to the higher water flux therefore less time remains for urea to pass the membrane to establish chemical equilibrium between feed and draw to test this we ran a 1 g l urea solution feed side of the membrane against di water draw side of the membrane and observed that the urea concentration in the feed decreased as the concentration in the draw increased until an equilibrium in urea concentration was obtained on both sides of the membrane our data therefore suggests that the chemical imbalance of urea between feed and draw is the primary driving force for urea flux over the membrane consequently in shorter duration experiments e g when high osmolarity draw solutions are being used less urea accumulates in the final draw solution over the course of the experiment as shown in fig 2 d changes in water recovery resulted in a significant variation of urea rejection anova p 0 0001 n 3 when rejection was calculated via overall mass balance formula 3 for a water recovery rate of 80 only 36 87 se 0 92 of urea could be rejected by the membrane on average while an average urea rejection rate of 82 91 se 2 15 could be achieved at a water recovery rate of 25 these findings suggest that a high volume reduction of urea streams is not feasible without compromising urea rejection by the membrane however when rejection rates were calculated using formula 4 urea rejection only ranged from around 43 to 44 showing no significant variation for different water recovery rates this is based on the consideration of the end feed tn concentration cfe in the denominator of formula 4 which compensates for the increase in draw solution tn concentration at higher water recovery in membrane specific studies eq 4 is usually being used to calculate rejection rates however the resulting data from eq 4 gives the impression that the tn concentration in the draw stream remained constant which was not the case as the draw solutions tn concentration increased with rising water recovery therefore formula 3 which bases rejection on overall mass balance may provide a clearer representation of overall tn rejection emphasizing the increased accumulation of tn in the draw solution at higher water recovery furthermore it has to be mentioned that rejection rates calculated by using formula 4 can be inaccurate if feed contaminants adsorb at the membrane which can result in mass imbalances due to lowered cfe values as we could observe in a recent study 36 even though modeling and experimental studies exist that describe the influence of different parameters on fo performance 42 45 we could not identify any past work that examined why solute rejection decreased with increasing water recovery rates when rejection was calculated via overall mass balance formula 3 we hypothesized that the decline in solute rejection was influenced by the solute concentration increase of the feed stream as well as the dilution of the draw stream as water flowed over the membrane over the course of the experiment to test this we set up two confirmation experiments in which we either controlled the urea concentration of the feed stream or the dilution of the nacl draw stream experimental details of these additional experiments can be found in the supplementary section the maximum feed volume reduction after the 10 min draw dilution controlled experiments averaged 83 06 se 0 21 n 3 while the water flux rate from feed to draw did not change significantly over the course of the experiment fig 3 a the tn concentration measured in the outlet reservoir of the draw stream did increase fig 3 c this trend is even more noticeable when looking at the increasing rate of tn flux from feed to draw over the course of the experiment fig 3 e the presented data therefore confirms that as a result of urea concentration increase in the feed stream data not shown the percentage of urea passing the membrane increases relatively to the transported water volume leading to an increase of tn concentration in the draw solution which resulted in lower rejection rates when calculations were done via overall mass balance it has to be mentioned that the feed concentration increase during the fo experiment should not be confused with the initial urea feed concentration fig 2 a variations in the initial feed concentration did not impact urea rejection while the increase in urea concentration in the feed stream during the experiment did this is not a contradiction as eq 3 only considers the initial feed and final draw concentration to calculate rejection thus under high water recovery rates more urea passes the membranes and accumulates in the draw solution due to the increased feed concentration the calculated ratio between the initial amount of urea in the feed stream and the final urea concentration in the draw solution does therefore decrease with increasing water recovery the results of the feed concentration controlled experiments are displayed in the right column of fig 3 it can be seen that the rate of tn flux from feed to draw only declined slightly throughout the experiment fig 3 f while the water flux rate decreased significantly as a result of draw dilution fig 3 b since therefore the water volume in the draw stream did not increase proportionally to the rate of tn flux the tn concentration in the draw stream fig 3 d increased throughout the experiment resulting in lower urea rejection if calculated using formula 3 in summary our results suggest that the decrease in mass balance based urea rejection at higher water recovery is due to the concentration increase of the feed stream as well as the declining rate in draw solution dilution over the course of the experiment overall our results show that urea rejection rates for the used membrane module are rather low especially when they are based on mass balance calculations under high water recovery rates calling into question rejection studies where relatively low water recovery rates are tested for instance a study by liu et al 23 reports 98 retention calculated using overall mass balance see formula 3 of urea for a flat sheet cta membrane however when considering the membrane size of the used membrane 29 5 cm2 the initial urine volume in the feed 0 6 l the maximum water flux from feed to draw 6 l m2 h as well as the experimental time of 2 h we calculated a water recovery rate of 5 9 such high rejection rates for urea are therefore not difficult to achieve when actual water recovery is low in a study by contés de jesús et al 22 average urea rejection rates of 94 4 were reported for a porifera flat sheet fo membrane the mentioned study however does also not contain sufficient information to allow other authors to estimate the achieved water recovery rates we suggest that more attention should be directed towards water recovery rates in fo rejection studies if rejection rates are being calculated via mass balance since high water recovery is key for most fo applications it has to be mentioned however that even for low water recovery rates urea rejection was not very high urea is however a small and uncharged molecule and its rejection based on steric hindrance and electrostatic or molecular interactions may be limited since enzymatic hydrolysis of urea into ammonium could be a feasible strategy to transform urea into a charged molecule which may enhance its rejection by the membrane we decided to also investigate the membrane s rejection capability for ammonia ammonium 3 3 membrane rejection for ammonia ammonium fig 4 shows the average rejection rates for ammonia ammonium under different feed solution ph ranges when feed solutions were adjusted to ph 9 solute rejection was only averaging 14 98 se 2 46 if calculated using formula 3 tn concentration in the feed did even decrease throughout the experiments at ph 9 this is based on the increasing water volume in the draw stream over the course of the experiment as the system tends to establish chemical equilibrium between feed and draw high amounts of ammonia have to diffuse into the draw solution to establish equal ammonia concentrations on both sides of the membrane which is enabled by the low rejection capability of the membrane at ph 9 due to the feed solute concentration decrease rejection rates were even negative when calculated using formula 4 which is based on the lower average feed concentration in the denominator in comparison to a higher average permeate concentration on the nominator of the equation we therefore set all negative rejection rates to zero star symbols in fig 4 however rejection rates increased significantly with decreasing ph anova p 0 0001 n 3 for values obtained from formula 3 as well as from formula 4 reaching 95 97 se 0 05 on average at ph 3 if rejection was calculated using formula 4 the results indicate that feed solution ph has a significant influence on the rejection rate of ammonia ammonium when using abms suggesting that ionic charge may play a role in solute rejection the ammonia ammonium ion pair has a pka of 9 25 thus at ph 9 the feed solution should also contain ammonia at ph 3 and 6 an excess of the protonated ammonium should be present due to the slightly negative charged tfc membrane molecular interactions between the membrane and ions may impact rejection as a result negatively charged anions may be repulsed from the membrane while positively charged cations such as ammonium may be attracted and immobilized to the tfc surface layer by electrostatic adhesion hindering the molecule to pass through the membrane nonetheless the proposed rejection mechanism does not explain the difference in rejection between a feed ph of 3 and 6 since both ph ranges are clearly below the pka of ammonia ammonium the protonated cation ammonium should be omnipresent in either feed solution at similar rates therefore rejection rates should also be in a similar range to explain the rejection differences changes of the membrane s surface charge at different ph levels have to be considered see table 1 for membrane zeta potentials at different ph for instance a study by lu et al 46 related the rejection of ammonia ammonium to the bidirectional diffusion of ammonium and sodium cations which is influenced by the surface chemistry of a tfc membrane the dominating functional groups of the tfc active layer are carboxyl groups with a pka value of 5 2 46 49 in feed solutions with a ph above 5 2 e g ph 6 deprotonated carboxylate groups coo dominate the membrane surface chemistry leading to a more negative surface charge while at lower ph e g ph 3 protonated carboxylic groups cooh dominate leading to a reduced negative surface charge on the membrane lu et al 46 observed an increase of bidirectional diffusion of na and nh4 cations when using a feed solution at ph 6 compared to a feed solution at ph 3 according to lu et al 46 the increase of bidirectional cation diffusion is promoted by the more negative surface charge of the tfc membrane the mechanism described by lu et al 46 could explain the observed rejection difference of ammonium at different feed solution ph at lower ph the bidirectional diffusion of nh4 and na is reduced based on the less negative surface charge of the membrane leading to a higher rejection of ammonium ions by the abm in the case of urea the ph of the feed solution did not influence solute rejection as urea does not carry a molecular charge at the ph ranges tested as a result the changes in membrane surface charge do not affect urea rejection as molecular interactions between urea molecules and carboxyl groups of the membrane s active layer can be excluded fig 5 provides an overview of the protonation deprotonation states of carboxyl groups ammonia ammonium and urea under the three tested feed solution ph ranges and highlights pka values for all three compounds functional groups 4 conclusions rejecting urea by using abms in fo is challenging due to the small size and uncharged nature of the molecule our data suggests that draw solution molarity impacts urea rejection while ph and initial feed solution concentration do not the amount of water recovery had the largest impact on urea rejection in our study when rejection rates were calculated over mass balance eq 3 urea rejection decreased with increasing water recovery which is primarily due to the feed solution concentration increase and the declining rate of draw solution dilution over the course of the fo experiment this trend was not observable when eq 4 was used to calculate rejection rates we believe that eq 3 overall provides a more appropriate representation of membrane rejection as eq 3 bases rejection on the initial concentration of the feed stream the resulting rejection rates provide a better representation of the amount of contaminant that actually ended up in the final draw solution furthermore eq 4 can be inaccurate if contaminants adsorb on the membrane or tubing system or if the feed concentration decreases throughout the fo experiment resulting in negative rejection rates rejection of ammonia ammonium was dramatically affected by feed solution ph and did increase the lower the ph of the feed was this trend has also been observed in other studies and can be explained by the decrease of bidirectional diffusion of sodium and ammonium cations favored by the less negative charge of carboxyl groups dominating the surface of the tfc active layer at low ph 46 50 51 in order to improve ammonium rejection when using tfc based membranes feed solutions could either be adjusted to lower ph prior to the fo step or depending on application alternative draw solutions e g sugar draw solutions that prevent cation exchanges across the membrane could be considered since the rejection of ammonia ammonium at low ph was significantly higher than the rejection of urea in our experiments we further suggest future explorations of alternative strategies where urea is being hydrolyzed into ammonia ammonium prior to the fo step for example the enzyme urease could be used to cleave urea into ammonia ammonium nonetheless changes in osmotic pressure limiting water recovery must be considered acknowledgements this work was supported by a grant to se from carlsbad caverns national park
