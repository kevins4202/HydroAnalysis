for the removal of malathion from aqueous solution keywords chitosan alginate malathion adsorption response surface methodology 1 introduction agricultural effluents contain highly toxic pesticides due to the excessive and uncontrolled application of these compounds as well as the diversity of plant pests strong water pollutants resulting from agricultural pesticides are often nondecomposable and carcinogenic memon et al 2008 salman et al 2011 pesticide residues in water adversely affect the aquatic ecosystem and human health in long term based on the report of the chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs only 30 of the pesticide achieves its biological objective and the remaining is in the environment it is therefore considered an environmental threat and many efforts are made to reduce and remove agricultural pesticides from water due to their adverse effects on the environment and water resources abdelhameed et al 2018 kalhor et al 2018 suo et al 2019 currently the control of residual pesticides in soil groundwater and drinking water is a real demand determining the concentration by parametric and environmental quality standards is the first step in monitoring and managing residual pesticides in water resources according to eec regulations the concentration of pesticides in drinking water should be less than 0 1 g l 1 habila et al 2015 hassani et al 2015 organophosphorus compounds such as malathion are extensively used around the world to control plat and fruit pests in agricultural lands malathion diethyl dimethoxythiophosphorylthio succinate with a molecular formula of c10h19o6ps2 and cas no 121 75 5 is a well known pesticide and its hydrolysis in alkaline media may produce highly toxic intermediate compounds in water like malaxon o o dimethyl phosphorodithioic diethyl thiomalate diethyl fumarate beta monoacid and malathion alpha kalantary et al 2016 pandey et al 2014 due to its effects on cholinesterase activity immune system central nervous system disorder adrenal glands liver and carcinogenic nature this pesticide is a serious threat to human health therefore strict rules have been imposed on using pesticides especially malathion by the food and drug administration fda and environmental protection agency epa there are also strict rules on further discharges into the environment which has led to extensive monitoring of this toxin in the environment vasseghian et al 2020 the removal of malathion from natural water resources has been recently turned into a serious challenge different methods have been reported for rapidly removing malathion from aquatic environments such as separation with various membranes sorour and shaalan 2013 electrochemical decomposition behloul et al 2013 biochemical decomposition kumar et al 2019 photocatalysis fakhri and bagheri 2020 advanced oxidation process zhang and pagilla 2010 and adsorption mojiri et al 2020 among these methods adsorption is considered an outstanding treatment technique due to the low cost ease of application eco friendliness reliability and high effectiveness various types of materials including activated carbon bouchenafa saïb et al 2012 jusoh et al 2011 multi walled carbon nanotubes dehghani et al 2017a 2017b 2017c rice husk and activated rice husk kumar et al 2014 clays and organoclays pal and vanjara 2001 ni doped tio2 nanoparticles surendra et al 2020 have been used as adsorbents for the treatment of aqueous solution from malathion among the natural and low cost adsorbents there has been recently a great interest in natural polysaccharides adsorbents such as chitosan cs a cationic polysaccharide and sodium alginate an anionic polysaccharide due to the low cost biocompatibility and eco friendliness for the removal of water pollutants godiya et al 2019 wang and zhuang 2017 yang et al 2018 cs is abundantly found in nature and obtained by the deacetylation of chitin it is a linear copolymer of n acetyl d glucosamine and d glucosamine used as a non toxic adsorbent for removing pollutants because of the amino and hydroxyl functional groups present in its structure with desirable properties and distinct biological functions such as solubility ph sensitivity increased diffusion and bio adhesivity wang and zhuang 2017 despite the favorable properties of cs as an ideal adsorbent depolymerization in acidic media low strength at ph 5 5 high swelling index low surface area and remarkable leachability are the main limitations of natural cs for the application in wastewater treatment jawad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e abd malek et al 2020 reghioua et al 2021a 2021b one of the successful treatment approaches for enhancing the chemical and structural characteristics of cs is crosslinking reaction crosslinking reaction can reduce the solubility of cs in an acidic environment as well as the swelling index and hydrophobicity in aqueous solution can be decreased jawad et al 2020a crosslinkers such as glutaraldehyde zhu et al 2010 reghioua et al 2021a 2021b epichlorohydrin chen et al 2008 ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether wan ngah et al 2002 and tripolyphosphate tpp jawad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e have been used for improving the properties of cs even though these compounds are relatively good crosslinkers there is currently a great interest in creating physical links instead of chemical ones through electrostatic forces to prevent the adverse effects of chemical crosslinking tpp is an ionic crosslinking agent which possesses many superior features such as nontoxicity high performance and solubility jawad et al 2020f its phosphate groups are linked to amine functional groups of cs tpp is often employed to enhance physicochemical feature chemical stability cs adsorption behavior by crosslinking phase without much change in the molecular structure of cs cho et al 2012 sureshkumar et al 2010 jawad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e sodium alginate is one of the linear polysaccharides that is soluble in water and is extracted from brown seaweed it contains two monomers 1 4 β l guluronate and 1 4 β dmannuronate a large number of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups distributed in its structure as active sites sodium alginate is extensively used as a polyelectrolyte biopolymer in various industries such as cosmetics pharmaceuticals and medicinal products ngah and fatinathan 2008 zhang et al 2019b alginate can produce a biopolymer through electrostatic forces between alginatecarboxylate polyanions and chitosan amine polycations the resulting biopolymer is employed as an effective adsorbent for removing pollutants from effluents bajpai 2019 dubey et al 2016 gokila et al 2017 huang et al 2018 siva kumar et al 2009 tao et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a zhao et al 2021 the most common method for determining the optimum conditions is the one factor at a time ofat approach in this method all factors are fixed except one independent parameter with individual effect on conditions it is time consuming the interaction between variables is not investigated as well as having high cost especially for performing a large number of experiments abdel rahman et al 2020 however mathematical and statistical techniques such as response surface methodology rsm are effective and can overcome these limitations rsm is used to improve and optimize the parameters for different chemical and industrial processes this method has unique potential for modeling the relationships between multiple explanatory factors and one or more responses through fewer tests and higher accuracy one of the most potent and effective experimental designs among the other response surface designs is central composite design ccd owing to its ability to quantify the variables of the quadratic model construction of sequential designs determination of lack of fit related to the model and usage of blocks hasan et al 2020 asfaram et al 2018 jawad et al 2020b 2020c in

contact time malathion concentration and adsorbent dosage were analyzed to achieve the optimal process design for removing malathion from water the ph was considered in the neutral range because malathion is decomposed in both acidic and alkaline media also due to the low thermal stability of malathion the temperature was kept constant in all experiments dehghani et al 2017a 2017b 2017c the

to evaluate its suitability in the adsorption process kumar et al 2014 the surface functional groups was investigated using ftir study of the crystalline structure of materials was carried out using xrd sem was utilized to study the surface structure of cs alginate and cs alginate bet was applied to analyze the surface area volume and pore diameter of adsorbent 3 1 1 ftir surface modification of chitosan alginate was examined by the ftir analysis fig 1 a b and c display the ftir spectra of chitosan alginate chitosan alginate respectively in fig 1 a the broad peak at 3366 57 cm 1 shows the overlap of the stretching vibrations of nh and oh the sharp peak of the stretching vibration of ch symmetrical and asymmetrical in the biopolymer is observed at 2880 39 cm 1 the peaks at 1661 91 and 1587 cm 1 are related to the nh bending vibration and co stretching vibrations of nhco amide type i respectively the peaks at 1421 32 and 1380 38 cm 1 are related to the stretching vibration of co and the cn stretching vibration respectively two polysaccharide bonds at 1153 and 1097 25 cm 1 are related to the stretching vibration of co dubey et al 2016 jawad et al 2020d 2020e in the spectra of sodium alginate fig 1b the broad peak at 3410 18 cm 1 is related to the oh stretching vibration the absorption peak at 2927 37 is attributed to ch2 groups the peaks at 1619 40 and 1418 15 cm 1 are related to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylate group coo respectively the peak at 1032 22 cm 1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of the saccharide structure of sodium alginate ionita et al 2013 in the chitosan alginate spectrum fig 1c the broad peak in the ftir spectrum of cs is shifted to 3428 89 cm 1 after reacting with alginate according to the results the carboxylate ions in alginate are connected to the positive ammonium groups in cs through electrostatic interactions to form a polyelectrolyte complex bajpai 2019 besides cs and alginate are ionotropically connected by cacl2 and sodium tripolyphosphate through electrostatic forces dubey et al 2016 sureshkumar et al 2010 the co stretching vibration in the ftir spectrum of cs is shifted from 1661 91 and 1587 cm 1 to a short peak at 1629 55 and 1464 96 cm 1 after reacting with alginate 3 1 2 x ray diffraction fig 2 a b and c display the xrd patterns of chitosan sodium alginate and chitosan alginate respectively in fig 2 a the two sharp peaks at 2θ 10 and 20 are related to the semi crystalline nature of chitosan the peak at 2θ 13 5 fig 2b shows the relatively amorphous structure of alginate ionita et al 2013 the xrd pattern of chitosan alginate shows that the peak intensity significantly decreases due to the elimination of the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and amine groups in chitosan leading to a decrease in the cs crystallinity after surface modification kanti et al 2004 kim and lee 1993 the average particle size was calculated from the debby scherrer equation from the full width at half maximum fwhm 11 d kλ β cos θ where d represents the particle size nm λ the wavelength 0 154 nm k the debby constant β the fwhm and θ is the diffraction angle the mean particle size of 106 6 nm was obtained for chitosan alginate 3 1 3 scanning electron microscopy fig 3 exhibits the sem of chitosan sodium alginate and chitosan alginate as seen cs has a non uniform rough surface with short fiber structures the non uniform geometry of the shells is related to the size of these shells alginate has a nonporous surface with cracks and wrinkles chitosan alginate has a rougher surface with more cracks and wrinkles leading to the greater percent removal of malathion by this adsorbent 3 1 4 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm analysis this analysis gives valuable information about the porous structure characterization of samples which isotherms are shown in fig 4 a the isotherm of all samples is similar to type iv isotherm that the gap between adsorption and desorption is called a hysteresis loop because of capillary condensation this resulting hysteresis loop was categorized as a combination of type h2 and h3 indicates layered or cracked mesoporous based on the iupac classification michot and villiéras 2006 powder surface area and porosity et al 2021 table 3 displays the bet and bjh values to determine the surface area and pore distribution based on table 3 the specific bet surface area decreases after surface modification indicating the occupation of some surface pores by sodium tripolyphosphate and calcium chloride leading to a reduction in the total cross sectional adsorbent area also according to iupac classification pore size can be classified as mesoporous adsorbent due to the average pore diameter of chitosan alginate was 31 188 nm 2 nm d 50 nm the pore size distribution of samples was determined using bjh method fig 4b and chitosan alginate showed a pore radius in the range of 1 2 53 nm with an average peak distribution at 14 22 nm indicating the mesoporous region also mp plot indicates a pore size distribution in the range 0 2 nm fig 4 b demonstrates that cs and alginate contain micropore structure and chitosan alginate contain the micropore structure although with a slightly smaller pore size compared to cs and alginate 3 2 optimization of adsorption process by the rsm ccd model the results obtained from 20 runs were analyzed by the rsm ccd model a good model should be selected for optimizing a response surface that may produce inappropriate results consequently the model and the impacts of the independent variables on the response are evaluated by the analysis of variance anova is a statistical technique that divides the changes in a dataset into its constituents related to certain variable sources this allows testing hypotheses based on the model parameters gönen and aksu 2008 shafeeyan et al 2012 the software selected a quadratic model and the anova for this quadratic model is reported in table 4 the significance of coefficients is specified by the f and p values in the regression model high f values indicate the greater impacts on the response and p values less than 0 05 indicate the statistical significance of an effect at a confidence level of 95 ionita et al 2013 the model f value 77 41 and a very low p value 0 0001 illustrated that the quadratic model was significant for malathion removal by chitosan alginate adsorbent according to the results the variables with the greatest impact on the malathion adsorption are the linear parameters of concentration contact time adsorbent dosage the interaction terms bc and ab and the quadratic term c2 the lack of fit f value 4 88 p value 0 053 confirms the significance of the model and a relatively negligible net error the lack of fit test facilitates the model correctness and its consistency with the experimental data ahmad et al 2009 the polynomial regression model is used for analyzing the relationship between variables and responses the experimental results were analyzed by the ccd regression analysis and the following equation eq 1 was obtained for the removal of malathion 12 y 60 26 11 44 x 1 2 12 x 2 2 62 x 3 1 99 x 1 x 2 0 835 x 1 x 3 6 14 x 2 x 3 0 14 x 1 2 0 51 x 2 2 5 30 x 3 2 the positive and negative signs in the above equation show the antagonistic and synergistic effects on malathion removal accordingly the removal efficiency increases with increasing adsorbent dosage and contact time in contrast the adsorption efficiency decreases with increasing the initial malathion concentration the r2 and adjusted r2 are equal to 0 9858 and 0 9731 respectively which are close to 1 indicating the good relationship of the experimental data and those predicted by the models moreover predicted r2 0 89 shows how a regression model predicts responses for new experimental observation a difference of 0 2 between the predicted r2 and adjusted r2 indicates a good fitness of the model adequacy precision measures the signal noise ratio the ratio should be 4 this value equal to 32 184 indicating an adequate signal the low coefficient of variation cv 3 94 and the standard deviation sd 2 20 represent the reasonable accuracy and precision of the model the low standard deviation indicates the closeness of predicted and real data fig 5 displays the diagnostic diagrams for the evaluation of the performance of the regression model fig 5 a shows the significant relationship between the experimental and predicted data in general points closer to the straight line demonstrate the higher accuracy of the model however the proposed model has reasonable accuracy the data were studied to verify the normality of the residuals the normal distribution of the residuals is depicted by a normal probability plot as observed in fig 5 b the residuals are on the straight line indicating the normal distribution of residuals the internally studentized residuals against the predicted responses fig 5c show the evenly scattering of points above and below the x axis the plot indicates the adequacy and reliability of the fitted model in general the cook s distance should be less than 1 as shown in fig 5 d all values are less than 1 the cook s distance r4 r5 r6 r9 r10 r11 r14 r19 and r2 are relatively zero indicating the significant effect on the predictive power of the model the perturbation diagram estimates the effect of perturbation of each variable on the process around the reference point each variable shows a different perturbed behavior around the reference point a initial concentration 15 mg l 1 b time 15 min and c dose 0 15 g in the removal of malathion as observed in fig 5 e as the initial concentration increases the percent removal decreases however the percent removal increases with increasing the contact time and adsorbent dosage this diversity indicates the effect of each parameter and its sensitivity to the removal of malathion from the aqueous media using chitosan alginate 3 3 3d and countor plot response surface three dimensional diagrams and contours help to clarify the effect of independent variables on the responses at different points through finding the reference cross points among the variables the exact value of the measured characteristic i e the response can be found and recorded the slope of the diagram indicates the interaction of process variables fig 6 a shows the interaction impact of the malathion contact time and initial concentration at a constant adsorption dosage for the percent removal of malathion the removal efficiency of malathion was dependent on the initial concentration of malathion and in general the removal efficiency decreases by increasing the initial concentration of the pesticide this is due to more pore available on the adsorbent surface in low concentration on the other hand at high concentrations the active sites on the adsorbent surface are saturated and the removal percentage is reduced gupta et al 2011 kumar et al 2014 contact time is of the critical parameters for cost effective treatment of wastewater processes removal of contaminants usually increases with the increased contact time until the equilibrium state is reached mojiri et al 2020 according to most studies on removing organophosphorus pesticides the removal efficiency increases with increasing contact time dehghani et al 2017a 2017b 2017c as it can be seen in fig 6 a malathion is rapidly removed in the first 15 min and the removal is then slowly reduced and also it is observed that increasing the initial malathion concentration from 5 to 25 mg l 1 reduced the removal rate from 81 53 to 38 86 which is because the vacant active sites of the adsorbent decrease over time and the surface is saturated the saturation of the adsorbent surface at a high malathion concentration is the main cause of this process besides at a high concentration more malathion ions remain unabsorbed in a certain solution volume and so malathion removal efficiency decreases this means that in a low concentration of malathion ions the ratio of initial malathion ions adsorbent surface area is low hence malathion ions are adsorbed by the active sites and the removal of malathion ions is enhanced dehghani et al 2019 the interaction of the initial malathion concentration and adsorbent dosage in fig 6 b proves that the removal percentage is reduced with increasing concentration of the initial malathion in contrast the percent removal increases with increasing the adsorbent dosage the adsorbent dose is a key parameter in quantitatively determining the pollutant removal selected in the adsorption processes mojiri et al 2020 as the adsorbent dose increased from 0 05 to 0 25 g malathion removal efficiency enhanced increasing the removal efficiency due to the increased level of adsorbent leads to increased access of adsorbate molecules to adsorption sites nevertheless an extra increase after a particular dose does not increase adsorption this may be due to interference between adsorbent dose binding sites this result is in agreement with the works of kumar et al kumar et al 2014 taking into account the simultaneous effect of the contact time and adsorbent dosage the removal percentage increases with increasing adsorbent dosage and contact time as seen in fig 6 c so higher malathion removal values are achieved by a simultaneous increase in polymer dosage and contact time nevertheless the maximum contact time and dosage are not needed in maximizing the malathion removal efficiency increasing the adsorbent dose during prolonged contact time results in the formation of glomeration of polymer particles and screening effect leading to reduced total surface area of the polymer and consequently reduced efficiency of malathion removal kalantary et al 2016 besides the lower value and contact time of the adsorbent dosage are favorable economically 3 4 adsorption process optimization the desirability function of 1 0 0 0 was used to define the maximum removal efficiency of malathion and the optimal values of the independent variables the optimal conditions for the removal of malathion were obtained at the initial malathion concentration 10 mg l 1 contact time 20 min and adsorbent dosage 0 18 g a maximum removal percentage of 78 40 was predicted under optimal conditions fig 7 experiments were repeated three times to confirm the optimization and analyze the results against the predicted results according to the results the observed result 82 36 is close to that predicted by the model 78 40 confirming the good performance of the model 3 5 adsorption isotherms isotherm models are of great importance for predicting and comparing the adsorption mechanisms the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms were utilized for adsorbing malathion on chitosan alginate the parameters for all isotherms and corresponding correlation coefficients with experimental values are shown in table 5 the langmuir model is valid for the monolayer adsorption on an adsorbent with a limited capacity it is also assumed there is not any interaction between the adsorbed molecules in other words when a malathion molecule occupies a site no other molecule is adsorbed on that site furthermore the adsorption energy is evenly distributed on the whole surface ghorbani et al 2008 s e and thinakaran 2017 the freundlich model is an empirical equation that explains non ideal reversible adsorption processes based on this model adsorption takes place on a heterogeneous surface with the nonuniform distribution of the adsorption heat on the surface dubey et al 2016 yu et al 2010 the temkin model considers the interactions of the adsorbent and adsorbed species the adsorption heat for all molecules in each layer is assumed to linearly decrease as a result of the adsorbate adsorbent interaction moreover the adsorption process is specified with a uniform distribution of binding energies dubey et al 2016 s e and thinakaran 2017 as indicated in table 5 and fig 8 the langmuir model with a larger r2 is best fitted to the experimental data as compared with the temkin and freundlich models the value of rl was 0 38 this represented that adsorption of malathion on chitosan alginate is favorable freundlich constant was larger than unity n 3 83 indicates chemisorption of malathion in the temkin model the high value of bt and the low value of kt related to the highest sorption of malathion at the initial level and a weak bonding of malathion on the adsorbent respectively kumar et al 2014 according to the results the langmuir model implies the monolayer adsorption of malathion on the adsorbent surface these results are in agreement with the works of kalantary et al kalantary et al 2016 and kumar et al kumar et al 2014 3 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetic is a key factor for realizing the relation between contact time and adsorption capacity the adsorption kinetics is dependent on the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent affecting the adsorption mechanism kumar et al 2014 in this investigation the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were employed for explaining the malathion adsorption kinetics on chitosan alginate the pseudo first order kinetic model is on the basis of solid capacity based on this model diffusion takes place into a layer and adsorption varies with time proportional to the vacant sites on the adsorbent surface kumar et al 2014 according to the pseudo second order model chemical adsorption is the limiting step controlling the surface adsorption processes this model is also on the basis of the solid phase where the sites are occupied proportional to the square of the number of vacant sites kumar et al 2014 based on table 6 and fig 9 the calculated qe value from pseudo first order model was 6 605 which is not in agreement with the experimental value 0 82 moreover r2 was found to be low 0 92 that it shows malathion adsorption on chitosan alginate does not perfectly fit the pseudo first order kinetics for the second order kinetics the qe is closer to the experimental data 0 823 as seen from the linear regression coefficients r2 0 99 the adsorption of malathion on chitosan alginate was better to describe by the pseudo second order kinetic model than by the pseudo first order model in addition chemical sorption was the rate limiting step of the adsorption process due to the pseudo second order kinetic model that is consistent with the assumption thus chemical interaction is probably involved in the adsorption processes most studies have reported pseudo second order models for adsorption of malathion onto different adsorbent that conforms to the conclusions of this report kalantary et al 2016 kumar et al 2014 3 7 mechanism of adsorption fig 10 shows the possible interaction between malathion on chitosan alginate owing to the present positive and negative ions in cs and alginate these two biopolymers are held by tripolyphosphate ions and calcium ions on the other hand the malathion is bound to the nitrogen atoms of the amine group related to the cs 3 8 reusability of adsorbent the adsorbent recycling is one of the main important cases for decreasing costs and waste production fig 11 represents the removal efficiency of chitosan alginate versus cycles five successive cycles as shown this adsorbent has high ability after five removal process for the reusability 3 9 comparison of various adsorbents the qmax removal percentage and contact time related to the various adsorbents were assessed to remove some pollutants from aqueous solutions table 7 it can be concluded that chitosan alginate has a high ability to remove contaminant in less time 20 min in the other adsorbents more time was spent to achieve high adsorption capacity 4 conclusion in this study chitosan alginate was prepared through crosslinking sodium tripolyphosphate and calcium chloride to improve its stability the synthesized adsorbent was employed for removing malathion from aqueous media characterization of synthesized adsorbent was studied using sem bet xrd and ftir the optimization of variables including contact time adsorbent dosage and malathion concentration as well as their effect on the removal of malathion were investigated by ccd the second order model was selected for this process it was found that the proposed model has high ability for predicting removal percentage the results showed that the interactions between the contact time and initial concentration as well as between the adsorbent dosage and contact time were more significant with a p value less than 0 05 three isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and temkin were assessed that the malathion adsorption has a high r2 with langmuir model kinetic models including pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were examined and results revealed that the adsorption was well fitted with the pseudo second order the present research demonstrated that chitosan alginate could be as a cost effectiveness and nature friendly adsorbent with low contact time and high efficiency for malathion removal from aqueous solution declaration of competing interest nazanin sabbagh kambiz tahvildari amir abdolah mehrdad sharif declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

for the removal of malathion from aqueous solution keywords chitosan alginate malathion adsorption response surface methodology 1 introduction agricultural effluents contain highly toxic pesticides due to the excessive and uncontrolled application of these compounds as well as the diversity of plant pests strong water pollutants resulting from agricultural pesticides are often nondecomposable and carcinogenic memon et al 2008 salman et al 2011 pesticide residues in water adversely affect the aquatic ecosystem and human health in long term based on the report of the chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs only 30 of the pesticide achieves its biological objective and the remaining is in the environment it is therefore considered an environmental threat and many efforts are made to reduce and remove agricultural pesticides from water due to their adverse effects on the environment and water resources abdelhameed et al 2018 kalhor et al 2018 suo et al 2019 currently the control of residual pesticides in soil groundwater and drinking water is a real demand determining the concentration by parametric and environmental quality standards is the first step in monitoring and managing residual pesticides in water resources according to eec regulations the concentration of pesticides in drinking water should be less than 0 1 g l 1 habila et al 2015 hassani et al 2015 organophosphorus compounds such as malathion are extensively used around the world to control plat and fruit pests in agricultural lands malathion diethyl dimethoxythiophosphorylthio succinate with a molecular formula of c10h19o6ps2 and cas no 121 75 5 is a well known pesticide and its hydrolysis in alkaline media may produce highly toxic intermediate compounds in water like malaxon o o dimethyl phosphorodithioic diethyl thiomalate diethyl fumarate beta monoacid and malathion alpha kalantary et al 2016 pandey et al 2014 due to its effects on cholinesterase activity immune system central nervous system disorder adrenal glands liver and carcinogenic nature this pesticide is a serious threat to human health therefore strict rules have been imposed on using pesticides especially malathion by the food and drug administration fda and environmental protection agency epa there are also strict rules on further discharges into the environment which has led to extensive monitoring of this toxin in the environment vasseghian et al 2020 the removal of malathion from natural water resources has been recently turned into a serious challenge different methods have been reported for rapidly removing malathion from aquatic environments such as separation with various membranes sorour and shaalan 2013 electrochemical decomposition behloul et al 2013 biochemical decomposition kumar et al 2019 photocatalysis fakhri and bagheri 2020 advanced oxidation process zhang and pagilla 2010 and adsorption mojiri et al 2020 among these methods adsorption is considered an outstanding treatment technique due to the low cost ease of application eco friendliness reliability and high effectiveness various types of materials including activated carbon bouchenafa saïb et al 2012 jusoh

surendra et al 2020 have been used as adsorbents for the treatment of aqueous solution from malathion among the natural and low cost adsorbents there has been recently a great interest in natural polysaccharides adsorbents such as chitosan cs a cationic polysaccharide and sodium alginate an anionic polysaccharide due to the low cost biocompatibility and eco friendliness for the removal of water pollutants godiya et al 2019 wang and zhuang 2017 yang et al 2018 cs is abundantly found in nature and obtained by the deacetylation of chitin it is a linear copolymer of n acetyl d glucosamine and d glucosamine used as a non toxic adsorbent for removing pollutants because of the amino and hydroxyl functional groups present in its structure with desirable properties and distinct biological functions such as solubility ph sensitivity increased diffusion and bio adhesivity wang and zhuang 2017 despite the favorable properties of cs as an ideal adsorbent depolymerization in acidic media low strength at ph 5 5 high swelling index low surface area and remarkable leachability are the main limitations of natural cs for the application in wastewater treatment jawad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e abd malek et al 2020 reghioua et al 2021a 2021b one of the successful treatment approaches for enhancing the chemical and structural characteristics of cs is crosslinking reaction crosslinking reaction can reduce the solubility of cs in an acidic environment as well as the swelling index and hydrophobicity in aqueous solution can be decreased jawad et al 2020a crosslinkers such as glutaraldehyde zhu et al 2010 reghioua et al 2021a 2021b epichlorohydrin chen et al 2008 ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether wan ngah et al 2002 and tripolyphosphate tpp jawad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e have been used for improving the properties of cs even though these compounds are relatively good crosslinkers there is currently a great interest in creating physical links instead of chemical ones through electrostatic forces to prevent the adverse effects of chemical crosslinking tpp is an ionic crosslinking agent which possesses many superior features such as nontoxicity high performance and solubility jawad et al 2020f its phosphate groups are linked to amine functional groups of cs tpp is often employed to enhance physicochemical feature chemical stability cs adsorption behavior by crosslinking phase without much change in the molecular structure of cs cho et al 2012 sureshkumar et al 2010 jawad et al 2020a 2020b 2020c 2020d 2020e sodium alginate is one of the linear

fatinathan 2008 zhang et al 2019b alginate can produce a biopolymer through electrostatic forces between alginatecarboxylate polyanions and chitosan amine polycations the resulting biopolymer is employed as an effective adsorbent for removing pollutants from effluents bajpai 2019 dubey et al 2016 gokila et al 2017 huang et al 2018 siva kumar et al 2009 tao et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a zhao et al 2021 the most common method for determining the optimum conditions is the one factor at a time ofat approach in this method all factors are fixed except one independent parameter with individual effect on conditions it is time consuming the interaction between variables is not investigated as well as having high cost especially for performing a large number of experiments abdel rahman et al 2020 however mathematical and statistical techniques such as response surface methodology rsm are effective and can overcome these limitations rsm is used to improve and optimize the parameters for different chemical and industrial processes this method has unique potential for modeling the relationships between multiple explanatory factors and one or more responses through

of alginate ionita et al 2013 the xrd pattern of chitosan alginate shows that the peak intensity significantly decreases due to the elimination of the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and amine groups in chitosan leading to a decrease in the cs crystallinity after surface modification kanti et al 2004 kim and lee 1993 the average particle size was calculated from the debby scherrer equation from the full width at half maximum fwhm 11 d kλ β cos θ where d represents the particle size nm λ the wavelength 0 154 nm k the debby constant β the fwhm and θ is the diffraction angle the mean

rough surface with short fiber structures the non uniform geometry of the shells is related to the size of these shells alginate has a nonporous surface with cracks and wrinkles chitosan alginate has a rougher surface with more cracks and wrinkles leading to the greater percent removal of malathion by this adsorbent 3 1 4 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm analysis this analysis gives valuable information about the porous structure characterization of samples which isotherms are shown in fig 4 a the isotherm of all samples is similar to type iv isotherm that the gap between adsorption and desorption is called a hysteresis loop because of capillary condensation this resulting hysteresis loop was categorized as a combination of type h2 and h3 indicates layered or cracked mesoporous based on the iupac classification michot and villiéras 2006 powder surface area and porosity et al 2021 table 3 displays the bet and bjh values to determine the surface area and pore distribution based on table 3 the specific bet surface area decreases after surface modification indicating the occupation of some surface pores by sodium tripolyphosphate and calcium chloride leading to a reduction in the total cross sectional adsorbent area also according to iupac classification pore size can be classified as mesoporous adsorbent due to the average pore diameter of chitosan alginate was 31 188 nm 2 nm d 50 nm the pore size distribution of samples was determined using bjh method fig 4b and chitosan alginate showed a pore radius in the range of 1 2 53 nm with an average peak distribution at 14 22 nm

analyzed by the rsm ccd model a good model should be selected for optimizing a response surface that may produce inappropriate results consequently the model and the impacts of the independent variables on the response are evaluated by the analysis of variance anova is a statistical technique that divides the changes in a dataset into its constituents related to certain variable sources this allows testing hypotheses based on the model parameters gönen and aksu 2008 shafeeyan et al 2012 the software selected a quadratic model and the anova for this quadratic model is reported in table 4 the significance of coefficients is specified by the f and p values in the regression model high f values indicate the greater impacts on the response and p values less than 0 05 indicate the statistical significance of an effect at a confidence level of 95 ionita et al 2013 the model f value 77 41 and a very low p value 0 0001 illustrated that the quadratic model was significant for malathion removal by chitosan alginate adsorbent according to the results the variables with the greatest impact on the malathion adsorption are the linear parameters of concentration contact time adsorbent dosage the interaction terms bc and ab and the quadratic term c2 the lack of fit f value 4 88 p value 0 053 confirms the significance of the model and a relatively negligible net error the lack of fit test facilitates the model correctness and its consistency with the experimental data ahmad et al 2009 the polynomial regression model is used for analyzing the relationship between variables and responses the experimental results were analyzed by the ccd regression analysis and the following equation eq 1 was obtained for the removal of malathion 12 y 60 26 11 44 x 1 2 12 x 2 2 62 x 3 1 99 x 1 x 2 0 835 x 1 x 3 6 14 x 2 x 3 0 14 x 1 2 0 51 x 2 2 5 30 x 3 2 the positive and negative signs in the above equation show the antagonistic and synergistic effects on malathion removal accordingly the removal efficiency increases with increasing adsorbent dosage and contact time in contrast the adsorption efficiency decreases with increasing the initial malathion concentration the r2 and adjusted r2 are equal to 0 9858 and 0 9731 respectively which are close to 1 indicating the good relationship of the experimental data and those predicted by the models moreover predicted r2 0 89 shows how a regression model predicts responses for new experimental observation a difference of 0 2 between the predicted r2 and adjusted r2 indicates a good fitness of the model adequacy precision measures the signal noise ratio the ratio should be 4 this value equal to 32 184 indicating an adequate signal the low coefficient of variation cv 3 94 and the standard deviation sd 2 20 represent the reasonable accuracy and precision of the model the low standard deviation indicates the closeness of predicted and real data fig 5 displays the diagnostic diagrams for the evaluation of the performance of the regression model fig 5 a shows the significant relationship between the experimental and predicted data in general points closer to the straight line demonstrate the higher accuracy of the model however the proposed model has reasonable accuracy the data were studied to verify the normality of the residuals the normal distribution of the residuals is depicted by a normal probability plot as observed in fig 5 b the residuals are on the straight line indicating the normal distribution of residuals the internally studentized residuals against the predicted responses fig 5c show the evenly scattering of points above and below the x axis the plot indicates the adequacy and reliability of the fitted model in general the cook s distance should be less than 1 as shown in fig 5 d all values are less than 1 the cook s distance r4 r5 r6 r9 r10 r11 r14 r19 and r2 are relatively zero indicating the significant effect on the predictive power of the model the perturbation diagram estimates the effect of perturbation of each variable on the process around the reference point each variable shows a different perturbed behavior around the reference point a initial concentration 15 mg l 1 b time 15 min and c dose 0 15 g in the removal of malathion as observed in fig 5 e as the initial concentration increases the percent removal decreases however the percent removal increases with increasing the contact time and adsorbent dosage this diversity indicates the effect of each parameter and its sensitivity to the removal of malathion from the aqueous media using chitosan alginate 3 3 3d and countor plot response surface three dimensional diagrams and contours help to clarify the effect of independent variables on the responses at different points through finding the reference cross points among the variables the exact value of the measured characteristic i e the response can be found and recorded the slope of the diagram indicates the interaction of process variables fig 6 a shows the interaction impact of the malathion contact time and initial concentration at a constant adsorption dosage for the percent removal of malathion the removal efficiency of malathion was dependent on the initial concentration of malathion and in general the removal efficiency decreases by increasing the initial concentration of the pesticide this is due to more pore available on the adsorbent surface in low concentration on the other hand at high concentrations the active sites on the adsorbent surface are saturated and the removal percentage is reduced gupta et al 2011 kumar et al 2014 contact time is of the critical parameters for cost effective treatment of wastewater processes removal of contaminants usually increases with the increased contact time until the equilibrium state is reached mojiri et al 2020 according to most studies on removing organophosphorus pesticides the removal efficiency increases with increasing contact time dehghani et al 2017a 2017b 2017c as it can be seen in fig 6 a malathion is rapidly removed in the first 15 min and the removal is then slowly reduced and also it is observed that increasing the initial malathion concentration from 5 to 25 mg l 1 reduced the removal rate from 81 53 to 38 86 which is because the vacant active sites of the adsorbent decrease over time and the surface is saturated the saturation of the adsorbent surface at a high malathion concentration is the main cause of this process besides at a high concentration more malathion ions remain unabsorbed in a certain solution volume and so malathion removal efficiency decreases this means that in a low concentration of malathion ions the ratio of initial malathion ions adsorbent surface area is low hence malathion ions are adsorbed by the active sites and the removal of malathion ions is enhanced dehghani et al 2019 the interaction of the initial malathion concentration and adsorbent dosage in fig 6 b proves that the removal percentage is reduced with increasing concentration of the initial malathion in contrast the percent removal increases with increasing the adsorbent dosage the adsorbent dose is a key parameter in quantitatively determining the pollutant removal selected in the adsorption processes mojiri et al 2020 as the adsorbent dose increased from 0 05 to 0 25 g malathion removal efficiency enhanced increasing the removal efficiency due to the increased level of adsorbent leads to increased access of adsorbate molecules to adsorption sites nevertheless an extra increase after a particular dose does not increase adsorption this may be due to interference between adsorbent dose binding sites this result is in agreement with the works of kumar et al kumar et al 2014 taking into account the simultaneous effect of the contact time and adsorbent dosage the removal percentage increases with increasing adsorbent dosage and contact time as seen in fig 6 c so higher malathion removal values are achieved by a simultaneous increase in polymer dosage and contact time nevertheless the maximum contact time and dosage are not needed in maximizing the malathion removal efficiency increasing the adsorbent dose during prolonged contact time results in the formation of glomeration of polymer particles and screening effect leading to reduced total surface area of the polymer and consequently reduced efficiency of malathion removal kalantary et al 2016 besides the lower value and contact time of the adsorbent dosage are favorable economically 3 4 adsorption process optimization the desirability function of 1 0 0 0 was used to define the maximum removal efficiency of malathion and the optimal values of the independent variables the optimal conditions for the removal of malathion were obtained at the initial malathion concentration 10 mg l 1 contact time 20 min and adsorbent dosage 0 18 g a maximum removal percentage of 78 40 was predicted under optimal conditions fig 7 experiments were repeated three times to confirm the optimization and analyze the results against the predicted results according to the results the observed result 82 36 is close to that predicted by the model 78 40 confirming the good performance of the model 3 5 adsorption isotherms isotherm models are of great importance for predicting and comparing the adsorption mechanisms the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms were utilized for adsorbing malathion on chitosan alginate the parameters for all isotherms and corresponding correlation coefficients with experimental values are shown in table 5 the langmuir model is valid for the monolayer adsorption on an adsorbent with a limited capacity it is also assumed there is not any interaction between the adsorbed molecules in other words when a malathion molecule occupies a site no other molecule is adsorbed on that site furthermore the adsorption energy is evenly distributed on the whole surface ghorbani et al 2008 s e and thinakaran 2017 the freundlich model is an empirical equation that explains non ideal reversible adsorption processes based on this model adsorption takes place on a heterogeneous surface with the nonuniform distribution of the adsorption heat on the surface dubey et al 2016 yu et al 2010 the temkin model considers the interactions of the adsorbent and adsorbed species the adsorption heat for all molecules in each layer is assumed to linearly decrease as a result of the adsorbate adsorbent interaction moreover the adsorption process is specified with a uniform distribution of binding energies dubey et al 2016 s e and thinakaran 2017 as indicated in table 5 and fig 8 the langmuir model with a larger r2 is best fitted to the experimental data as compared with the temkin and freundlich models the value of rl was 0 38 this represented that adsorption of malathion on chitosan alginate is favorable freundlich constant was larger than unity n 3 83 indicates chemisorption of malathion in the temkin model the high value of bt and the low value of kt related to the highest sorption of malathion at the initial level and a weak bonding of malathion on the adsorbent respectively kumar et al 2014 according to the results the langmuir model implies the monolayer adsorption of malathion on the adsorbent surface these results are in agreement with the works of kalantary et al kalantary et al 2016 and kumar et al kumar et al 2014 3 6 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetic is a key factor for realizing the relation between contact time and adsorption capacity the adsorption kinetics is dependent on the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent affecting the adsorption mechanism kumar et al 2014 in this investigation the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were employed for explaining the malathion adsorption kinetics on chitosan alginate the pseudo first order kinetic model is on the basis of solid capacity based on this model diffusion takes place into a layer and adsorption varies with time proportional to the vacant sites on the adsorbent surface kumar et al 2014 according to the pseudo second order model chemical adsorption is the limiting step controlling the surface adsorption processes this model is also on the basis of the solid phase where the sites are occupied proportional to the square of the number of vacant sites kumar et al 2014 based on table 6 and fig 9 the calculated qe value from pseudo first order model was 6 605 which is not in agreement with the experimental value 0 82 moreover r2 was found to be low 0 92 that it shows malathion adsorption on chitosan alginate does not perfectly fit the pseudo first order kinetics for the second order kinetics the qe is closer to the experimental data 0 823 as seen from the linear regression coefficients r2 0 99 the adsorption of malathion on chitosan alginate was better to describe by the pseudo second order kinetic model than by the pseudo first order model in addition chemical sorption was the rate limiting step of the adsorption process due to the pseudo second order kinetic model that is consistent with the assumption thus chemical interaction is probably involved in the adsorption processes most studies have reported pseudo second order models for adsorption of malathion onto different adsorbent that conforms to the conclusions of this report kalantary et al 2016 kumar et al 2014 3 7 mechanism of adsorption fig 10 shows the possible interaction between malathion on chitosan alginate owing to the present positive and negative ions in cs and alginate these two biopolymers are held by tripolyphosphate ions and calcium ions on the other hand the malathion is bound to the nitrogen atoms of the amine group related to the cs 3 8 reusability of adsorbent the adsorbent recycling is one of the main important cases for decreasing costs and waste production fig 11 represents the removal efficiency of chitosan alginate versus cycles five successive cycles as shown this adsorbent has high ability after five removal process for the reusability 3 9 comparison of various adsorbents the qmax removal percentage and contact time related to the various adsorbents were assessed to remove some pollutants from aqueous solutions table 7 it can be concluded that chitosan alginate has a high ability to remove contaminant in less time 20 min in the other adsorbents more time was spent to achieve high adsorption capacity 4 conclusion in this study chitosan alginate was prepared through crosslinking sodium tripolyphosphate and calcium chloride to improve its stability the synthesized adsorbent was employed for removing malathion from aqueous media characterization of synthesized adsorbent was studied using sem bet xrd and ftir the optimization of variables including contact time adsorbent dosage and malathion concentration as well as their effect on the removal of malathion were investigated by ccd the second order model was selected for this process it was found that the proposed model has high ability for predicting removal percentage the results showed that the interactions between the contact time and initial concentration as well as between the adsorbent dosage and contact time were more significant with a p value less than 0 05 three isotherm models including langmuir freundlich and temkin were assessed that the malathion adsorption has a high r2 with langmuir model kinetic models including pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were examined and results revealed that the adsorption was well fitted with the pseudo second order the present research demonstrated that chitosan alginate could be as a cost effectiveness and nature friendly adsorbent with low contact time and high efficiency for malathion removal from aqueous solution declaration of competing interest nazanin sabbagh kambiz tahvildari amir abdolah mehrdad sharif declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
1406,many uncertain factors exist in the water resource systems leading to dynamic characteristics of the water distribution process especially for the watershed including irrigation area with multiple water sources and water users it is complicated that the joint risk among available water from each water source and multi uncertainties under water resource allocation among multiple water users in this research an approach is developed that a copula based interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming cimfsp model this research aims at figuring out the planning of a case study for water resources management in the multi sources water supply subsystem the copula function is introduced to tackle the interaction of water availability between two water sources i e a b joint risk

resource distribution in a multi users water demand subsystem through this model uncertainties presented as interval numbers and probability distributions as well as fuzzy sets were handled the dynamics of the entire water resource system can be reflected by multi stage discrete trees a series of solutions can be generated under multiple scenarios i e joint risk and α cut levels the modeling results will produce a series of alternatives under a battery of scenarios and help the decision makers get an insight into the tradeoff between the system economic benefit and financial penalties under the corresponding risk level this approach is valuable for improving the feasibility of optimal results in the watershed with irrigation region water resource management keywords water resource system multi stage stochastic analysis coupled risk fuzzy sets irrigation 1 introduction water resources are the foundation of strategic economic and natural resources and then become the guarantee of global sustainable development when insufficient water resources meet rising water consumption over withdrawal of water resources and associated ecological environmental degradation would occur wang cui and li 2012 therefore it is a worldwide issue that how to maintain the balance of the entire water system generally water resources availability was particularly critical since the demands from multiple sectors were rapidly increasing in many regions of the past years li huang huang and zhou 2009 at present water resources management is mainly based on a statistical analysis of hydrological data luis carlos miguel carlo and denise 2019 system analysis techniques can help distribute water in a highly efficient manner which may achieve an ideal compromise between required environmental goals and maximized system benefits he et al 2008 however system components such as stream flows and water allocation targets have complexities and uncertainties huang and loucks 2008 therefore it is desired to develop effective optimization methods to support water resources management water resources management with multiple water sources and end users is thus expected to facilitate sustainable economic development in specific river basins along with rapid socio economic development and urbanization all water demand sectors have become increasingly dependent on sufficient water resources supply bonaccorso cancelliere and rossi 2003 fu li cui liu and lu 2017 at the same time exploitation of any new water sources is extremely difficult in many river basins due to the increasing environmental awareness li et al 2017 to address the uncertainties and complexities of water allocation systems with multiple water sources a growing number of uncertainty analyzing theories methods were used for optimal water allocation wang and huang 2013 for instance many scholars applied stochastic and fuzzy mathematical programming to deal with both fuzziness and randomness of water resources management systems dai li and huang 2011 dong tan huang et al 2014 cheng huang and dong 2015 huang li xiao et al 2015 chen huang fan et al 2016 durodié 2017 moradi and limaei 2018 elleuch anane euchi and frikha 2019 through the introduction of interval mathematical programming many methods were also developed to tackle further uncertainties expressed as intervals cai et al 2009 combined interval numbers fuzzy mathematics and two stage stochastic programming to establish a water resources management model under mixed uncertainties tan et al 2009 applied the interval two stage planning model to optimize the allocation of water resources among multiple users in the sanjiang plain they provided some reference schemes to analyze the uncertainties of water resource systems tan et al 2010a combined two stage planning with fuzzy stochastic programming and optimized analysis based on the combined water pairing of multiple water sources for each crop researchers have discovered that multi stage programming can provide makeup policies for the inherent shortcomings of many previous methods and its main advantage is that it cannot only simulate the decision making process the dynamics of defining the situation the high dimension of the situations but also reflect above these characteristics a novel multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming mfsp model was developed for regional energy systems optimization and planning considering energy water nexus under multiple uncertainties ji zhang huang and wang 2020 moreover plenty of complexities and uncertainties are associated with relevant factors and processes of water resources systems posing significant challenges for water managers and decision makers at multiple scales generally there are multiple water sources within the water supply system it is essential to analyze the interactive relationships between water availability from different water source areas and quantify the coupled risk to control water scarcity zhang and li 2014 in the multi source water optimal allocation there was an increasing intensity of uncertainties compared with a single source water allocation problem the total available water in the supply water subsystem comes from multiple water source areas mainly open water from every water source varies from season to season giving rise to float in water availability and would exert a strong influence on the total amount of available water in the multi source water supply system the mutual interaction of these water resources makes the whole water resources system more probabilistic and more complicated it is necessary for the exchange and the joint shortage risk analysis of water availability from each water resource area within the water supply subsystem the dynamic and complex interaction in water resources systems cannot be easily characterized and modeled to effectively reflect and handle system response under multiple risk control settings wang li guo zhang and guo 2020 developed a risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming rfitswmp model to optimize water consumption within a water resources system multi water sources allocation risk is the possibility that multi water source allocation could hardly realize the expected effects under the influence of supply and demand of water engineering and management strategies and many other uncertain factors quantitative analysis of the combined risk of water supply in multiple water source systems and the interactive relationship among water availability from the multi resource area provides a basis for subsequent optimal allocation of water resources generally the purpose of risk analysis is to pre assess the undertaken risk of the system for achieving any desired goals which can help decision makers improve the follow up measures in advance to ensure the safety and reliability of decision making processes durodié 2017 however many approaches take into account a series of uncertainties and different resource shortage risk scenarios they have the following shortages including interaction in the subsystem interaction between water availability from diverse water resources joint risk scenario and dynamic changes during configuration on the actual conditions therefore that must develop a water resources allocation model based on the combined water shortage risk of multiple water sources systems under uncertainty for providing a decision basis for water resources managers therefore in this research we aim to develop an allocation model based on interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming with coupled risk analyzing model to optimize water resource allocation within the entire water resources system with multi source multi users a case study will be provided to demonstrating the applicability of the developed model in detail this study will a construct a joint risk model based on copula theory to respond to the interaction of various water recourses in the water supply subsystem b formulate an interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming model which reflects uncertainties expressed as intervals probability distributions and fuzzy sets and c formulate a cimfsp model to optimize water resources allocation in the entire water resources system the following innovations will be associated with the research including a quantify the joint risk within multiple water supply subsystems b reflect the dynamic decision making process of water resources allocation in every planning period under discrete multi scenarios the results will be used for coming into being a range of decision alternatives under diverse system conditions and then help decision makers determine the water resources management policies needed under uncertain conditions 2 overview of multiple water demands we aim to program sustainable water resources management in multiple water sources area in this research the c city is chosen as a typical ecological city the total amount of available water mainly comes from two sources i e source a source b in the water supply subsystem the public water in the city is the sum of the water availability from a and b the dynamic changes of the available water in each water source will cause the shortage risk in the water resource system at any time in this research a typical water supply subsystem like this is called the a b nexus abn system to maximize the total net benefits define available water in the abn system and calculate how much water is released to the downstream users in this research consider an unregulated river is made to release water to five downstream users ecological sector agricultural sector industrial sector service sector and domestic sector the ministry of ecological environment is mainly targeted at urban environmental water demand and rural ecological water demand water demand in the agricultural sector is mainly used for farmland irrigation forestry animal husbandry fishing and livestock water demand in the industrial sector is primarily used for industry and construction water demand in the service sector is mainly used for entertainment catering etc the domestic water sector mainly targets urban residents domestic water demand and rural residents domestic water demand the water resources system is shown in fig 1 for the study the planning time horizon is 12 years divided into three planning periods 4 4 4 the water availability from two river basins is shown in table 1 a is nanpanjing bain b is yuanjiang basin the available water resources in each water source area were obtained based on the historical data meanwhile the related probability of occurrence in each period was got in table 2 table 3 shows the target values of multiple water users in three planning horizons are pre regulated by decision makers and minimum demands by analyzing the typical city s governmental reports and public surveys c city comprehensively the related benefits and penalties are presented in terms of fuzzy sets with known triangle membership functions based on the analysis of economic data in table 4 3 method and materials the model divides the water resources system into a water supply subsystem and a water demand subsystem in the water supply subsystem the copula function is introduced to quantify the complicated joint risks of inbound water that lead to high uncertainty in the total water availability in the water demand subsystem we aim to develop an interval parameter multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming imfsp method for water distribution in multi users within the water demand subsystem through integrating the multi stage programming msp chance constrained programming ccp and fuzzy mathematical programming fmp into the general interval linear programming ilp framework the multiple uncertainties and complexities expressed as interval numbers fuzzy numbers and distribution information are handled to analyze the water system we established an integrated approach including 1 water supply module introduced a copula function for analyzing coupled risks of water shortage in multiple water sources area and establishing diverse joint risk scenarios and 2 water demand module constructed a method considering the variety of uncertainties and dynamic change in multiple water users based on risk analysis the framework is shown in fig 2 the detailed solution process can be described as follows step 1 construct a systematic joint risk model and analysis shortage risk based on copula step 2 establish the interval multistage chance constrained programming imsp model through integrating msp ccp and ilp model step 3 formulate the interval multistage fuzzy chance constrained programming imfsp model through building fuzzy sets a 1 a 2 a 3 a m for uncertain parameters x1 x2 x3 xm step 4 discretize the range of membership grade 0 1 into a finite number of α cut levels α1 α2 α3 αm step 5 formulate the cimfsp model through imfsp model and copula method transform the joint probability constraint level p into different single probability constraint levels p1 p2 p3 pk through the copula function step 6 transform the cimfsp model into two deterministic sub models by an interactive algorithm formulate and solve the upper submodel to obtainfjopt xjopt and the lower submodel to obtainfjopt xjopt step 7 solutions of the cimfsp model are fjopt fjopt fjopt xjopt xjopt xjopt step 8 repeat the process at every α cut level under different joint risk scenarios then we can obtain the final fuzzy solutions and joint risk scenario that cause the objective function to be maximum 3 1 water supply system considering joint shortage risk in the water supply subsystem the total available water from multi sources i e a source area b source area is also considered it exists a shortage risk of available water from each water source in the multiple sources area the risk of joint shortage among diverse water sources has an impact on the total water availability therefore we introduced the copula function favre el adlouni perreault thiémonge and bobée 2004 salvadori and de michele 2004 michele 2007 to represent the interaction among diverse water sources and the joint risk of shortage copula functions are applied increasingly in hydrology and meteorology studies in these decades fang et al 2018 due to their flexibility and fewer limitations on the types of marginal distributions to be connected the copula method is a class of functions that use a low dimensional marginal probability density function to describe high dimensional joint distribution zhang and jiang 2019 it can connect any form of the marginal distributions and obtain the corresponding joint cumulative distributions cai cai xu tan and xu 2019 the copula function has excellent flexibility and adaptability based on sklar s theorem rüschendorf 2009 if h is a joint distribution function with marginal distributions f and g and these marginal distributions are continuous a single copula function c exists the copula function is defined as follows 1 h x y c f x g y x y r where h a joint distribution function with marginal cumulative distribution functions cdfs f x and g y c a copula and f x and g y are distribution functions firstly establish the marginal distribution functions of water availability from each source and make goodness of fit test the standard parametric methods such as the likelihood method ml and moment method mm were used in the research at the same time kernel density estimation which is the nonparametric estimation method is used to fit the common four kinds of marginal distributions i e normal lognormal gamma and weibull the akaike information criterion aic or bayesian information criterion bic statistical indicators wang and liu 2006 root mean square error rmse are used to choose the optimal marginal distribution meanwhile whether to pass the kolmogorov smirnov test ks test is used to evaluate the goodness of fit for establishing marginal cumulative distribution functions the aic bic value and rmse are smaller the reasonable degree of the process is better the aic can be expressed as 2 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k the number of model parameters l likelihood function similarly the bic is given by 3 bic kln n 2 ln l where k the number of model parameters n the sample size l likelihood function the rmse can be expressed as 4 rmse k 1 n x k est x k obs 2 n where n the sample size x k est the estimated value from the fitted univariate probability distribution x k obs the corresponding observed value the ks test is a method to test the conformity between the actual distribution of sample data and the specified theoretical distribution which can judge whether the sample data fit with a specific theoretical distribution cai cai xu tan and xu 2019 the ks test statistic can be defined as 5 z max 1 l n f n x l f 0 x l where n the sample size f n x l the actual distribution of sample data f 0 x l the theoretical distribution of sample data secondly choose the appropriate copula function and make goodness of fit test for the joint distribution function in this study the four common bivariate copulas i e gaussian copula clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula were considered which are briefly expressed and generated li li huang and gao 2020 they are easily derived and can capture wide ranges of dependence i e lower or upper tail dependences borgomeo pflug hall and hochrainer stigler 2015 when appropriate copula types are selected the empirical copula function was introduced to evaluate the quality of four copula models the formula can be expressed as 6 c 0 u v 1 n i 1 n i f n x i u i g n y i v u v 0 1 when f n x i u then i f n x i u 1 when f n x i u then i f n x i u 0 similarity wheng n y i v theni g n y i v 1 when g n y i v then i g n y i v 0 the euclidean distance can reflect the degree of fit between the copula function and the actual value it is the distance between the predicted value and the real value the smaller value means better fitness the following is the euclidean distance expression 7 d 2 i 1 n c u v c 0 u v 2 where c u v the selected copula function c 0 u v empirical copula function therefore the optimal copula function can be selected to establish the joint process of the multi sources water supply subsystem 3 2 water demand system considering ecological water demand in the water demand subsystem consider a decision maker who performs a stochastic decision process over multiple stages the decision taken at each step is affected by the subsequent stage decisions the problem is maximizing the total expected utility of the overall multi stage stochastic dynamic decision process tadei perboli and manerba 2019 based on the analysis of multi users maximize the expected economic benefits of the entire system furthermore decision makers plan to meet the water demand target values of each water user if this water is diverted it will maximize the local economy however suppose the promised water is not delayed in that case either water must be obtained from alternative and more expensive sources or demand must be curtailed resulting in penalties on the local economy li 2017 to reflect the dynamic variations of system conditions considering the objective of a water resources management is to make water supply schemes timely under discrete probability levels in each stage and deal with such a dynamic feature the method was proposed which the multistage stochastic programming msp to the process of water resources management was presented in the previous studies li cai and qian 2018 consider an msp with water resources as follows 8a maxf t 1 t i 1 i b it w it t 1 t i 1 i p tk c itk d itk subject to 8b i 1 i w it d itk wq tk t k 1 2 kt 8c w it max w it d itk w it min 0 i t k 1 2 kt 8d d itk 0 where f the

scenarios in period t w it max maximum allowable allocation amount for user i during period t w it min minimum allowable allocation amount for user i during period t model 8 can provide a linkage between the pre regulated policies and the associated economic implications however there are random variables in the right hand side parameters the right hand side uncertainties are presented as coefficients presented as independent uncertainties in function gu guo and huang 2012 for instance in water resources management systems the storage capacity of an unregulated reservoir has a statement expressed as approximately 540 106 m3 and it is difficult to determine the value such as net benefits or penalties interval parameter mathematical programming ip can deal with uncertainties presented as upper bound and lower bound but unknown probability distribution information li et al 2019 therefore in order to solve the above problem effectively we introduce ip technique into the msp framework the model interval parameter multi stage stochastic programming imsp model is as follows 9a max f t 1 t i 1 i b it w it φ it w it t 1 t i 1 i p tk c itk d itk subject to 9b i 1 i w it φ it w

is promised to user i during period t w it w it w it φ it a decision variable that satisfies target water volume to user i during the period many interval parameters can be expressed as fuzzy sets random and vague uncertainties represent different subjective judgments for the same problem and then improve the accuracy of making decisions one potential approach for accounting for such uncertainty and complexities is introducing the fuzzy mathematical programming fmp technique into the above imsp model fuzzy arithmetic operations are applied to mathematical equations that include fuzzy numbers which are commonly used to represent non probabilistic uncertainty in different applications the existing computational methods for implementing fuzzy arithmetic mainly focus on implementing the α cut approach due to its simplicity gerami seresht and fayek 2019 triangular fuzzy numbers are defined by their piecewise linear segments as presented 10a a x β 1 β 2 β 3 x β 1 β 2 β 1 if β 1 x β 2 β 3 x β 3 β 2 if β 2 x β 3 β 1 β 2 β 3 where β 1 and β 3 stand for the lower and upper bounds of the support and β 2 the core of fuzzy numbers nl nm nh can express the minimum possible occurrence value the most credible value and the maximum potential occurrence value the most credible value and the maximum possible value of fuzzy numbers n respectively parameter n under each α cut level can be represented as a closed interval 10b n n 1 α nl αnm 1 α nh αnm α 0 1 α cut levels can be defined as a set of elements that belong to a fuzzy set at least to membership grade of α α 0 1 fuzzy intervals from a triangular membership function are shown in fig 3 assume that net benefits b it penalties c it is fuzzy coefficients in the objective and presented as fuzzy triangular numbers therefore an interval parameter multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming imfsp model can be reformulated as follows 11a max f i 1 i t 1 t 1 α b it l λ b it m 1 α b it h λ b it m w it φ it w it i 1 i t 1 t k 1 kt ptk 1 α c it l λ c it m 1 α c it h λ c it m d itk subject to 11b i 1 i w it φ it w it d itk wq tk t k 1 2 kt 11c w it max w it φ it w it d itk w it min 0 i t k 1 2 kt 11d w it φ it w it d itk 0 i t k 11e 1 φ it 0 nevertheless the main limitations of the fmp methods remain in their difficulties in tracking uncertainties expressed as probabilistic distributions in a non fuzzy decision space li huang huang and zhou 2009 when uncertainties on the right hand side are presented as a probability distribution chance constrained programming ccp can effectively deal with this kind of problem liu et al 2009 the model can fix a certain level of probability q for each constraint and impose the condition that the constraint should be satisfied with at least a possibility of 1 q q 0 1 the following constraints restrict the feasible solution set 12 pr ax b t α 1 p where x decision variables a integer b t a random variable pr the probability of an event in p represents the risk of breach of system constraints 1 p represents the joint probability that the system constraints are satisfied however constraints for various levels of non compliance risk are independent of each other and joint interactions change effects between constraints are not taken into account finally analyze the synergy shortage risks of water availability from diverse water sources then the controlled amounts of water availability can be identified through setting up multiple scenario combinations the amount of water availability in the water supply subsystem in the planning period has a dynamic characteristic furthermore the single probabilistic constraints can be transformed into the joint probabilistic constraints as follows 13 p r j 1 n a ij x j b i t a j 1 p i i 1 2 k 14 c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p k 1 p where c is the optimal copula previously determined p i i 1 2 k are the levels of probabilistic violation of individual chance constraints also known as the significant levels which represent the acceptable risk of violation of constraints li li huang and gao 2020 therefore a coupled based interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming cimfsp model can be formulated as follows 15a max f

model formulation the problem with consideration is the joint shortage risk of water availability from multiple water sources and how to allocate limited water resources to various users thus maximize the system benefits during the planning period in this case the total water resources were calculated under a series of joint risk conditions for subsequent optimal allocation the three period four stages scenario tree was built to reflect the dynamic decision making process of distribution consider the parameter uncertainty in the risk management system such as the randomness of available water the uncertainty of the inflow in the future the vagueness of economic data these uncertainties were presented as interval fuzzy set and probability such an issue can be formulated as a multi stage undefined stochastic programming method considering joint risks to help decision makers weigh system benefits and risks and promote coordinated development in multiple water sources areas so the cimfsp model for the entire water system can be formulated as 17a max f i 1 5 t 1 3 1 α b it l λ b it m 1 α b it h λ b i t m w it φ it w it i 1 5 t 1 3 k 1 kt ptk 1 α c it l λ c it m 1 α c it h λ c it

functions were shown generally speaking the distribution function type passes the ks test when the h value of the ks test is 0 and the p value is more significant than 0 05 therefore table 5 shows that all four distributions have passed the ks test all of them can be used to construct the marginal distribution function of the water supply capacity of the a and b water sources area according to the principle of minimum aic bic and rmse the marginal distribution of a follows a lognormal distribution and the marginal distribution of b follows a weibull distribution the joint distribution function of available water resources in a and b was established separately therefore four common copula types gaussian gumbel clayton and frank copula functions are selected the parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method to obtain the four copula type parameters the copula function type with the smallest squared euclidean distance is selected as the optimal joint distribution function to construct a joint distribution function of the available water resources in a and b it can be seen from table 6 the clayton copula function has the smallest d2 which can fit the joint distribution of available water resources in a and b best therefore the clayton copula function is selected to quantify the shortage risk between a and b in summary the clayton copula function expression of the joint distribution is finally obtained 16 c cl u v u 2 4955 v 2 4955 1 1 2 4955 where u available water resources in a satisfying lognormal distribution n 1 4875 0 1194 v available water resources in b satisfying weibull distribution n 4 4131 14 1793 ccl u v means the clayton copula it is shown in fig 4 their marginal cumulative distribution functions are shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a it can be cleared from the curve that the probability of available water resources more than 5 54 109 m3 would be 0 97 it means when the water demand from a is 5 54 109 m3 the probability of water shortage risk would be 0 03 in fig 5 b it can be noticed from the curve that the possibility of water resources availability more than 4 89 109 m3 would be 0 9862 it means when the water demand from b is 4 89 109 m3 the probability of water shortage risk would be 0 0138 in table 7 there are three synergy risks of the abn system i e 0 05 0 1 0 15 and some common shortage risks are set in the risk analysis scenario combinations for instance in the r1 risk scenario when the joint risk is 0 05 the univariate risk a is set as 0 04 according to the clayton copula function the univariate risk b is 0 015 at this time the amounts of available water from a and b are 5 46 109 m3 and 4 88 109 m3 respectively in a similar way when the joint risk is 0 10 and the univariate risk a is set as 0 09 the univariate b is 0 014 based on the copula model therefore from table 7 we indicate that the univariate risk is lower the water availability from the water source is more 4 2 water demand analysis in this study the uncertain parameters expressed as interval numbers e g available water resources from various water resource areas water demand for each sector and other uncertain parameters e g net benefits and penalty as fuzzy sets can be handled imsp model five α cut levels 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 0 95 are considered each α cut level denotes a subset of elements due to uncertainty of the net incoming water volume during the planning period the water availability of each water user is dynamic managers are required to make decisions on water supply schemes at discrete probability levels promptly at each planning stage to obtain the best economic benefits for the entire planning period this decision is also dynamic so water resource allocation can be clearly expressed through a multi stage random programming model msp based on different scenarios it is as shown in fig 6 an optimized set of water target values could be identified under varying system conditions this optimized set could help approach the highest possible system benefit under uncertainty li huang huang and zhou 2009 fig 7 shows that under α 0 and different shortage risk scenarios 0 05 0 1 0 15 of abn system in risk scenario r4 0 05 0 01 0 0414 water allocation targets for the ecological sector would be 0 17 109m3 in period 1 0 24 109m3 in period 2 0 38 109m3 in period 3 similarly in the context of different shortage risk combinations the first two period water allocation targets for the environmental sector are consistent however in third period the water allocation target for this user is 0 21 0 38 109m3 in risk scenario r13 0 1 0 01 0 0929 and 0 21 0 38 109m3 in risk scenario r27 0 15 0 01 0 1442 the results indicate that different joint risk levels correspond to different water availability and reservoir storage capacities and thus would lead to varied water allocation targets the results also indicate that water allocation plans would vary under different α cut levels fig 8 presents the lower bound in water resources optimal allocation plans on the contrary fig 9 presents the upper bound in water resources optimal allocation plans for fig 8 and fig 9 provide the water allocation patterns for five sectors under the same shortage risk scenario r4 0 05 0 1 0 0414 and α 0 α 0 25 α 0 5 α 0 75 α 0 95 for instance when the flow levels are low in all three periods for the industrial sector the water allocation target is 1 2 8 109m3 in period three under α 0 the water allocation targets are 1 8 109m3 and 2 4 109m3 in periods one and two respectively for the same user under α 0 consequently the total water allocation to the industrial sector is 68 40 73 80 109m3 under α 0 70 20 73 80 109 m3 under α 0 25 71 84 73 80 109m3 under α 0 5 system benefits in 135 scenarios are listed in the table s1 with three joint risk levels 0 05 0 10 0 15 and five α cut levels 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 95 the results indicate that system benefits would vary with the α cut level under a higher degree of plausibility i e a higher α cut level the intervals for the system benefits are narrower when the α 0 95 the system benefit can be 1230 40 1257 25 109 with the widest interval compared with the other four α cut levels for the set joint risk the lower risk of a the greater risk of b and the system s net profit will increase for example when the α cut level system benefits in the risk scenario r4 0 05 0 01 0 0414 risk scenario r13 0 10 0 01 0 0929 and risk scenario r27 0 15 0 01 0 1442 are higher relatively under a certain risk portfolio different combinative considerations on the uncertain inputs in different α cut levels would lead to varied objective function values for instance when α 0 the larger system benefit in risk scenario r4 0 05 0 01 0 0414 the minimum and maximum values of systems benefits would be 98 715 21 million rmb 153217 2 million rmb similarly when α 0 95 in risk scenario r4 0 05 0 01 0 0414 the system benefit is largest in all 135 scenarios they would be 1230 530 1257 444 109 this shows that under different α cut levels the benefits of the system will be different at lower α cut levels the interval between system benefits is wider connected with a decreased system certainty therefore for this study the first six scenarios α 0 95 0 05 0 01 0 0414 0 10 0 01 0 0929 0 15 0 01 0 1442 α 0 75 0 05 0 01 0 0414 0 10 0 01 0 0929 0 15 0 01 0 1442 with relatively larger system benefits are selected the maximum system benefits under different joint risk and α cut level scenarios are as follows fig 10 thus the cimfsp approach provides more useful information for decision makers regarding tradeoffs among system benefit certainty and reliability 5 conclusion in the research a copula based interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming cimfsp method is developed to distribute the limited available water resource under uncertainty in the cimfsp model circumstances under a series of α cut levels α 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 95 could be produced by working out a battery of deterministic submodels we consider the joint shortage risk of total water availability in the water supply subsystem through setting up disparate joint risk scenarios in the meantime the various uncertain factors and dynamic characters are considered during the water distribution other research currently puts the availability of water resources in an ideal term and then seldom thinks over the joint interaction within multi source water supply subsystem as a result the uncertainty and complexity of total water availability are ignored in this research the sum of 135 kinds of scenarios 27 kinds of risk scenarios are set to quantify the quantitative relationship within the water supply subsystem five kinds of fuzzy set scenarios are utilized simultaneously we set up subsequent configuration schemes according to various risk scenarios and fuzzy sets strategies this research would help a facilitate reflections of multiple forms of uncertainties within the water resource system with multiple water sources and multiple water users b generate plenty of cost effective decision alternatives under different joint risk scenarios allowing comprehensive analysis of tradeoffs among system benefits and environmental objectives and then tailor the allocation schemes and c decision makers can consider the single risk level and the joint risk level of the subsystem based on the relationship between the system benefit and the amount of resource allocation the results show that this situation for specific joint shortage risk the lower shortage risk of water availability in one and the greater shortage risk of water availability in the other one has higher system benefits comprehensively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the policy to avoid risk loss and then maximize overall benefits however this research is a methodological one with some limitations for instance two water sources are considered for testing the approach and for water allocation and management this dramatically simplifies the water supply subsystem therefore it limits the applicability in the real world in future studies more water sources should be considered using the multi dimensional function algorithm to assess the joint interaction in the water resources system more accurately author statement yutong li has made

1406,many uncertain factors exist in the water resource systems leading to dynamic characteristics of the water distribution process especially for the watershed including irrigation area with multiple water sources and water users it is complicated that the joint risk among available water from each water source and multi uncertainties under water resource allocation among multiple water users in this research an approach is developed that a copula based interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming cimfsp model this research aims at figuring out the planning of a case study for water resources management in the multi sources water supply subsystem the copula function is introduced to tackle the interaction of water availability between two water sources i e a b joint risk was set 0 05 0 10 0 15 to reflect the shortage risk of total available water at diverse levels an interval parameter multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming imfsp model is developed for water resource distribution in a multi users water demand subsystem through this model uncertainties presented as interval numbers and probability distributions as well as fuzzy sets were handled the dynamics of the entire water resource system can be reflected by multi stage discrete trees a series of solutions can be generated under multiple scenarios i e joint risk and α cut levels the modeling results will produce a series of alternatives under a battery of scenarios and help the decision makers get an insight into the tradeoff between the system economic benefit and financial penalties under the corresponding risk level this approach is valuable for improving the feasibility of optimal results in the watershed with irrigation region water resource management keywords water resource system multi stage stochastic analysis coupled risk fuzzy sets irrigation 1 introduction water resources are the foundation of strategic economic and natural resources and then become the guarantee of global sustainable development when insufficient water resources meet rising water consumption over withdrawal of water resources and associated ecological environmental degradation would occur wang cui and li 2012 therefore it is a worldwide issue that how to maintain the balance of the entire water system generally water resources availability was particularly critical since the demands from multiple sectors were rapidly increasing in many regions of the past years li huang huang and zhou 2009 at present water resources management is mainly based on a statistical analysis of hydrological data luis carlos miguel carlo and denise 2019 system analysis techniques can help distribute water in a highly efficient manner which may achieve an ideal compromise between required environmental goals and maximized system benefits he et al 2008 however system components such as stream flows and water allocation targets have complexities and uncertainties huang and loucks 2008 therefore it is desired to develop effective optimization methods to support water resources management water resources management with multiple water sources and end users is thus expected to facilitate sustainable economic development in specific river basins along with rapid socio economic development and urbanization all water demand sectors have become increasingly dependent on sufficient water resources supply bonaccorso cancelliere and rossi 2003 fu li cui liu and lu 2017 at the same time exploitation of any new water sources is extremely difficult in many river basins due to the increasing environmental awareness li et al 2017 to address the uncertainties and complexities of water allocation systems with multiple water sources a growing number of uncertainty analyzing theories methods were used for optimal water allocation wang and huang 2013 for instance many scholars applied stochastic and fuzzy mathematical programming to deal with both fuzziness and randomness of water resources management systems dai li and huang 2011 dong tan huang et al 2014 cheng huang and dong 2015 huang li xiao et al 2015 chen huang fan et al 2016 durodié 2017 moradi and limaei 2018 elleuch anane euchi and frikha 2019 through the introduction of interval mathematical programming many methods were also developed to tackle further uncertainties expressed as intervals cai et al 2009 combined interval numbers fuzzy mathematics and two stage stochastic programming to establish a water resources management model under mixed uncertainties tan et al 2009 applied the interval two stage planning model to optimize the allocation of water resources among multiple users in the sanjiang plain they provided some reference schemes to analyze the uncertainties of water resource systems tan et al 2010a combined two stage planning with fuzzy stochastic programming and optimized analysis based on the combined water pairing of multiple water sources for each crop researchers have discovered that multi stage programming can provide makeup policies for the inherent shortcomings of many previous methods and its main advantage is that it cannot only simulate the decision making process the dynamics of defining the situation the high dimension of the situations but also reflect above these characteristics a novel multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming mfsp model was developed for regional energy systems optimization and planning considering energy water nexus under multiple uncertainties ji zhang huang and wang 2020 moreover plenty of complexities and uncertainties are associated with relevant factors and processes of water resources systems posing significant challenges for water managers and decision makers at multiple scales generally there are multiple water sources within the water supply system it is essential to analyze the interactive relationships between water availability from different water source areas and quantify the coupled risk to control water scarcity zhang and li 2014 in the multi source water optimal allocation there was an increasing intensity of uncertainties compared with a single source water allocation problem the total available water in the supply water subsystem comes from multiple water source areas mainly open water from every water source varies from season to season giving rise to float in water availability and would exert a strong influence on the total amount of available water in the multi source water supply system the mutual interaction of these water resources makes the whole water resources system more probabilistic and more complicated it is necessary for the exchange and the joint shortage risk analysis of water availability from each water resource area within the water supply subsystem the dynamic and complex interaction in water resources systems cannot be easily characterized and modeled to effectively reflect and handle system response under multiple risk control settings wang li guo zhang and guo 2020 developed a risk based fuzzy boundary interval two stage stochastic water resources management programming rfitswmp model to optimize water consumption within a water resources system multi water sources allocation risk is the possibility that multi water source allocation could hardly realize the expected effects under the influence of supply and demand of water engineering and management strategies and many other uncertain factors quantitative analysis of the combined risk of water supply in multiple water source systems and the interactive relationship among water availability from the multi resource area provides a basis for subsequent optimal allocation of water resources generally the purpose of risk analysis is to pre assess the undertaken risk of the system for achieving any desired goals which can help decision makers improve the follow up measures in advance to ensure the safety and reliability of decision making processes durodié 2017 however many approaches take into account a series of uncertainties and different resource shortage risk scenarios they have the following shortages including interaction in the subsystem interaction between water availability from diverse water resources joint risk scenario and dynamic changes during configuration on the actual conditions therefore that must develop a water resources allocation model based on the combined water shortage risk of multiple water sources systems under uncertainty for providing a decision basis for water resources managers therefore in this research we aim to develop an allocation model based on interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming with coupled risk analyzing model to optimize water resource allocation within the entire water resources system with multi source multi users a case study will be provided to demonstrating the applicability of the developed model in detail this study will a construct a joint risk model based on copula theory to respond to the interaction of various water recourses in the water supply subsystem b formulate an interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming model which reflects uncertainties expressed as intervals probability distributions and fuzzy sets and c formulate a cimfsp model to optimize water resources allocation in the entire water resources system the following innovations will be associated with the research including a quantify the joint risk within multiple water supply subsystems b reflect the dynamic decision making process of water resources allocation in every planning period under discrete multi scenarios the results will be used for coming into being a range of decision alternatives under diverse system conditions and then help decision makers determine the water resources management policies needed under uncertain conditions 2 overview of multiple water demands we aim to program sustainable water resources management in multiple water sources area in this research the c city is chosen as a typical ecological city the total amount of available water mainly comes from two sources i e source a source b in the water supply subsystem the public water in the city is the sum of the water availability from a and b the dynamic changes of the available water in each water source will cause the shortage risk in the water resource system at any time in this research a typical water supply subsystem like this is called the a b nexus abn system to maximize the total net benefits define available water in the abn system and calculate how much water is released to the downstream users in this research consider an unregulated river is made to release water to five downstream users ecological sector agricultural sector industrial sector service sector and domestic sector the ministry of ecological environment is mainly targeted at urban environmental water demand and rural ecological water demand water demand in the agricultural sector is mainly used for farmland irrigation forestry animal husbandry fishing and livestock water demand in the industrial sector is primarily used for industry and construction water demand in the service sector is mainly used for entertainment catering etc the domestic water sector mainly targets urban residents domestic water demand and rural residents domestic water demand the water resources system is shown in fig 1 for the study the planning time horizon is 12 years divided into three planning periods 4 4 4 the water availability from two river basins is shown in table 1 a is nanpanjing bain b is yuanjiang basin the available water resources in each water source area were obtained based on the historical data meanwhile the related probability of occurrence in each period was got in table 2 table 3 shows the target values of multiple water users in three planning horizons are pre regulated by decision makers and minimum demands by analyzing the typical city s governmental reports and public surveys c city comprehensively the related benefits and penalties are presented in terms of fuzzy sets with known triangle membership functions based on the analysis of economic data in table 4 3 method and materials the model divides the water resources system into a water supply subsystem and a water demand subsystem in the water supply subsystem the copula function is introduced to quantify the complicated joint risks of inbound water that lead to high uncertainty in the total water availability in the water demand subsystem we aim to develop an interval parameter multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming imfsp method for water distribution in multi users within the water demand subsystem through integrating the multi stage programming msp chance constrained programming ccp and fuzzy mathematical programming fmp into the general interval linear programming ilp framework the multiple uncertainties and complexities expressed as interval numbers fuzzy numbers and distribution information are handled to analyze the water system we established an integrated approach including 1 water supply module introduced a copula function for analyzing coupled risks of water shortage in multiple water sources area and establishing diverse joint risk scenarios and 2 water demand module constructed a method considering the variety of uncertainties and dynamic change in multiple water users based on risk analysis the framework is shown in fig 2 the detailed solution process can be described as follows step 1 construct a systematic joint risk model and analysis shortage risk based on copula step 2 establish the interval multistage chance constrained programming imsp model through integrating msp ccp and ilp model step 3 formulate the interval multistage fuzzy chance constrained programming imfsp model through building fuzzy sets a 1 a 2 a 3 a m for uncertain parameters x1 x2 x3 xm step 4 discretize the range of membership grade 0 1 into a finite number of α cut levels α1 α2 α3 αm step 5 formulate the cimfsp model through imfsp model and copula method transform the joint probability constraint level p into different single probability constraint levels p1 p2 p3 pk through the copula function step 6 transform the cimfsp model into two deterministic sub models by an interactive algorithm formulate and solve the upper submodel to obtainfjopt xjopt and the lower submodel to obtainfjopt xjopt step 7 solutions of the cimfsp model are fjopt fjopt fjopt xjopt xjopt xjopt step 8 repeat the process at every α cut level under different joint risk scenarios then we can obtain the final fuzzy solutions and joint risk scenario that cause the objective function to be maximum 3 1 water supply system considering joint shortage risk in the water supply subsystem the total available water from multi sources i e a source area b source area is also considered it exists a shortage risk of available water from each water source in the multiple sources area the risk of joint shortage among diverse water sources has an impact on the total water availability therefore we introduced the copula function favre el adlouni perreault thiémonge and bobée 2004 salvadori and de michele 2004 michele 2007 to represent the interaction among diverse water sources and the joint risk of shortage copula functions are applied increasingly in hydrology and meteorology studies in these decades fang et al 2018 due to their flexibility and fewer limitations on the types of marginal distributions to be connected the copula method is a class of functions that use a low dimensional marginal probability density function to describe high dimensional joint distribution zhang and jiang 2019 it can connect any form of the marginal distributions and obtain the corresponding joint cumulative distributions cai cai xu tan and xu 2019 the copula function has excellent flexibility and adaptability based on sklar s theorem rüschendorf 2009 if h is a joint distribution function with marginal distributions f and g and these marginal distributions are continuous a single copula function c exists the copula function is defined as follows 1 h x y c f x g y x y r where h a joint distribution function with marginal cumulative distribution functions cdfs f x and g y c a copula and f x and g y are distribution functions firstly establish the marginal distribution functions of water availability from each source and make goodness of fit test the standard parametric methods such as the likelihood method ml and moment method mm were used in the research at the same time kernel density estimation which is the nonparametric estimation method is used to fit the common four kinds of marginal distributions i e normal lognormal gamma and weibull the akaike information criterion aic or bayesian information criterion bic statistical indicators wang and liu 2006 root mean square error rmse are used to choose the optimal marginal distribution meanwhile whether to pass the kolmogorov smirnov test ks test is used to evaluate the goodness of fit for establishing marginal cumulative distribution functions the aic bic value and rmse are smaller the reasonable degree of the process is better the aic can be expressed as 2 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k the number of model parameters l likelihood function similarly the bic is given by 3 bic kln n 2 ln l where k the number of model parameters n the sample size l likelihood function the rmse can be expressed as 4 rmse k 1 n x k est x k obs 2 n where n the sample size x k est the estimated value from the fitted univariate probability distribution x k obs the corresponding observed value the ks test is a method to test the conformity between the actual distribution of sample data and the specified theoretical distribution which can judge whether the sample data fit with a specific theoretical distribution cai cai xu tan and xu 2019 the ks test statistic can be defined as 5 z max 1 l n f n x l f 0 x l where n the sample size f n x l the actual distribution of sample data f 0 x l the theoretical distribution of sample data secondly choose the appropriate copula function and make goodness of fit test for the joint distribution function in this study the four common bivariate copulas i e gaussian copula clayton copula frank copula gumbel copula were considered which are briefly expressed and generated li li huang and gao 2020 they are easily derived and can capture wide ranges of dependence i e lower or upper tail dependences borgomeo pflug hall and hochrainer stigler 2015 when appropriate copula types are selected the empirical copula function was introduced to evaluate the quality of four copula models the formula can be expressed as 6 c 0 u v 1 n i 1 n i f n x i u i g n y i v u v 0 1 when f n x i u then i f n x i u 1 when f n x i u then i f n x i u 0 similarity wheng n y i v theni g n y i v 1 when g n y i v then i g n y i v 0 the euclidean distance can reflect the degree of fit between the copula function and the actual value it is the distance between the predicted value and the real value the smaller value means better fitness the following is the euclidean distance expression 7 d 2 i 1 n c u v c 0 u v 2 where c u v the selected copula function c 0 u v empirical copula function therefore the optimal copula function can be selected to establish the joint process of the multi sources water supply subsystem 3 2 water demand system considering ecological water demand in the water demand subsystem consider a decision maker who performs a stochastic decision process over multiple stages the decision taken at each step is affected by the subsequent stage decisions the problem is maximizing the total expected utility of the overall multi stage stochastic dynamic decision process tadei perboli and manerba 2019 based on the analysis of multi users maximize the expected economic benefits of the entire system furthermore decision makers plan to meet the water demand target values of each water user if this water is diverted it will maximize the local economy however suppose the promised water is not delayed in that case either water must be obtained from alternative and more expensive sources or demand must be curtailed resulting in penalties on the local economy li 2017 to reflect the dynamic variations of system conditions considering the objective of a water resources management is to make water supply schemes timely under discrete probability levels in each stage and deal with such a dynamic feature the method was proposed which the multistage stochastic programming msp to the process of water resources management was presented in the previous studies li cai and qian 2018 consider an msp with water resources as follows 8a maxf t 1 t i 1 i b it w it t 1 t i 1 i p tk c itk d itk subject to 8b i 1 i w it d itk wq tk t k 1 2 kt 8c w it max w it d itk w it min 0 i t k 1 2 kt 8d d itk 0 where f the

between the pre regulated policies and the associated economic implications however there are random variables in the right hand side parameters the right hand side uncertainties are presented as coefficients presented as independent uncertainties in function gu guo and huang 2012 for instance in water resources management systems the storage capacity of an unregulated reservoir has a statement expressed as approximately 540 106 m3 and it is difficult to determine the value such as net benefits or penalties interval parameter mathematical programming ip can deal with uncertainties presented as upper bound and lower bound but unknown probability distribution information li et al 2019 therefore in order to solve the above problem effectively we introduce ip technique into the msp framework the model interval parameter multi stage stochastic programming imsp model is as follows 9a max f t 1 t i 1 i b it w it φ it w it t 1 t i 1 i p tk c itk d itk subject to 9b i 1 i w it φ it w

is promised to user i during period t w it w it w it φ it a decision variable that satisfies target water volume to user i during the period many interval parameters can be expressed as fuzzy sets random and vague uncertainties represent different subjective judgments for the same problem and then improve the accuracy of making decisions one potential approach for accounting for such uncertainty and complexities is introducing the fuzzy mathematical programming fmp technique into the above imsp model fuzzy arithmetic operations are applied to mathematical equations that include fuzzy numbers which are commonly used to represent non probabilistic uncertainty in different applications the existing computational methods for implementing fuzzy arithmetic mainly focus on implementing the α cut approach due to its simplicity gerami seresht and fayek 2019 triangular fuzzy numbers are defined by their piecewise linear segments as presented 10a a x β 1 β 2 β 3 x β 1 β 2 β 1 if β 1 x β 2 β 3 x β 3 β 2 if β 2 x β 3 β 1 β 2 β 3 where β 1 and β 3 stand for the lower and upper bounds of the support and β 2 the core of fuzzy numbers nl nm nh can express the minimum possible occurrence value the most credible value and the maximum potential occurrence value the most credible value and the maximum possible value of fuzzy numbers n respectively parameter n under each α cut level can be represented as a closed interval 10b n n 1 α nl αnm 1 α nh αnm α 0 1 α cut levels can be defined as a set of elements that belong to a fuzzy set at least to membership grade of α α 0 1 fuzzy intervals from a triangular membership function are shown in fig 3 assume that net benefits b it penalties c it is fuzzy coefficients in the objective and presented as fuzzy triangular numbers therefore an interval parameter multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming imfsp model can be reformulated as follows 11a max f i 1 i t 1 t 1 α b it l λ b it m 1 α b it h λ b it m w it φ it w it i 1 i t

itk 0 i t k 11e 1 φ it 0 nevertheless the main limitations of the fmp methods remain in their difficulties in tracking uncertainties expressed as probabilistic distributions in a non fuzzy decision space li huang huang and zhou 2009 when uncertainties on the right hand side are presented as a probability distribution chance constrained programming ccp can effectively deal with this kind of problem liu et al 2009 the model can fix a certain level of probability q for each constraint and impose the condition that the constraint should be satisfied with at least a possibility of 1 q q 0 1 the following constraints restrict the feasible solution set 12 pr ax b t α 1 p where x decision variables a integer b t a random variable pr the probability of an event in p represents the risk of breach of system constraints 1 p represents the joint probability that the system constraints are satisfied however constraints for various levels of non compliance risk are independent of each other and joint interactions change effects between constraints are not taken into account finally analyze the synergy shortage risks of water availability from diverse water sources then the controlled amounts of water availability can be identified through setting up multiple scenario combinations the amount of water availability in the water supply subsystem in the planning period has a dynamic characteristic furthermore the single probabilistic constraints can be transformed into the joint probabilistic constraints as follows 13 p r j 1 n a ij x j b i t a j 1 p i i 1 2 k 14 c 1 p 1 1 p 2 1 p k 1 p where c is the optimal copula previously determined p i i 1 2 k are the levels of probabilistic violation of individual chance constraints also known as the significant levels which represent the acceptable risk of violation of constraints li li huang and gao 2020 therefore a coupled based interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming cimfsp model can be formulated as follows 15a max f

model formulation the problem with consideration is the joint shortage risk of water availability from multiple water sources and how to allocate limited water resources to various users thus maximize the system benefits during the planning period in this case the total water resources were calculated under a series of joint risk conditions for subsequent optimal allocation the three period four stages scenario tree was built to reflect the dynamic decision making process of distribution consider the parameter uncertainty in the risk management system such as the randomness of available water the uncertainty of the inflow in the future the vagueness of economic data these uncertainties were presented as interval fuzzy set and probability such an issue can be formulated as a multi stage undefined stochastic programming method considering joint risks to help decision makers weigh system benefits and risks and promote coordinated development in multiple water sources areas so the cimfsp model for the entire water system can be formulated as 17a max f i 1 5 t 1 3 1 α b it l λ b it m 1 α b it h λ b i t m w it φ it w it i 1 5 t 1 3 k 1 kt ptk 1 α c it l λ c it m 1 α c it h λ c it

according to an interactive algorithm tan et al 2010b the model can be transformed into two deterministic sub models correspondings to the lower and upper bounds of the function as follows upper bound

functions were shown generally speaking the distribution function type passes the ks test when the h value of the ks test is 0 and the p value is more significant than 0 05 therefore table 5 shows that all four distributions have passed the ks test all of them can be used to construct the marginal distribution function of the water supply capacity of the a and b water sources area according to the principle of minimum aic bic and rmse the marginal distribution of a follows a lognormal distribution and the marginal distribution of b follows a weibull distribution the joint distribution function of available water resources in a and b was established separately therefore four common copula types gaussian gumbel clayton and frank copula functions are selected the parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method to obtain the four copula type parameters the copula function type with the smallest squared euclidean distance is selected as the optimal joint distribution function to construct a joint distribution function of the available water resources in a and b it can be seen from table 6 the clayton copula function has the smallest d2 which can fit the joint distribution of available water resources in a and b best therefore the clayton copula function is selected to quantify the shortage risk between a and b in summary the clayton copula function expression of the joint distribution is finally obtained 16 c cl u v u 2 4955 v 2 4955 1 1 2 4955 where u available water resources in a satisfying lognormal distribution n 1 4875 0 1194 v available water resources in b satisfying weibull distribution n 4 4131 14 1793 ccl u v means the clayton copula it is shown in fig 4 their marginal cumulative distribution functions are shown in fig 5 in fig 5 a it can be cleared from the curve that the probability of available water resources more than 5 54 109 m3 would be 0 97 it means when the water demand from a is 5 54 109 m3 the probability of water shortage risk would be 0 03 in fig 5 b it can be noticed from the curve that the possibility of water resources availability more than 4 89 109 m3 would be 0 9862 it means when the water demand from b is 4 89 109 m3 the probability of water shortage risk would be 0 0138 in table 7 there are three synergy risks of the abn system i e 0 05 0 1 0 15 and some common shortage risks are set in the risk analysis scenario combinations for instance in the r1 risk scenario when the joint risk is 0 05 the univariate risk a is set as 0 04 according to the clayton copula function the univariate risk b is 0 015 at this time the amounts of available water from a and b are 5 46 109 m3 and 4 88 109 m3 respectively in a similar way when the joint risk is 0 10 and the univariate risk a is set as 0 09 the univariate b is 0 014 based on the copula model therefore from table 7 we indicate that the univariate risk is lower the water availability from the water source is more 4 2 water demand analysis in this study the uncertain parameters expressed as interval numbers e g available water resources from various water resource areas water demand for each sector and other uncertain parameters e g net benefits and penalty as fuzzy sets can be handled imsp model five α cut levels 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 0 95 are considered each α cut level denotes a subset of elements due to uncertainty of the net incoming water volume during the planning period the water availability of each water user is dynamic managers are required to make decisions on water supply schemes at discrete probability levels promptly at each planning stage to obtain the best economic benefits for the entire planning period this decision is also dynamic so water resource allocation can be clearly expressed through a multi stage random programming model msp based on different scenarios it is as shown in fig 6 an optimized set of water target values could be identified under varying system conditions this optimized set could help approach the highest possible system benefit under uncertainty li huang huang and zhou 2009 fig 7 shows that under α 0 and different shortage risk scenarios 0 05 0 1 0 15 of abn system in risk scenario r4 0 05 0 01 0 0414 water allocation targets for the ecological sector would be 0 17 109m3 in period 1 0 24 109m3 in period 2 0 38 109m3 in period 3 similarly in the context of different shortage risk combinations the first two period water allocation targets for the environmental sector are consistent however in third period the water allocation target for this user is 0 21 0 38 109m3 in risk scenario r13 0 1 0 01 0 0929 and 0 21 0 38 109m3 in risk scenario r27 0 15 0 01 0 1442 the results indicate that different joint risk levels correspond to different water availability and reservoir storage capacities and thus would lead to varied water allocation targets the results also indicate that water allocation plans would vary under different α cut levels fig 8 presents the lower bound in water resources optimal allocation plans on the contrary fig 9 presents the upper bound in water resources optimal allocation plans for fig 8 and fig 9 provide the water allocation patterns for five sectors under the same shortage risk scenario r4 0 05 0 1 0 0414 and α 0 α 0 25 α 0 5 α 0 75 α 0 95 for instance when the flow levels are low in all three periods for the industrial sector the water allocation target is 1 2 8 109m3 in period three under α 0 the water allocation targets are 1 8 109m3 and 2 4 109m3 in periods one and two respectively for the same user under α 0 consequently the total water allocation to the industrial sector is 68 40 73 80 109m3 under α 0 70 20 73 80 109 m3 under α 0 25 71 84 73 80 109m3 under α 0 5 system benefits in 135 scenarios are listed in the table s1 with three joint risk levels 0 05 0 10 0 15 and five α cut levels 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 95 the results indicate that system benefits would vary with the α cut level under a higher degree of plausibility i e a higher α cut level the intervals for the system benefits are narrower when the α 0 95 the system benefit can be 1230 40 1257 25 109 with the widest interval compared with the other four α cut levels for the set joint risk the lower risk of a the greater risk of b and the system s net profit will increase for example when the α cut level system benefits in the risk scenario r4 0 05 0 01 0 0414 risk scenario r13 0 10 0 01 0 0929 and risk scenario r27 0 15 0 01 0 1442 are higher relatively under a certain risk portfolio different combinative considerations on the uncertain inputs in different α cut levels would lead to varied objective function values for instance when α 0 the larger system benefit in risk scenario r4 0 05 0 01 0 0414 the minimum and maximum values of systems benefits would be 98 715 21 million rmb 153217 2 million rmb similarly when α 0 95 in risk scenario r4 0 05 0 01 0 0414 the system benefit is largest in all 135 scenarios they would be 1230 530 1257 444 109 this shows that under different α cut levels the benefits of the system will be different at lower α cut levels the interval between system benefits is wider connected with a decreased system certainty therefore for this study the first six scenarios α 0 95 0 05 0 01 0 0414 0 10 0 01 0 0929 0 15 0 01 0 1442 α 0 75 0 05 0 01 0 0414 0 10 0 01 0 0929 0 15 0 01 0 1442 with relatively larger system benefits are selected the maximum system benefits under different joint risk and α cut level scenarios are as follows fig 10 thus the cimfsp approach provides more useful information for decision makers regarding tradeoffs among system benefit certainty and reliability 5 conclusion in the research a copula based interval multi stage fuzzy stochastic programming cimfsp method is developed to distribute the limited available water resource under uncertainty in the cimfsp model circumstances under a series of α cut levels α 0 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 95 could be produced by working out a battery of deterministic submodels we consider the joint shortage risk of total water availability in the water supply subsystem through setting up disparate joint risk scenarios in the meantime the various uncertain factors and dynamic characters are considered during the water distribution other research currently puts the availability of water resources in an ideal term and then seldom thinks over the joint interaction within multi source water supply subsystem as a result the uncertainty and complexity of total water availability are ignored in this research the sum of 135 kinds of scenarios 27 kinds of risk scenarios are set to quantify the quantitative relationship within the water supply subsystem five kinds of fuzzy set scenarios are utilized simultaneously we set up subsequent configuration schemes according to various risk scenarios and fuzzy sets strategies this research would help a facilitate reflections of multiple forms of uncertainties within the water resource system with multiple water sources and multiple water users b generate plenty of cost effective decision alternatives under different joint risk scenarios allowing comprehensive analysis of tradeoffs among system benefits and environmental objectives and then tailor the allocation schemes and c decision makers can consider the single risk level and the joint risk level of the subsystem based on the relationship between the system benefit and the amount of resource allocation the results show that this situation for specific joint shortage risk the lower shortage risk of water availability in one and the greater shortage risk of water availability in the other one has higher system benefits comprehensively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the policy to avoid risk loss and then maximize overall benefits however this research is a methodological one with some limitations for instance two water sources are considered for testing the approach and for water allocation and management this dramatically simplifies the water supply subsystem therefore it limits the applicability in the real world in future studies more water sources should be considered using the multi dimensional function algorithm to assess the joint interaction in the water resources system more accurately author statement yutong li has made

1407,surface water tracing is a widely used technique to investigate in stream mass transport including contaminant migration recently a microparticle tracer was developed with unique synthetic dna encapsulated in an environmentally friendly silica coating si dna microparticle previous tracing applications of such tracers reported detection and quantification but a massive loss of tracer mass however the transport behavior of these dna tagged microparticle tracers has not been rigorously quantified and compared with that of solute tracers therefore we compared the transport behavior of si dna microparticles to the behavior of solute nacl in 6 different environmentally representative water types using breakthrough curves btcs obtained from laboratory open channel injection experiments whereby no si dna microparticle tracer mass was lost hereafter we modelled the btcs using a 1 d advection dispersion model with one transient storage zone otis by calibrating the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d and a storage zone exchange rate coefficient we concluded that the transport behavior of si dna microparticles resembled that of nacl in surface water relevant conditions evidenced by btcs with a similar range of d however the si dna microparticle had a more erratic btc than its solute counterpart whereby the scatter increased as a function of water quality complexity the overall larger confidence interval of dsi dna was attributed to the discrete nature of colloidal particles with a certain particle size distribution and possibly minor shear induced aggregations this research established a solid methodological foundation for field application of si dna microparticles in surface water tracing providing insight in transport behavior of equivalent sized and mass particles in rivers keywords microparticle tracers dna surface water hydrodynamic dispersion 1 introduction environmental pollution poses an unprecedented burden over surface water quality and aquatic ecosystems between terrestrial and marine ecosystems rivers are the major dispersal vectors both to distribute nutrient and to transport detrimental contaminants nantke et al 2019 a comprehensive understanding of riverine mass transport is a prerequisite for pollution control solute and particle tracers are widely used in surface water tracing experiments to characterize in stream transport of solutes and particulates most of such studies use solute tracers such as to track sources and migration pathways of pollutants sediment water interactions and transient storages bencala et al 2011 haggerty et al 2008 particle tracers however were used only in a few studies e g micron sized fluorescent microspheres bacteriophages bacteria and natural clay sediment particles göppert and goldscheider 2008 jamieson et al 2005 schiperski et al 2016 spencer et al 2011 wyer et al 2010 in these studies and as far as we know particles smaller than 1 μm were only used once due to practical limitations goeppert and goldscheider 2019 however colloids defined as materials between 10 nm and 10 μm mccarthy and zachara 1989 in the aquatic environment are of significant interest due to their sizes surface areas and mass as nutrients in phosphorus related colloids guo and macdonald 2006 heathwaite and dils 2000 jarvie et al 2012 stolpe et al 2010 as carriers for contaminants lead and wilkinson 2006 h wang et al 2015 and when smaller than 30 nm their limited sizes may cause enhanced biological and chemical reactivities auffan et al 2009 azimzada et al 2021 these aquatic colloids include naturally occurring biocolloids e g viruses bacteria extracellular polymeric substances etc geocolloids e g clay metal oxides and hydroxides anthropogenic engineered nanomaterials e g titanium dioxide nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes and microplastics alimi et al 2018 h wang et al 2015 xu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 besides traditional tracer tests have several disadvantages 1 a limited number of distinguishable artificial tracers is available 2 tracer detections often have background noise with dilution limitations and 3 practical constraints limit the application of a proper tracer e g strict regulations for uranine or rhodamine or being very expensive like fluorobenzoic acid bencala et al 2011 choi et al 2000 stern et al 2001 whitmer et al 2000 wilderer 2011 in search of new tracer substances synthetic dna deoxyribonucleic acid was introduced as a hydrological tracer laboratory synthesis enables a virtually unlimited number of synthetic dna sequences to be produced and these can be identified by target specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr with a theoretical detection limit down to one dna molecule per qpcr well watson et al 1992 such dna tracers have been employed to identify pathways of sediments and solutes in various environmental conditions aquilanti et al 2013 2016 dahlke et al 2015 foppen et al 2011 2013 mahler et al 1998 mccluskey et al 2021 pang et al 2017 ptak et al 2004 sabir et al 1999 2000 viccione et al 2014 however these naked dna tracers showed attenuation up to 80 90 of injected mass which was mainly attributed to adsorption attachment and biological uptake dahlke et al 2015 foppen et al 2013 besides dna strands are subject to breakdown and degradation in the natural environment due to extracellular enzymes abundant microbial activity or elevated temperatures lindahl 1993 sabir et al 1999 tsuji et al 2017 such dna mass loss may be overcome by using a cover to protect the dna strands from the hostile environment so far silica coated dna encapsulated microparticles si dna microparticles and similar variants have been applied in hydrological tracing experiments as proof of concept garnett et al 2009 liao et al 2020 pang et al 2014 paunescu et al 2013 puddu et al 2014 a sharma et al 2021 a n sharma et al 2012 in multiplexed tracing experiments in streams and rivers dna tagged microparticles were traceable at greater distances compared to solute tracers and exhibited similar breakthrough behavior garnett et al 2009 pang et al 2020 a n sharma et al 2012 however the transport behavior of these dna tagged microparticle tracers has not been rigorously quantified and compared with that of solute tracers a mass balance accounting for sources and sinks is required for the understanding of si dna microparticles in transport behavior furthermore between dna tagged microparticles and ubiquitous natural substances in the aquatic environment i e organic and inorganic particles possible interactions should also be considered when necessary such knowledge is essential when selecting appropriate tracers for hydrological investigations therefore the objective of this paper was to understand and quantify the transport behavior of si dna microparticles in surface water tracing experiments our hypothesis was that when in colloidal stable conditions si dna microparticles have a transport behavior comparable to solute tracers in surface water injection experiments hereto we conducted a series of controlled injection experiments in 6 environmentally representative water types and compared the breakthrough curves btcs and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d si dna of si dna microparticles to that of nacl a solute tracer d nacl besides these laboratory scale experiments are vital for successful field scale tracing experiments for which a well developed methodology including reliable sample handling technique is indispensable mikutis et al 2018 this paper contributes to understanding the behavior of such novel dna tagged microparticle and anticipates the application potential in large scale tracing experiments providing insight in transport behavior of equivalent sized and mass particles in rivers 2 material methods 2 1 si dna microparticles and primers the si dna microparticles were the same as used in the study by mikutis et al 2018 provided by eth zurich the synthesized si dna microparticles were spheres with a narrow and unimodal size distribution the surface of si dna microparticles represents sio2 properties and no interference with dna chemistry is expected paunescu et al 2013 dna and primer sequences are given in the supporting information table s1 in the si 2 2 hydrodynamic radius and zeta potential of si dna microparticles the hydrodynamic radius rhdls of si dna microparticles in each water type 500 ppb was measured by dynamic light scattering dls and the zeta potential ζ of si dna microparticles was calculated by using smoluchowski s equation from their electrophoretic mobility measured on a nanosizer nano series malvern instrument ltd worcestershire united kingdom to assess if aggregations of si dna microparticles took place within the time frame of the injection experiment in each water type the rhdls was measured as a function of time in quiescent and in mixing conditions respectively thereto in each water type si dna microparticles were suspended to reach a final concentration of 500 ppb of 2 ml in duplicate each sample tube was sonicated to reach a homogenous suspension before the first measurement after the first measurement of rhdls one sample was allowed to stand still while the other sample was mixed at 1500 rpm until the next measurement in 2 h 2 3 injection experiments injection experiments of tracers are widely conducted to obtain btcs to understand transport behavior because they are simple to carry out and give good and reliable results leibundgut and seibert 2011 a series of pulse injection experiments with si dna microparticles was performed in 6 water types in a horizontally placed pvc box fig 1 the channel was 20 cm long 10 cm wide and 3 cm deep tracers were injected by a peristaltic pump the injection experiment had a flow rate of 18 ml min and a duration of approximately 100 min hydraulic retention time was 28 5 min for each experiment a 10 ml suspension of 5 ppb si dna microparticles was injected due to the low flow rate a magnetic stirrer was set close 2 cm to the inlet point to enhance cross sectional mixing of tracer mass we assumed that tracer mass was mixed rapidly but not instantaneous over the entire cross section so that the impact of the mixing in the so called initial period on the transport in the investigated reach was negligible rieckermann et al 2005 whereby the mixing was not represented by the 1 d advection dispersion process a solute fluorescent dye tracer was added once to visualize mixing conditions and the transport pathway of the injected tracer mass in the box see details in the si sampling was carried out at the outlet the sampling interval progressively increased from 1 to 5 min see table s2 in the si from each of the sample bottle 500 μl of sub sample was taken in duplicate for sample analysis sample bottles were vortexed for 1 to 2 min before taking sub samples ensuring that si dna microparticles were homogeneously distributed over the entire sample volume each injection experiment was performed three times the 1st and 2nd injection experiments were sequentially performed with a break of 0 5 h to rinse the set up to remove possible residual substances from the previous experiment the 3rd injection experiment was performed later after each experiment extra water samples were analyzed for any residual tracer in the pvc box see fig 1 first a pulse injection experiment of nacl 5 0 mm emsure merck kgaa a solute tracer was performed in triplicate for reference the btc of nacl was measured by an electrical conductivity ec meter multi 3620 ids xylem analytics germany gmbh germany and mass recovery was calculated see the standard curve on page s5 in the si similarly to the nacl injection experiment si dna microparticle tests were conducted in 6 representative water types demi water was chosen as a blank control furthermore we used a 5 0 mm nah2po4 h2o solution j t baker and a 1 67 mm cacl2 2h2o emsure merck kgaa solution to anticipate the effects of monovalent dalas and koutsoukos 1990 ji et al 2020 and divalent cations liu et al 2010 this group of synthetic chemical solutions were prepared in the laboratory tap water was used as a transition water type which was more complex than the synthetic chemical solutions but less complex than natural water in the sense that various natural or anthropogenic nanoparticles colloidal particles or particulate matter 5 μm could still be part of that water also two natural surface water samples were collected from a canal in delft one of which was filtered 5 μm cellulose nitrate filters referred to as filtered natural water and the other was not referred to as natural water the canal receives its water from both rhine river and meuse river in this way we tested for the effect of particulate matter concentrations of major cations and anions of tap water and natural water samples were measured by ion chromatography methrohm ag when performing the 3rd series of replicate experiments the organic matter content of the water types was measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in mg c l using the combustion technique with a total organic carbon analyser toc vcpn tn shimadzu japan before the injection experiments to assess if the pvc material could be a possible sink for dna mass loss during injection experiments the concentration of si dna microparticles in demi water was determined as a function of time in batch experiments for 7 days an extended period was designed as an extreme condition the suspension of si dna microparticles in demi water was kept in pvc containers and protected against daylight at room temperature no mass loss of si dna microparticles was observed results shown in fig s3 in the si 2 4 sample analysis quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was used to quantify dna concentrations of the samples from the injection experiments prior to qpcr analysis samples were centrifuged washed and re suspended before dissolving silica coating after extensive testing some adjustments were made to the original protocol in paunescu et al 2013 such as increasing centrifugal force and duration washing samples with demi water and enhanced mixing see centrifugation procedure and quality control in the si to minimize manual errors a high precision pipetting robot qiagility benchtop instrument was used to mix reagents the silica coating was dissolved within 10 min by adding 1 μl buffered oxide etch boe solution 2 3 g of nh4fhf sigma aldrich and 1 9 g of nh4f j t baker in 10 ml water to achieve a final concentration of 2500 ppm f ions after the silica coating had dissolved the sample was directly used for qpcr reaction without purification qpcr was performed using kapa sybr green based master mixes roche sequencing and life science on a bio rad miniopticon the details of qpcr reaction setup and cycling parameters are provided in the si the qpcr readings i e cq were converted into dna concentration mg ml and plotted against time to produce a btc fig 1 the conversion equation and mass recovery calculations are provided in the si hereafter we compared the obtained btcs of si dna microparticles with that of nacl 2 5 analysis of btcs the physical transport of solutes and si dna microparticles in the injection experiments can be described by a one dimensional advection and dispersion equation with a first order mass transfer transient storage we used the one dimensional transport with inflow and storage model otis to model the curves runkel 1998 otis was chosen because our experimental set up mimics 1 d steady uniform flow in a main channel with a storage zone without lateral inflow besides dna mass was conserved during injection experiments since no source or sink of dna mass was observed in our experimental channel therefore no mass loss term was considered in the otis modelling the goals were to fit the observed btc and to quantify d si dna of the si dna microparticles the fitting was carried out using nonlinear least squares by requiring an input of observed btc see details in the si which was implemented in otis p in a modelling case where mass is conserved the injected mass should equal to the recovered total mass which is the area under the observed btc in spite of no mass loss this total recovered dna mass calculated from the observed btc can differ from the measured injected dna mass to some extent see more discussion in 3 2 to resolve the imbalance of input output mass we scaled the mass recoveries to 100 by linearly correcting the initial injection mass before otis modelling this linear correction of the injected mass has no influence on the characteristics of the btcs pang et al 2017 and can be used for dispersion estimation

s in otis p d and α were fitted while other parameters were fixed best fit estimates of d nacl and αnacl from nacl injection experiments were used as initial estimates of d si dna and αsi dna 3 results discussion 3 1 btcs of si dna microparticles and the effect of water quality hydrodynamics water quality ph ec doc tss and major chemical compositions of 6 water types used for the injection experiments are given in table 1 the zeta potential of the si dna microparticles was between 17 7 1 mv and 49 8 5 9 mv and the mean rhdls was between 237 81 nm and 299 129 nm measured before the injection experiments table 1 in the quiescent condition and as a function of time the mean rhdls and pdi of si dna microparticles remained constant for each water type fig 2 a a one way anova revealed that there was no significant difference p 0 3 at 95 significance level among mean rhdls and pdi of si dna microparticles however when mixing the rhdls and pdi significantly increased p values 0 05 at 95 significance level in cacl2 tap water filtered and unfiltered natural water while in demi water and in phosphate solution the rhdls and pdi remained constant as a function of time fig 2 b generally the btcs of the si dna microparticles in all water types showed a close resemblance to the btcs of nacl fig 3 s7 the c c0 of the nacl btc demonstrated a sharp increase and then reached a peak of roughly 2 at 4th minute which was followed by a slow decline 1 at 24 min fig 3 when compared with si dna microparticles the c c0 of si dna microparticles were noisier than the nacl btc moreover comparing si dna btcs within the group of laboratory prepared waters the btcs in cacl2 were slightly noisier than those in demi and nah2po4 also the si dna btcs were more scattered in tap water filtered natural water and natural water in other words the observed relative concentrations of si dna microparticles around the peaks were more scattered as compositions of solution became more complex exhibiting higher peak values than those of nacl tracers in particular the si dna btcs in the filtered natural water and natural water were most scattered with the largest discrepancy among the triplicates water quality including ionic strength natural organic matter nom content and suspended solids are important factors determining the fate of engineered nano and micro particles in water bodies shevlin et al 2018 in our experiments the ionic strength of used water types was in the range of 1 25 mm based on the measured concentrations of known cations and anions table 1 note that compared to studies which focused on the effect of ionic strength on colloidal interactions ledin and karlsson 1993 j f mccarthy et al 2002 nocito gobel and tobiason 1996 torkzaban et al 2008 zhao et al 2021 the ionic strength of water types used in this paper was in the low range in such solution chemistry si dna microparticles remained colloidally stable evidenced by a constant hydrodynamic radius over 4 h fig 2 a this indicated that the solution chemistry alone was unfavorable for aggregation of si dna microparticles metin et al 2014 specifically the calculated total energy barriers based on classical dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1993 verwey 1947 for si dna microparticles in demi and nah2po4 solution were relatively high 50 kt with negligible secondary minima see table s3 in the si for the details of dlvo energy calculations such high repulsive energy would prevent aggregation of si dna microparticles in the solution chemistry in cacl2 tap filtered natural and natural waters the reduction of zeta potentials table 1 can be explained by the compression of the electric double layer indicating a likely lower total energy barrier elimelech et al 2013 in contrast to the quiescent condition no shear force after 2 h of mixing the increase of rhdls in cacl2 phosphate tap filtered and unfiltered natural water fig 2 b indicated shear induced aggregation i e orthokinetic flocculation barthelmes et al 2003 hijnen and clegg 2014 spicer 1997 moreover when a flow field acts on the suspension the hydrodynamic force e g shear force is responsible for bringing the particles together and would likely dominate the particle collisions elimelech et al 2013 frungieri et al 2020 zaccone et al 2009 thus it is reasonable to imply that shear induced aggregation might have taken place during the injection experiments however we argue that the effect of aggregation is likely minor as the coupled effect of shear rate and volume friction gregory 2005 in our experiments was orders of magnitude lower than that in our batch mixing experiments the btcs of si dna microparticles in filtered and unfiltered natural water showed similar characteristics with a degree of scatter in the peaks fig 3 despite the variations in water quality parameters between the third and the preceding two series of experiments table 1 there was a time gap between the first two series and the third series the interactions between natural particulates and nanoparticles were extensively studied in literature lead et al 2018 oney and nason 2021 peijnenburg et al 2015 petosa et al 2010 praetorius et al 2020 quik et al 2013 velzeboer et al 2014 xu et al 2020 for example quik and co workers found that natural particulates played a key role in the increased hetero aggregation and sedimentation of nanomaterials by comparing filtered and unfiltered natural water samples quik et al 2013 however the effect of particulate matter content 5 μm on the transport characteristics of si dna microparticle was not clearly observed in our injection experiments 3 2 d and colloidal stability after re scaling mass recoveries to 100 without changing the btc behavior we modelled the btcs of all injection experiments to determine d and α fig 4 and table 1 the rising and falling limbs of nacl btcs were modelled almost perfectly fig 3 panel a r2 99 8 and the peaks of nacl btcs were slightly underestimated this showed that the otis conceptualization 1d ade with one transient storage was well capable of mimicking the experimental set up even though there was a small discrepancy between the schematisation of otis and experimental set up in the 1d representation in otis the tracer mass is uniformly distributed over the cross sectional area we used a stirrer to achieve cross sectional mixing and the time required to achieve this was not incorporated in our otis modelling meanwhile stirring enhanced the extent of the interaction between tracers and the storage zone so that tracer spreading caused by storage exchange reached an equilibrium stage soon after tracers entered the channel harvey and wagner 2000 this storage contribution was visible in the long tail of the btcs indicating a diffusion limited steady state storage moreover the calculated damkohler number dai is 10 see eq s6 in the si also suggested the dominance of the storage process caused by enhanced mixing thus fitting the resultant long tail using a higher exchange rate compromised the fitting of the peak details of otis model implementation are provided in the si this effect could also be seen in the rest of btcs of si dna microparticles regardless of solution chemistry and colloidal stability mean d si dna was essentially similar across 6 water types and was comparable to d nacl fig 4 the same was observed for the mean αsi dna the size of the confidence intervals of d si dna and αsi dna were directly related to btc noisy behavior when we plotted the variations against relative concentration we observed that uncertainties were more associated with tails than peaks of btcs in all water types of which natural waters filtered and non filtered had the largest coefficient variations fig s8 in natural waters co transporting with nom and the likely presence of inorganic particles of various size ranges si dna microparticles were also subject to more complicated interactions such as steric acid base forces etc grasso et al 2002 likely resulting in some random attachment and detachment e g flocculation and breakage due to shear forces this could possibly contribute to a more irregular or noisier si dna btc resulting in a larger confidence interval uncertainty of d si dna in natural waters likewise schiperski et al also showed a similar range of dispersion estimations of silica fluorescent particles of micron size to those of solute tracers in a karst river drainage system despite differences in the surface properties of the particle tracers schiperski et al 2016 the effect of hydrodynamics on colloidal particle transport in subsurface environments is widely studied elimelech et al 2013 sasidharan et al 2014 torkzaban et al 2007 however in surface waters less research focuses on quantitatively comparing colloids in the size range of 200 400 nm such as si dna microparticles to that of solutes recently dna tagged alginate coated microparticles with a similar negative surface charge in stream injection experiments showed to behave similarly to solute tracers in rising limb and peak of btcs albeit without quantification pang et al 2020 besides among the few studies most used particles of much larger size such as natural organic inorganic particulates fluorescent latex particles e coli and titanium dioxide particles and focused on distribution and fate without quantification of dispersion behavior drummond et al 2014 jamieson et al 2005 karwan and saiers 2009 newbold et al 2005 phillips et al 2019 spencer et al 2011 wyer et al 2010 3 3 mass recovery and data uncertainty the mass recovery of each injection experiment is of fundamental importance for quantifying transport behavior of si dna microparticles we analyzed all samples and randomly performed lab duplicates the mass recovery of si dna microparticles with known initial concentration was calculated and ranged between 88 and 118 table 1 in demi water where minimal impurity or interfering ion was present the mass recoveries of si dna microparticles ranged between 91 and 97 in such case the si dna mass was considered fully recovered a mass ambiguity of less than 10 is well within the expected mass ambiguity range 20 which is due to the accuracy of qpcr reading and uncertainty of particle concentration foppen et al 2013 paunescu et al 2015 qpcr technology is only accurate on a logarithmic scale from our experimental data the difference of cq values between replicates varied from 0 07 to 0 2 which resulted in a concentration difference of 5 20 07 to 14 8 20 2 such variation error of cq values was inevitable because errors may propagate from pipetting or intrinsic variances of enzymatic efficiency due to minor temperature differences in the qpcr apparatus foppen et al 2013 besides a variety of factors including the water quality of samples could also influence the enzymatic activity gibson et al 2012 zipper et al 2003 moreover subsampling is required when transferring a large environmental sample size into a much smaller sample size for qpcr analysis when taking subsamples the sample volume has to contain a sufficient number of particles such that variations are statistically insignificant crowe 2012 in samples with diluted si dna microparticles up to a 20 difference in particle concentration between two samples can arise from a few particles difference resulting in qpcr signal variations when subsamples and replicates were taken for qpcr assay kittilä et al 2019 this is most likely to encounter for samples collected from large scale environmental water bodies however in our laboratory experiments such quantification uncertainty associated with particle concentration was trivial as the qpcr amplification result as a function of the particle concentration the 10 fold dilution curve in the si suggested that the particle quantification by amplifying dna was consistent over a range of particle concentration down to 10 8 mg ml additionally we speculate that the discrete nature of such heavier than fluid particles with a certain spread of size distribution might be the origin of the fluctuations in btcs won et al 2019 it would be very convenient if the size distribution was very limited such that every particle is essentially subject to the identical transport characteristics future research is warranted to assess the possible impact of particle size distribution on si dna microparticle transport in surface waters the differences in fluctuations of si dna btcs may arise from particle characteristics e g particle size distributions environmental conditions e g hydrodynamic forces and qpcr analytical methods contributing to the overall more irregularities in si dna btcs than nacl btcs a similar trend of fluctuations in si dna btc was also reported even more evidently in recent studies on dna tagged microparticles and their tracing applicability in environmental and hydrological investigations e g pang et al 2020 c wang et al 2019 nevertheless increasing the injected tracer mass and up concentrating from a larger sample volume into a smaller sample volume could be beneficial for obtaining better quality btcs kittilä et al 2019 4 conclusion we concluded that the transport behavior of si dna microparticles resembled that of nacl in surface water relevant conditions evidenced by btcs with a similar range of d with special attention paid to mass balance the si dna microparticles as colloids had overall more erratic btcs than solute tracers whereby the scatter increased a function of water quality complexity the overall larger confidence interval of dsi dna we contributed to the discrete nature of colloidal particles with a certain particle size distribution and possible minor shear induced aggregation this research established a solid methodological foundation for field application of si dna microparticles in surface water tracing despite the fluctuations of signals in

1407,surface water tracing is a widely used technique to investigate in stream mass transport including contaminant migration recently a microparticle tracer was developed with unique synthetic dna encapsulated in an environmentally friendly silica coating si dna microparticle previous tracing applications of such tracers reported detection and quantification but a massive loss of tracer mass however the transport behavior of these dna tagged microparticle tracers has not been rigorously quantified and compared with that of solute tracers therefore we compared the transport behavior of si dna microparticles to the behavior of solute nacl in 6 different environmentally representative water types using breakthrough curves btcs obtained from laboratory open channel injection experiments whereby no si dna microparticle tracer mass was lost hereafter we modelled the btcs using a 1 d advection dispersion model with one transient storage zone otis by calibrating the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d and a storage zone exchange rate coefficient we concluded that the transport behavior of si dna microparticles resembled that of nacl in surface water relevant conditions evidenced by btcs with a similar range of d however the si dna microparticle had a more erratic btc than its solute counterpart whereby the scatter increased as a function of water quality complexity the overall larger confidence interval of dsi dna was attributed to the discrete nature of colloidal particles with a certain particle size distribution and possibly minor shear induced aggregations this research established a solid methodological foundation for field application of si dna microparticles in surface water tracing providing insight in transport behavior of equivalent sized and mass particles in rivers keywords microparticle tracers dna surface water hydrodynamic dispersion 1 introduction environmental pollution poses an unprecedented burden over surface water quality and aquatic ecosystems between terrestrial and marine ecosystems rivers are the major dispersal vectors both to distribute nutrient and to transport detrimental contaminants nantke et al 2019 a comprehensive understanding of riverine mass transport is a prerequisite for pollution control solute and particle tracers are widely used in surface water tracing experiments to characterize in stream transport of solutes and particulates most of such studies use solute tracers such as to track sources and migration pathways of pollutants sediment water interactions and transient storages bencala et al 2011 haggerty et al 2008 particle tracers however were used only in a few studies e g micron sized fluorescent microspheres bacteriophages bacteria and natural clay sediment particles göppert and goldscheider 2008 jamieson et al 2005 schiperski et al 2016 spencer et al 2011 wyer et al 2010 in these studies and as far as we know particles smaller than 1 μm were only used once due to practical limitations goeppert and goldscheider 2019 however colloids defined as materials between 10 nm and 10 μm mccarthy and zachara 1989 in the aquatic environment are of significant interest due to their sizes surface areas and mass as nutrients in phosphorus related colloids guo and macdonald 2006 heathwaite and dils 2000 jarvie et al 2012 stolpe et al 2010 as carriers for contaminants lead and wilkinson 2006 h wang et al 2015 and when smaller than 30 nm their limited sizes may cause enhanced biological and chemical reactivities auffan et al 2009 azimzada et al 2021 these aquatic colloids include naturally occurring biocolloids e g viruses bacteria extracellular polymeric substances etc geocolloids e g clay metal oxides and hydroxides anthropogenic engineered nanomaterials e g titanium dioxide nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes and microplastics alimi et al 2018 h wang et al 2015 xu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 besides traditional tracer tests have several disadvantages 1 a limited number of distinguishable artificial tracers is available 2 tracer detections often have background noise with dilution limitations and 3 practical constraints limit the application of a proper tracer e g strict regulations for uranine or rhodamine or being very expensive like fluorobenzoic acid bencala et al 2011 choi et al 2000 stern et al 2001 whitmer et al 2000 wilderer 2011 in search of new tracer substances synthetic dna deoxyribonucleic acid was introduced as a hydrological tracer laboratory synthesis enables a virtually unlimited number of synthetic dna sequences to be produced and these can be identified by target specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr with a theoretical detection limit down to one dna molecule per qpcr well watson et al 1992 such dna tracers have been employed to identify pathways of sediments and solutes in various environmental conditions aquilanti et al 2013 2016 dahlke et al 2015 foppen et al 2011 2013 mahler et al 1998 mccluskey et al 2021 pang et al 2017 ptak et al 2004 sabir et al 1999 2000 viccione et al 2014 however these naked dna tracers showed attenuation up to 80 90 of injected mass which was mainly attributed to adsorption attachment and biological uptake dahlke et al 2015 foppen et al 2013 besides dna strands are subject to breakdown and degradation in the natural environment due to extracellular enzymes abundant microbial activity or elevated temperatures lindahl 1993 sabir et al 1999 tsuji et al 2017 such dna mass loss may be overcome by using a cover to protect the dna strands from the hostile environment so far silica coated dna encapsulated microparticles si dna microparticles and similar variants have been applied in hydrological tracing experiments as proof of concept garnett et al 2009 liao et al 2020 pang et al 2014 paunescu et al 2013 puddu et al 2014 a sharma et al 2021 a n sharma et al 2012 in multiplexed tracing experiments in streams and rivers dna tagged microparticles were traceable at greater distances compared to solute tracers and exhibited similar breakthrough behavior garnett et al 2009 pang et al 2020 a n sharma et al 2012 however the transport behavior of these dna tagged microparticle tracers has not been rigorously quantified and compared with that of solute tracers a mass balance accounting for sources and sinks is required for the understanding of si dna microparticles in transport behavior furthermore between dna tagged microparticles and ubiquitous natural substances in the aquatic environment i e organic and inorganic particles possible interactions should also be considered when necessary such knowledge is essential when selecting appropriate tracers for hydrological investigations therefore the objective of this paper was to understand and quantify the transport behavior of si dna microparticles in surface water tracing experiments our hypothesis was that when in colloidal stable conditions si dna microparticles have a transport behavior comparable to solute tracers in surface water injection experiments hereto we conducted a series of controlled injection experiments in 6 environmentally representative water types and compared the breakthrough curves btcs and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d si dna of si dna microparticles to that of nacl a solute tracer d nacl besides these laboratory scale experiments are vital for successful field scale tracing experiments for which a well developed methodology including reliable sample handling technique is indispensable mikutis et al 2018 this paper contributes to understanding the behavior of such novel dna tagged microparticle and anticipates the application potential in large scale tracing experiments providing insight in transport behavior of equivalent sized and mass particles in rivers 2 material methods 2 1 si dna microparticles and primers the si dna microparticles were the same as used in the study by mikutis et al 2018 provided by eth zurich the synthesized si dna microparticles were spheres with a narrow and unimodal size distribution the surface of si dna microparticles represents sio2 properties and no interference with dna chemistry is expected paunescu et al 2013 dna and primer sequences are given in the supporting information table s1 in the si 2 2 hydrodynamic radius and zeta potential of si dna microparticles the hydrodynamic radius rhdls of si dna microparticles in each water type 500 ppb was measured by dynamic light scattering dls and the zeta potential ζ of si dna microparticles was calculated by using smoluchowski s equation from their electrophoretic mobility measured on a nanosizer nano series malvern instrument ltd worcestershire united kingdom to assess if aggregations of si dna microparticles took place within the time frame of the injection experiment in each water type the rhdls was measured as a function of time in quiescent and in mixing conditions respectively thereto in each water type si dna microparticles were suspended to reach a final concentration of 500 ppb of 2 ml in duplicate each sample tube was sonicated to reach a homogenous suspension before the first measurement after the first measurement of rhdls one sample was allowed to stand still while the other sample was mixed at 1500 rpm until the next measurement in 2 h 2 3 injection experiments injection experiments of tracers are widely conducted to obtain btcs to understand transport behavior because they are simple to carry out and give good and reliable results leibundgut and seibert 2011 a series of pulse injection experiments with si dna microparticles was performed in 6 water types in a horizontally placed pvc box fig 1 the channel was 20 cm long 10 cm wide and 3 cm deep tracers were injected by a peristaltic pump the injection experiment had a flow rate of 18 ml min and a duration of approximately 100 min hydraulic retention time was 28 5 min for each experiment a 10 ml suspension of 5 ppb si dna microparticles was injected due to the low flow rate a magnetic stirrer was set close 2 cm to the inlet point to enhance cross sectional mixing of tracer mass we assumed that tracer mass was mixed rapidly but not instantaneous over the entire cross section so that the impact of the mixing in the so called initial period on the transport in the investigated reach was negligible rieckermann et al 2005 whereby the mixing was not represented by the 1 d advection dispersion process a solute fluorescent dye tracer was added once to visualize mixing conditions and the transport pathway of the injected tracer mass in the box see details in the si sampling was carried out at the outlet the sampling interval progressively increased from 1 to 5 min see table s2 in the si from each of the sample bottle 500 μl of sub sample was taken in duplicate for sample analysis sample bottles were vortexed for 1 to 2 min before taking sub samples ensuring that si dna microparticles were homogeneously distributed over the entire sample volume each injection experiment was performed three times the 1st and 2nd injection experiments were sequentially performed with a break of 0 5 h to rinse the set up to remove possible residual substances from the previous experiment the 3rd injection experiment was performed later after each experiment extra water samples were analyzed for any residual tracer in the pvc box see fig 1 first a pulse injection experiment of nacl 5 0 mm emsure merck kgaa a solute tracer was performed in triplicate for reference the btc of nacl was measured by an electrical conductivity ec meter multi 3620 ids xylem analytics germany gmbh germany and mass recovery was calculated see the standard curve on page s5 in the si similarly to the nacl injection experiment si dna microparticle tests were conducted in 6 representative water types demi water was chosen as a blank control furthermore we used a 5 0 mm nah2po4 h2o solution j t baker and a 1 67 mm cacl2 2h2o emsure merck kgaa solution to anticipate the effects of monovalent dalas and koutsoukos 1990 ji et al 2020 and divalent cations liu et al 2010 this group of synthetic chemical solutions were prepared in the laboratory tap water was used as a transition water type which was more complex than the synthetic chemical solutions but less complex than natural water in the sense that various natural or anthropogenic nanoparticles colloidal particles or particulate matter 5 μm could still be part of that water also two natural surface water samples were collected from a canal in delft one of which was filtered 5 μm cellulose nitrate filters referred to as filtered natural water and the other was not referred to as natural water the canal receives its water from both rhine river and meuse river in this way we tested for the effect of particulate matter concentrations of major cations and anions of tap water and natural water samples were measured by ion chromatography methrohm ag when performing the 3rd series of replicate experiments the organic matter content of the water types was measured as dissolved organic carbon doc in mg c l using the combustion technique with a total organic carbon analyser toc vcpn tn shimadzu japan before the injection experiments to assess if the pvc material could be a possible sink for dna mass loss during injection experiments the concentration of si dna microparticles in demi water was determined as a function of time in batch experiments for 7 days an extended period was designed as an extreme condition the suspension of si dna microparticles in demi water was kept in pvc containers and protected against daylight at room temperature no mass loss of si dna microparticles was observed results shown in fig s3 in the si 2 4 sample analysis quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr was used to quantify dna concentrations of the samples from the injection experiments prior to qpcr analysis samples were centrifuged washed and re suspended before dissolving silica coating after extensive testing some adjustments were made to the original protocol in paunescu et al 2013 such as increasing centrifugal force and duration washing samples with demi water and enhanced mixing see centrifugation procedure and quality control in the si to minimize manual errors a high precision pipetting robot qiagility benchtop instrument was used to mix reagents the silica coating was dissolved within 10 min by adding 1 μl buffered oxide etch boe solution 2 3 g of nh4fhf sigma aldrich and 1 9 g of nh4f j t baker in 10 ml water to

based master mixes roche sequencing and life science on a bio rad miniopticon the details of qpcr reaction setup and cycling parameters are provided in the si the qpcr readings i e cq were converted into dna concentration mg ml and plotted against time to produce a btc fig 1 the conversion equation and mass recovery calculations are provided in the si hereafter we compared the obtained btcs of si dna microparticles with that of nacl 2 5 analysis of btcs the physical transport of solutes and si dna microparticles in the injection experiments can be described by a one dimensional advection and dispersion equation with a first order mass transfer transient storage we used the one dimensional transport with inflow and storage model otis to model the curves runkel 1998 otis was chosen because our experimental set up mimics 1 d steady uniform flow in a main channel with a storage zone without lateral inflow besides dna mass was conserved during injection experiments since no source or sink of dna mass was observed in our experimental channel therefore no mass loss term was considered in the otis modelling the goals were to fit the observed btc and to quantify d si dna of the si dna microparticles the fitting was carried out using nonlinear least squares by requiring an input of observed btc see details in the si which was implemented in otis p in a modelling case where mass is conserved the injected mass should equal to the recovered total mass which is the area under the observed btc in spite of no mass loss this total recovered dna mass calculated from the observed btc can differ from the measured injected dna mass to some extent see more discussion in 3 2 to resolve the imbalance of input output mass we scaled the mass recoveries to 100 by linearly correcting the initial injection mass before otis modelling this linear correction of the injected mass has no influence on the characteristics of the btcs pang et al 2017 and can be used for dispersion estimation

results discussion 3 1 btcs of si dna microparticles and the effect of water quality hydrodynamics water quality ph ec doc tss and major chemical compositions of 6 water types used for the injection experiments are given in table 1 the zeta potential of the si dna microparticles was between 17 7 1 mv and 49 8 5 9 mv and the mean rhdls was between 237 81 nm and 299 129 nm measured before the injection experiments table 1 in the quiescent condition and as a function of time the mean rhdls and pdi of si dna microparticles remained constant for each water type fig 2 a a one way anova revealed that there was no significant difference p 0 3 at 95 significance level among mean rhdls and pdi of si dna microparticles however when mixing the rhdls and pdi significantly increased p values 0 05 at 95 significance level in cacl2 tap water filtered and unfiltered natural water while in demi water and in phosphate solution the rhdls and pdi remained constant as a function of time fig 2 b generally the btcs of the si dna microparticles in all water types showed a close resemblance to the btcs of nacl fig 3 s7 the c c0 of the nacl btc demonstrated a sharp increase and then reached a peak of roughly 2 at 4th minute which was followed by a slow decline 1 at 24 min fig 3 when compared with si dna microparticles the c c0 of si dna microparticles were noisier than the nacl btc moreover comparing si dna btcs within the group of laboratory prepared waters the btcs in cacl2 were slightly noisier than those in demi and nah2po4 also the si dna btcs were more scattered in tap water filtered natural water and natural water in other words the observed relative concentrations of si dna microparticles around the peaks were more scattered as compositions of solution became more complex exhibiting higher peak values than those of nacl tracers in particular the si dna btcs in the filtered natural water and natural water were most scattered with the largest discrepancy among the triplicates water quality including ionic strength natural organic matter nom content and suspended solids are important factors determining the fate of engineered nano and micro particles in water bodies shevlin et al 2018 in our experiments the ionic strength of used water types was in the range of 1 25 mm based on the measured concentrations of known cations and anions table 1 note that compared to studies which focused on the effect of ionic strength on colloidal interactions ledin and karlsson 1993 j f mccarthy et al 2002 nocito gobel and tobiason 1996 torkzaban et al 2008 zhao et al 2021 the ionic strength of water types used in this paper was in the low range in such solution chemistry si dna microparticles remained colloidally stable evidenced by a constant hydrodynamic radius over 4 h fig 2 a this indicated that the solution chemistry alone was unfavorable for aggregation of si dna microparticles metin et al 2014 specifically the calculated total energy barriers based on classical dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1993 verwey 1947 for si dna microparticles in demi and nah2po4 solution were relatively high 50 kt with negligible secondary minima see table s3 in the si for the details of dlvo energy calculations such high repulsive energy would prevent aggregation of si dna microparticles in the solution chemistry in cacl2 tap filtered natural and natural waters the reduction of zeta potentials table 1 can be explained by the compression of the electric double layer indicating a likely lower total energy barrier elimelech et al 2013 in contrast to the quiescent condition no shear force after 2 h of mixing the increase of rhdls in cacl2 phosphate tap filtered and unfiltered natural water fig 2 b indicated shear induced aggregation i e orthokinetic flocculation barthelmes et al 2003 hijnen and clegg 2014 spicer 1997 moreover when a flow field acts on the suspension the hydrodynamic force e g shear force is responsible for bringing the particles together and would likely dominate the particle collisions elimelech et al 2013 frungieri et al 2020 zaccone et al 2009 thus it is reasonable to imply that shear induced aggregation might have taken place during the injection experiments however we argue that the effect of aggregation is likely minor as the coupled effect of shear rate and volume friction gregory 2005 in our experiments was orders of magnitude lower than that in our batch mixing experiments the btcs of si dna microparticles in filtered and unfiltered natural water showed similar characteristics with a degree of scatter in the peaks fig 3 despite the variations in water quality parameters between the third and the preceding two series of experiments table 1 there was a time gap between the first two series and the third series the interactions between natural particulates and nanoparticles were extensively studied in literature lead et al 2018 oney and nason 2021 peijnenburg et al 2015 petosa et al 2010 praetorius et al 2020 quik et al 2013 velzeboer et al 2014 xu et al 2020 for example quik and co workers found that natural particulates played a key role in the increased hetero aggregation and sedimentation of nanomaterials by comparing filtered and unfiltered natural water samples quik et al 2013 however the effect of particulate matter content 5 μm on the transport characteristics of si dna microparticle was not clearly observed in our injection experiments 3 2 d and colloidal stability after re scaling mass recoveries to 100 without changing the btc behavior we modelled the btcs of all injection experiments to determine d and α fig 4 and table 1 the rising and falling limbs of nacl btcs were modelled almost perfectly fig 3 panel a r2 99 8 and the peaks of nacl btcs were slightly underestimated this showed that the otis conceptualization 1d ade with one transient storage was well capable of mimicking the experimental set up even though there was a small discrepancy between the schematisation of otis and experimental set up in the 1d representation in otis the tracer mass is uniformly distributed over the cross sectional area we used a stirrer to achieve cross sectional mixing and the time required to achieve this was not incorporated in our otis modelling meanwhile stirring enhanced the extent of the interaction between tracers and the storage zone so that tracer spreading caused by storage exchange reached an equilibrium stage soon after tracers entered the channel harvey and wagner 2000 this storage contribution was visible in the long tail of the btcs indicating a diffusion limited steady state storage moreover the calculated damkohler number dai is 10 see eq s6 in the si also suggested the dominance of the storage process caused by enhanced mixing thus fitting the resultant long tail using a higher exchange rate compromised the fitting of the peak details of otis model implementation are provided in the si this effect could also be seen in the rest of btcs of si dna microparticles regardless of solution chemistry and colloidal stability mean d si dna was essentially similar across 6 water types and was comparable to d nacl fig 4 the same was observed for the mean αsi dna the size of the confidence intervals of d si dna and αsi dna were directly related to btc noisy behavior when we plotted the variations against relative concentration we observed that uncertainties were more associated with tails than peaks of btcs in all water types of which natural waters filtered and non filtered had the largest coefficient variations fig s8 in natural waters co transporting with nom and the likely presence of inorganic particles of various size ranges si dna microparticles were also subject to more complicated interactions such as steric acid base forces etc grasso et al 2002 likely resulting in some random attachment and detachment e g flocculation and breakage due to shear forces this could possibly contribute to a more irregular or noisier si dna btc resulting in a larger confidence interval uncertainty of d si dna in natural waters likewise schiperski et al also showed a similar range of dispersion estimations of silica fluorescent particles of micron size to those of solute tracers in a karst river drainage system despite differences in the surface properties of the particle tracers schiperski et al 2016 the effect of hydrodynamics on colloidal particle transport in subsurface environments is widely studied elimelech et al 2013 sasidharan et al 2014 torkzaban et al 2007 however in surface waters less research focuses on quantitatively comparing colloids in the size range of 200 400 nm such as si dna microparticles to that of solutes recently dna tagged alginate coated microparticles with a similar negative surface charge in stream injection experiments showed to behave similarly to solute tracers in rising limb and peak of btcs albeit without quantification pang et al 2020 besides among the few studies most used particles of much larger size such as natural organic inorganic particulates fluorescent latex particles e coli and titanium dioxide particles and focused on distribution and fate without quantification of dispersion behavior drummond et al 2014 jamieson et al 2005 karwan and saiers 2009 newbold et al 2005 phillips et al 2019 spencer et al 2011 wyer et al 2010 3 3 mass recovery and data uncertainty the mass recovery of each injection experiment is of fundamental importance for quantifying transport behavior of si dna microparticles we analyzed all samples and randomly performed lab duplicates the mass recovery of si dna microparticles with known initial concentration was calculated and ranged between 88 and 118 table 1 in demi water where minimal impurity or interfering ion was present the mass recoveries of si dna microparticles ranged between 91 and 97 in such case the si dna mass was considered fully recovered a mass ambiguity of less than 10 is well within the expected mass ambiguity range 20 which is due to the accuracy of qpcr reading and uncertainty of particle concentration foppen et al 2013 paunescu et al 2015 qpcr technology is only accurate on a logarithmic scale from our experimental data the difference of cq values between replicates varied from 0 07 to 0 2 which resulted in a concentration difference of 5 20 07 to 14 8 20 2 such variation error of cq values was inevitable because errors may propagate from pipetting or intrinsic variances of enzymatic efficiency due to minor temperature differences in the qpcr apparatus foppen et al 2013 besides a variety of factors including the water quality of samples could also influence the enzymatic activity gibson et al 2012 zipper et al 2003 moreover subsampling is required when transferring a large environmental sample size into a much smaller sample size for qpcr analysis when taking subsamples the sample volume has to contain a sufficient number of particles such that variations are statistically insignificant crowe 2012 in samples with diluted si dna microparticles up to a 20 difference in particle concentration between two samples can arise from a few particles difference resulting in qpcr signal variations when subsamples and replicates were taken for qpcr assay kittilä et al 2019 this is most likely to encounter for samples collected from large scale environmental water bodies however in our laboratory experiments such quantification uncertainty associated with particle concentration was trivial as the qpcr amplification result as a function of the particle concentration the 10 fold dilution curve in the si suggested that the particle quantification by amplifying dna was consistent over a range of particle concentration down to 10 8 mg ml additionally we speculate that the discrete nature of such heavier than fluid particles with a certain spread of size distribution might be the origin of the fluctuations in btcs won et al 2019 it would be very convenient if the size distribution was very limited such that every particle is essentially subject to the identical transport characteristics future research is warranted to assess the possible impact of particle size distribution on si dna microparticle transport in surface waters the differences in fluctuations of si dna btcs may arise from particle characteristics e g particle size distributions environmental conditions e g hydrodynamic forces and qpcr analytical methods contributing to the overall more irregularities in si dna btcs than nacl btcs a similar trend of fluctuations in si dna btc was also reported even more evidently in recent studies on dna tagged microparticles and their tracing applicability in environmental and hydrological investigations e g pang et al 2020 c wang et al 2019 nevertheless increasing the injected tracer mass and up concentrating from a larger sample volume into a smaller sample volume could be beneficial for obtaining better quality btcs kittilä et al 2019 4 conclusion we concluded that the transport behavior of si dna microparticles resembled that of nacl in surface water relevant conditions evidenced by btcs with a similar range of d with special attention paid to mass balance the si dna microparticles as colloids had overall more erratic btcs than solute tracers whereby the scatter increased a function of water quality complexity the overall larger confidence interval of dsi dna we contributed to the discrete nature of colloidal particles with a certain particle size distribution and possible minor shear induced aggregation this research established a solid methodological foundation for field application of si dna microparticles in surface water tracing despite the fluctuations of signals in btcs si dna microparticles possess promising potential as surrogates for colloids of sub micron size in surface water tracing experiments author contributions the manuscript was written through

1408,accurate characterization of hydraulic parameters is vital for modeling subsurface flow and transport in the past decade ensemble based methods have been widely applied in estimating unknown parameters from state measurements however these methods require sufficiently large ensemble sizes to guarantee the accuracy of the ensemble averaged parameter sensitivities leading to heavy computational burdens especially in large scale problems although different surrogates have been introduced to alleviate the computational burden the sensitivity information therein is still calculated by sampling the surrogate therefore the sampling error is still inevitable in this study we propose an adaptive gaussian process gp based iterative smoother gpis algorithm in which the parameter sensitivity indices are analytically derived from the gp surrogate during the iterations the gp surrogate is adaptively refined by taking the updated parameter realizations as new base points both numerical and experimental cases are conducted to test the effectiveness of gpis we also compare its performance in estimating the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field with that of its prototype iterative ensemble smoother ies and our previously developed gp based iterative ensemble smoother gpies results show that using the gp derived sensitivity indices gpis shows advantages over gpies in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational efficiency although subsurface flow and transport problems are considered in this work the proposed method can be equally applied in other hydrological problems keywords hydraulic conductivity parameter inversion gaussian process surrogate iterative smoother 1 introduction accurate characterization of subsurface hydraulic parameters is vital for modeling subsurface flow and transport however direct measurements of these parameters are usually costly and even infeasible recent researches have focused on inferring these parameters indirectly from easily obtained state measurements through data assimilation methods ju et al 2018a 2018b nowak and cirpka 2006 ye and khaleel 2008 among various data assimilation methods the ensemble kalman filter enkf and the ensemble smoother es have been widely used in estimating subsurface hydraulic parameters oliver and chen 2011 zhou et al 2014 compared to enkf es can address the parameter state inconsistency issue by simultaneously assimilating the historical measurements applications of es in hydrologic inverse problems can be found in bailey and baù 2012 crestani et al 2013 li et al 2018 however the performance of es in nonlinear problems may be compromised due to the following two reasons first es is based on the linear estimation theory making it inherently optimal for linear problems second unlike the sequential data assimilation in enkf es assimilates all data together in only one step which is equivalent to a linear minimization based on a single linear approximation xu et al 2021 to improve the performance in nonlinear cases iteration has been introduced to the es algorithm for example chen and oliver 2012 proposed an iterative ensemble smoother ies also called batch enrml which seeks solution through minimizing an ensemble of cost functions directly by a gradient method emerick and reynolds 2013 developed an iterative form of es with multiple data assimilation es mda which approximates the solution by a recursion of the es equation through inflating the measurement errors xu et al 2021 compared es mda with restart enkf r enkf for identifying a contaminant source and hydraulic conductivity and found it can do much better than r enkf with increased computational cost evensen 2018 compared es ies and es mda based on bayes theorem and found that these three methods produced same results for linear models but the two iterative ones showed better performance in nonlinear situations also ies and es mda converged to different solutions in nonlinear cases due to their different ways of seeking solutions the key in enkf and its variants such as es and ies is to compute the sensitivity information between model parameters and state variables from an ensemble of realizations previous studies have reported that the ensemble size significantly influences the estimation accuracy with larger ensemble sizes leading to higher accuracy fishman 2013 on the other hand a large ensemble size will impose a heavy computational burden especially in large scale problems the iteration process in ies further increases the computational cost one promising approach to alleviate the computational burden is to replace complex models with surrogate models which are constructed to approximate the outputs of a complex model at low computational cost asher et al 2015 razavi et al 2012 different surrogate based iess have been developed for data assimilation chang et al 2017 combined both the pce and the interpolation based surrogates with ies to estimate hydraulic conductivities in subsurface flow problems in our previous work ju et al 2018b we proposed to combine the adaptive gp surrogate with ies and found that gpies achieves about one order of magnitude of speed up although showing certain advantages the above mentioned surrogate based iess still calculate the sensitivity information between model parameters and state variables by sampling the surrogate therefore the sampling error is still inevitable in fact the sensitivity indices between model parameters and state variables can be analytically derived from the gp surrogate wang et al 2021 the gp derived sensitivity indices have been successfully combined with the extended kalman filter ekf ko and fox 2009 combined the gp derived sensitivity jacobian matrix with ekf and found that the gp ekf algorithm outperforms its parametric counterpart in blimp tracking experiments to the best of our knowledge there is no existing study about using gp derived analytic sensitivities for inverse modeling in hydrological problems extended from our previous work ju et al 2018b and inspired by the advantages of gp we propose an adaptive gp based iterative smoother for subsurface parameter characterization in this study the new algorithm is promising in that the parameter sensitivity indices are analytically derived from the gp surrogate which can be refined adaptively during iterations furthermore the calculation of the gp based sensitivities is non intrusive so that only repetitive executions of the deterministic solver are required the rest of the paper is organized as follows we start by presenting the methodology in the next section then we test the applicability of the gpis algorithm through three cases in section 3 finally some conclusions are provided in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 iterative ensemble smoother assuming that an arbitrary hydrologic system can be represented in the following way 1 y obs f m ε where yobs denotes the measurement vector f represents the system model m is a vector consisting of unknown parameters and ε represents the normally distributed measurement errors with zero mean and covariance cd e εεt with the perturbed entire historical measurements the parameter ensemble can be iteratively updated using the following formula chen and oliver 2012 2 m l 1 β l m 0 1 β l m l β

iteration index while the subscript denotes the ensemble number index m0 is the initial ensemble derived from the prior distribution β l is an adjustment parameter for the iteration step length cm denotes the prior model covariance matrix and remains unchanged with iteration g l is the ensemble averaged sensitivity matrix which can be obtained by solving δd l g l δm l using the singular value decomposition gu and oliver 2007 here d l d l d l and m l m l m l are the mean removed model outputs ensemble and model parameters ensemble at the lth iteration respectively to choose a reasonable value for β l at each iteration a data mismatch term is defined as below gu and oliver 2007 3 s m l j 1 n e f m j l y obs j t c d 1 f m j l y obs j if s m l 1 s m l then replace m l with m l 1 and increase β l otherwise keep m l and decrease β l the iteration continues until the convergence criterion is met i e s m l 1 s m l γ s m l where γ is a preset convergence ratio 2 2 gp derived jacobian matrix for the given model f m a gp surrogate g m can be constructed to approximate the relationship between the model parameters and model outputs g m conforms to a gaussian stochastic process and can be specified by a mean function μ m and a covariance function k m m such that 4 g m gp μ m k m m suppose we have the model outputs f m evaluated at n parameter realizations b mb 1 mb n which we call base points and then g m can be obtained through conditioning on these base points the conditional process denoted as g b m is still a gaussian process the mean and variance of g b m at an arbitrary parameter realization m can be given as williams and rasmussen 2006 5 μ b m μ m k m b t k b b 1 f b μ b and 6 σ b 2 m k m m k m b t k b b 1 k m b eq 5 can be used to approximate the original model output f m while eq 6 gives the corresponding approximation error which can be diminished through adding more base points in the local region the most widely used squared exponential kernel shown in eq 7 is adopted to measure the similarity between two input points m and m in this study for its convenience in analytically deriving the jacobian with respect to the inputs 7 k m m σ f 2 exp 1 2 m m w m m t where σ f 2 is the variance w diag 1 η 1 2 1 η d in 2 is a diagonal matrix η i is the correlation length d in is the dimensionality of the input space for each output dimension the jacobian of the gp mean function eq 5 can be expressed as 8 μ b m m k m b m t k b b 1 f b μ b the jacobian of the kernel function with respect to the input m can be written as 9 k m b m k m m b 1 m 1 k m m b 1 m d in k m m b n m 1 k m m b n m d in where n is the number of training points for the squared exponential kernel the derivative of the kernel between m and a training point mb i is 10 k m m

full d out d in jacobian matrix j of an observation model is determined by stacking d out jacobian vectors together 2 3 the adaptive gp based iterative smoother the flowchart of the gpis algorithm is illustrated in fig 1 and described as follows step 1 randomly draw n ini base points mb i and the initial parameter vector m0 from the prior distribution and evaluate the corresponding function values f mb i i 1 2 n ini step 2 build the gp surrogate by conditioning to the base points and analytically derive the jacobian matrix j at the parameter vector from the gp surrogate step 3 use the perturbed measurements to update the parameter vector using the following formula 11 m l 1 β l m 0 1 β l m l β l c m j l t c d j l c m j l t 1 f m l y obs j l m l m 0 as shown in the above formula the sensitivity matrix g l in eq 2 is replaced by the gp derived jacobian matrix j specifically a new error term ε consisting of both the surrogate model error εgp and measurement error ε i e ε ε εgp is used in eq 1 to avoid an over confident estimation step 4 evaluate the original model f at the updated parameter vector and add it into the existing set of base points construct a refined gp surrogate by conditioning to the new set of base points and derive the jacobian matrix j at the updated parameter vector step 5 repeat steps 2 4 until the stop criterion is met in this study the total number of original model simulations n ori determines the computational cost thus the computational cost of gpis is mainly from constructing the gp surrogate i e generating the model outputs with parameter base points suppose the number of iterations in ies gpies and gpis is iter ies iter gpies and iter gpis respectively then the n ori values for the three different algorithms are as follows n e iter ies 1 for ies n ini n add iter gpies for gpies and n ini iter gpis for gpis here n e denotes the ensemble size for ies n ini denotes the number of initial base points and n add denotes the number of added base points at each iteration of gpies usually n ini is much smaller than n e furthermore n add in gpies is always larger than one that in gpis leading to an accelerated gp refinement at the cost of higher computational cost on the other hand due to the gp approximation error and its decline during iterations the required number of iterations of gpis iter gpis is slightly larger than that of ies iter ies and gpies iter gpies on the whole the computational cost of gpis is significantly reduced compared to that of ies and gpies this will be demonstrated in the following case studies 3 case studies in this section the applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three cases the first analytical case is set up to demonstrate the ability of gp in deriving sensitivity indices while the latter two cases are implemented to test the validity of gpis in estimating heterogeneous conductivities in groundwater flow and transport problems respectively 3 1 case 1 validation of the gp derived sensitivity indices to test the ability of gp in deriving sensitivity indices the methodology in section 2 2 is first applied to the g function saltelli and sobol 1995 which is commonly used to illustrate and justify sensitivity techniques glen and isaacs 2012 sobol and kucherenko 2009 the g function for d in inputs x 1 x d in has the following form 12 g x 1 x d in i 1 d in 4 x i 2 a i 1 a i where the input variables x i i 1 2 d in are uniformly distributed over 0 1 a i 0 represents the weighting coefficient and it measures the contribution of each input x i to the variability of the model output with lower values indicating more significant contributions in this study we set a i k referring to the work of marrel et al 2008 the partial derivative for an input variable x i can be analytically computed as follows 13 δg δ x i 4 1 a i j i 4 x j 2 a j 1 a j 0 x i 1 2 4 1 a i j i 4 x j 2 a j 1 a j 1 2 x i 1 the effects of the number of training points n b on the accuracy of the gp derived sensitivities are first examined for a relatively low input dimension in this test the input dimension d in is chosen as 4 and different n b values i e n b 20 50 100 200 500 1000 are considered the analytical and gp derived sensitivities at 100 randomly chosen test points are compared in fig 2 it is seen that with the increasing n b value the distribution of circles along the 1 1 line becomes more concentrated and the determination coefficient r 2 between the analytical and gp derived sensitivities keeps increasing indicating the improved accuracy of the gp derived sensitivity information this occurs because increasing the number of training points leads to a more accurate gp surrogate and thus to more accurate sensitivity information we then derive sensitivities from the gp surrogate under different conditions of d in value i e d in 4 8 12 16 20 30 40 to test the effects of the input dimension for the given n b value of 200 the analytical and gp derived sensitivities at 100 randomly chosen test points under different conditions of input dimension are compared in fig 3 we can see that as the input dimension increases the distribution of circles along the 1 1 line becomes more dispersed and r 2 between the analytical and gp derived sensitivities is on the decline indicating the decreased accuracy of the gp derived sensitivities the underlying reason is that the gp surrogate suffers from the curse of dimensionality and it needs more training data to maintain the accuracy of the derived sensitivities as the input dimension becomes large 3 2 case 2 application of gpis in the groundwater flow problem the second case is synthetic and used to evaluate the performance of the gpis algorithm in estimating the hydraulic conductivity field we apply gpis to a two dimensional 2 d transient groundwater flow problem which satisfies the following equation 14 s s h t x ks x h x z ks z h z q x z where s s is the specific storage l 1 h is the hydraulic head l t is the time t k sx z is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the corresponding direction lt 1 q x z is the source or sink term at location x z l 3 t 1 the governing equation is solved numerically with the finite element solver comsol multiphysics as shown in fig 4 the model domain has a size of 2 l 1 l and is evenly discretized into 5000 100 50 elements the upper boundary has a constant hydraulic head of 1 l while the other boundaries are impermeable the initial condition for the hydraulic head in the domain is set at a level of 1 l the specific storage s s is assumed to be homogeneous taking a value of 1 10 4 l 1 the total simulation period is chosen as 0 02 t during the whole simulation process all wells denoted as filled circles in fig 4 follow a constant pumping rate of 1 l 3 t 1 the simulated transient hydraulic heads are observed at the 50 observation locations denoted by the hollow circles in fig 4 with a time interval of 0 05 t in this case only the hydraulic conductivity in the model domain is assumed heterogeneous and to be estimated the log transformed conductivity field lnk s is modeled as a spatially correlated gaussian random field with the following statistics 15 ln k s 2 ln lt 1 16 c ln k s r σ ln k s 2 1 1 5 r ς 0 5 r ς 3 r ς 0 r ς where ln k s denotes the mean component σ lnk s 2 1 is the variance r represents the distance between two arbitrary locations x 1 z 1 and x 2 z 2 ς is the spatial correlation length r ς x 1 x 2 2 η x 2 z 1 z 2 2 η z 2 η x l x 0 45 η z l z 0 35 η x z and l x z denote the correlation length and domain size in the corresponding direction respectively the sequential gaussian simulation sgsim tool in the geostatistical simulation library gslib deutsch and journel 1995 is employed to generate the reference lnk s field the true hydraulic head measurements are acquired from simulation results using a randomly chosen reference field the measurement errors are assumed to be gaussian distributed with zero mean and standard deviation of 1 10 3 l the perturbed measurements are then used to estimate the lnk s field through the standard ies previously developed gpies and newly developed gpis to ensure the reliability of the estimation results we set the convergence ratio γ as 1 10 4 the initial parameter ensemble realizations for ies are also randomly generated using the sgsim tool to improve the computational efficiency of gpies and gpis we parameterize the lnk s field using the karhunen loève kl expansion zhang and lu 2004 in the following way 17 ln k s x z ln k s i 1 n kl ξ i τ i f i x z where ξ i represents independent gaussian random variables τ i and f i x z denote the ith eigenvalue and ith eigenfunction of the covariance function shown in eq 16 respectively n kl is the number of retained kl terms in this case we set n kl 30 which can keep 89 of the total field variance in this way the dimension of the parameter field is reduced from 5000 to 30 the initial parameter realizations for gpies and gpis are then randomly generated through the kl expansion the estimation accuracy of the three different algorithms is evaluated with the root mean square error rmse of the estimated parameters or the predicted states rmse for a variable v can be calculated using the following formula 18 rmse v 1 n i 1 n v i v r i 2 here v represents the values of the estimated parameters on all elements or predicted states at the observation locations while v r denotes the reference true values of the corresponding variables n is the number of elements or measurements with i denoting its index smaller rmse values indicate higher estimation accuracy since ies is a monto carlo based algorithm its performance can be affected by the ensemble size a common approach to determin the approximately optimal ensemble size in such algorithms is based on sensitivity experiments which test the algorithms sensitivity to the size of the ensemble chen and zhang 2006 xu et al 2021 yin et al 2015 in this paper different ensemble sizes i e n e 50 100 200 300 400 600 are tested to determine the ensemble size required to achieve satisfactory performance to give a fair comparison ies is run 10 times with different sets of initial parameter realizations for each tested ensemble size fig 5 plots the rmse m rmse for estimated parameters and iter number of required iterations values as a function of ensemble size it can be seen that rmse m and iter values decrease as the ensemble size increases from 40 to 300 but almost no changes can be detected when the ensemble size increases beyond 300 besides the lengths of error bars in both figures decrease first before the ensemble size increasing to 300 and then keep stable after that indicating convergence of these two indicators this occurs because a larger ensemble size guarantees more accurate sensitivity information leading to more accurate estimations and an accelerated convergence thus in this case the reasonable ensemble size is chosen as 300 i e n e 300 which is also used for gpies in the following calculations in gpies the recommended settings determined in our previous work ju et al 2018b i e n ini 10 n add 10 are used then gpies n e 300 n ini 10 n add 10 is also repeatedly implemented 10 times with different initial ensemble realizations to give a fair comparison we also set n ini 10 in gpis and repeat the implementation with 10 different initial parameter sets the estimated mean lnk s fields given by ies n e 300 gpies n e 300 n ini 10 n add 10 and gpis n ini 10 are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that all the estimated lnk s fields can capture the main patterns of the reference field specifically due to the utilization of dimension reduction the kl expansion the lnk s fields estimated by gpies and gpis are much smoother than that estimated by ies the computational settings and average performance indicator values for different algorithms are compared in table 1 as indicated by the rmse m and rmse h rmse for the predicted heads values gpis and gpies achieve satisfactory estimation results compared with ies and gpis shows advantages over gpies in terms of estimation accuracy the average number of iterations required to reach convergence for different algorithms are as follows 6 for ies 11 for gpies and 26 for gpis in terms of computational efficiency gpis n ori 36 only needs about 1 60 of the computational cost required by ies n ori 2100 and 1 3 of the computational cost required by gpies n ori 120 thus gpis is superior to gpies in this case the underlying reason is that the gp derived analytic sensitivity indices used in gpis are more accurate than the ensemble averaged sensitivity information in gpies however due to the fact that only one base point can be added to refine the gp surrogate at each iteration of gpis it needs more iterations to reach convergence than gpies 3 3 case 3 application of gpis in the heat transport problem in this case a sandbox experiment fig 7 is implemented to validate gpis in the heat transport problem the plexiglass sandbox has an internal volume of 1 86 m 1 m 0 12 m width height depth during the experiment the flow system in the sandbox was driven by two constant head reservoirs the top 0 15 m of the sandbox was connected to reservoir 1 creating a constant hydraulic head of 0 906 m the middle part from h 0 05 m to h 0 85 m was filled with the same type of natural quartz sand grain size 0 15 1 mm which was added and packed layer by layer 0 2 m each the bottom 0 05 m of the sandbox was connected to reservoir 2 to create a constant head of 0 72 m the remaining boundaries were impermeable to simulate the heat transport the heater in reservoir 1 was turned on and off with a 2 h interval thus the water temperature approximated a sinusoidal variation with a period of 4 h and a range of 23 33 c as shown in figs 7 63 ports were cut out of the front wall to allow the installation of the thermistors omega hsth 44000 series with an accuracy of 0 1 c these sensors were connected to a campbell scientific cr1000 data acquisition system to monitor the temperature changes in the sandbox the experiment lasted 350 min with a sampling rate of 5 min more details about the sandbox experiment can be found in our previous works ju et al 2018a ju et al 2019 the sandbox experimental process can be described by the coupled hydro thermal model in which the steady state flow process is defined as 19 x k x h x z k z h z 0 subject to the boundary and initial conditions 20 h γ 1 h 1 h γ 2 h 2 and h t 0 h 0 and the darcy water velocity q can be calculated from 21 q x k x h x 22 q z k z h z where h 0 is the initial hydraulic head h 1 and h 2 are the prescribed hydraulic heads assigned at dirichlet boundaries γ1 and γ2 respectively the heat transport equation is written as bear 1972 23 t t k e x t x t z ρ w c w ρc q x t x q z t z where t is the temperature c t is the time d q x z is the darcy flux density in the corresponding direction m d 1 k e is the effective thermal diffusivity k e λ ρc m 2 d 1 λ is the thermal conductivity of the saturated sediment λ λ w θ λ s 1 θ wm 1 c 1 λ w and λ s denote the thermal conductivity of the fluid and the solid matrix respectively w m 1 c 1 θ is the effective porosity of the sediment ρc is the volumetric heat capacity of the fluid saturated sediment ρc θρ w c w 1 θ ρ s c s j m 3 c 1 ρ w and ρ s are respectively the fluid s density and the matrix block s density kg m 3 c w and c s denote the heat capacity of the fluid and the matrix block respectively j kg 3 c 1 in this case comsol multiphysics is also employed to couple and solve the governing equations although the sandbox was filled with the same type of sand heterogeneity can still be induced by the non uniform packing and the grain size separation during packing zhao et al 2016 we model the lnk s field in the sandbox as a gaussian random field with the correlation function given in eq 16 the prior mean value is set as 3 13 ln md 1 which was determined from flow through tests considering that the filled sand only covers a narrow grain size range a value of 1 is assigned to the variance σ lnk s 2 we select the vertical correlation length as the thickness of each packed layer i e η z 0 2 m while using the horizontal correlation length η x 0 4 m the sandbox domain is discretized into 4000 100 40 elements we also employ the kl expansion to parameterize the lnk s field in the sandbox as per our previous work ju et al 2019 n kl 20 is chosen as the number of retained kl terms temperature measurements from the first 300 min assimilation period are respectively assimilated by ies n e 300 gpies n e 300 n ini 10 n add 10 and gpis n ini 10 to estimate the 20 gaussian variables while the measurements during the last 50 min validation period are used for validation purpose values of thermal parameters for the sand were previously determined by ju et al 2018a and are listed in table 2 the number of iterations required to reach convergence for different algorithms are as follows 9 for ies 13 for gpies and 36 for gpis the mean lnk s fields given by the three different algorithms are presented in fig 8 overall these estimation results show high similarity in terms of the computational cost the n ori of gpis is 37 which is much smaller than that of ies 3000 and gpies 140 since the true distribution of lnk s in the sandbox is unknown the estimation accuracy is compared by the ability to predict temperatures during the validation period with the estimated lnk s fields from different algorithms the n ori values and rmse values for temperature predictions rmse t are listed in table 3 we can see that the rmse t value for ies is again the smallest followed by gpis and gpies gives the largest value in summary gpis still gives better temperature predictions during the validation period than gpies it should be pointed out again that the computational cost of gpis is still less than one third of that of gpies in this experimental case 4 conclusions in this study a sampling free algorithm gpis has been proposed for subsurface parameter characterization the key idea is to analytically derive the parameter sensitivity indices from the gp surrogate and then use them in the solution of inverse problems the gp surrogate is adaptively refined using the updated parameter vectors during the iterations of gpis an analytical function is first employed to demonstrate the performance of gp in deriving the analytic sensitivities under different conditions i e different number of training data and varying input dimension then both numerical and sandbox experimental cases are tested to validate gpis in groundwater flow and heat transport problems respectively the overall results show that a gp surrogate with high accuracy leads to accurate parameter sensitivity information but more training data are required to maintain the accuracy of the surrogate as the input dimension increases by using the gp derived sensitivities gpis achieves more accurate estimation results with the efficiency improvement of 3 to 4 times compared with the previously proposed gpies algorithm it should be pointed out that although gpis shows certain advantages over gpies in the test cases it still suffers some limitations for example as a non ensemble based algorithm the estimation result of gpis only contains one parameter vector which makes the uncertainty estimation unavailable additionally the kl expansion is employed as a dimension reduction tool to parameterize the lnk s field in the test cases for gpis thus the gp surrogate is constructed in a relatively low parameter dimension however for cases with very small correlation scales the reduced dimensionality is still large and gpis may lose efficiency in such high dimensional i e d 100 problems to address this issue more efficient parametric dimensionality

1408,accurate characterization of hydraulic parameters is vital for modeling subsurface flow and transport in the past decade ensemble based methods have been widely applied in estimating unknown parameters from state measurements however these methods require sufficiently large ensemble sizes to guarantee the accuracy of the ensemble averaged parameter sensitivities leading to heavy computational burdens especially in large scale problems although different surrogates have been introduced to alleviate the computational burden the sensitivity information therein is still calculated by sampling the surrogate therefore the sampling error is still inevitable in this study we propose an adaptive gaussian process gp based iterative smoother gpis algorithm in which the parameter sensitivity indices are analytically derived from the gp surrogate during the iterations the gp surrogate is adaptively refined by taking the updated parameter realizations as new base points both numerical and experimental cases are conducted to test the effectiveness of gpis we also compare its performance in estimating the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field with that of its prototype iterative ensemble smoother ies and our previously developed gp based iterative ensemble smoother gpies results show that using the gp derived sensitivity indices gpis shows advantages over gpies in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational efficiency although subsurface flow and transport problems are considered in this work the proposed method can be equally applied in other hydrological problems keywords hydraulic conductivity parameter inversion gaussian process surrogate iterative smoother 1 introduction accurate characterization of subsurface hydraulic parameters is vital for modeling subsurface flow and transport however direct measurements of these parameters are usually costly and even infeasible recent researches have focused on inferring these parameters indirectly from easily obtained state measurements through data assimilation methods ju et al 2018a 2018b nowak and cirpka 2006 ye and khaleel 2008 among various data assimilation methods the ensemble kalman filter enkf and the ensemble smoother es have been widely used in estimating subsurface hydraulic parameters oliver and chen 2011 zhou et al 2014 compared to enkf es can address the parameter state inconsistency issue by simultaneously assimilating the historical measurements applications of es in hydrologic inverse problems can be found in bailey and baù 2012 crestani et al 2013 li et al 2018 however the performance of es in nonlinear problems may be compromised due to the following two reasons first es is based on the linear estimation theory making it inherently optimal for linear problems second unlike the sequential data assimilation in enkf es assimilates all data together in only one step which is equivalent to a linear minimization based on a single linear approximation xu et al 2021 to improve the performance in nonlinear cases iteration has been introduced to the es algorithm for example chen and oliver 2012 proposed an iterative ensemble smoother ies also called batch enrml which seeks solution through minimizing an ensemble of cost functions directly by a gradient method emerick and reynolds 2013 developed an iterative form of es with multiple data assimilation es mda which approximates the solution by a recursion of the es equation through inflating the measurement errors xu et al 2021 compared es mda with restart enkf r enkf for identifying a contaminant source and hydraulic conductivity and found it can do much better than r enkf with increased computational cost evensen 2018 compared es ies and es mda based on bayes theorem and found that these three methods produced same results for linear models but the two iterative ones showed better performance in nonlinear situations also ies and es mda converged to different solutions in nonlinear cases due to their different ways of seeking solutions the key in enkf and its variants such as es and ies is to compute the sensitivity information between model parameters and state variables from an ensemble of realizations previous studies have reported that the ensemble size significantly influences the estimation accuracy with larger ensemble sizes leading to higher accuracy fishman 2013 on the other hand a large ensemble size will impose a heavy computational burden especially in large scale problems the iteration process in ies further increases the computational cost one promising approach to alleviate the computational burden is to replace complex models with surrogate models which are constructed to approximate the outputs of a complex model at low computational cost asher et al 2015 razavi et al 2012 different surrogate based iess have been developed for data assimilation chang et al 2017 combined both the pce and the interpolation based surrogates with ies to estimate hydraulic conductivities in subsurface flow problems in our previous work ju et al 2018b we proposed to combine the adaptive gp surrogate with ies and found that gpies achieves about one order of magnitude of speed up although showing certain advantages the above mentioned surrogate based iess still calculate the sensitivity information between model parameters and state variables by sampling the surrogate therefore the sampling error is still inevitable in fact the sensitivity indices between model parameters and state variables can be analytically derived from the gp surrogate wang et al 2021 the gp derived sensitivity indices have been successfully combined with the extended kalman filter ekf ko and fox 2009 combined the gp derived sensitivity jacobian matrix with ekf and found that the gp ekf algorithm outperforms its parametric counterpart in blimp tracking experiments to the best of our knowledge there is no existing study about using gp derived analytic sensitivities for inverse modeling in hydrological problems extended from our previous work ju et al 2018b and inspired by the advantages of gp we propose an adaptive gp based iterative smoother for subsurface parameter characterization in this study the new algorithm is promising in that the parameter sensitivity indices are analytically derived from the gp surrogate which can be refined adaptively during iterations furthermore the calculation of the gp based sensitivities is non intrusive so that only repetitive executions of the deterministic solver are required the rest of the paper is organized as follows we start by presenting the methodology in the next section then we test the applicability of the gpis algorithm through three cases in section 3 finally some conclusions are provided in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 iterative ensemble smoother assuming that an arbitrary hydrologic system can be represented in the following way 1 y obs f m ε where yobs denotes the measurement vector f represents the system model m is a vector consisting of unknown parameters and ε represents the normally distributed measurement errors with zero mean and covariance cd e εεt with the perturbed entire historical measurements the parameter ensemble can be iteratively updated using the following formula chen and oliver 2012 2 m l 1 β l m 0 1 β l m l β l c m g l t c d g l c m g l t 1 f m l y obs g l m l m 0 in the above equation m l m1 l m2 l m n e l represents an ensemble of n e parameter samples at the lth iteration step the superscript denotes iteration index while the subscript denotes the ensemble number index m0 is the initial ensemble derived from the prior distribution β l is an adjustment parameter for the iteration step length cm denotes the prior model covariance matrix and remains unchanged with iteration g l is the ensemble averaged sensitivity matrix which can be obtained by solving δd l g l δm l using the singular value decomposition gu and oliver 2007 here d l d l d l and m l m l m l are the mean removed model outputs ensemble and model parameters ensemble at the lth iteration respectively to choose a reasonable value for β l at each iteration a data mismatch term is defined as below gu and oliver 2007 3 s m l j 1 n e f m j l y obs j t c d 1 f m j l y obs j if s m l 1 s m l then replace m l with m l 1 and increase β l otherwise keep m l and decrease β l the iteration continues until the convergence criterion is met i e s m l 1 s m l γ s m l where γ is a preset convergence ratio 2 2 gp derived jacobian matrix for the given model f m a gp surrogate g m can be constructed to approximate the relationship between the model parameters and model outputs g m conforms to a gaussian stochastic process and can be specified by a mean function μ m and a covariance function k m m such that 4 g m gp μ m k m m suppose we have the model outputs f m evaluated at n parameter realizations b mb 1 mb n which we call base points and then g m can be obtained through conditioning on these base points the conditional process denoted as g b m is still a gaussian process the mean and variance of g b m at an arbitrary parameter realization m can be given as williams and rasmussen 2006 5 μ b m μ m k m b t k b b 1 f b μ b and 6 σ b 2 m k m m k m b t k b b 1 k m b eq 5 can be used to approximate the original model output f m while eq 6 gives the corresponding approximation error which can be diminished through adding more base points in the local region the most widely used squared exponential kernel shown in eq 7 is adopted to measure the similarity between two input points m and m in this study for its convenience in analytically deriving the jacobian with respect to the inputs 7 k m m σ f 2 exp 1 2 m m w m m t where σ f 2 is the variance w diag 1 η 1 2 1 η d in 2 is a diagonal matrix η i is the correlation length d in is the dimensionality of the input space for each output dimension the jacobian of the gp mean function eq 5 can be expressed as 8 μ b m m k m b m t k b b 1 f b μ b the jacobian of the kernel function with respect to the input m can be written as 9 k m b m k m m b 1 m 1 k m m b 1 m d in k m m b n m 1 k m m b n m d in where n is the number of training points for the squared exponential kernel the derivative of the kernel between m and a training point mb i is 10 k m m b i m m σ f 2 exp 1 2 m m b i w m m b i t w m m b i k m m b i eq 8 defines the d in dimensional jacobian vector for a single output dimension if the dimensionality of the output space is d out the full d out d in jacobian matrix j of an observation model is determined by stacking d out jacobian vectors together 2 3 the adaptive gp based iterative smoother the flowchart of the gpis algorithm is illustrated in fig 1 and described as follows step 1 randomly draw n ini base points mb i and the initial parameter vector m0 from the prior distribution and evaluate the corresponding function values f mb i i 1 2 n ini step 2 build the gp surrogate by conditioning to the base points and analytically derive the jacobian matrix j at the parameter vector from the gp surrogate step 3 use the perturbed measurements to update the parameter vector using the following formula 11 m l 1 β l m 0 1 β l m l β l c m j l t c d j l c m j l t 1 f m l y obs j l m l m 0 as shown in the above formula the sensitivity matrix g l in eq 2 is replaced by the gp derived jacobian matrix j specifically a new error term ε consisting of both the surrogate model error εgp and measurement error ε i e ε ε εgp is used in eq 1 to avoid an over confident estimation step 4 evaluate the original model f at the updated parameter vector and add it into the existing set of base points construct a refined gp surrogate by conditioning to the new set of base points and derive the jacobian matrix j at the updated parameter vector step 5 repeat steps 2 4 until the stop criterion is met in this study the total number of original model simulations n ori determines the computational cost thus the computational cost of gpis is mainly from constructing the gp surrogate i e generating the model outputs with parameter base points suppose the number of iterations in ies gpies and gpis is iter ies iter gpies and iter gpis respectively then the n ori values for the three different algorithms are as follows n e iter ies 1 for ies n ini n add iter gpies for gpies and n ini iter gpis for gpis here n e denotes the ensemble size for ies n ini denotes the number of initial base points and n add denotes the number of added base points at each iteration of gpies usually n ini is much smaller than n e furthermore n add in gpies is always larger than one that in gpis leading to an accelerated gp refinement at the cost of higher computational cost on the other hand due to the gp approximation error and its decline during iterations the required number of iterations of gpis iter gpis is slightly larger than that of ies iter ies and gpies iter gpies on the whole the computational cost of gpis is significantly reduced compared to that of ies and gpies this will be demonstrated in the following case studies 3 case studies in this section the applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through three cases the first analytical case is set up to demonstrate the ability of gp in deriving sensitivity indices while the latter two cases are implemented to test the validity of gpis in estimating heterogeneous conductivities in groundwater flow and transport problems respectively 3 1 case 1 validation of the gp derived sensitivity indices to test the ability of gp in deriving sensitivity indices the methodology in section 2 2 is first applied to the g function saltelli and sobol 1995 which is commonly used to illustrate and justify sensitivity techniques glen and isaacs 2012 sobol and kucherenko 2009 the g function for d in inputs x 1 x d in has the following form 12 g x 1 x d in i 1 d in 4 x i 2 a i 1 a i where the input variables x i i 1 2 d in are uniformly distributed over 0 1 a i 0 represents the weighting coefficient and it measures the contribution of each input x i to the variability of the model output with lower values indicating more significant contributions in this study we set a i k referring to the work of marrel et al 2008 the partial derivative for an input variable x i can be analytically computed as follows 13 δg δ x i 4 1 a i j i 4 x j 2 a j 1 a j 0 x i 1 2 4 1 a i j i 4 x j 2 a j 1 a j 1 2 x i 1 the effects of the number of training points n b on the accuracy of the gp derived sensitivities are first examined for a relatively low input dimension in this test the input dimension d in is chosen as 4 and different n b values i e n b 20 50 100 200 500 1000 are considered the analytical and gp derived sensitivities at 100 randomly chosen test points are compared in fig 2 it is seen that with the increasing n b value the distribution of circles along the 1 1 line becomes more concentrated and the determination coefficient r 2 between the analytical and gp derived sensitivities keeps increasing indicating the improved accuracy of the gp derived sensitivity information this occurs because increasing the number of training points leads to a more accurate gp surrogate and thus to more accurate sensitivity information we then derive sensitivities from the gp surrogate under different conditions of d in value i e d in 4 8 12 16 20 30 40 to test the effects of the input dimension for the given n b value of 200 the analytical and gp derived sensitivities at 100 randomly chosen test points under different conditions of input dimension are compared in fig 3 we can see that as the input dimension increases the distribution of circles along the 1 1 line becomes more dispersed and r 2 between the analytical and gp derived sensitivities is on the decline indicating the decreased accuracy of the gp derived sensitivities the underlying reason is that the gp surrogate suffers from the curse of dimensionality and it needs more training data to maintain the accuracy of the derived sensitivities as the input dimension becomes large 3 2 case 2 application of gpis in the groundwater flow problem the second case is synthetic and used to evaluate the performance of the gpis algorithm in estimating the hydraulic conductivity field we apply gpis to a two dimensional 2 d transient groundwater flow problem which satisfies the following equation 14 s s h t x ks x h x z ks z h z q x z where s s is the specific storage l 1 h is the hydraulic head l t is the time t k sx z is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the corresponding direction lt 1 q x z is the source or sink term at location x z l 3 t 1 the governing equation is solved numerically with the finite element solver comsol multiphysics as shown in fig 4 the model domain has a size of 2 l 1 l and is evenly discretized into 5000 100 50 elements the upper boundary has a constant hydraulic head of 1 l while the other boundaries are impermeable the initial condition for the hydraulic head in the domain is set at a level of 1 l the specific storage s s is assumed to be homogeneous taking a value of 1 10 4 l 1 the total simulation period is chosen as 0 02 t during the whole simulation process all wells denoted as filled circles in fig 4 follow a constant pumping rate of 1 l 3 t 1 the simulated transient hydraulic heads are observed at the 50 observation locations denoted by the hollow circles in fig 4 with a time interval of 0 05 t in this case only the hydraulic conductivity in the model domain is assumed heterogeneous and to be estimated the log transformed conductivity field lnk s is modeled as a spatially correlated gaussian random field with the following statistics 15 ln k s 2 ln lt 1 16 c ln k s r σ ln k s 2 1 1 5 r ς 0 5 r ς 3 r ς 0 r ς where ln k s denotes the mean component σ lnk s 2 1 is the variance r represents the distance between two arbitrary locations x 1 z 1 and x 2 z 2 ς is the spatial correlation length r ς x 1 x 2 2 η x 2 z 1 z 2 2 η z 2 η x l x 0 45 η z l z 0 35 η x z and l x z denote the correlation length and domain size in the corresponding direction respectively the sequential gaussian simulation sgsim tool in the geostatistical simulation library gslib deutsch and journel 1995 is employed to generate the reference lnk s field the true hydraulic head measurements are acquired from simulation results using a randomly chosen reference field the measurement errors are assumed to be gaussian distributed with zero mean and standard deviation of 1 10 3 l the perturbed measurements are then used to estimate the lnk s field through the standard ies previously developed gpies and newly developed gpis to ensure the reliability of the estimation results we set the convergence ratio γ as 1 10 4 the initial parameter ensemble realizations for ies are also randomly generated using the sgsim tool to improve the computational efficiency of gpies and gpis we parameterize the lnk s field using the karhunen loève kl expansion zhang and lu 2004 in the following way 17 ln k s x z ln k s i 1 n kl ξ i τ i f i x z where ξ i represents independent gaussian random variables τ i and f i x z denote the ith eigenvalue and ith eigenfunction of the covariance function shown in eq 16 respectively n kl is the number of retained kl terms in this case we set n kl 30 which can keep 89 of the total field variance in this way the dimension of the parameter field is reduced from 5000 to 30 the initial parameter realizations for gpies and gpis are then randomly generated through the kl expansion the estimation accuracy of the three different algorithms is evaluated with the root mean square error rmse of the estimated parameters or the predicted states rmse for a variable v can be calculated using the following formula 18 rmse v 1 n i 1 n v i v r i 2 here v represents the values of the estimated parameters on all elements or predicted states at the observation locations while v r denotes the reference true values of the corresponding variables n is the number of elements or measurements with i denoting its index smaller rmse values indicate higher estimation accuracy since ies is a monto carlo based algorithm its performance can be affected by the ensemble size a common approach to determin the approximately optimal ensemble size in such algorithms is based on sensitivity experiments which test the algorithms sensitivity to the size of the ensemble chen and zhang 2006 xu et al 2021 yin et al 2015 in this paper different ensemble sizes i e n e 50 100 200 300 400 600 are tested to determine the ensemble size required to achieve satisfactory performance to give a fair comparison ies is run 10 times with different sets of initial parameter realizations for each tested ensemble size fig 5 plots the rmse m rmse for estimated parameters and iter number of required iterations values as a function of ensemble size it can be seen that rmse m and iter values decrease as the ensemble size increases from 40 to 300 but almost no changes can be detected when the ensemble size increases beyond 300 besides the lengths of error bars in both figures decrease first before the ensemble size increasing to 300 and then keep stable after that indicating convergence of these two indicators this occurs because a larger ensemble size guarantees more accurate sensitivity information leading to more accurate estimations and an accelerated convergence thus in this case the reasonable ensemble size is chosen as 300 i e n e 300 which is also used for gpies in the following calculations in gpies the recommended settings determined in our previous work ju et al 2018b i e n ini 10 n add 10 are used then gpies n e 300 n ini 10 n add 10 is also repeatedly implemented 10 times with different initial ensemble realizations to give a fair comparison we also set n ini 10 in gpis and repeat the implementation with 10 different initial parameter sets the estimated mean lnk s fields given by ies n e 300 gpies n e 300 n ini 10 n add 10 and gpis n ini 10 are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that all the estimated lnk s fields can capture the main patterns of the reference field specifically due to the utilization of dimension reduction the kl expansion the lnk s fields estimated by gpies and gpis are much smoother than that estimated by ies the computational settings and average performance indicator values for different algorithms are compared in table 1 as indicated by the rmse m and rmse h rmse for the predicted heads values gpis and gpies achieve satisfactory estimation results compared with ies and gpis shows advantages over gpies in terms of estimation accuracy the average number of iterations required to reach convergence for different algorithms are as follows 6 for ies 11 for gpies and 26 for gpis in terms of computational efficiency gpis n ori 36 only needs about 1 60 of the computational cost required by ies n ori 2100 and 1 3 of the computational cost required by gpies n ori 120 thus gpis is superior to gpies in this case the underlying reason is that the gp derived analytic sensitivity indices used in gpis are more accurate than the ensemble averaged sensitivity information in gpies however due to the fact that only one base point can be added to refine the gp surrogate at each iteration of gpis it needs more iterations to reach convergence than gpies 3 3 case 3 application of gpis in the heat transport problem in this case a sandbox experiment fig 7 is implemented to validate gpis in the heat transport problem the plexiglass sandbox has an internal volume of 1 86 m 1 m 0 12 m width height depth during the experiment the flow system in the sandbox was driven by two constant head reservoirs the top 0 15 m of the sandbox was connected to reservoir 1 creating a constant hydraulic head of 0 906 m the middle part from h 0 05 m to h 0 85 m was filled with the same type of natural quartz sand grain size 0 15 1 mm which was added and packed layer by layer 0 2 m each the bottom 0 05 m of the sandbox was connected to reservoir 2 to create a constant head of 0 72 m the remaining boundaries were impermeable to simulate the heat transport the heater in reservoir 1 was turned on and off with a 2 h interval thus the water temperature approximated a sinusoidal variation with a period of 4 h and a range of 23 33 c as shown in figs 7 63 ports were cut out of the front wall to allow the installation of the thermistors omega hsth 44000 series with an accuracy of 0 1 c these sensors were connected to a campbell scientific cr1000 data acquisition system to monitor the temperature changes in the sandbox the experiment lasted 350 min with a sampling rate of 5 min more details about the sandbox experiment can be found in our previous works ju et al 2018a ju et al 2019 the sandbox experimental process can be described by the coupled hydro thermal model in which the steady state flow process is defined as 19 x k x h x z k z h z 0 subject to the boundary and initial conditions 20 h γ 1 h 1 h γ 2 h 2 and h t 0 h 0 and the darcy water velocity q can be calculated from 21 q x k x h x 22 q z k z h z where h 0 is the initial hydraulic head h 1 and h 2 are the prescribed hydraulic heads assigned at dirichlet boundaries γ1 and γ2 respectively the heat transport equation is written as bear 1972 23 t t k e x t x t z ρ w c w ρc q x t x q z t z where t is the temperature c t is the time d q x z is the darcy flux density in the corresponding direction m d 1 k e is the effective thermal diffusivity k e λ ρc m 2 d 1 λ is the thermal conductivity of the saturated sediment λ λ w θ λ s 1 θ wm 1 c 1 λ w and λ s denote the thermal conductivity of the fluid and the solid matrix respectively w m 1 c 1 θ is the effective porosity of the sediment ρc is the volumetric heat capacity of the fluid saturated sediment ρc θρ w c w 1 θ ρ s c s j m 3 c 1 ρ w and ρ s are respectively the fluid s density and the matrix block s density kg m 3 c w and c s denote the heat capacity of the fluid and the matrix block respectively j kg 3 c 1 in this case comsol multiphysics is also employed to couple and solve the governing equations although the sandbox was filled with the same type of sand heterogeneity can still be induced by the non uniform packing and the grain size separation during packing zhao et al 2016 we model the lnk s field in the sandbox as a gaussian random field with the correlation function given in eq 16 the prior mean value is set as 3 13 ln md 1 which was determined from flow through tests considering that the filled sand only covers a narrow grain size range a value of 1 is assigned to the variance σ lnk s 2 we select the vertical correlation length as the thickness of each packed layer i e η z 0 2 m while using the horizontal correlation length η x 0 4 m the sandbox domain is discretized into 4000 100 40 elements we also employ the kl expansion to parameterize the lnk s field in the sandbox as per our previous work ju et al 2019 n kl 20 is chosen as the number of retained kl terms temperature measurements from the first 300 min assimilation period are respectively assimilated by ies n e 300 gpies n e 300 n ini 10 n add 10 and gpis n ini 10 to estimate the 20 gaussian variables while the measurements during the last 50 min validation period are used for validation purpose values of thermal parameters for the sand were previously determined by ju et al 2018a and are listed in table 2 the number of iterations required to reach convergence for different algorithms are as follows 9 for ies 13 for gpies and 36 for gpis the mean lnk s fields given by the three different algorithms are presented in fig 8 overall these estimation results show high similarity in terms of the computational cost the n ori of gpis is 37 which is much smaller than that of ies 3000 and gpies 140 since the true distribution of lnk s in the sandbox is unknown the estimation accuracy is compared by the ability to predict temperatures during the validation period with the estimated lnk s fields from different algorithms the n ori values and rmse values for temperature predictions rmse t are listed in table 3 we can see that the rmse t value for ies is again the smallest followed by gpis and gpies gives the largest value in summary gpis still gives better temperature predictions during the validation period than gpies it should be pointed out again that the computational cost of gpis is still less than one third of that of gpies in this experimental case 4 conclusions in this study a sampling free algorithm gpis has been proposed for subsurface parameter characterization the key idea is to analytically derive the parameter sensitivity indices from the gp surrogate and then use them in the solution of inverse problems the gp surrogate is adaptively refined using the updated parameter vectors during the iterations of gpis an analytical function is first employed to demonstrate the performance of gp in deriving the analytic sensitivities under different conditions i e different number of training data and varying input dimension then both numerical and sandbox experimental cases are tested to validate gpis in groundwater flow and heat transport problems respectively the overall results show that a gp surrogate with high accuracy leads to accurate parameter sensitivity information but more training data are required to maintain the accuracy of the surrogate as the input dimension increases by using the gp derived sensitivities gpis achieves more accurate estimation results with the efficiency improvement of 3 to 4 times compared with the previously proposed gpies algorithm it should be pointed out that although gpis shows certain advantages over gpies in the test cases it still suffers some limitations for example as a non ensemble based algorithm the estimation result of gpis only contains one parameter vector which makes the uncertainty estimation unavailable additionally the kl expansion is employed as a dimension reduction tool to parameterize the lnk s field in the test cases for gpis thus the gp surrogate is constructed in a relatively low parameter dimension however for cases with very small correlation scales the reduced dimensionality is still large and gpis may lose efficiency in such high dimensional i e d 100 problems to address this issue more efficient parametric dimensionality reduction dr techniques e g hierarchical functional decompositions perdikaris et al 2016 or deep neural network based dr methods laloy et al 2018 laloy et al 2017 can be combined with gpis in future

1409,aquifers under agricultural areas are considered to be an indirect source of nitrous oxide emission n2o to the atmosphere which is the greenhouse gas ghgs characterized with the highest global warning potential and acts as a stratospheric ozone depletion agent previous investigations performed in the cretaceous hesbaye chalk aquifer in eastern belgium suggested that the dynamics of n2o in the aquifer is controlled by overlapping biochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification the current study aims to obtain better insight concerning the factors controlling the distribution of n2o concentration along a vertical dimension in the aquifer and to capture and quantify the occurrence of nitrification and denitrification processes in the groundwater system low flow groundwater sampling technique was undertaken at different depths in the aquifer to collect groundwater samples aiming at obtaining information about ambient aquifer hydrogeochemical conditions and their effect on the accumulation of ghgs afterwards laboratory stable isotope experiments using no3 and nh4 compounds labeled with heavy 15n isotope were applied to quantify the rates of nitrification and denitrification processes ambient studies suggest that the occurrence of n transformation was related to denitrification while laboratory incubation experiments did not detect it such controversial results might be explained by the discrepancy between real aquifer conditions and lab design studies thus additional in situ tracer experiments should be carried out in areas where natural groundwater fluxes do not flush the injected tracer too rapidly in addition it would be useful to conduct microbiological studies to obtain better insight into the nature of subsurface biofilm biotope keywords greenhouse gases groundwater n stable isotope analysis low flow sampling nitrification denitrification 1 introduction one of the major challenges of this century is to find the balance between intensive agricultural production and related environmental damages such as the contribution to anthropogenic ghgs emissions and climate change or the deterioration of water resources and soil fisher et al 2018 inorganic and organic n fertilizers intensively used for decades to increase annual harvest have contributed to changes in the n biogeochemical cycle davidson 2009 in particular this change has led to increased atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide n2o by 122 in comparison to the preindustrial period with a continuous annual raise by 0 2 0 3 anderson et al 2010 world meteorological organization 2018 n2o is a greenhouse gas ghgs which is characterized by a warming potential 298 times higher than carbon dioxide co2 and an average atmospheric longevity of 114 years ipcc 2016 pollution of groundwater under agricultural landscapes with n species makes aquifers a potential source of n2o emission to the atmosphere in areas of groundwater discharge or through pumping activities fox et al 2014 gardner et al 2016 jurado et al 2018 there is still large uncertainty regarding the quantification of n2o emission from aquifer systems since most approaches used for the calculation the emission factor from groundwater assume that they act only as a transport media without any internal n transformation processes zhou et al 2019 that is why it is important to improve our understanding of the dynamics of n in groundwater which is highly variable in space and time and might lead to the accumulation of n2o in the subsurface hinkle and tesoriero 2014 and indirectly in the atmosphere differentiating the specific contribution of different biogeochemical pathways to n2o production at local to regional scales can help to introduce process oriented mitigation measures that will contribute to decrease global n2o emission guo et al 2018 this study attempts to characterize the dynamics of n2o in one of the largest chalk aquifer located under agricultural areas in the walloon region belgium based on regional investigations in this groundwater body it was assumed that the availability of n2o in the chalk aquifer was governed by both nitrification and denitrification processes nikolenko et al 2019 in order to test this hypothesis further explorations here focus on upper and lower parts of the aquifer assuming that they were presumably different in terms of physical chemical and or biochemical conditions those differences may actually explain the mixed origin of n2o therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to obtain better insight related to the distribution of n compounds and their isotopes with depth in the chalk aquifer 2 to characterize in details the effect of changing hydrogeochemical conditions on n2o production consumption processes and 3 to estimate of the rates of nitrification and denitrification processes in the aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the studied aquifer is located in cretaceous chalky geological formations in the eastern belgium brouyère et al 2004 orban et al 2010 goderniaux et al 2015 two sites bovenistier and sgb allowing access to different aquifer depths were selected for the studies both are equipped with multilevel piezometers which characteristics and investigated depth intervals are shown in fig 1 during the investigations upper and lower groundwater layers were examined in each piezometer for the sake of convenience in further discussion all of the sampling points i e depth intervals which were sampled are numbered from 1 to 10 as indicated in fig 1 along the left side of each piezometer 2 2 sampling procedure information regarding the hydrochemical conditions concentrations of n compounds and their isotopic and isotopomer signals used to describe the nature of n2o dynamics was obtained by chemical and isotope analyses of groundwater samples those were collected using a low flow sampling technique during the summer june 2019 and winter november 2019 campaigns samples were collected at the end of a low flow pumping 240 ml min stage performed at each location until the stabilization of electrical conductivity ec and ph using a solinst bladder pump model 407 ss 1 66 dia it was assumed that stabilization occurred when five consecutive measurements for ec and ph did not differ by 2 and 0 1 units respectively 2 3 exploration of the variability of n compounds and their isotopes with depth the results of isotopic and chemical analyses of groundwater samples consist of 1 total nitrate no3 and boron b dual isotope plots for both sgb and bovenistier sites 2 comparative vertical distribution profiles of no3 n2o and n isotopes for the summer and winter campaigns and for each of the studied sites individually dual isotope plots help to address the question whether changes in n isotope and isotopomer values along the profiles are related to the ongoing n2o production consumption processes or are due to differences in the isotopic signatures of the initial substrate sources the analysis of 11b was performed only for groundwater samples collected in summer consequently the conclusions regarding the origin of n in winter samples will be made both by examining no3 dual isotope plots and considering the corresponding results of δ11b analyses from summer samples comparative vertical distribution profiles are used to examine covariations between n compounds and their isotopes with depth which helps to understand n2o dynamics in the aquifer 2 4 estimation of the rates of nitrification and denitrification processes two n stable isotope labeled experiments were conducted in order to estimate the rates of nitrification and denitrification processes in groundwater for this purpose groundwater was collected at different depths of the aquifer at bovenistier and sgb sites see sampling points on fig 1 section 2 1 during the winter campaign from each sampling point 4 water samples of 50 ml each were collected and stored in borosilicate serum vials sealed without headspace using a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum seal half of them were used for nitrification incubation experiment and another half for denitrification incubation experiment by addition of 15n labeled compounds it should be emphasized that this experiment provides the information about the potential rates of nitrification and denitrification because the addition of the 15n labeled compounds substrates for denitrification and nitrification processes increases their concentrations relative to its in situ values nitrification rates were determined in headspace free serum vials spiked with 15n labeled nh4cl 99 atom 15n by measuring the changes in δ15n no3 values resulting from the oxidation of the 15nh4 which is a substrate for nitrification since the results of chemical analysis showed the ambient concentration of nh4 in groundwater was below the detection limit it was decided to amend water samples with an excess of 15n nh4 in order to reach the final concentration of 2 mg l of nh4 similarly denitrification rates were determined in headspace free serum vials amended with 15n labeled kno3 25 atom 15n by observing the changes in 15n n2o and 15n n2 isotopic signatures expecting the consumption of added isotopically enriched 15n no3 25 atom 15n which is a substrate for denitrification considering that the background concentration of no3 in groundwater vary from 0 to 52 5 mg l based on the results obtained from summer campaign the amount of injected 15n no3 was defined aiming to double the concentration of no3 at each location amendments were made by injecting the tracer solutions through the septa of borosilicate glass vials the magnitudes of nitrification and denitrification processes were measured during 24 h and 48 h long experiments respectively each of which consisted of four time spans with 2 vials used for each time span duplicates the vials were incubated in the dark under 10 c which corresponds to the mean in situ temperature of groundwater at the time of sampling both incubations started just after tracer injections at the beginning of the incubation experiments an addition of 200 μl of a saturated solution of hgcl2 in two vials was performed to inhibit microbiological activity in order to have reference values of initial t0 15n no3 15n n2o and 15n n2 isotopic values for nitrification further inhibitions of microbiological activity took place in 2 subsequent vials in the time course after 6 h 12 h 18 h and 24 h intervals for denitrification the intervals after which inhibition was performed in the respective vials were established at 6 h 12 h 24 h and 48 h the magnitude of nitrification and denitrification were estimated based on the formula provided by hama et al 1983 and adapted for the quantification of no3 or n2o and n2 production rates 3 p c a is a 0 t a s a 0 where p is the production rate of a particular compound nmol l h c is the initial background

means of aqueous phase ion chromatography via specific ion exchange resin and a conductivity detector the concentrations of dissolved n2o was measured at the chemical oceanography unit of the university of liège belgium with the headspace equilibration technique 20 ml of n2 headspace in 50 ml serum bottles and a gas chromatograph equipped with electron capture and flame ionization

and 30 ppm ch4 the reproducibility of measurements was 3 2 for n2o concentration analysis the stable isotope analyses of n2o present in ambient groundwater samples were conducted using an off axis cavity ringdown spectroscopy oa icos los gatos research instrument for the measurements of δ15nα δ15nβ δ18o of n2o at the chemical oceanography unit of the university of liège belgium and the 15n site preference sp in was calculated as the difference between central δ15nα and peripheral δ15nβ 15n enrichment of the linear n2o molecule δ15nα δ15nβ a 20 ml helium he headspace was created in the 250 ml bottles 24 h before the analysis in order to assure equilibration between gas and dissolved n2o headspace samples were injected into a custom built purge and trap device he flow 120 ml min 1 consisting of a co2 trap soda lime a water trap magnesium perchlorate and a stainless steel loop immersed in liquid nitrogen to trap n2o volume of headspace injection was adapted as function of the n2o concentration in every sample in order to minimize concentration dependent effect as much as possible wassenaar et al 2018 data was calibrated against calibration curves obtained with several injection at increasing concentration typically 8 of an international reference material usgs52 δ15nα air 13 52 δ15nβ air 12 64 δ18osmow 40 14 and an in house n2o standard provided by air liquide belgium δ15nα air 0 47 δ15nβ air 1 41 δ18osmow 37 63 and previously calibrated by the tokyo institute of technology data calibration was performed as described in wassenaar et al 2018 analytical precision was 0 5 1 2 and 1 2 for δ15nα air δ15nβ air and δ18osmow respectively the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopes analyses were conducted using an off axis cavity ringdown spectroscopy oa icos los gatos research instrument university of liège belgium applying cd azide reduction method to quantitatively converts no3 to n2o mcilvin and altabet 2005 ryabenko et al 2009 wassenaar et al 2018 after chemical conversion of no3 to n2o the resulting gas was analyzed with the above mentioned laser isotope analyzer using the same analytical setup as for n2o isotopes analysis samples and standards iaea no3 δ15n no3 4 7 δ18o no3 25 6 were normalized to the same concentration 20 μmol l 1 before the initiation of the cd azide reduction protocol following the recommendation of wassenaar et al 2018 typical precision for δ15n no3 was better than 0 6 and for δ18o no3 was better than 1 8 the δ11b measurements in groundwater samples was performed using sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry sf icp ms according to the procedure described by tirez et al 2010 the precision on the quality control sample nbs 951 that was measured along in this run amounts 2 6 groundwater dissolved gases n2o and n2 from incubation samples were extracted using the headspace equilibration technique with helium he filling the headspace 20 ml of he headspace in 50 ml serum bottles the δ15n n2o values were determined on a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer stable isotope facility uc davis davis ca as described by mosier and schimel 1993 note that only the samples from 5 locations out of 9 pz 13 1 pz12 3 and 5 and sgb 4 and 6 were sent for the 15n n2o isotope analyses the δ15n n2 was estimated by isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta v plus thermoscientific volume injected in the mass spectrometer 50 μl typical precision for δ15n n2 analysis with the irms was better than 0 2 3 results 3 1 sources of n compounds in groundwater according to the obtained results the origin of n in groundwater samples at the bovenistier site during the summer period fig 2 was attributed to 2 major sources manure the isotope signal of which was dominant at the shallowest sampling point 5 pzcs and nh4 fertilizers identified at the deeper studied points 4 pzcs 3 and 2 both in pz12 fig 2 in the absence of δ11b samples for the winter campaign it was more difficult to distinguish the n sources in this dataset for example the sample 5w indicates no3 isotopic values typical for both fertilizers and sewage the sample 4w exhibits no3 isotopic signals typical for denitrification process as 4 and 4w are located along the denitrifying line with a slope 1 1 though the small enrichment factor 2 15 which is not typical for denitrification under natural conditions is observed here the denitrification cannot be excluded in case the studied system is substrate limited and high microbiological activity is present clark 2015 the presence of the first condition can be supported by the two fold decrease in the concentration of no3 between 4 and 4w as for the second one additional microbiological studies are required in order to detect the activity of denitrifiers nevertheless according to jahangir et al 2013 denitrifier functional genes are ubiquitous in groundwater systems despite the fact that 3 and 3w are located along the denitrifying line with a slope 2 1 denitrification cannot be claimed in this case it is related to the fact that two points are located too far away from each other which gives extremely high enrichment factor taking into account the absolute absence of change in the concentration of no3 fig 2 at point 1 pz13 no3 is detected only in the winter and its isotope signature fall out of the ranges typically attributed to the considered n sources at the sgb site fig 3 samples 8 and 9 sgb3 that belong to the shallower part of the aquifer show isotopic values that can be attributed to different n sources while the samples 6 and 7 sgb1 that belong to the deeper part of the aquifer fall in the sewage interval during the summer campaign samples 8 and 9 can be associated with household sewage and manure respectively in winter the same samples fall into the ranges typical for household sewage and nh4 fertilizers samples 7 show no3 and b isotope values typical for both nh4 fertilizers and household sewage during summer and winter periods sample 6w demonstrates n isotopic signatures which might be associated with denitrification processes as 6 and 6w fall along the denitrifying line with slope 2 1 the occurrence of denitrification is supported by the drastic decrease in the concentration of no3 between 6 and 6w fig 3 and the reasons described in the above paragraph for points 4 and 4w 3 2 depth specific distribution of n compounds and their isotopes in this section changes in vertical variations of the concentrations of n compounds n isotopic signatures and dissolved oxygen do at the sgb and bovenistier sites for the summer and winter periods are discussed groundwater samples from the sgb site show concentrations of n n2o which exceed the equilibrium with the atmosphere concentration 0 3 μgn l hasegawa et al 2000 in winter n2o concentrations were higher 12 6 2 9 μgn l in comparison to the summer 8 2 1 5 μgn l the sgb1 piezometer showed that the concentration of n n2o was higher in the deepest part of the piezometer point 6 9 9 μgn l and 14 5 μgn l than in its upper part point 7 6 4 μgn l and 11 6 μgn l in the summer and winter campaigns respectively the sgb3 piezometer did not indicate any significant difference in n n2o concentration with depth for the summer campaign however for the winter campaign the upper sampling location sample 9 showed a concentration almost two times higher 15 5 μgn l versus 8 6 μgn l compared to the deeper sampling location sample 8 at the sgb site the concentrations of no3 decreased with depth but they showed significant variations between the summer and winter sampling campaigns the shallower sampling points 8 and 9 showed concentrations of 28 7 mg l and 47 9 mg l mg l in the summer and 21 5 mg l and 38 3 mg l in the winter the deeper samples 6 and 7 showed no3 concentrations 23 5 mg l and 18 3 mg l in the summer and of 48 7 mg l and 1 56 mg l in the winter the concentrations of do were in a range between 7 0 mg l to 9 6 mg l decreasing with depth during both sampling periods the sp and n n2o results red circles fig 4 a and c changed in the same direction along the depth profile both in the summer and winter campaigns with the exception of location 7 for n n2o this indicates the absence of n2o reduction processes ostrom et al 2007 the similarity between n n2o and δ15n n2o evolutions blue circle fig 4 b in the winter campaign also indicates that n2o is not reduced such a similarity is not observed for the summer sampling campaign which in this case might evidence n2o reduction moreover data from the summer campaign show a strong covariation with depth between of δ15n n2o and δ15nβ n2o green circle fig 4 c which suggests close dependence between these two parameters the δ15nα n2o enrichment increased with depth while the δ18o n2o green circles fig 4 c decreased slightly the winter campaign data show that δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o δ15nβ n2o and δ18o n2o green circles fig 4 c parameters exhibited similar vertical distribution patterns along the vertical profile with more pronounced increase of δ15nα n2o with depth this observation suggests that δ15n n2o signature might be either influenced by production processes solely or influenced to the same extent with both n2o production and reduction processes all samples collected at bovenistier showed n n2o concentrations exceeding the equilibrium with the atmosphere similarly to the sgb site the concentration of this gas was higher in the winter 10 5 μgn l 1 7 μgn l than in the summer 8 6 μgn l 1 3 μgn l for the summer campaign samples 4 and 5 pzcs showed higher concentrations of n n2o 10 16 μgn l and 9 26 μgn l respectively in comparison to 3 and 2 pz12 where its concentrations were nearly the same around 7 μgn l during the winter campaign n n2o concentrations varied vary between 10 7 μg n l and 12 4 μgn l at all of the sampling points with higher concentrations observed at the bottom parts of piezometers sampling points 4 and 2 during the winter campaign n2o was detected at a concentration of 7 7 μgn l at the deepest sampling location 1 pz13 but in the summer campaign the concentration there was below the detection limit during the summer campaign the concentration of no3 did not change noticeably between point 4 and 5 pzcs 40 mg l but it varied between samples 3 and 5 47 8 mg l vs 37 0 mg l located respectively in the shallow and deep part of pz12 during this period no3 was not detected in the sample collected at location 1 in pz13 in the winter the no3 concentration was almost two times lower at location 5 24 2 mg l than at location 4 46 2 mg l at the same period there was no significant difference in no3 between locations 2 and 3 40 mg l and the concentration of no3 was 47 9 mg l at point 1 in pz13 the concentration of do varied from 1 5 mg l to 9 9 mg l at bovenistier variations with depth of n n2o and sp red circles fig 5 a and c were different for both winter and summer periods however these differences are not significant enough to conclude on the possible occurrence of n2o reduction at the same time the similarity observed between n n2o and δ15n n2o blue circle fig 5 b profiles for winter except for the deepest sampling point at pz12 and pz13 indicates the absence of n2o reduction in the shallower part of the aquifer and its occurrence in the deepest part n2o reduction processes at the bottom part of the aquifer are also supported by the positive value of δ15n n2o 9 2 and the high δ18o n2o value 66 0 during the summer campaign differences in n n2o and δ15n n2o patterns can be attributed to n2o reduction summer period shows nearly the same distributions of δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o δ15nβ n2o and δ18o n2o green circles fig 5 c except the slight decrease in δ18o n2o at the interval which corresponds to sampling locations 5 and 4 in winter the patterns between δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o δ15nβ n2o and δ18o n2o green circles fig 5 c are identical with the obvious increase at the deeper aquifer layers which corresponds to sampling point 1 pz13 this indicates that n2o reduction dominates n2o production in the deeper part of the aquifer at the same time n2o production exceeds its consumption or occurs to the same extent at the upper part of the aquifer 3 3 potential rates of nitrification and denitrification processes obtained from laboratory incubation experiment the results of the isotope analyses of 15n no3 15n n2o and 15n n2 have not highlighted any considerable enrichment of respective compounds between different time spans this indicates that nitrification or denitrification processes did not occur at significant rates in the bottles during the incubation experiments the maximal analytical errors of the 15n no3 15n n2o and 15n n2 analyses were 2 0 14 and 0 1 the detection limits were 1 for nitrification 2 7 nmol l h and 2 for denitrification 2 7 nmol l h for n2 and 0 0002 nmol l h for n2o 4 discussion 4 1 evidence of n2o production and consumption processes obtained from the analyses of ambient groundwater samples according to the results both n2o production and consumptions processes occur in the chalk aquifer the fact that n as an initial substrate originates from different sources at different depths complicates the distinction between nitrification and denitrification as well as between n2o production and consumption mechanisms at sgb the similarity between δ15n n2o and δ15nβ n2o in the summer campaign means that the isotopic signature of n2o is not determined by n2o reduction in the winter campaign simultaneous increase in n2o isotopomers values with more pronounced increase in 15nα and δ18o n2o at levels 7 and 6 indicates park et al 2011 the occurrence of n2o reduction processes at the bottom part of the aquifer this is also supported by the drastic decrease in the concentration of no3 at sampling point 6 in comparison to 7 the opposite patterns of no3 and n2o concentrations in the deep part of the aquifer both in summer and winter periods provide additional evidence of reduction processes minamikawa et al 2011 at bovenistier it could be concluded that n2o production processes dominate over its consumption based on the similarities in the distributions of n isotopes isotopomers and n n2o concentrations along the vertical profile intensive n2o consumption is revealed only in the deep part of the aquifer pz13 during the winter campaign this observation is probably related to significant no3 input which stimulated denitrification process and allowed to detect n2o at measureable levels as a first conclusion despite of the occurrence of aerobic conditions at sgb and bovenistier both production and consumption processes govern the dynamics of n2o with the reduction processes being more pronounced in the deeper part of the aquifer such conclusions are supported by the fact that there is more and more evidence of denitrifiers being capable of using both do and no3 as electron acceptors zhu et al 2019 moreover there are studies which suggest the presence of micro anaerobic hotspots in total aerobic environments capable of supporting denitrification processes well et al 2012 4 2 evidence of n2o production and consumption processes from laboratory incubation experiments the results show that our previous hypothesis about the simultaneous occurrence of both nitrification and denitrification processes in the aquifer might not explain the sp values of n2o measured in groundwater samples collected during the regional and local investigations consequently on the one hand the availability of n2o in the aquifer might be explained by the infiltration of n2o produced by nitrification and denitrification processes occurring within the other parts of the aquifer alternatively there might exist a discrepancy between real aquifer conditions and laboratory experiments in particular in the aquifer groundwater is in permanent contact with biofilms attached to the rocks materials while groundwater samples collected in piezometers for incubation might not represent the real complexity of the subsurface environment to investigate this it would be needed to collect large volumes of groundwater to extract the available bacterial biomass and analyze it in order to determine the expression of nitrifying and denitrifying genes which might help to obtain better insight into the qualitative diversity of biofilm biotope since it is expected that there exists a constant flux of bacteria between biofilm and water layers 5 conclusions this study applied stable isotope analyses and laboratory design tracer experiments in order to clarify the origin of n2o in groundwater the results of measurements of n isotope parameters in ambient groundwater samples and laboratory incubations are controversial it is difficult to differentiate between the roles of nitrification and denitrification in n2o production because n isotopic signatures and sp values measured in collected groundwater are overlapping at the same time n2o reduction which is related solely to denitrification could be identified based on positive values of δ15n n2o high values of δ18o n2o 35 and enrichment in 15nα n2o in particular at one of the examined locations pz 13 sp δ15n n2o and δ18o n2o values of ambient groundwater showed ranges typical for complete denitrification with n2o reduction which coincide with the lower do levels measured at this location since direct measurement of the magnitude of nitrification and denitrification processes within the aquifer is not possible at the majority of selected locations due to the high groundwater fluxes it was decided to conduct laboratory bottle incubation experiments to determine the potential rates of respective processes those results did not detect nitrification and denitrification in the bottles and this might be related to the fact that n2o availability in groundwater is determined by nitrification and denitrification processes in the unsaturated zone however the results draw our attention since at pz 13 the sp and δ15n n2o values were significantly different from values obtained at other locations as they showed ranges typical for n2o reduction which coincide with low do levels in groundwater at this location those three facts suggest that the best explanation might be the discrepancy between real aquifer conditions and lab design studies laboratory studies were conducted under controlled conditions but the aquifer conditions are more complex not only the amount of bacteria in the collected samples could differ but reaction rates during the experiments and in the aquifer actually differ therefore the isotopic signatures of n2o in the aquifer might indicate that denitrification occurs in the aquifer but the responsible bacteria were not present in sufficient quantity in the collected groundwater samples because they mostly reside in biofilms attached to the surface of the rocks materials to sum up the solitary application of isotope and isotopomer analyses together with hydrochemical evidence can provide the information only about production or consumption of n2o in the subsurface under the heterogeneous conditions prevailing in the subsurface the sp values and n isotope signatures are the result of mixing between continuous transformation and transport processes of n compounds driven from different sources consequently it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the location and extent of key functional zones in n cycle dynamics based only on the isotope and isotopomer datasets evidences from laboratory incubation experiments should be verified by additional in situ tracer experiments at locations that are characterized by low groundwater fluxes that allows leaving a tracer in subsurface for at least several hours in addition it will be useful to conduct microbiological studies of the biomass extracted from groundwater which will allow having better understanding about activity of subsurface biofilm biotope finally it is important to emphasize that microbiological findings should not be focused on the evidence of abundance of certain organisms or enzymes which might be misleading but rather on determining their actual activity based on mrnas or protein declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this project has

1409,aquifers under agricultural areas are considered to be an indirect source of nitrous oxide emission n2o to the atmosphere which is the greenhouse gas ghgs characterized with the highest global warning potential and acts as a stratospheric ozone depletion agent previous investigations performed in the cretaceous hesbaye chalk aquifer in eastern belgium suggested that the dynamics of n2o in the aquifer is controlled by overlapping biochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification the current study aims to obtain better insight concerning the factors controlling the distribution of n2o concentration along a vertical dimension in the aquifer and to capture and quantify the occurrence of nitrification and denitrification processes in the groundwater system low flow groundwater sampling technique was undertaken at different depths in the aquifer to collect groundwater samples aiming at obtaining information about ambient aquifer hydrogeochemical conditions and their effect on the accumulation of ghgs afterwards laboratory stable isotope experiments using no3 and nh4 compounds labeled with heavy 15n isotope were applied to quantify the rates of nitrification and denitrification processes ambient studies suggest that the occurrence of n transformation was related to denitrification while laboratory incubation experiments did not detect it such controversial results might be explained by the discrepancy between real aquifer conditions and lab design studies thus additional in situ tracer experiments should be carried out in areas where natural groundwater fluxes do not flush the injected tracer too rapidly in addition it would be useful to conduct microbiological studies to obtain better insight into the nature of subsurface biofilm biotope keywords greenhouse gases groundwater n stable isotope analysis low flow sampling nitrification denitrification 1 introduction one of the major challenges of this century is to find the balance between intensive agricultural production and related environmental damages such as the contribution to anthropogenic ghgs emissions and climate change or the deterioration of water resources and soil fisher et al 2018 inorganic and organic n fertilizers intensively used for decades to increase annual harvest have contributed to changes in the n biogeochemical cycle davidson 2009 in particular this change has led to increased atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide n2o by 122 in comparison to the preindustrial period with a continuous annual raise by 0 2 0 3 anderson et al 2010 world meteorological organization 2018 n2o is a greenhouse gas ghgs which is characterized by a warming potential 298 times higher than carbon dioxide co2 and an average atmospheric longevity of 114 years ipcc 2016 pollution of groundwater under agricultural landscapes with n species makes aquifers a potential source of n2o emission to the atmosphere in areas of groundwater discharge or through pumping activities fox et al 2014 gardner et al 2016 jurado et al 2018 there is still large uncertainty regarding the quantification of n2o emission from aquifer systems since most approaches used for the calculation the emission factor from groundwater assume that they act only as a transport media without any internal n transformation processes zhou et al 2019 that is why it is important to improve our understanding of the dynamics of n in groundwater which is highly variable in space and time and might lead to the accumulation of n2o in the subsurface hinkle and tesoriero 2014 and indirectly in the atmosphere differentiating the specific contribution of different biogeochemical pathways to n2o production at local to regional scales can help to introduce process oriented mitigation measures that will contribute to decrease global n2o emission guo et al 2018 this study attempts to characterize the dynamics of n2o in one of the largest chalk aquifer located under agricultural areas in the walloon region belgium based on regional investigations in this groundwater body it was assumed that the availability of n2o in the chalk aquifer was governed by both nitrification and denitrification processes nikolenko et al 2019 in order to test this hypothesis further explorations here focus on upper and lower parts of the aquifer assuming that they were presumably different in terms of physical chemical and or biochemical conditions those differences may actually explain the mixed origin of n2o therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to obtain better insight related to the distribution of n compounds and their isotopes with depth in the chalk aquifer 2 to characterize in details the effect of changing hydrogeochemical conditions on n2o production consumption processes and 3 to estimate of the rates of nitrification and denitrification processes in the aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the studied aquifer is located in cretaceous chalky geological formations in the eastern belgium brouyère et al 2004 orban et al 2010 goderniaux et al 2015 two sites bovenistier and sgb allowing access to different aquifer depths were selected for the studies both are equipped with multilevel piezometers which characteristics and investigated depth intervals are shown in fig 1 during the investigations upper and lower groundwater layers were examined in each piezometer for the sake of convenience in further discussion all of the sampling points i e depth intervals which were sampled are numbered from 1 to 10 as indicated in fig 1 along the left side of each piezometer 2 2 sampling procedure information regarding the hydrochemical conditions concentrations of n compounds and their isotopic and isotopomer signals used to describe the nature of n2o dynamics was obtained by chemical and isotope analyses of groundwater samples those were collected using a low flow sampling technique during the summer june 2019 and winter november 2019 campaigns samples were collected at the end of a low flow pumping 240 ml min stage performed at each location until the stabilization of electrical conductivity ec and ph using a solinst bladder pump model 407 ss 1 66 dia it was assumed that stabilization occurred when five consecutive measurements for ec and ph did not differ by 2 and 0 1 units respectively 2 3 exploration of the variability of n compounds and their isotopes with depth the results of isotopic and chemical analyses of groundwater samples consist of 1 total nitrate no3 and boron b dual isotope plots for both sgb and bovenistier sites 2 comparative vertical distribution profiles of no3 n2o and n isotopes for the summer and winter campaigns and for each of the studied sites individually dual isotope plots help to address the question whether changes in n isotope and isotopomer values along the profiles are related to the ongoing n2o production consumption processes or are due to differences in the isotopic signatures of the initial substrate sources the analysis of 11b was performed only for groundwater samples collected in summer consequently the conclusions regarding the origin of n in winter samples will be made both by examining no3 dual isotope plots and considering the corresponding results of δ11b analyses from summer samples comparative vertical distribution profiles are used to examine covariations between n compounds and their isotopes with depth which helps to understand n2o dynamics in the aquifer 2 4 estimation of the rates of nitrification and denitrification processes two n stable isotope labeled experiments were conducted in order to estimate the rates of nitrification and denitrification processes in groundwater for this purpose groundwater was collected at different depths of the aquifer at bovenistier and sgb sites see sampling points on fig 1 section 2 1 during the winter campaign from each sampling point 4 water samples of 50 ml each were collected and stored in borosilicate serum vials sealed without headspace using a butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum seal half of them were used for nitrification incubation experiment and another half for denitrification incubation experiment by addition of 15n labeled compounds it should be emphasized that this experiment provides the information about the potential rates of nitrification and denitrification because the addition of the 15n labeled compounds substrates for denitrification and nitrification processes increases their concentrations relative to its in situ values nitrification rates were determined in headspace free serum vials spiked with 15n labeled nh4cl 99 atom 15n by measuring the changes in δ15n no3 values resulting from the oxidation of the 15nh4 which is a substrate for nitrification since the results of chemical analysis showed the ambient concentration of nh4 in groundwater was below the detection limit it was decided to amend water samples with an excess of 15n nh4 in order to reach the final concentration of 2 mg l of nh4 similarly denitrification rates were determined in headspace free serum vials amended with 15n labeled kno3 25 atom 15n by observing the changes in 15n n2o and 15n n2 isotopic signatures expecting the consumption of added isotopically enriched 15n no3 25 atom 15n which is a substrate for denitrification considering that the background concentration of no3 in groundwater vary from 0 to 52 5 mg l based on the results obtained from summer campaign the amount of injected 15n no3 was defined aiming to double the concentration of no3 at each location amendments were made by injecting the tracer solutions through the septa of borosilicate glass vials the magnitudes of nitrification and denitrification processes were measured during 24 h and 48 h long experiments respectively each of which consisted of four time spans with 2 vials used for each time span duplicates the vials were incubated in the dark under 10 c which corresponds to the mean in situ temperature of groundwater at the time of sampling both incubations started just after tracer injections at the beginning of the incubation experiments an addition of 200 μl of a saturated solution of hgcl2 in two vials was performed to inhibit microbiological activity in order to have reference values of initial t0 15n no3 15n n2o and 15n n2 isotopic values for nitrification further inhibitions of microbiological activity took place in 2 subsequent vials in the time course after 6 h 12 h 18 h and 24 h intervals for denitrification the intervals after which inhibition was performed in the respective vials were established at 6 h 12 h 24 h and 48 h the magnitude of nitrification and denitrification were estimated based on the formula provided by hama et al 1983 and adapted for the quantification of no3 or n2o and n2 production rates 3 p c a is a 0 t a s a 0 where p is the production rate of a particular compound nmol l h c is the initial background

n in groundwater samples at the bovenistier site during the summer period fig 2 was attributed to 2 major sources manure the isotope signal of which was dominant at the shallowest sampling point 5 pzcs and nh4 fertilizers identified at the deeper studied points 4 pzcs 3 and 2 both in pz12 fig 2 in the absence of δ11b samples for the winter campaign it was more difficult to distinguish the n sources in this dataset for example the sample 5w indicates no3 isotopic values typical for both fertilizers and sewage the sample 4w exhibits no3 isotopic signals typical for denitrification process as 4 and 4w are located along the denitrifying line with a slope 1 1 though the small enrichment factor 2 15 which is not typical for denitrification under natural conditions is observed here the denitrification cannot be excluded in case the studied system is substrate limited and high microbiological activity is present clark 2015 the presence of the first condition can be supported by the two fold decrease in the concentration of no3 between 4 and 4w as for the second one additional microbiological studies are required in order to detect the activity of denitrifiers nevertheless according to jahangir et al 2013 denitrifier functional genes are ubiquitous in groundwater systems despite the fact that 3 and 3w are located along the denitrifying line with a slope 2 1 denitrification cannot be claimed in this case it is related to the fact that two points are located too far away from each other which gives extremely high enrichment factor taking into account the absolute absence of change in the concentration of no3 fig 2 at point 1 pz13 no3 is detected only in the winter and its isotope signature fall out of the ranges typically attributed to the considered n sources at the sgb site fig 3 samples 8 and 9 sgb3 that belong to the shallower part of the aquifer show isotopic values that can be attributed to different n sources while the samples 6 and 7 sgb1 that belong to the deeper part of the aquifer fall in the sewage interval during the summer campaign samples 8 and 9 can be associated with household sewage and manure respectively in winter the same samples fall into the ranges typical for household sewage and nh4 fertilizers samples 7 show no3 and b isotope values typical for both nh4 fertilizers and household sewage during summer and winter periods sample 6w demonstrates n isotopic signatures which might be associated with denitrification processes as 6 and 6w fall along the denitrifying line with slope 2 1 the occurrence of denitrification is supported by the drastic decrease in the concentration of no3 between 6 and 6w fig 3 and the reasons described in the above paragraph for points 4 and 4w 3 2 depth specific distribution of n compounds and their isotopes in this section changes in vertical variations of the concentrations of n compounds n isotopic signatures and dissolved oxygen do at the sgb and bovenistier sites for the summer and winter periods are discussed groundwater samples from the sgb site show concentrations of n n2o which exceed the equilibrium with the atmosphere concentration 0 3 μgn l hasegawa et al 2000 in winter n2o concentrations were higher 12 6 2 9 μgn l in comparison to the summer 8 2 1 5 μgn l the sgb1 piezometer showed that the concentration of n n2o was higher in the deepest part of the piezometer point 6 9 9 μgn l and 14 5 μgn l than in its upper part point 7 6 4 μgn l and 11 6 μgn l in the summer and winter campaigns respectively the sgb3 piezometer did not indicate any significant difference in n n2o concentration with depth for the summer campaign however for the winter campaign the upper sampling location sample 9 showed a concentration almost two times higher 15 5 μgn l versus 8 6 μgn l compared to the deeper sampling location sample 8 at the sgb site the concentrations of no3 decreased with depth but they showed significant variations between the summer and winter sampling campaigns the shallower sampling points 8 and 9 showed concentrations of 28 7 mg l and 47 9 mg l mg l in the summer and 21 5 mg l and 38 3 mg l in the winter the deeper samples 6 and 7 showed no3 concentrations 23 5 mg l and 18 3 mg l in the summer and of 48 7 mg l and 1 56 mg l in the winter the concentrations of do were in a range between 7 0 mg l to 9 6 mg l decreasing with depth during both sampling periods the sp and n n2o results red circles fig 4 a and c changed in the same direction along the depth profile both in the summer and winter campaigns with the exception of location 7 for n n2o this indicates the absence of n2o reduction processes ostrom et al 2007 the similarity between n n2o and δ15n n2o evolutions blue circle fig 4 b in the winter campaign also indicates that n2o is not reduced such a similarity is not observed for the summer sampling campaign which in this case might evidence n2o reduction moreover data from the summer campaign show a strong covariation with depth between of δ15n n2o and δ15nβ n2o green circle fig 4 c which suggests close dependence between these two parameters the δ15nα n2o enrichment increased with depth while the δ18o n2o green circles fig 4 c decreased slightly the winter campaign data show that δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o δ15nβ n2o and δ18o n2o green circles fig 4 c parameters exhibited similar vertical distribution patterns along the vertical profile with more pronounced increase of δ15nα n2o with depth this observation suggests that δ15n n2o signature might be either influenced by production processes solely or influenced to the same extent with both n2o production and reduction processes all samples collected at bovenistier showed n n2o concentrations exceeding the equilibrium with the atmosphere similarly to the sgb site the concentration of this gas was higher in the winter 10 5 μgn l 1 7 μgn l than in the summer 8 6 μgn l 1 3 μgn l for the summer campaign samples 4 and 5 pzcs showed higher concentrations of n n2o 10 16 μgn l and 9 26 μgn l respectively in comparison to 3 and 2 pz12 where its concentrations were nearly the same around 7 μgn l during the winter campaign n n2o concentrations varied vary between 10 7 μg n l and 12 4 μgn l at all of the sampling points with higher concentrations observed at the bottom parts of piezometers sampling points 4 and 2 during the winter campaign n2o was detected at a concentration of 7 7 μgn l at the deepest sampling location 1 pz13 but in the summer campaign the concentration there was below the detection limit during the summer campaign the concentration of no3 did not change noticeably between point 4 and 5 pzcs 40 mg l but it varied between samples 3 and 5 47 8 mg l vs 37 0 mg l located respectively in the shallow and deep part of pz12 during this period no3 was not detected in the sample collected at location 1 in pz13 in the winter the no3 concentration was almost two times lower at location 5 24 2 mg l than at location 4 46 2 mg l at the same period there was no significant difference in no3 between locations 2 and 3 40 mg l and the concentration of no3 was 47 9 mg l at point 1 in pz13 the concentration of do varied from 1 5 mg l to 9 9 mg l at bovenistier variations with depth of n n2o and sp red circles fig 5 a and c were different for both winter and summer periods however these differences are not significant enough to conclude on the possible occurrence of n2o reduction at the same time the similarity observed between n n2o and δ15n n2o blue circle fig 5 b profiles for winter except for the deepest sampling point at pz12 and pz13 indicates the absence of n2o reduction in the shallower part of the aquifer and its occurrence in the deepest part n2o reduction processes at the bottom part of the aquifer are also supported by the positive value of δ15n n2o 9 2 and the high δ18o n2o value 66 0 during the summer campaign differences in n n2o and δ15n n2o patterns can be attributed to n2o reduction summer period shows nearly the same distributions of δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o δ15nβ n2o and δ18o n2o green circles fig 5 c except the slight decrease in δ18o n2o at the interval which corresponds to sampling locations 5 and 4 in winter the patterns between δ15n n2o δ15nα n2o δ15nβ n2o and δ18o n2o green circles fig 5 c are identical with the obvious increase at the deeper aquifer layers which corresponds to sampling point 1 pz13 this indicates that n2o reduction dominates n2o production in the deeper part of the aquifer at the same time n2o production exceeds its consumption or occurs to the same extent at the upper part of the aquifer 3 3 potential rates of nitrification and denitrification processes obtained from laboratory incubation experiment the results of the isotope analyses of 15n no3 15n n2o and 15n n2 have not highlighted any considerable enrichment of respective compounds between different time spans this indicates that nitrification or denitrification processes did not occur at significant rates in the bottles during the incubation experiments the maximal analytical errors of the 15n no3 15n n2o and 15n n2 analyses were 2 0 14 and 0 1 the detection limits were 1 for nitrification 2 7 nmol l h and 2 for denitrification 2 7 nmol l h for n2 and 0 0002 nmol l h for n2o 4 discussion 4 1 evidence of n2o production and consumption processes obtained from the analyses of ambient groundwater samples according to the results both n2o production and consumptions processes occur in the chalk aquifer the fact that n as an initial substrate originates from different sources at different depths complicates the distinction between nitrification and denitrification as well as between n2o production and consumption mechanisms at sgb the similarity between δ15n n2o and δ15nβ n2o in the summer campaign means that the isotopic signature of n2o is not determined by n2o reduction in the winter campaign simultaneous increase in n2o isotopomers values with more pronounced increase in 15nα and δ18o n2o at levels 7 and 6 indicates park et al 2011 the occurrence of n2o reduction processes at the bottom part of the aquifer this is also supported by the drastic decrease in the concentration of no3 at sampling point 6 in comparison to 7 the opposite patterns of no3 and n2o concentrations in the deep part of the aquifer both in summer and winter periods provide additional evidence of reduction processes minamikawa et al 2011 at bovenistier it could be concluded that n2o production processes dominate over its consumption based on the similarities in the distributions of n isotopes isotopomers and n n2o concentrations along the vertical profile intensive n2o consumption is revealed only in the deep part of the aquifer pz13 during the winter campaign this observation is probably related to significant no3 input which stimulated denitrification process and allowed to detect n2o at measureable levels as a first conclusion despite of the occurrence of aerobic conditions at sgb and bovenistier both production and consumption processes govern the dynamics of n2o with the reduction processes being more pronounced in the deeper part of the aquifer such conclusions are supported by the fact that there is more and more evidence of denitrifiers being capable of using both do and no3 as electron acceptors zhu et al 2019 moreover there are studies which suggest the presence of micro anaerobic hotspots in total aerobic environments capable of supporting denitrification processes well et al 2012 4 2 evidence of n2o production and consumption processes from laboratory incubation experiments the results show that our previous hypothesis about the simultaneous occurrence of both nitrification and denitrification processes in the aquifer might not explain the sp values of n2o measured in groundwater samples collected during the regional and local investigations consequently on the one hand the availability of n2o in the aquifer might be explained by the infiltration of n2o produced by nitrification and denitrification processes occurring within the other parts of the aquifer alternatively there might exist a discrepancy between real aquifer conditions and laboratory experiments in particular in the aquifer groundwater is in permanent contact with biofilms attached to the rocks materials while groundwater samples collected in piezometers for incubation might not represent the real complexity of the subsurface environment to investigate this it would be needed to collect large volumes of groundwater to extract the available bacterial biomass and analyze it in order to determine the expression of nitrifying and denitrifying genes which might help to obtain better insight into the qualitative diversity of biofilm biotope since it is expected that there exists a constant flux of bacteria between biofilm and water layers 5 conclusions this study applied stable isotope analyses and laboratory design tracer experiments in order to clarify the origin of n2o in groundwater the results of measurements of n isotope parameters in ambient groundwater samples and laboratory incubations are controversial it is difficult to differentiate between the roles of nitrification and denitrification in n2o production because n isotopic signatures and sp values measured in collected groundwater are overlapping at the same time n2o reduction which is related solely to denitrification could be identified based on positive values of δ15n n2o high values of δ18o n2o 35 and enrichment in 15nα n2o in particular at one of the examined locations pz 13 sp δ15n n2o and δ18o n2o values of ambient groundwater showed ranges typical for complete denitrification with n2o reduction which coincide with the lower do levels measured at this location since direct measurement of the magnitude of nitrification and denitrification processes within the aquifer is not possible at the majority of selected locations due to the high groundwater fluxes it was decided to conduct laboratory bottle incubation experiments to determine the potential rates of respective processes those results did not detect nitrification and denitrification in the bottles and this might be related to the fact that n2o availability in groundwater is determined by nitrification and denitrification processes in the unsaturated zone however the results draw our attention since at pz 13 the sp and δ15n n2o values were significantly different from values obtained at other locations as they showed ranges typical for n2o reduction which coincide with low do levels in groundwater at this location those three facts suggest that the best explanation might be the discrepancy between real aquifer conditions and lab design studies laboratory studies were conducted under controlled conditions but the aquifer conditions are more complex not only the amount of bacteria in the collected samples could differ but reaction rates during the experiments and in the aquifer actually differ therefore the isotopic signatures of n2o in the aquifer might indicate that denitrification occurs in the aquifer but the responsible bacteria were not present in sufficient quantity in the collected groundwater samples because they mostly reside in biofilms attached to the surface of the rocks materials to sum up the solitary application of isotope and isotopomer analyses together with hydrochemical evidence can provide the information only about production or consumption of n2o in the subsurface under the heterogeneous conditions prevailing in the subsurface the sp values and n isotope signatures are the result of mixing between continuous transformation and transport processes of n compounds driven from different sources consequently it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the location and extent of key functional zones in n cycle dynamics based only on the isotope and isotopomer datasets evidences from laboratory incubation experiments should be verified by additional in situ tracer experiments at locations that are characterized by low groundwater fluxes that allows leaving a tracer in subsurface for at least several hours in addition it will be useful to conduct microbiological studies of the biomass extracted from groundwater which will allow having better understanding about activity of subsurface biofilm biotope finally it is important to emphasize that microbiological findings should not be focused on the evidence of abundance of certain organisms or enzymes which might be misleading but rather on determining their actual activity based on mrnas or protein declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this project has
