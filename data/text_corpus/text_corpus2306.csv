11530,italy is the leading rice producer in europe accounting for more than half of the total high quality production of this crop rice is traditionally grown in fields that remain flooded starting with crop establishment until close to harvest the water management in rice areas requires a high level of labor because it is based on maintaining a predetermined water height in paddy fields and because the regulation of input and output flow is typically operated manually by the farmers this study aims to evaluate the hydraulic control and economical performances of the first automatic and remote controlled system applied for traditional rice irrigation in europe and tested in italy during 2016 agricultural season in particular i the effects of automation on the water balance ii the reliability of the irrigation system for a real time control of flow regulation and water level management in the field and iii the economic viability of the investment are investigated the results show that despite the automatic system has not proven a decrease of water consumptions ranging from 2000 to 3700 mm or a significant increase of rice yield of about 8 ton hectare 1 it has not revealed any mechanical malfunctioning during the irrigation season and it allows to drastically reduce the time spent by workers for water level control and flow regulation lastly the price of the automatic irrigation system ranging from 638 to 689 hectare 1 appears to be in good agreement with respect to the willingness of farmers for innovation keywords paddy field automatic system for irrigation remote controlled gate hydraulic control economic performances 1 introduction 1 1 rice irrigation features in the italian agricultural context rice is a staple crop for more than half the world s population approximately 90 of world rice production is grown in asia while the quantities produced in europe are relatively limited approximately 2 million tons italy with more than half of the total european rice production is the first producer of the old continent while spain greece portugal and france appear in the top five producers providing about 30 10 5 and 3 of the total european rice production respectively eurostat 2013 istat 2009 fig 1 the most important rice growing area in italy is a portion of the padana plain located to the east of ticino river straddling the regions of lombardy and piedmont in northern italy more than 200 000 ha 92 of the italian rice surface national rice centre 2015 although the main objective of the rice farms is productive areas in which the prevailing crop is rice create a peculiar agro ecosystem characterized by the presence of water in the fields for several months each year leibundgut and kohn 2014 this extensive water presence endows these areas with significant landscape and natural heritage values ranging from the preservation of traditional rural landscapes to the safeguarding of different animal and plant species typical of wetland areas cesari de maria et al 2016 masseroni et al 2017b the prolonged presence and circulation of water due to continuous flooding of fields from wet sowing until close to harvest represents a distinguishing feature of these rice areas some of which have also been included in the european ecological network natura 2000 and on the official list of the european special protected areas habitat directive 92 43 eec european commission 1992 chiaradia et al 2013 however the traditional irrigation technique based on continuous flooding during the growing season still dominates in most areas for example in 85 of the northern italy rice area and is characterized by very low irrigation efficiencies and a high level labor requirement performed by workers named in italian acquaioli which combine rich hands on experience and local traditional knowledge although there are no accurate literature measurements related to the time that farmers spend for irrigation management of their fields it may be estimated that a significant fraction of the working day during the agricultural season is dedicated to the manual control and adjustment of the gates to maintain the correct levels of water inside the paddy fields this fraction of the day can vary considerably depending on the extension of the cultivated area the growing period and the fragmentation of the rice growing property consequently these features affect the fixed costs of individual companies primarily for the assumption of seasonal workers time that is dedicated full time or part time to irrigation management the implementation of reliable automatic irrigation systems which support the manual operations of these workers is strictly encouraged especially by farmers in order to ensure a more rational allocation of water in the fields according crop conditions moreover from the legislative point of view the recommendations provided in the european water framework directive 2000 60 cee recently transposed into the italian national law n 213 of the 15 july 2015 stress on the necessity to reduce the water consumptions through i the measure of irrigation consumptions ii the improvement irrigation efficiency and iii the development of new irrigation management framework and tools 1 2 compendium of applications of automatic gravity fed irrigation systems various attempts to develop and apply automatic gravity fed irrigation systems have been reported in the literature niblack and sanchez 2008 dassanayake et al 2010 shahidian and serralheiro 2012 in particular automatic systems for bay irrigation such as farmconnect rubicon water 2013 and aquator gm poly 2013 are commercially available in australia and north america adoption of these systems is growing particularly in northern victoria in response to the combined influences of a modernised and automatic supply system growers access to higher and more consistent flow rates increasing labour costs and government incentives for on farm improvements to date these systems have been largely applied for furrow or border irrigations with suitable infrastructure to deliver water to the field in a controlled and uniform manner preliminary trials obtained by koech et al 2014a 2014b have shown that on maize soybean lucerne pasture and cotton these systems are effective in improving application efficiency above the values routinely achieved by the growers along with these developments in australia the cotton industry has been funding the development of a real time optimisation system for furrow irrigation khatri and smith 2006 2007 smart automated furrow irrigation of cotton are widely adopted on farms in the southern part of australia mainly in the state of victoria and in california united states of america where gravity fed surface irrigation methods are currently adopted to irrigate large portions of cultivated areas gillies et al 2010 uddin et al 2015 different case studies in which these systems are adopted for wheat barley faba bean canola and maize crops demonstrated that the application of automatic systems leads to a reduction of the time spent by the farmer for irrigation koech et al 2014a 2014b and to an increase in water application efficiency smith et al 2016a 2016b in these areas farmers managed properties ranging from 200 to 800 hectares with single fields characterized by a surface of approximately 8 10 ha irrigation of each field requires several hours and interviews with farmers show that they have to interrupt other farm chores to close and open the bay gates these gates are habitually closed later than the optimal cut off time leading to a water wastage of approximately 20 compared with the real crop requirements of each irrigation event gillies and smith 2015 the introduction of well designed and well managed gravity fed surface irrigation systems using automatic and remote controlled gates can increase application efficiencies and reduce very significantly the labour requirements for example an extensive number of furrow irrigation evaluations in the australian sugar and cotton industries during the 1990s raine and bakker 1996 smith et al 2005 found application efficiencies for individual furrow irrigations averaging approximately 50 and ranging from 10 to 90 in cotton production an increase in the furrow inflow rates of 6 l s 1 combined with a reduction in the irrigation duration time to cut off enabled attaining an average application efficiency of approximately 75 smith et al 2005 the analysis of the cotton industry irrigation water consumption showed that over a 16 year period the wide adoption of automatic irrigation systems allowed a water savings of approximately 28 5 million of m3 year 1 which contributed to an industry improvement in water use efficiency of 10 bda group 2007 a similar situation occurred for the dairy industry in the goulburn murray irrigation district gmid in northern victoria australia a study by the cooperative research centre for irrigation futures smith et al 2009 gillies et al 2010 demonstrated that significant gains in application efficiency approximately 20 can be reached in the bay irrigation of pasture and fodder crops simply by doubling the flow rates to at least 0 2 million m3 day 1 m 1 width and reducing the irrigation durations generally in these cases the type of flow control was dependent on the soil water content which was monitored using multi level sensors placed within each field the continuous monitoring of the soil water content compared with the crop specific water stress threshold provided a framework for when to irrigate and how much water to apply despite the encouraging results obtained in the australian and united states agricultural contexts currently the literature does not show any trials of these systems in europe only two experiments were contemporaneously running in spain and italy in the year 2016 for supplying irrigation requirements to crops using automatic and remote controlled gate prototypes in spain the automatic gate was tested on maize and grass providing furrow and basin irrigations respectively soil moisture probes located at different depths in the field assured a real time flow control in order to schedule irrigations according crop requirements while in italy the automatic gate was tested on a rice field with traditional irrigation management with the aim to maintain optimal flooding conditions during the growing season in this case the flow control at the field inlet was provided by a water level sensor located close to the field outflow masseroni et al 2017a 1 3 objectives the purpose of this study concerns the evaluation of i hydraulic ii control and iii economic performances of the first automatic and remote controlled gate prototype already described in its hardware and software components in masseroni et al 2017a originally designed for furrow basin or border irrigations and rearranged for a traditional rice irrigation in europe and tested with a pilot project in italy in particular the specific objectives of the paper are i to analyze the effects of automation on the water balance ii to critically discuss the reliability of the gate for a real time control of flow regulation and water level management in the field and iii to evaluate the economic viability of the investment for the european farmers 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental campaign was carried out in the agricultural season 2016 from april to september the experimental site of cerino farm 45 08 00 00 n 8 44 42 15 e fig 2 is composed by 7 fields each of about 5 8 ha provided with one inlet and one outlet for irrigation and runoff respectively cultivated with two similar rice cultivar terra and sole registered trademarks in monoculture dry seeding and delayed flooding dfl method is applied in all fields i e rice is seeded in dry soil and the field is flooded when rice is approximately around the three leaf stage about one month after the seeding the availability of water for the farm irrigation is continuous during the year because the water is supplied from a spring canal named roggia raina with a mean flow during the agricultural season of about 2 5 m3 s 1 and delivered by a main farm canal with a maximum flow capacity of about 1 m3 s 1 up to the single fields point p1 in fig 3 a in the experimental farm the hydraulic structure in inlet to each field is constituted by a concrete structure supporting a 50 cm wide and 60 cm high iron gate which regulates the flow through an orifice with diameter of 40 cm the farmer opens and closes the gates manually many times a day according to the water level in the fields and taking into account the crop conditions assessed through a combination of visual judgment and personal experience before the irrigation season 2016 at the inlet point of the field a 7 8 ha a rectangular concrete structure of 720 mm width 650 mm high and 5500 mm long was built and connected in front of the traditional hydraulic structure for accommodating one automatic gate baydrive and one sonary box flow meter sensor flumemeter the former was designed for the case study by rubicon water industry and traditionally applied for furrow basin or border irrigations while the latter is a standard meter box for measuring the velocity profile through ultrasonic array principle specifically the flumemeter sensor and the baydrive gate were located downstream the orifice of the field a point p2 in fig 3b at a distance about 2 m and 4 m respectively in order to reduce the flow turbulence in input to the flumemeter during irrigations this device configuration provides a good level of precision of the flow measurements maintaining their accuracy in the range of 2 5 as reported in the flumemeter fact sheet a water level sensor floodtech for a continuous monitoring of the water level in the field was located at the end of the south east part of the field a point p3 in fig 3c providing the data required to govern the baydrive gate in real time according to the precise time to cut off the flow rate the sensor was located at the end of the field in order to guarantee and homogeneous water level conditions all over parts of the plot the aim of the system automation was the control and adjustment of the gate for maintaining the correct levels of water inside the paddy field according to the farmer settings scheduled during the growing season for a detailed description of the installed instrumentations transmission procedures and operation scheduling the reader can refer to masseroni et al 2017a 2017b in the field a seeding was the 12th of april while harvesting was the 10th of september the field was maintained completely flooded from about the 12th of may to the 15th of august the soil can be classified as sandy loam with a mean saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of about 1 0 cm day 1 evaluated in a soil horizon that reaches the 80 cm below the ground level the plow sole is located at about 30 35 cm below the ground level while the groundwater level is about 100 cm below the ground level on average throughout the agricultural season 2 2 instrumentation the cerino farm was part of a project aimed at quantifying the water efficiency in paddy areas of northern italy at the changing of the spatial scale watpad project funded by fondazione cariplo grant number 2014 1260 in this contest an intense monitoring activity was conducted in the farm in the years 2015 and 2016 at the cerino farm a detailed soil survey was carried out in more than 50 points of the farm about 10 for each field and in many soil horizons for detecting soil textures and soil hydraulic properties nonstandard and innovative prototype system specifically designed for the case study was implemented for the monitoring of paddies water fluxes details about the adopted monitoring systems are provided by chiaradia et al 2015 therefore just a brief summary is given in the following inflow and outflow discharges in each plot were measured by a parshall long throated flume associated with a specific stage discharge relationship only the parshall flume at the inlet point of the field a was replaced with the flumemeter in the year 2016 groundwater levels were monitored by a series of 19 piezometric wells 3 m depth positioned along the bunds dividing the plots in each well a capacity pressure probe 41x by keller or mtm n10 by sts instruments was installed for detecting in continuous groundwater level the same typology of probes was used to monitor the water level in the field during flooding periods in particular one water level sensor per plot was placed close to the inlet point soil water contents were measured in each field by 7 soil moisture multi level probes depths 10 30 50 and 70 cm enviroscan by sentek calibrated by volumetric measures on undisturbed soil samples collected at the beginning of the seasons data of the probes and devices were recorded every ten minutes and stored in a set of campbell scientific dataloggers 3 cr1000 5 cr200 and 1 cr800 self powered by solar panels data were checked and downloaded on field more or less one time a week except for the baydrive flumemeter and floodtech sensors where the data were send via wireless to the farmconnect gateway mother station and then sent via gsm to a dedicated farmconnect web page to be remotely available in real time meteorological data were provided by a davis vantage pro2 weather station located in the middle of the farm at a height of 2 m from the ground level these great amount of experimental data were needed for calculating the terms of the water balance in each field in particular amount of irrigation supply tail water drainage flowing out from the fields rainfall crop evapotranspiration change in soil water storage within the root zone between 0 and 80 cm depth and in ponding water over the field percolation out of the root zone 2 3 automatic irrigation system performances the hydraulic performance of the automatic irrigation system is assessed by comparing the water balance terms determined for field a in the years 2015 and 2016 while during year 2016 a comparison of water fluxes between field a automatically managed and field b manually managed is carried out since very similar topographical soil and hydrological features were assessed for the two fields during 2015 table 1 the control performance of the baydrive gate is assessed as follows i analyzing the ability of the gate to maintain autonomously optimal flooding conditions i e a constant water level in the field according the farmer s scheduling ii checking if any hardware malfunctions or communication breaks occurred during the growing season the assessment of the economical performance is performed analyzing the improvements achieved by the automated irrigation system with respect to traditional rice irrigation management features in particular traditional rice irrigation management practices were extrapolated from questionnaires distributed by the national rice center technicians to 45 farmers homogenously spread over a rice area of about 1500 km2 located between the ticino and sesia rivers fig 4 the 13 questions listed in the interview are the following and the answer referring to the agricultural season 2016 1 municipality where the farm is located 2 utilized agricultural area uaa for rice cultivation within the farm 3 type of seeding method surface devoted to each method and

cumulated inflow if applied to field a was about 2700 mm and 3700 mm respectively in years 2015 and 2016 fig 5 a and c while in field b in the year 2015 and 2016 the irrigation inflow was respectively about 2000 mm and 2600 mm fig 5b and d rainfall was lower than 500 mm in both seasons cumulated evapotranspiration et was about 700 mm in both fields and years the soil water storage sws between 0 and 80 cm depth in the fields under saturated condition was about 250 mm for both fields and years fig 5e h confirming the attendance in the field of the same soil hydraulic features despite the soil preparation works before the seeding values of percolations dp obtained as residual terms in the water balance computation for fields a and b respectively in years 2015 and 2016 amounted ranging from 1700 to 2500 mm fig 5a b d while in the field a in the year 2016 the percolation was about 3500 mm fig 5c in both fields the irrigation outflow was negligible values of irrigation supply for fields a in the year 2015 and for the field b in the years 2015 and 2016 are in good agreement with results found in the literature which reports water consumptions ranging from 1500 to 3000 mm singh et al 2001 tabbal et al 2002 zhao et al 2015 the amount of irrigation in the field a in the year 2016 instead is in reasonable agreement with the results of previous water balance experiments carried out in the northern italy rice area with irrigations sometimes exceeding 3000 mm cesari de maria et al 2016 de maria et al 2017 concerning water levels in fields a and b they were maintained on average equal for both the fields during the entire 2015 and then 2016 growing seasons about 50 mm for both fields in the year 2015 fig 5e and f and 150 mm for both fields in the year 2016 fig 5g and h despite the water levels in the year 2016 are generally greater than those maintained in the year 2015 comparing the water levels in the field a the average water level in 2016 was higher than in 2015 of about 70 mm in view of the fact that water level in field a in 2016 when baydrive gate was operating was scheduled by the farmer during the growing season the reasons of this gap could be explained mainly by farmer s lack of knowledge of the actual water levels in the fields as well as to a natural proclivity to increase the water supply in order to avoid any crop water stress when a new irrigation technology was adopted as a matter of fact water levels which the farmer believed to have maintained in the field according to his visual judgment and experience are far from the actual conditions in the year 2016 the farmer set a mean water level of 150 mm within the field a to obtain the water level achieved in 2015 by manually regulating the inflow gate this factor led to an increase of water supply in field a in 2016 which however cannot be ascribed to the automated irrigation system itself but to the way in which the system was set in fig 6 water levels monitored near the inlet point of the field a in years 2015 and 2016 between the 4th of july and the 13th of august are shown while in the first case fig 6a the water level fluctuations are evident and ranging between 20 mm and 100 mm in the year 2016 fig 6b even if the water level in the field is higher than in the previous year water level fluctuations are restricted in a range between 150 mm and 200 mm the field a provided an average yield of 8 8 ton hectare 1 in 2015 and 8 4 ton hectare 1 in 2016 the field b provided an average yield of 8 4 ton hectare 1 in 2015 and 8 7 ton hectare 1 in 2016 applying the fisher test on average productions the difference in rice yield occurred between 2015 and 2016 is not significant for both fields p value 001 3 2 control performance the complex of automatic irrigation system components constituted by the baydrive gate the floodtech sensor and the flumemeter device proved to reliable since no malfunctioning occurred during the whole experimental campaign the farmconnect software uploaded online sensor readings every ten minutes as planned and by means of a web based interface the farmer was able to manage the irrigation using his computer and smartphone in particular each irrigation event consists of a single cycle of gate opening and closing then the program is aborted this type of scheduling was designed in primis for furrow and basin irrigations as well as for rotational water supplies i e where the number of irrigations in a growing season is relatively low no more than 10 12 irrigations koech et al 2014a 2014b in field a the high soil conductivity ksat 1 02 cm day 1 requires to schedule multiple irrigation events in a day in order to maintain the fixed water level threshold within the field in fig 7 the gate maneuvering sequences in 45 days from the 4th of july to the 13th of august are shown in particular when maneuvering phase is 1 the gate is completely open while when maneuvering phase is 1 the gate is completely close in this period 167 irrigation events occurred with a mean of about 3 irrigation events per day value that is maintained also for the entire agricultural season according the current characteristics of the irrigation program setting procedure used in this pilot project require the farmer to initiate repetitive sub weekly scheduling procedure with a considerable amount of time spent for programming concerning the ability of the baydrive gate to maintain optimal flooding conditions the real time communication between floodtech sensor and baydrive gate allows to optimize the binomial flow rate cutoff time thus minimizing the water level fluctuations in the field for this pilot project the gate worked only in two positions i e fully opened or fully closed as the vendor is yet to commercialize a solution for rice which would include autonomous multiple events within its program as a result a lag time has to be taken into consideration in the choice of the optimal water level range to be preserved in the field the lag time consists in the time needed for water to flow from the inlet point of the field where the baydrive gate is located to the end of the field where the floodtech sensor is installed in fact as shown in fig 8 a where a range of 115 125 mm was set in the program the water level fluctuations in the field are on average of about 40 mm between 100 mm and 140 mm conversely as shown in fig 8b where a range of 159 160 mm was set in the program the water level fluctuations in the field are on average only about 5 mm between 158 mm and 163 mm this means that for minimizing water level fluctuations in the field a narrow range of water levels has to be set however this setting operation leads to an increase of the number of gate openings and closings in fig 8a and b three drying periods for agronomic treatments are shown on june 21st and june 26th during the first period and from the 28th of july to the 3th of august in the second period 3 3 economical performance 3 3 1 results of questionnaires the uaa devoted to rice cultivation in the surveyed farms is on average 63 ha with a minimum and a maximum size of 11 and 160 ha the overall uaa of the surveyed farms is about 2837 ha the overall surface with dfl seeding method is about 1940 ha 68 4 of the total area while that the wfl method is adopted only on 816 ha 28 8 of the total area the remaining surface about 81 ha i e 2 8 of the total area is devoted to other types of seeding and irrigation management not specified in the questionnaires referring the number of farms preferring dfl or wfl methods the 58 of farms adopted for all fields the dfl seeding and irrigation method while the 29 of farms adopted for all the fields the wfl method the 13 of farms adopted both methods of rice seeding fig 9 a two diversion canals on average supply water to each farm independently from the uaa size as shown in fig 10 this is probably due to a high level of farm fragmentation istat 2010 aggravated by an agrarian context where land reorganization plans and rational allocation of water resource are extremely difficult to achieve in 20 farms the water is delivered in continuous while in 16 farms the water is delivered following a rotational schedule in 9 farms both the modes are present depending on the type of irrigation license granted by the regional authority or by the irrigation consortium to each farm diversion canal in general between ticino and sesia rivers the continuous method of supply prevails while between ticino and adda rivers supply by rotation is preferred also in according to the prevailing seeding and irrigation method i e the dfl fig 9b irrigation in the surveyed farms is entirely manually managed and the gravity fed systems prevail over pumped irrigation systems 28 farms adopt gravity fed irrigation systems 2 farms adopt pumped systems 15 farms adopt both methods fig 9c regarding the gravity fed distribution system the water is delivered to the field by a network of canals the flow regulation is performed opening and closing sluice gates located along the canals at the inlet of each field flow regulation is performed according to water availability and crop status flow regulation is performed on average 2 times per day during the entire growing season and 3 man hours is the average labor requirement for flow regulation in a day generally 2 workers per farm are involved in the irrigation management 3 3 2 cost benefit analysis the average cost for a complete automated irrigation system composed by one baydrive gate one floodtech sensor transmission antenna communication and actuation protocols power supply and farmconnect software is about 7704 subdivided in 1540 for the gate 700 for the rubber insert 1806 for the water level sensor 3224 for the antenna communication protocols 245 for installation and finally 189 for farmconnect software and commissioning the gate cost can vary considerably in function of the baydrive width however in this study we chose the price of a generic gate of about 70 cm width according the dimension of the inlet point of the field a in addition to this cost an annual maintenance fee for automation of about 21 gate 1 year 1 and floodtech 1 year 1 is required which include software upgrade services gates maintenance and data storages an annual sim card recharge service of about 315 year 1 has to be included the cost of the initial investment for the surveyed farms is on average 43 474 this cost was obtained by multiplying the fixed costs for the automation system i e 1540 for gate 700 for rubber insert 1806 for the water level sensor 378 for software and commissioning for the mean number of fields per farm supposing one field one gate the mean number of fields per farm is about 9 the latter calculated as the ratio between the mean uaa for the surveyed farms about 63 ha and the mean size of a rice field about 7 ha furthermore to the previous costs 3224 plus 245 respectively for central gateway transmission device and for installation both costs are independent by the number of fields are summed the life time of the whole automatic system is supposed to be 20 years after which all the devices should be replaced with new equipment regarding the management costs of a traditional rice irrigation system the overall hours invested in a day for the farm irrigation were multiplied for i the hourly cost of a non specialized agricultural worker 13 73 hour 1 by istat information ii the days of an irrigation season about 90 days and lastly iii the number of workers involved in irrigation procedures the irrigation management cost amounts to 3400 year 1 as well as 2300 year 1 for the irrigation network maintenance as sum of farm canals and gates maintenance the npv methodology was applied to quantify the profitability of the automation adoption and separately the manual option by subtracting the actual value of cash outflows including initial cost from the actual value of cash inflows over the life time of devices 20 year a discount rate of 5 is supposed the cash outflows for the automation solution are i the initial investment 43 474 at the first year ii the annual fee for automation and sim card recharge service 688 year 1 iii the cost for farm canals maintenance about 460 year 1 supposed to be 20 of the total cost of the irrigation network maintenance iv the cost for the gates tele control supposed about 15 min day 1 of about 309 year 1 i e 13 73 hour 1 15 min day 1 90 days year 1 60 1 h min 1 while the cash outflow for the manual solution are i the labor cost for traditional rice irrigation 3400 year 1 ii the cost of irrigation network maintenance 2300 year 1 the results show that the npv at the end of the 20th year is positive about 9400 for the automation solution and therefore the investment can be accepted and can be selected over the manual option fig 11 the investment is fully repaid at the end of the 14th year with a total capital cost of ranging from 638 to 689 hectare 1 the former in the case where gateway and installation costs are amortized across 12 properties as usually performed in the australian installations a factor that should be taken into account is that no significant increase of rice production occurred in the field a between 2015 and 2016 agricultural season as well as no significant reduction in water consumptions were observed as shown in section 4 1 by the comparison between the water inflow rate at the field a automatically managed and at the field b manually managed generally in literature is commonly known that automatic systems for gravity irrigation allow to achieve an increase of application efficiency and uniformity distribution up to 40 50 in cases of furrow or basin irrigations as a consequence of a real time selection of the optimum combination between irrigation flow rate and cut off time smith et al 2016a 2016b in the case of flooding irrigation rice fields flow rates and cutoff times are usually replaced with a constant water inflow to the field this allows to achieve both application efficiency and distribution uniformity at the maximum possible level also with a traditional and manually managed irrigation management furthermore if an adequate water level in the field is maintained during the growing season generally between 5 20 cm water stress should not occur and the quality and quantity of production should not be subject to evident changes bouman et al 2007 in our case for both years the mean water level in the field a was maintained within the optimal range about 10 cm on average in the year 2015 and 15 cm on average in the year 2016 and only a decrease of water level fluctuations was provided by the automatic system these findings from one season only suggest that only small variations in water consumption and rice production might be envisaged over consecutive years and the profitability derived from potential reduction of water consumptions or by the increase of rice production probably will not improve the economic balance for example reducing the time of investment repayment this fact is also amplified by a low water price for irrigation that is about 17 10 3 m 3 in respect to that of other european countries such as spain and greece where the costs are about 100 10 3 m 3 and 82 10 3 m 3 respectively bardarska and hadjieva 2000 this implies that even if a relevant reduction of water uses for farm irrigation would occur the economic benefit would be relatively low it follow that the mainly advantage provided by the automatic system adoption in italian paddy fields would concern almost exclusively the reduction of labor cost of the workers involved in irrigation procedures but would probably not provide improvements in terms of rice production or irrigation efficiencies nevertheless both these aspects improvement of yield and decreasing in water consumption depending on automation should be analyzed in detail considering more than one year of experimental data 4 conclusion remarks in this work the performances of an innovative automatic irrigation prototype originally designed for furrow basin or border irrigations and rearranged for the traditional rice irrigation in europe are evaluated the experimental activity was carried out in the agricultural season 2016 in a paddy field located in the most important rice growing area in italy specifically in the municipality of semiana the system was composed by one baydrive gate for automatic and remote controlled flow regulation one flumemeter box for inlet flow measurements one floodtech sensor for the real time monitoring of water level in the field and lastly one farmconnect gateway as a connection device to the cellular network the outcomes show the following positive aspects i the automatic irrigation system did not reveal any mechanical malfunctioning during the irrigation season as well as good communication protocols provides reliable data transmission on the server web ii the web interface can be considered a valuable tool for an easy real time control of gate position flow regulation and water level measurement in the field iii the automatic irrigation system allows to reduce the time spent by workers for water level control and flow regulation iv the automatic irrigation system allows for constant flow to maintain a constant water level with a narrow operational band compared to the manually operated system the previous year fig 6 v the current price of the automatic irrigation system ranging from 638 to 689 hectare 1 is suitable with respect to the willingness of farmers to spend for innovation inferred by questionnaires data this result is in line with what achieved by the researches of university of lleida for two agrarian districts in lleida spain considering the current labor cost for irrigation the profitable investment for farm modernization with automatic irrigation system was assessed to be lower than 1000 hectare 1 conversely no significant reduction of water consumptions ranging from 2000 to 3700 mm or a significant increase of rice yield of about 8 ton hectare 1 occur in this experimentation but as shown in fig 5 a good correlation between water levels in the field and the amount of percolations suggests that a good water level maintenance in the field by automatic irrigation systems might lead to a stabilization of water losses e g percolations or runoffs some lessons learned from this pilot project for future development of a specific paddy automatic irrigation system could be i future development of software would require for traditional rice irrigation in europe that irrigation program settings incorporate the possibility to set different water levels according to specific period of time with respect to a regulation based on a number of cycles i e gate openings and closings in particular the farmer should be allowed to plan at the beginning of each agricultural season the water level in the field according to the crop growing phases or dry periods for agronomic treatments ii in the web page the farmers should set only two basic information for each scheduling i e the optimal range of water level in the field and the date of start and end of each scheduling independently by the number of opening and closing cycles of the gate iii regarding the automatic gate opening operation features the number of gate openings and closings could be drastically decreased if a self learning process is implemented in the gate program allowing thus the regulation of a constant flow in inlet to the field in this case the gate should change its degree of opening in function of the upstream at the canal and downstream in the field water levels this type of flow regulation could remedy the difficulties of a traditional rice irrigation especially in permeable soils that are typical in northern italy rice areas more than 40 of sandy and sandy loam soil textures moreover decreasing the number of gate opening and closing the wear of mechanical components and the ordinary maintenance costs could be minimized another setting typology able to simplify the automatic gate opening operation features could be the maintenance of a certain degree of gate opening related to the mean infiltration capacity of the field in order to maintain a constant flow in inlet to the field which compensates for the losses terms into the hydrological balance iv lastly the current costs for the automation appear affordable for the italian rice farmers since the npv of the automatic solution is positive even though this one year pilot project did not demonstrate a decrease of water consumptions or a significant increase of rice yield many externalities connected with an automatic and remote controlled management of irrigation should be taken into account if the performances of these systems are evaluated on a wider spatial scale i e irrigation district or basin scales in these cases the maintaining of the ecological landscape and environmental functions of the gravity fed irrigation systems and the continuous monitoring of the binominal crop water requirements water availability give to the irrigation water managers the possibility to plan the water allocation and to regulate water distribution in function of farmer requirements this overall improvement of the management performance could provide a profitable growth in revenue of irrigation consortia in particular reducing the time spending for gates maneuvering especially in the context of padana plain where the length of the irrigation network exceeds the 40 000 km lastly the combination of flow regulation and measurements provided by the automatic irrigation system can be a valuable support for the regional water authorities in order to evaluate the actual water consumptions according to the national law and european union recommendations this might provide an overview on irrigation efficiencies over the territories allow a more rational planning of irrigation resources in a more general prospective automatic gravity fed irrigation systems could automatically control the water deliver irrigation time irrigation water quantity according to soil conditions and crop requirements however in order that the system would be able to perform an irrigation control based on its management potentiality an integrated gravity fed irrigation system from storages or main rivers to the farms and finally to the fields should be designed fig 12 acknowledgements we wish to thank dr david aughton dr peter moller and dr reece tyrrell of rubicon water and its delegate for italy dr tullio zanotti for designing

11530,italy is the leading rice producer in europe accounting for more than half of the total high quality production of this crop rice is traditionally grown in fields that remain flooded starting with crop establishment until close to harvest the water management in rice areas requires a high level of labor because it is based on maintaining a predetermined water height in paddy fields and because the regulation of input and output flow is typically operated manually by the farmers this study aims to evaluate the hydraulic control and economical performances of the first automatic and remote controlled system applied for traditional rice irrigation in europe and tested in italy during 2016 agricultural season in particular i the effects of automation on the water balance ii the reliability of the irrigation system for a real time control of flow regulation and water level management in the field and iii the economic viability of the investment are investigated the results show that despite the automatic system has not proven a decrease of water consumptions ranging from 2000 to 3700 mm or a significant increase of rice yield of about 8 ton hectare 1 it has not revealed any mechanical malfunctioning during the irrigation season and it allows to drastically reduce the time spent by workers for water level control and flow regulation lastly the price of the automatic irrigation system ranging from 638 to 689 hectare 1 appears to be in good agreement with respect to the willingness of farmers for innovation keywords paddy field automatic system for irrigation remote controlled gate hydraulic control economic performances 1 introduction 1 1 rice irrigation features in the italian agricultural context rice is a staple crop for more than half the world s population approximately 90 of world rice production is grown in asia while the quantities produced in europe are relatively limited approximately 2 million tons italy with more than half of the total european rice production is the first producer of the old continent while spain greece portugal and france appear in the top five producers providing about 30 10 5 and 3 of the total european rice production respectively eurostat 2013 istat 2009 fig 1 the most important rice growing area in italy is a portion of the padana plain located to the east of ticino river straddling the regions of lombardy and piedmont in northern italy more than 200 000 ha 92 of the italian rice surface national rice centre 2015 although the main objective of the rice farms is productive areas in which the prevailing crop is rice create a peculiar agro ecosystem characterized by the presence of water in the fields for several months each year leibundgut and kohn 2014 this extensive water presence endows these areas with significant landscape and natural heritage values ranging from the preservation of traditional rural landscapes to the safeguarding of different animal and plant species typical of wetland areas cesari de maria et al 2016 masseroni et al 2017b the prolonged presence and circulation of water due to continuous flooding of fields from wet sowing until close to harvest represents a distinguishing feature of these rice areas some of which have also been included in the european ecological network natura 2000 and on the official list of the european special protected areas habitat directive 92 43 eec european commission 1992 chiaradia et al 2013 however the traditional irrigation technique based on continuous flooding during the growing season still dominates in most areas for example in 85 of the northern italy rice area and is characterized by very low irrigation efficiencies and a high level labor requirement performed by workers named in italian acquaioli which combine rich hands on experience and local traditional knowledge although there are no accurate literature measurements related to the time that farmers spend for irrigation management of their fields it may be estimated that a significant fraction of the working day during the agricultural season is dedicated to the manual control and adjustment of the gates to maintain the correct levels of water inside the paddy fields this fraction of the day can vary considerably depending on the extension of the cultivated area the growing period and the fragmentation of the rice growing property consequently these features affect the fixed costs of individual companies primarily for the assumption of seasonal workers time that is dedicated full time or part time to irrigation management the implementation of reliable automatic irrigation systems which support the manual operations of these workers is strictly encouraged especially by farmers in order to ensure a more rational allocation of water in the fields according crop conditions moreover from the legislative point of view the recommendations provided in the european water framework directive 2000 60 cee recently transposed into the italian national law n 213 of the 15 july 2015 stress on the necessity to reduce the water consumptions through i the measure of irrigation consumptions ii the improvement irrigation efficiency and iii the development of new irrigation management framework and tools 1 2 compendium of applications of automatic gravity fed irrigation systems various attempts to develop and apply automatic gravity fed irrigation systems have been reported in the literature niblack and sanchez 2008 dassanayake et al 2010 shahidian and serralheiro 2012 in particular automatic systems for bay irrigation such as farmconnect rubicon water 2013 and aquator gm poly 2013 are commercially available in australia and north america adoption of these systems is growing particularly in northern victoria in response to the combined influences of a modernised and automatic supply system growers access to higher and more consistent flow rates increasing labour costs and government incentives for on farm improvements to date these systems have been largely applied for furrow or border irrigations with suitable infrastructure to deliver water to the field in a controlled and uniform manner preliminary trials obtained by koech et al 2014a 2014b have shown that on maize soybean lucerne pasture and cotton these systems are effective in improving application efficiency above the values routinely achieved by the growers along with these developments in australia the cotton industry has been funding the development of a real time optimisation system for furrow irrigation khatri and smith 2006 2007 smart automated furrow irrigation of cotton are widely adopted on farms in the southern part of australia mainly in the state of victoria and in california united states of america where gravity fed surface irrigation methods are currently adopted to irrigate large portions of cultivated areas gillies et al 2010 uddin et al 2015 different case studies in which these systems are adopted for wheat barley faba bean canola and maize crops demonstrated that the application of automatic systems leads to a reduction of the time spent by the farmer for irrigation koech et al 2014a 2014b and to an increase in water application efficiency smith et al 2016a 2016b in these areas farmers managed properties ranging from 200 to 800 hectares with single fields characterized by a surface of approximately 8 10 ha irrigation of each field requires several hours and interviews with farmers show that they have to interrupt other farm chores to close and open the bay gates these gates are habitually closed later than the optimal cut off time leading to a water wastage of approximately 20 compared with the real crop requirements of each irrigation event gillies and smith 2015 the introduction of well designed and well managed gravity fed surface irrigation systems using automatic and remote controlled gates can increase application efficiencies and reduce very significantly the labour requirements for example an extensive number of furrow irrigation evaluations in the australian sugar and cotton industries during the 1990s raine and bakker 1996 smith et al 2005 found application efficiencies for individual furrow irrigations averaging approximately 50 and ranging from 10 to 90 in cotton production an increase in the furrow inflow rates of 6 l s 1 combined with a reduction in the irrigation duration time to cut off enabled attaining an average application efficiency of approximately 75 smith et al 2005 the analysis of the cotton industry irrigation water consumption showed that over a 16 year period the wide adoption of automatic irrigation systems allowed a water savings of approximately 28 5 million of m3 year 1 which contributed to an industry improvement in water use efficiency of 10 bda group 2007 a similar situation occurred for the dairy industry in the goulburn murray irrigation district gmid in northern victoria australia a study by the cooperative research centre for irrigation futures smith et al 2009 gillies et al 2010 demonstrated that significant gains in application efficiency approximately 20 can be reached in the bay irrigation of pasture and fodder crops simply by doubling the flow rates to at least 0 2 million m3 day 1 m 1 width and reducing the irrigation durations generally in these cases the type of flow control was dependent on the soil water content which was monitored using multi level sensors placed within each field the continuous monitoring of the soil water content compared with the crop specific water stress threshold provided a framework for when to irrigate and how much water to apply despite the encouraging results obtained in the australian and united states agricultural contexts currently the literature does not show any trials of these systems in europe only two experiments were contemporaneously running in spain and italy in the year 2016 for supplying irrigation requirements to crops using automatic and remote controlled gate prototypes in spain the automatic gate was tested on maize and grass providing furrow and basin irrigations respectively soil moisture probes located at different depths in the field assured a real time flow control in order to schedule irrigations according crop requirements while in italy the automatic gate was tested on a rice field with traditional irrigation management with the aim to maintain optimal flooding conditions during the growing season in this case the flow control at the field inlet was provided by a water level sensor located close to the field outflow masseroni et al 2017a 1 3 objectives the purpose of this study concerns the evaluation of i hydraulic ii control and iii economic performances of the first automatic and remote controlled gate prototype already described in its hardware and software components in masseroni et al 2017a originally designed for furrow basin or border irrigations and rearranged for a traditional rice irrigation in europe and tested with a pilot project in italy in particular the specific objectives of the paper are i to analyze the effects of automation on the water balance ii to critically discuss the reliability of the gate for a real time control of flow regulation and water level management in the field and iii to evaluate the economic viability of the investment for the european farmers 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the experimental campaign was carried out in the agricultural season 2016 from april to september the experimental site of cerino farm 45 08 00 00 n 8 44 42 15 e fig 2 is composed by 7 fields each of about 5 8 ha provided with one inlet and one outlet for irrigation and runoff respectively cultivated with two similar rice cultivar terra and sole registered trademarks in monoculture dry seeding and delayed flooding dfl method is applied in all fields i e rice is seeded in dry soil and the field is flooded when rice is approximately around the three leaf stage about one month after the seeding the availability of water for the farm irrigation is continuous during the year because the water is supplied from a spring canal named roggia raina with a mean flow during the agricultural season of about 2 5 m3 s 1 and delivered by a main farm canal with a maximum flow capacity of about 1 m3 s 1 up to the single fields point p1 in fig 3 a in the experimental farm the hydraulic structure in inlet to each field is constituted by a concrete structure supporting a 50 cm wide and 60 cm high iron gate which regulates the flow through an orifice with diameter of 40 cm the farmer opens and closes the gates manually many times a day according to the water level in the fields and taking into account the crop conditions assessed through a combination of visual judgment and personal experience before the irrigation season 2016 at the inlet point of the field a 7 8 ha a rectangular concrete structure of 720 mm width 650 mm high and 5500 mm long was built and connected in front of the traditional hydraulic structure for accommodating one automatic gate baydrive and one sonary box flow meter sensor flumemeter the former was designed for the case study by rubicon water industry and traditionally applied for furrow basin or border irrigations while the latter is a standard meter box for measuring the velocity profile through ultrasonic array principle specifically the flumemeter sensor and the baydrive gate were located downstream the orifice of the field a point p2 in fig 3b at a distance about 2 m and 4 m respectively in order to reduce the flow turbulence in input to the flumemeter during irrigations this device configuration provides a good level of precision of the flow measurements maintaining their accuracy in the range of 2 5 as reported in the flumemeter fact sheet a water level sensor floodtech for a continuous monitoring of the water level in the field was located at the end of the south east part of the field a point p3 in fig 3c providing the data required to govern the baydrive gate in real time according to the precise time to cut off the flow rate the sensor was located at the end of the field in order to guarantee and homogeneous water level conditions all over parts of the plot the aim of the system automation was the control and adjustment of the gate for maintaining the correct levels of water inside the paddy field according to the farmer settings scheduled during the growing season for a detailed description of the installed instrumentations transmission procedures and operation scheduling the reader can refer to masseroni et al 2017a 2017b in the field a seeding was the 12th of april while harvesting was the 10th of september the field was maintained completely flooded from about the 12th of may to the 15th of august the soil can be classified as sandy loam with a mean saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of about 1 0 cm day 1 evaluated in a soil horizon that reaches the 80 cm below the ground level the plow sole is located at about 30 35 cm below the ground level while the groundwater level is about 100 cm below the ground level on average throughout the agricultural season 2 2 instrumentation the cerino farm was part of a project aimed at quantifying the water efficiency in paddy areas of northern italy at the changing of the spatial scale watpad project funded by fondazione cariplo grant number 2014 1260 in this contest an intense monitoring activity was conducted in the farm in the years 2015 and 2016 at the cerino farm a detailed soil survey was carried out in more than 50 points of the farm about 10 for each field and in many soil horizons for detecting soil textures and soil hydraulic properties nonstandard and innovative prototype system specifically designed for the case study was implemented for the monitoring of paddies water fluxes details about the adopted monitoring systems are provided by chiaradia et al 2015 therefore just a brief summary is given in the following inflow and outflow discharges in each plot were measured by a parshall long throated flume associated with a specific stage discharge relationship only the parshall flume at the inlet point of the field a was replaced with the flumemeter in the year 2016 groundwater levels were monitored by a series of 19 piezometric wells 3 m depth positioned along the bunds dividing the plots in each well a capacity pressure probe 41x by keller or mtm n10 by sts instruments was installed for detecting in continuous groundwater level the same typology of probes was used to monitor the water level in the field during flooding periods in particular one water level sensor per plot was placed close to the inlet point soil water contents were measured in each field by 7 soil moisture multi level probes depths 10 30 50 and 70 cm enviroscan by sentek calibrated by volumetric measures on undisturbed soil samples collected at the beginning of the seasons data of the probes and devices were recorded every ten minutes and stored in a set of campbell scientific dataloggers 3 cr1000 5 cr200 and 1 cr800 self powered by solar panels data were checked and downloaded on field more or less one time a week except for the baydrive flumemeter and floodtech sensors where the data were send via wireless to the farmconnect gateway mother station and then sent via gsm to a dedicated farmconnect web page to be remotely available in real time meteorological data were provided by a davis vantage pro2 weather station located in the middle of the farm at a height of 2 m from the ground level these great amount of experimental data were needed for calculating the terms of the water balance in each field in particular amount of irrigation supply tail water drainage flowing out from the fields rainfall crop evapotranspiration change in soil water storage within the root zone between 0 and 80 cm depth and in ponding water over the field percolation out of the root zone 2 3 automatic irrigation system performances the hydraulic performance of the automatic irrigation system is assessed by comparing the water balance terms determined for field a in the years 2015 and 2016 while during year 2016 a comparison of water fluxes between field a automatically managed and field b manually managed is carried out since very similar topographical soil and hydrological features were assessed for the two fields during 2015 table 1 the control performance of the baydrive gate is assessed as follows i analyzing the ability of the gate to maintain autonomously optimal flooding conditions i e a constant water level in the field according the farmer s scheduling ii checking if any hardware malfunctions or communication breaks occurred during the growing season the assessment of the economical performance is performed analyzing the improvements achieved by the automated irrigation system with respect to traditional rice irrigation management features in particular traditional rice irrigation management practices were extrapolated from questionnaires distributed by the national rice center technicians to 45 farmers homogenously spread over a rice area of about 1500 km2 located between the ticino and sesia rivers fig 4 the 13 questions listed in the interview are the following and the answer referring to the

cumulated inflow if applied to field a was about 2700 mm and 3700 mm respectively in years 2015 and 2016 fig 5 a and c while in field b in the year 2015 and 2016 the irrigation inflow was respectively about 2000 mm and 2600 mm fig 5b and d rainfall was lower than 500 mm in both seasons cumulated evapotranspiration et was about 700 mm in both fields and years the soil water storage sws between 0 and 80 cm depth in the fields under saturated condition was about 250 mm for both fields and years fig 5e h confirming the attendance in the field of the same soil hydraulic features despite the soil preparation works before the seeding values of percolations dp obtained as residual terms in the water balance computation for fields a and b respectively in years 2015 and 2016 amounted ranging from 1700 to 2500 mm fig 5a b d while in the field a in the year 2016 the percolation was about 3500 mm fig 5c in both fields the irrigation outflow was negligible values of irrigation supply for fields a in the year 2015 and for the field b in the years 2015 and 2016 are in good agreement with results found in the literature which reports water consumptions ranging from 1500 to 3000 mm singh et al 2001 tabbal et al 2002 zhao et al 2015 the amount of irrigation in the field a in the year 2016 instead is in reasonable agreement with the results of previous water balance experiments carried out in the northern italy rice area with irrigations sometimes exceeding 3000 mm cesari de maria et al 2016 de maria et al 2017 concerning water levels in fields a and b they were maintained on average equal for both the fields during the entire 2015 and then 2016 growing seasons about 50 mm for both fields in the year 2015 fig 5e and f and 150 mm for both fields in the year 2016 fig 5g and h despite the water levels in the year 2016 are generally greater than those maintained in the year 2015 comparing the water levels in the field a the average water level in 2016 was higher than in 2015 of about 70 mm in view of the fact that water level in field a in 2016 when baydrive gate was operating was scheduled by the farmer during the growing season the reasons of this gap could be explained mainly by farmer s lack of knowledge of the actual water levels in the fields as well as to a natural proclivity to increase the water supply in order to avoid any crop water stress when a new irrigation technology was adopted as a matter of fact water levels which the farmer believed to have maintained in the field according to his visual judgment and experience are far from the actual conditions in the year 2016 the farmer set a mean water level of 150 mm within the field a to obtain the water level achieved in 2015 by manually regulating the inflow gate this factor led to an increase of water supply in field a in 2016 which however cannot be ascribed to the automated irrigation system itself but to the way in which the system was set in fig 6 water levels monitored near the inlet point of the field a in years 2015 and 2016 between the 4th of july and the 13th of august are shown while in the first case fig 6a the water level fluctuations are evident and ranging between 20 mm and 100 mm in the year 2016 fig 6b even if the water level in the field is higher than in the previous year water level fluctuations are restricted in a range between 150 mm and 200 mm the field a provided an average yield of 8 8 ton hectare 1 in 2015 and 8 4 ton hectare 1 in 2016 the field b provided an average yield of 8 4 ton hectare 1 in 2015 and 8 7 ton hectare 1 in 2016 applying the fisher test on average productions the difference in rice yield occurred between 2015 and 2016 is not significant for both fields p value 001 3 2 control performance the complex of automatic irrigation system components constituted by the baydrive gate the floodtech sensor and the flumemeter device proved to reliable since no malfunctioning occurred during the whole experimental campaign the farmconnect software uploaded online sensor readings every ten minutes as planned and by means of a web based interface the farmer was able to manage the irrigation using his computer and smartphone in particular each irrigation event consists of a single cycle of gate opening and closing then the program is aborted this type of scheduling was designed in primis for furrow and basin irrigations as well as for rotational water supplies i e where the number of irrigations in a growing season is relatively low no more than 10 12 irrigations koech et al 2014a 2014b in field a the high soil conductivity ksat 1 02 cm day 1 requires to schedule multiple irrigation events in a day in order to maintain the fixed water level threshold within the field in fig 7 the gate maneuvering sequences in 45 days from the 4th of july to the 13th of august are shown in particular when maneuvering phase is 1 the gate is completely open while when maneuvering phase is 1 the gate is completely close in this period 167 irrigation events occurred with a mean of about 3 irrigation events per day value that is maintained also for the entire agricultural season according the current characteristics of the irrigation program setting procedure used in this pilot project require the farmer to initiate repetitive sub weekly scheduling procedure with a considerable amount of time spent for programming concerning the ability of the baydrive gate to maintain optimal flooding conditions the real time communication between floodtech sensor and baydrive gate allows to optimize the binomial flow rate cutoff time thus minimizing the water level fluctuations in the field for this pilot project the gate worked only in two positions i e fully opened or fully closed as the vendor is yet to commercialize a solution for rice which would include autonomous multiple events within its program as a result a lag time has to be taken into consideration in the choice of the optimal water level range to be preserved in the field the lag time consists in the time needed for water to flow from the inlet point of the field where the baydrive gate is located to the end of the field where the floodtech sensor is installed in fact as shown in fig 8 a where a range of 115 125 mm was set in the program the water level fluctuations in the field are on average of about 40 mm between 100 mm and 140 mm conversely as shown in fig 8b where a range of 159 160 mm was set in the program the water level fluctuations in the field are on average only about 5 mm between 158 mm and 163 mm this means that for minimizing water level fluctuations in the field a narrow range of water levels has to be set however this setting operation leads to an increase of the number of gate openings and closings in fig 8a and b three drying periods for agronomic treatments are shown on june 21st and june 26th during the first period and from the 28th of july to the 3th of august in the second period 3 3 economical performance 3 3 1 results of questionnaires the uaa devoted to rice cultivation in the surveyed farms is on average 63 ha with a minimum and a maximum size of 11 and 160 ha the overall uaa of the surveyed farms is about 2837 ha the overall surface with dfl seeding method is about 1940 ha 68 4 of the total area while that the wfl method is adopted only on 816 ha 28 8 of the total area the remaining surface about 81 ha i e 2 8 of the total area is devoted to other types of seeding and irrigation management not specified in the questionnaires referring the number of farms preferring dfl or wfl methods the 58 of farms adopted for all fields the dfl seeding and irrigation method while the 29 of farms adopted for all the fields the wfl method the 13 of farms adopted both methods of rice seeding fig 9 a two diversion canals on average supply water to each farm independently from the uaa size as shown in fig 10 this is probably due to a high level of farm fragmentation istat 2010 aggravated by an agrarian context where land reorganization plans and rational allocation of water resource are extremely difficult to achieve in 20 farms the water is delivered in continuous while in 16 farms the water is delivered following a rotational schedule in 9 farms both the modes are present depending on the type of irrigation license granted by the regional authority or by the irrigation consortium to each farm diversion canal in general between ticino and sesia rivers the continuous method of supply prevails while between ticino and adda rivers supply by rotation is preferred also in according to the prevailing seeding and irrigation method i e the dfl fig 9b irrigation in the surveyed farms is entirely manually managed and the gravity fed systems prevail over pumped irrigation systems 28 farms adopt gravity fed irrigation systems 2 farms adopt pumped systems 15 farms adopt both methods fig 9c regarding the gravity fed distribution system the water is delivered to the field by a network of canals the flow regulation is performed opening and closing sluice gates located along the canals at the inlet of each field flow regulation is performed according to water availability and crop status flow regulation is performed on average 2 times per day during the entire growing season and 3 man hours is the average labor requirement for flow regulation in a day generally 2 workers per farm are involved in the irrigation management 3 3 2 cost benefit analysis the average cost for a complete automated irrigation system composed by one baydrive gate one floodtech sensor transmission antenna communication and actuation protocols power supply and farmconnect software is about 7704 subdivided in 1540 for the gate 700 for the rubber insert 1806 for the water level sensor 3224 for the antenna communication protocols 245 for installation and finally 189 for farmconnect software and commissioning the gate cost can vary considerably in function of the baydrive width however in this study we chose the price of a generic gate of about 70 cm width according the dimension of the inlet point of the field a in addition to this cost an annual maintenance fee for automation of about 21 gate 1 year 1 and floodtech 1 year 1 is required which include software upgrade services gates maintenance and data storages an annual sim card recharge service of about 315 year 1 has to be included the cost of the initial investment for the surveyed farms is on average 43 474 this cost was obtained by multiplying the fixed costs for the automation system i e 1540 for gate 700 for rubber insert 1806 for the water level sensor 378 for software and commissioning for the mean number of fields per farm supposing one field one gate the mean number of fields per farm is about 9 the latter calculated as the ratio between the mean uaa for the surveyed farms about 63 ha and the mean size of a rice field about 7 ha furthermore to the previous costs 3224 plus 245 respectively for central gateway transmission device and for installation both costs are independent by the number of fields are summed the life time of the whole automatic system is supposed to be 20 years after which all the devices should be replaced with new equipment regarding the management costs of a traditional rice irrigation system the overall hours invested in a day for the farm irrigation were multiplied for i the hourly cost of a non specialized agricultural worker 13 73 hour 1 by istat information ii the days of an irrigation season about 90 days and lastly iii the number of workers involved in irrigation procedures the irrigation management cost amounts to 3400 year 1 as well as 2300 year 1 for the irrigation network maintenance as sum of farm canals and gates maintenance the npv methodology was applied to quantify the profitability of the automation adoption and separately the manual option by subtracting the actual value of cash outflows including initial cost from the actual value of cash inflows over the life time of devices 20 year a discount rate of 5 is supposed the cash outflows for the automation solution are i the initial investment 43 474 at the first year ii the annual fee for automation and sim card recharge service 688 year 1 iii the cost for farm canals maintenance about 460 year 1 supposed to be 20 of the total cost of the irrigation network maintenance iv the cost for the gates tele control supposed about 15 min day 1 of about 309 year 1 i e 13 73 hour 1 15 min day 1 90 days year 1 60 1 h min 1 while the cash outflow for the manual solution are i the labor cost for traditional rice irrigation 3400 year 1 ii the cost of irrigation network maintenance 2300 year 1 the results show that the npv at the end of the 20th year is positive about 9400 for the automation solution and therefore the investment can be accepted and can be selected over the manual option fig 11 the investment is fully repaid at the end of the 14th year with a total capital cost of ranging from 638 to 689 hectare 1 the former in the case where gateway and installation costs are amortized across 12 properties as usually performed in the australian installations a factor that should be taken into account is that no significant increase of rice production occurred in the field a between 2015 and 2016 agricultural season as well as no significant reduction in water consumptions were observed as shown in section 4 1 by the comparison between the water inflow rate at the field a automatically managed and at the field b manually managed generally in literature is commonly known that automatic systems for gravity irrigation allow to achieve an increase of application efficiency and uniformity distribution up to 40 50 in cases of furrow or basin irrigations as a consequence of a real time selection of the optimum combination between irrigation flow rate and cut off time smith et al 2016a 2016b in the case of flooding irrigation rice fields flow rates and cutoff times are usually replaced with a constant water inflow to the field this allows to achieve both application efficiency and distribution uniformity at the maximum possible level also with a traditional and manually managed irrigation management furthermore if an adequate water level in the field is maintained during the growing season generally between 5 20 cm water stress should not occur and the quality and quantity of production should not be subject to evident changes bouman et al 2007 in our case for both years the mean water level in the field a was maintained within the optimal range about 10 cm on average in the year 2015 and 15 cm on average in the year 2016 and only a decrease of water level fluctuations was provided by the automatic system these findings from one season only suggest that only small variations in water consumption and rice production might be envisaged over consecutive years and the profitability derived from potential reduction of water consumptions or by the increase of rice production probably will not improve the economic balance for example reducing the time of investment repayment this fact is also amplified by a low water price for irrigation that is about 17 10 3 m 3 in respect to that of other european countries such as spain and greece where the costs are about 100 10 3 m 3 and 82 10 3 m 3 respectively bardarska and hadjieva 2000 this implies that even if a relevant reduction of water uses for farm irrigation would occur the economic benefit would be relatively low it follow that the mainly advantage provided by the automatic system adoption in italian paddy fields would concern almost exclusively the reduction of labor cost of the workers involved in irrigation procedures but would probably not provide improvements in terms of rice production or irrigation efficiencies nevertheless both these aspects improvement of yield and decreasing in water consumption depending on automation should be analyzed in detail considering more than one year of experimental data 4 conclusion remarks in this work the performances of an innovative automatic irrigation prototype originally designed for furrow basin or border irrigations and rearranged for the traditional rice irrigation in europe are evaluated the experimental activity was carried out in the agricultural season 2016 in a paddy field located in the most important rice growing area in italy specifically in the municipality of semiana the system was composed by one baydrive gate for automatic and remote controlled flow regulation one flumemeter box for inlet flow measurements one floodtech sensor for the real time monitoring of water level in the field and lastly one farmconnect gateway as a connection device to the cellular network the outcomes show the following positive aspects i the automatic irrigation system did not reveal any mechanical malfunctioning during the irrigation season as well as good communication protocols provides reliable data transmission on the server web ii the web interface can be considered a valuable tool for an easy real time control of gate position flow regulation and water level measurement in the field iii the automatic irrigation system allows to reduce the time spent by workers for water level control and flow regulation iv the automatic irrigation system allows for constant flow to maintain a constant water level with a narrow operational band compared to the manually operated system the previous year fig 6 v the current price of the automatic irrigation system ranging from 638 to 689 hectare 1 is suitable with respect to the willingness of farmers to spend for innovation inferred by questionnaires data this result is in line with what achieved by the researches of university of lleida for two agrarian districts in lleida spain considering the current labor cost for irrigation the profitable investment for farm modernization with automatic irrigation system was assessed to be lower than 1000 hectare 1 conversely no significant reduction of water consumptions ranging from 2000 to 3700 mm or a significant increase of rice yield of about 8 ton hectare 1 occur in this experimentation but as shown in fig 5 a good correlation between water levels in the field and the amount of percolations suggests that a good water level maintenance in the field by automatic irrigation systems might lead to a stabilization of water losses e g percolations or runoffs some lessons learned from this pilot project for future development of a specific paddy automatic irrigation system could be i future development of software would require for traditional rice irrigation in europe that irrigation program settings incorporate the possibility to set different water levels according to specific period of time with respect to a regulation based on a number of cycles i e gate openings and closings in particular the farmer should be allowed to plan at the beginning of each agricultural season the water level in the field according to the crop growing phases or dry periods for agronomic treatments ii in the web page the farmers should set only two basic information for each scheduling i e the optimal range of water level in the field and the date of start and end of each scheduling independently by the number of opening and closing cycles of the gate iii regarding the automatic gate opening operation features the number of gate openings and closings could be drastically decreased if a self learning process is implemented in the gate program allowing thus the regulation of a constant flow in inlet to the field in this case the gate should change its degree of opening in function of the upstream at the canal and downstream in the field water levels this type of flow regulation could remedy the difficulties of a traditional rice irrigation especially in permeable soils that are typical in northern italy rice areas more than 40 of sandy and sandy loam soil textures moreover decreasing the number of gate opening and closing the wear of mechanical components and the ordinary maintenance costs could be minimized another setting typology able to simplify the automatic gate opening operation features could be the maintenance of a certain degree of gate opening related to the mean infiltration capacity of the field in order to maintain a constant flow in inlet to the field which compensates for the losses terms into the hydrological balance iv lastly the current costs for the automation appear affordable for the italian rice farmers since the npv of the automatic solution is positive even though this one year pilot project did not demonstrate a decrease of water consumptions or a significant increase of rice yield many externalities connected with an automatic and remote controlled management of irrigation should be taken into account if the performances of these systems are evaluated on a wider spatial scale i e irrigation district or basin scales in these cases the maintaining of the ecological landscape and environmental functions of the gravity fed irrigation systems and the continuous monitoring of the binominal crop water requirements water availability give to the irrigation water managers the possibility to plan the water allocation and to regulate water distribution in function of farmer requirements this overall improvement of the management performance could provide a profitable growth in revenue of irrigation consortia in particular reducing the time spending for gates maneuvering especially in the context of padana plain where the length of the irrigation network exceeds the 40 000 km lastly the combination of flow regulation and measurements provided by the automatic irrigation system can be a valuable support for the regional water authorities in order to evaluate the actual water consumptions according to the national law and european union recommendations this might provide an overview on irrigation efficiencies over the territories allow a more rational planning of irrigation resources in a more general prospective automatic gravity fed irrigation systems could automatically control the water deliver irrigation time irrigation water quantity according to soil conditions and crop requirements however in order that the system would be able to perform an irrigation control based on its management potentiality an integrated gravity fed irrigation system from storages or main rivers to the farms and finally to the fields should be designed fig 12 acknowledgements we wish to thank dr david aughton dr peter moller and dr reece tyrrell of rubicon water and its delegate for italy dr tullio zanotti for designing

11531,soil water repellency is a common phenomenon which develops when surface soils become dry in summer and autumn it is claimed that repellency is likely to result in a lower infiltration rate and a concomitant increase in surface runoff particularly on slopes this study quantifies the effect of water repellency on runoff from a series of small plots on a range of slopes 20 and 30 and aspects n s and e in a hilly landscape in the south east of the north island of new zealand the plots 1 m wide and 2 m long were set up to capture runoff via a slotted pvc pipe and measure it using tipping bucket apparatus at each of the slope aspect locations there were duplicate plots a meteorological station was also established at the site along with tdr probes to measure soil moisture down to 300 mm depth when moist the soil at the site had a very high infiltrability 1 5 mm min on nine occasions runoff was measured ranging from 1 to 59 of rainfall when the soil surface was dry and rainfall was intense greater than 0 1 mm min however during the two year study period this repellency induced runoff equated to only 5 of the total rainfall furthermore the infiltration rate of initially dry repellent soil ranging from 0 2 to 0 6 mm min partly recovered over a ten minute period 0 6 1 0 mm min and with sufficient rainfall repellency completely disappeared within two days the transitory nature of water repellency was confirmed in an experiment on large soil slabs conducted in the laboratory where repellency induced runoff was observed to largely disappear over a period of 30 min overall it is concluded that soil water repellency does not play a major role in the soil water balance of the hill country at the study site keywords infiltration runoff soil water repellency 1 introduction soil water repellency is a common and much studied phenomenon dekker et al 2005 deurer et al 2011 found that 98 of the 50 north island of new zealand pasture soils they studied became hydrophobic when dry as in many other studies they used the water drop penetration time wdpt and molarity of ethanol droplet med tests to identify repellency both these tests measure the time taken for the absorption of a drop of liquid usually into a small sample of sieved soil while useful for exploratory investigations the drop size scale of the wdpt and med tests disqualifies them from contributing useful information about what happens at larger scales in the field in an extensive review doerr et al 2000 states that among the major hydrological impacts of repellency are increased overland flow enhanced streamflow responses to rainstorms and enhanced total stream flow in an earlier review wallis and horne 1992 similarly suggested that the influence of repellency upon runoff deserves more attention considering both the on site and downstream consequences however there are few studies of such impacts particularly on soils under pasture the study that comes nearest to addressing the effect of repellency on runoff from pasture soils in a detailed manner is that of jeyakumar et al 2014 which used the runoff measurement apparatus roma that they developed they brought large rectangular slabs of intact soil under pasture into the laboratory let the slabs dry out then set them on a 5 20 slope and applied liquid at the top of the slope via eight hypodermic needles at a rate of 1 mm min if averaged over the area of the slabs they applied both water and a 30 v v water ethanol solution measurements included runoff from the slabs and drainage through the slabs as a function of time for three of the four new zealand soils studied they found similar runoff rates after the first five minutes of 56 57 and 64 of the water application rate dropping to 10 of the application rate after 25 42 recent soils and 51 min gley soil the fourth soil was an organic soil which became highly repellent with more than 90 of the applied water lost as runoff over the 60 min of the experiment there was no runoff at all from all four of the soils when the water ethanol mixture was applied confirming that it was repellency causing the runoff their paper suggests that initially repellency can cause over half of a heavy rain event to be lost as runoff although after an hour of further wetting this repellency induced runoff has effectively stopped however the roma apparatus differs from the field situation in two important aspects the manner in which the water is applied and the soil depth it is not clear how these differences affected their results the issue of scale also remains would a larger area of soil behave similarly a field study by gillingham and gray 2006 avoided the uneven water application and shallow soil depth problems mentioned above and was on a larger scale they installed twelve 4 m long runoff collector troughs in a hill country catchment the runoff went into containers 200 l and was measured manually after each runoff event they also measured topsoil water content at monthly intervals the runoff collection area above each trough was not delineated so their results can only be interpreted in a general way over the 20 months of their study they observed just four larger runoff events and eight smaller ones they state that volumes of runoff were highest in the period from early summer to late autumn and inversely related to soil moisture content suggesting that repellency was the major mechanism producing this runoff a third study pointing to the occurrence of repellency induced runoff from hill country under pasture is that of bretherton et al 2010 which focussed on a soil water balance on three occasions over the two year period of the study substantial runoff was measured from rainfall events which occurred when water balance calculations indicated that there was less than 2 5 mm of available water in the top 50 mm of soil it is probable that most of this runoff was due to repellency in some ways the three studies described raise more questions than answers but all indicate that further work on repellency induced runoff from hill country under pasture is warranted this paper attempts to address some of these questions by reporting on repellency induced runoff from 2 m2 plots with the following objectives the quantification of repellency induced runoff as a fraction of rainfall and the quantification of changes in the infiltration rate of a water repellent soil during the early stages of a heavy rainfall event 2 site description and methodology 2 1 site description the runoff plots were established on a pastoral sheep and beef farm near alfredton on the southern east coast of the north island in new zealand 40 38 651 s 175 53 881 e with an elevation of 200 m thirty year 1980 2010 annual average rainfall and ten year 1995 2005 average daily temperature values are 1234 mm and 12 5 c respectively winter climate conditions are often cold and wet and summer rainfall is unreliable with 12 34 of the annual rainfall falling during december through to february therefore the surface soil in the area is often dry in late spring and summer a more detailed description of the site is provided by bretherton et al 2010 plots 2 m down slope 1 m across slope were grouped as adjacent pairs at six locations within two sub catchments each plot being bordered to prevent on flow from uphill and adjacent surface areas the location of the plots is shown on the aerial photograph in fig 1 a pvc pipe with a slot cut along its 1 m length was located at the bottom of each plot to collect surface runoff bretherton et al 2010 this was directed to a tipping bucket system which had been calibrated so that the volume tipped was calculated as a function of the tip rate plot labels describe the slope 20 30 aspect n s e and whether they were on the left or right l r looking uphill detailed soil profile examinations on the n and s aspects revealed that the soil at the site is a mottled orthic recent soil hewitt 1998 with silty clay loam texture pronounced mottling in the subsoil below 350 mm depth indicates impeded drainage and the intermittent presence of a perched water table the soil was visually similar at the two aspects so would be expected to have similar hydraulic properties and infiltration behaviour across the site the soil has developed from uplifted mudstones and siltstones of tertiary and late cretaceous age with high erosion rates preventing the formation of a more mature soil soil fertility analyses 0 75 mm depth indicated a low ph regime 5 1 5 4 with olsen p indicating a range of fertility values 16 0 35 8 μg p g the pasture was diverse sanches 2009 with the grass species 83 of pasture composition dominated by browntop agrostis capillaris followed by crested dogstail cynosurus cristatus and then by perennial ryegrass lolium perenne legumes averaged 9 of pasture composition dominated by subterranean clover trifolium subterraneum followed by white clover trifolium repens the remaining pasture composition consisted of weed species 2 2 methodology four meteorological stations were installed at the research area to record rainfall air temperature humidity wind run and short wave solar radiation at 2 m above ground level daily averages and or totals were recorded for these variables except for rainfall which was logged whenever 0 2 mm of rain fell the primary purpose of monitoring climate variables was to enable the calculation of a daily soil water balance which will be described in a following paper in addition to climate variables the data loggers also recorded the runoff from the plots as well as daily 0 300 mm depth volumetric soil water content values from campbell scientific logan utah cs616 tdr probes installed in the n and s plots during the course of the experiment the raw attenuation output from the tdr probes was calibrated against occasional volumetric water content values calculated from bulk density and gravimetric soil water content measurements at 300 mm depth taken at 50 mm intervals the climate data tdr and runoff data were logged using campbell scientific logan utah cr1000 data loggers rainfall and runoff data are expressed as depth per unit horizontal surface area unfortunately until the problem was identified and solved the proximity of electric stock fences was responsible for frequent data losses from the loggers during the early stages of the experiment bulk density values for the 0 50 mm depth of soil from each site were highly variable ranging from 568 to 1095 kg m3 bulk density increased with depth so that at 300 350 mm a range of 1298 1563 kg m3 was observed as there was no obvious correlation between bulk density and location average bulk density values for a given depth were used to convert gravimetric water contents to their volumetric equivalents water drop penetration time wdpt and molarity of ethanol droplet med tests were not used routinely to measure water repellency due to their small spatial resolution and the potentially high spatial variability of these measurements across the dimensions of the runoff plots however one set of wdpt and med measurements was undertaken in order to assess the potential repellency of the surface soils 0 40 mm at each of the runoff sites the sampling and measurement techniques described by deurer et al 2011 were adopted classification of persistence class was then determined according to dekker and jungerius 1990 and ranged from 2 strong through to 3 severe calculation of droplet contact angles as described by roy and mcgill 2002 resulted in values that ranged from 95 9 through to 100 2 all contact angles were greater than 90 indicating that the 0 40 mm surface soils at all sites exhibited potential for water repellency furthermore once established water repellency is likely to have been strongly to severely persistent dekker and jungerius 1990 laboratory scale experiments employed the roma apparatus jeyakumar et al 2014 discussed in the introduction this apparatus uses soil slabs 460 mm long 170 mm wide 50 mm deep to study the effects of soil water repellency on runoff triplicate soil slabs were gathered from the 20 and 30 slopes at both the n and s sites and then dried in the laboratory to constant mass prior to placement in the roma apparatus at this stage calculated volumetric water contents of the slabs ranged from 0 04 0 16 m3 m3 much drier than their field values when the slabs were collected 0 40 0 59 m3 m3 the soil slabs were set at a slope of 22 similar to that of the slope of the n20 and s20 runoff plots water was applied via a line of eight hypodermic needles which were positioned 10 mm above the soil surface and 20 mm apart at the top of the sloping soil slab the combined delivery rate of the water through the needles was fixed at 90 ml min once the water run was completed the wetted slabs were again air dried until their water contents were the same as those measured prior to the water run the roma experiment was then repeated using 30 ethanol instead of water in order to measure the runoff response of the soil slabs without the influence of soil water repellency 3 results 3 1 intrinsic infiltrability runoff data gathered over the duration of the trial are presented in figs 2 and 3 although the data loggers experienced sporadic and sometimes prolonged failures due to voltage spikes induced by nearby electric fences sufficient data were gathered to examine a number of runoff events and the rainfall intensities and the soil water status associated with them these runoff events will most likely have been induced by either a rainfall intensity that was greater than the infiltrability of the topsoil at the time of the event infiltration excess or by a perched water table which saturated the topsoil so that it was no longer able to receive all the rainfall saturation excess soil water repellency reduces the infiltrability of the topsoil making it more likely that infiltration excess runoff will occur in order to identify the repellency induced runoff events the intrinsic infiltrability of the topsoil must be ascertained intrinsic infiltrability is defined here as the minimum infiltration rate when the soil is not water repellent i e it will be similar to the saturated hydraulic conductivity to investigate the intrinsic infiltrability we examined those runoff events when both rainfall intensity and topsoil volumetric soil water contents were high due to recent lower intensity rainfall and or low evaporation rates but no runoff was observed rainfall intensity and runoff data for 2010 provided little opportunity to investigate the intrinsic infiltrability of the topsoil as when sufficiently high intensity rainfall events did occur they coincided with drier soil moisture conditions during the summer and autumn months however runoff responses to two rainfall events in 2011 were found which fitted the criteria described above the first of these events occurred on 7 may 2011 fig 3 when 8 3 mm of rain fell over an eleven minute period with a maximum intensity of 1 5 mm min during this event there was very little runoff from the n20 0 7 and 0 8 mm n30 0 3 and 0 3 mm and e30 0 0 and 0 1 mm plots the water content of the top 300 mm of soil immediately prior to the event ranged from 0 35 to 0 40 m3 m3 indicating that the topsoil was moist no runoff data were available for the s and e 30 plots the second such heavy rain event occurred over a 37 min period on 9 july 2011 fig 3 when 20 4 mm of rain fell at intensities up to 2 0 mm min runoff totals from the n20 7 6 and 8 5 mm s20 11 4 and 9 2 mm and s30 6 3 mm plots were large the missing value for the adjacent paired plots at the s30 location was the result of a logger malfunction but in contrast runoff responses from the n30 plots 0 4 and 1 3 mm the e30 plots 1 3 and 1 3 mm and the e 30 plots 0 2 and 0 2 mm were low with almost all of the rainfall infiltrating the soil surface the water content of the top 300 mm of soil immediately prior to the event was about 0 45 m3 m3 for the n plots and 0 50 m3 m3 for the s plots indicating that the soil was moist the runoff from the n20 and the s plots can be attributed to the presence of a perched water table probably largely due to interflow from above the plots inducing saturation excess runoff on these particular slopes and aspects similar saturation excess induced runoff from these plots but not from the n30 plot was observed from somewhat lower intensity rainfall in early to mid september in 2010 fig 2 the two events described above show that very high infiltration rates of between 1 5 and 2 mm min occurred on the n30 e30 and e 30 plots when the topsoil was moist and so that intrinsic infiltrabilities are greater than or equal to these values pedological examination indicated that the topsoil across the site was similar so all the plots were likely to have similarly high intrinsic infiltrability values of at least 1 5 mm min however no opportunity presented itself to observe this directly either due to missing data or due to the susceptibility of these sites to interflow and or a rising water table during wet soil conditions 3 2 identification of repellency induced runoff events as discussed above examination of the runoff patterns shown in figs 2 and 3 allows the two types of runoff to be differentiated saturation excess flow was observed on the s20 and s30 plots during winter when soils were wet saturation excess flow was also observed on the n20 plots during periods of prolonged and or intense rainfall in the winter and spring months however despite the high intrinsic infiltrability inferred above 1 5 2 mm min runoff also occurred when the topsoil was initially relatively dry usually during the summer and autumn months and the rainfall intensity was greater than about 0 1 mm min thus the infiltrability decreased as the topsoil became drier to a point where rainfall intensity above some threshold value generated infiltration excess runoff the obvious and most likely explanation for this behaviour is that the soil became water repellent on the basis of the repellency induced runoff criteria proposed above the nine runoff events described in table 1 were identified over the two years each occurring when the topsoil was initially quite dry and rainfall intensities were greater than 0 1 mm min for all nine events the timing of the runoff event almost exactly matched the timing of peak rainfall intensities providing further evidence that a water repellent surface had developed the summed runoff from these events was less than 5 of the total rainfall over the two year study period indicating that runoff induced by soil water repellency is not a major component of the annual water balance at the alfredton site heavy rain when the soil surface is dry can however induce significant runoff comparison of the runoff from the adjacent paired 2 m2 left l and right r plots in table 1 shows that runoff induced by soil water repellency is spatially highly variable two extreme examples of this are the 7 8 mm and 18 3 mm values for the e 30 plots on 23 01 2011 and the 13 5 mm and 3 2 mm values for the s30 plots on 3 10 2011 when mean values are calculated across all runoff plots for each of the nine events table 1 the standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean varies from 43 to 85 further emphasising the variable nature of repellency induced runoff at the plot scale 3 3 a detailed study of two heavy rain events in an attempt to further assess the characteristics of topsoil repellency behaviour event 1 in 2010 in table 1 has been analysed in some detail it was an unusual event in that after an initial 2 mm of lighter rain there was 18 mm of heavy and uniform rainfall with an intensity of 1 75 mm min which induced from 10 to 14 mm of runoff from the four n plots as shown in fig 4 and table 1 over the next 44 h 15 mm of much lighter rain fell followed by 14 mm of heavy rain as shown in fig 5 eight mm of this fell in five minutes with an average intensity of 1 54 mm minute in sharp contrast to the similar event two days earlier this event produced less than 0 3 mm of runoff from the steeper n and e plots this earlier event and the 15 mm of light rain over the intervening 44 h had been sufficient to effectively eliminate repellency on these plots the three 20 plots did shed about 1 5 mm of runoff while it is possible that this represents some residual repellency it is more likely that it is the first signs of the interflow and a rising perched water table saturation excess to which these plots were prone the majority of the runoff recorded in event 1 of 2010 is associated with the 10 min of heavy rainfall which was unusually consistent in intensity fig 4 the uniformity of this event provides an opportunity to study the changes in the repellency throttled infiltration rates and runoff over the 10 min rather than the longer 44 h period described above least squares regression was used to fit quadratic equations to the approximately linear sections of the rainfall and runoff data shown as the lines in fig 4 since these fitted equations describe the accumulation of rainfall and runoff with respect to time the derivatives of these equations give instantaneous rainfall intensities and runoff rates during the 10 min period these are shown in fig 6 over the ten minutes of heavy rainfall the rainfall intensity increased only very gradually from 1 74 mm min to 1 76 mm min the runoff responses from the plots were varied providing further evidence of the extent of the spatial unevenness of soil water repellency at the plot scale but follow one of two patterns the first pattern is shown by the four n plots in fig 6 with initial runoff rates being between 64 and 87 of the rainfall rate over the ten minutes of steady rainfall the runoff rate from these plots decreased to between 42 and 66 of the steady rainfall rate indicating that the soil was becoming less water repellent assuming a constant spatially averaged ponded water depth on each plot over the 10 min the infiltration rate can be estimated as the difference between the rainfall intensity and the runoff rate the infiltration rates so estimated were initially between 0 2 and 0 6 mm min ten minutes later they had increased to between 0 6 and 1 0 mm min indicating that the repellency had partly dissipated the second behaviour pattern is characterised by the three s20 l and e 30 plots in contrast to the n plots these plots show much lower initial runoff rates 3 30 of the rainfall rate which slowly increased over the ten minute period to 15 35 of the steady rainfall rate however these three plots had much less total runoff than the four n plots fig 3 3 4 laboratory scale runoff observations the inferred increase in infiltration rates on the n plots during the first 10 min of the intense rainfall event on 20 01 2010 prompted further examination of this behaviour in the laboratory the recent development and construction of the roma apparatus enabled us to study runoff from relatively large topsoil slabs taken from areas adjacent to the runoff plots the results are shown in fig 7 although the apparatus attempts to simulate field conditions the method it employs to apply water to the soil slab is quite different to rainfall and therefore the runoff results can only be interpreted in general terms the runoff event on 20 01 2010 involved rainfall intensities of 1 5 2 0 mm min if this rainfall had been applied uniformly to the sloping slabs in the roma apparatus the application rate would have been 1 3 mm min however the localised application rate under each of the eight needles was extremely large observations during the roma trials showed that this high application rate combined with topsoil repellency under the needles led to the formation of a number of irregular rivulets about 5 mm wide which rapidly induced runoff as they extended down the length of the soil slab these rivulets were no longer visible after about 20 min no topsoil field volumetric water content data were available immediately prior to the 20 01 2010 event to compare with those of the air dried soil slabs however the water contents of the air dried soil slabs were about as dry as the driest of the water content values recorded 0 11 m3 m3 for the 0 50 mm depth in the field over the duration of the field study thus it is likely that the soil slabs were at least as repellent as the topsoil prior to the 20 01 2010 event the peak runoff values ranged from 6 to 67 of the applied water rate again illustrating the large variability in repellency exhibited at this scale fig 7 the time taken to reach peak runoff was quite consistent ranging from five to ten minutes after the initiation of water application during which the rivulets described above developed of particular note in fig 7 is the marked and rapid decrease of runoff following peak runoff for eight of the eleven slabs the repellency induced runoff rate had dropped to less than 5 of the application rate after 30 min the results are consistent with but more variable than those of jeyakumar et al 2014 leaving aside the data for their organic soil following the water run a 30 ethanol solution was applied to each soil slab in order to demonstrate the response of the soil surface to infiltration and runoff without the influence of soil water repellency in all cases no runoff at all was observed during the 30 ethanol runs confirming that the runoff responses observed during the water run were the result of soil water repellency as already mentioned the application of water to just the top of the air dried soil slabs in the roma experiment is quite different to rainfall which would fall more evenly over the entire soil surface and thus presumably overcome the repellency more rapidly and effectively conversely the absence of subsoil under the shallow slabs may have allowed more preferential flow and drainage tending to reduce runoff however the fact that repellency induced runoff had become negligible on most slabs after the application of water over a 30 min period confirms the transient behaviour of soil water repellency doerr et al 2000 4 discussion this study attempted to quantify the amount of runoff generated from 2 m2 runoff plots on new zealand pastoral hill country as a fraction of rainfall as well as measure the changes in the infiltration rate of a water repellent soil surface during the early stages of a heavy rainfall event in order to identify those runoff events that were repellency induced the intrinsic infiltrability of the topsoil needed to be ascertained i e the minimum infiltration rate of the topsoil when it was not water repellent although rainfall intensity and runoff data collected during 2010 offered little opportunity to determine intrinsic infiltrability several events during 2011 intense rainfall and a non repellent topsoil suggested that intrinsic infiltrability of the topsoil was at least 1 5 mm min despite this high value examination of runoff patterns indicated that runoff was occurring on initially dry soils thereby excluding saturation excess runoff processes and also when rainfall intensity was greater than about 0 1 mm min and was more frequent during the summer and autumn months thus there was some process occurring whereby intrinsic infiltrability was compromised and infiltration excess runoff was generated the most likely explanation for this behaviour is that the soil became water repellent nine of these runoff events were identified over the two years of study each occurring when the topsoil was initially dry and rainfall intensities were greater than 0 1 mm min in all cases the runoff timing coincided closely with peak rainfall intensity further suggesting that these runoff events were repellency induced summed runoff from these events indicated that repellency induced runoff was less than 5 of the total rainfall over the 2 year period although in individual events runoff comprised up to 75 of rainfall comparison of runoff values between adjacent paired plots and of means and standard deviations across all plots within each of the nine events indicated high variability this variability makes modelling repellency effects difficult and extrapolation of the runoff data to larger scales problematic the movement of runoff down slope could either accumulate or dissipate as scale is increased from plot size to the sub catchment level in a following paper we plan to use stream flow data to investigate which behaviour dominates the disappearance and re appearance of repellency induced runoff on the same plots shows that there is a cyclic process occurring whereby soil water repellency develops as the soil dries out and then disappears once enough rainfall occurs an unusual rainfall event in january 2010 event 1 table 1 allowed a detailed examination of the changes in infiltrability of an initially repellent soil surface during the first 10 min of consistent and heavy rainfall the uniformity of the rainfall during this 10 min allowed measurement of changes in repellency throttled infiltration rates during this period and revealed two patterns of behaviour the first pattern showed an increase in infiltrability from an initial 0 2 0 6 mm min to 0 6 1 0 mm min by the end of the 10 min period indicating the partial dissipation of repellency the second pattern showed much lower initial runoff rates which slowly increased over the 10 min period the slowly increasing runoff rate may reflect a slowly diminishing rate of rainfall going into surface ponding rather than a slowly decreasing infiltration rate however even if this is not so the change in infiltration rates over the 10 min inferred from the data in fig 6 are quite different to the expected shape of curves depicting the infiltration rate of ponded water into non repellent dry soil in this situation infiltration rates are expected to drop rapidly from an initial very high value towards the intrinsic infiltrability as the capillary pull dissipates jury et al 1991 p 141 philip 1969 p 281 subsequent to this unusual rainfall event 15 mm of light rain fell over the next 44 h ending in 14 mm of heavy rain however in contrast to the earlier event described above only 0 3 mm of runoff was observed this earlier event and the 15 mm of light rain over the intervening 44 h had been sufficient to effectively eliminate repellency on these plots the increase in infiltration rates observed during the initial stages of event 1 table 1 invited further investigation using laboratory techniques as mentioned in the introduction the water droplet penetration time wdpt and molarity of ethanol droplet med tests are well established techniques for the measurement of soil water repellency the major drawbacks of these techniques are that they are highly susceptible to micro scale variations in soil water repellency on the soil surface and also that the resulting numbers cannot be directly related to repellency induced runoff in the field the recent development of the roma apparatus allowed detailed study of runoff from relatively large soil slabs taken from the field since all slabs were subjected to an application of 30 ethanol solution in which no runoff was observed then all runoff associated with the application of water were the result of soil water repellency for all slabs peak water runoff rates ranged from 6 to 67 of the applied water rate and after 30 min most slabs exhibited runoff rates that were less than 5 of the application rate the high variability of peak runoff values again emphasises the issue with variability at the slab plot scale despite this the observation that repellency induced runoff had become negligible on most slabs after 30 min confirms the transient nature of soil water repellency it is widely accepted that organic coatings are a common cause of water repellency doerr et al 2000 the reason for the transient behaviour of repellency may be due to the nature of the outermost layer of these coatings particularly if amphipathic or amphiphilic compounds are present as suggested by several authors doerr et al 2000 horne and mcintosh 2000 the latter study proposed several mechanisms for repellency in order to explain marked seasonal variations in soil water repellency in sandy soils found on the south west coast of the north island new zealand the outcomes of our study suggest that while repellency is overt during extended dry conditions at the study site there are much shorter term fluctuations driven by a succession of infrequent rainfall events and extended dry periods which trigger responses from amphipathic compounds present on the surfaces of organic coatings 5 conclusion examination of repellency induced runoff events from 2 m2 plots on hill slopes in the south east coast of new zealand showed that there were nine runoff events greater than 1 mm over two years and that runoff constituted less than 5 of the annual rainfall however during the first 10 min of infrequent heavy rainfall events up to 75 of that rain was found to run off the 2 m2 plots analysis of a 24 8 mm rainfall event during this period suggests that infiltration rates increased on the most repellent plots over the first ten minutes of steady heavy rain 1 75 mm min indicating some reduction in repellency over that time period a second and similar heavy rain event two days later produced negligible runoff indicating the topsoil was no longer water repellent laboratory

11531,soil water repellency is a common phenomenon which develops when surface soils become dry in summer and autumn it is claimed that repellency is likely to result in a lower infiltration rate and a concomitant increase in surface runoff particularly on slopes this study quantifies the effect of water repellency on runoff from a series of small plots on a range of slopes 20 and 30 and aspects n s and e in a hilly landscape in the south east of the north island of new zealand the plots 1 m wide and 2 m long were set up to capture runoff via a slotted pvc pipe and measure it using tipping bucket apparatus at each of the slope aspect locations there were duplicate plots a meteorological station was also established at the site along with tdr probes to measure soil moisture down to 300 mm depth when moist the soil at the site had a very high infiltrability 1 5 mm min on nine occasions runoff was measured ranging from 1 to 59 of rainfall when the soil surface was dry and rainfall was intense greater than 0 1 mm min however during the two year study period this repellency induced runoff equated to only 5 of the total rainfall furthermore the infiltration rate of initially dry repellent soil ranging from 0 2 to 0 6 mm min partly recovered over a ten minute period 0 6 1 0 mm min and with sufficient rainfall repellency completely disappeared within two days the transitory nature of water repellency was confirmed in an experiment on large soil slabs conducted in the laboratory where repellency induced runoff was observed to largely disappear over a period of 30 min overall it is concluded that soil water repellency does not play a major role in the soil water balance of the hill country at the study site keywords infiltration runoff soil water repellency 1 introduction soil water repellency is a common and much studied phenomenon dekker et al 2005 deurer et al 2011 found that 98 of the 50 north island of new zealand pasture soils they studied became hydrophobic when dry as in many other studies they used the water drop penetration time wdpt and molarity of ethanol droplet med tests to identify repellency both these tests measure the time taken for the absorption of a drop of liquid usually into a small sample of sieved soil while useful for exploratory investigations the drop size scale of the wdpt and med tests disqualifies them from contributing useful information about what happens at larger scales in the field in an extensive review doerr et al 2000 states that among the major hydrological impacts of repellency are increased overland flow enhanced streamflow responses to rainstorms and enhanced total stream flow in an earlier review wallis and horne 1992 similarly suggested that the influence of repellency upon runoff deserves more attention considering both the on site and downstream consequences however there are few studies of such impacts particularly on soils under pasture the study that comes nearest to addressing the effect of repellency on runoff from pasture soils in a detailed manner is that of jeyakumar et al 2014 which used the runoff measurement apparatus roma that they developed they brought large rectangular slabs of intact soil under pasture into the laboratory let the slabs dry out then set them on a 5 20 slope and applied liquid at the top of the slope via eight hypodermic needles at a rate of 1 mm min if averaged over the area of the slabs they applied both water and a 30 v v water ethanol solution measurements included runoff from the slabs and drainage through the slabs as a function of time for three of the four new zealand soils studied they found similar runoff rates after the first five minutes of 56 57 and 64 of the water application rate dropping to 10 of the application rate after 25 42 recent soils and 51 min gley soil the fourth soil was an organic soil which became highly repellent with more than 90 of the applied water lost as runoff over the 60 min of the experiment there was no runoff at all from all four of the soils when the water ethanol mixture was applied confirming that it was repellency causing the runoff their paper suggests that initially repellency can cause over half of a heavy rain event to be lost as runoff although after an hour of further wetting this repellency induced runoff has effectively stopped however the roma apparatus differs from the field situation in two important aspects the manner in which the water is applied and the soil depth it is not clear how these differences affected their results the issue of scale also remains would a larger area of soil behave similarly a field study by gillingham and gray 2006 avoided the uneven water application and shallow soil depth problems mentioned above and was on a larger scale they installed twelve 4 m long runoff collector troughs in a hill country catchment the runoff went into containers 200 l and was measured manually after each runoff event they also measured topsoil water content at monthly intervals the runoff collection area above each trough was not delineated so their results can only be interpreted in a general way over the 20 months of their study they observed just four larger runoff events and eight smaller ones they state that volumes of runoff were highest in the period from early summer to late autumn and inversely related to soil moisture content suggesting that repellency was the major mechanism producing this runoff a third study pointing to the occurrence of repellency induced runoff from hill country under pasture is that of bretherton et al 2010 which focussed on a soil water balance on three occasions over the two year period of the study substantial runoff was measured from rainfall events which occurred when water balance calculations indicated that there was less than 2 5 mm of available water in the top 50 mm of soil it is probable that most of this runoff was due to repellency in some ways the three studies described raise more questions than answers but all indicate that further work on repellency induced runoff from hill country under pasture is warranted this paper attempts to address some of these questions by reporting on repellency induced runoff from 2 m2 plots with the following objectives the quantification of repellency induced runoff as a fraction of rainfall and the quantification of changes in the infiltration rate of a water repellent soil during the early stages of a heavy rainfall event 2 site description and methodology 2 1 site description the runoff plots were established on a pastoral sheep and beef farm near alfredton on the southern east coast of the north island in new zealand 40 38 651 s 175 53 881 e with an elevation of 200 m thirty year 1980 2010 annual average rainfall and ten year 1995 2005 average daily temperature values are 1234 mm and 12 5 c respectively winter climate conditions are often cold and wet and summer rainfall is unreliable with 12 34 of the annual rainfall falling during december through to february therefore the surface soil in the area is often dry in late spring and summer a more detailed description of the site is provided by bretherton et al 2010 plots 2 m down slope 1 m across slope were grouped as adjacent pairs at six locations within two sub catchments each plot being bordered to prevent on flow from uphill and adjacent surface areas the location of the plots is shown on the aerial photograph in fig 1 a pvc pipe with a slot cut along its 1 m length was located at the bottom of each plot to collect surface runoff bretherton et al 2010 this was directed to a tipping bucket system which had been calibrated so that the volume tipped was calculated as a function of the tip rate plot labels describe the slope 20 30 aspect n s e and whether they were on the left or right l r looking uphill detailed soil profile examinations on the n and s aspects revealed that the soil at the site is a mottled orthic recent soil hewitt 1998 with silty clay loam texture pronounced mottling in the subsoil below 350 mm depth indicates impeded drainage and the intermittent presence of a perched water table the soil was visually similar at the two aspects so would be expected to have similar hydraulic properties and infiltration behaviour across the site the soil has developed from uplifted mudstones and siltstones of tertiary and late cretaceous age with high erosion rates preventing the formation of a more mature soil soil fertility analyses 0 75 mm depth indicated a low ph regime 5 1 5 4 with olsen p indicating a range of fertility values 16 0 35 8 μg p g the pasture was diverse sanches 2009 with the grass species 83 of pasture composition dominated by browntop agrostis capillaris followed by crested dogstail cynosurus cristatus and then by perennial ryegrass lolium perenne legumes averaged 9 of pasture composition dominated by subterranean clover trifolium subterraneum followed by white clover trifolium repens the remaining pasture composition consisted of weed species 2 2 methodology four meteorological stations were installed at the research area to record rainfall air temperature humidity wind run and short wave solar radiation at 2 m above ground level daily averages and or totals were recorded for these variables except for rainfall which was logged whenever 0 2 mm of rain fell the primary purpose of monitoring climate variables was to enable the calculation of a daily soil water balance which will be described in a following paper in addition to climate variables the data loggers also recorded the runoff from the plots as well as daily 0 300 mm depth volumetric soil water content values from campbell scientific logan utah cs616 tdr probes installed in the n and s plots during the course of the experiment the raw attenuation output from the tdr probes was calibrated against occasional volumetric water content values calculated from bulk density and gravimetric soil water content measurements at 300 mm depth taken at 50 mm intervals the climate data tdr and runoff data were logged using campbell scientific logan utah cr1000 data loggers rainfall and runoff data are expressed as depth per unit horizontal surface area unfortunately until the problem was identified and solved the proximity of electric stock fences was responsible for frequent data losses from the loggers during the early stages of the experiment bulk density values for the 0 50 mm depth of soil from each site were highly variable ranging from 568 to 1095 kg m3 bulk density increased with depth so that at 300 350 mm a range of 1298 1563 kg m3 was observed as there was no obvious correlation between bulk density and location average bulk density values for a given depth were used to convert gravimetric water contents to their volumetric equivalents water drop penetration time wdpt and molarity of ethanol droplet med tests were not used routinely to measure water repellency due to their small spatial resolution and the potentially high spatial variability of these measurements across the dimensions of the runoff plots however one set of wdpt and med measurements was undertaken in order to assess the potential repellency of the surface soils 0 40 mm at each of the runoff sites the sampling and measurement techniques described by deurer et al 2011 were adopted classification of persistence class was then determined according to dekker and jungerius 1990 and ranged from 2 strong through to 3 severe calculation of droplet contact angles as described by roy and mcgill 2002 resulted in values that ranged from 95 9 through to 100 2 all contact angles were greater than 90 indicating that the 0 40 mm surface soils at all sites exhibited potential for water repellency furthermore once established water repellency is likely to have been strongly to severely persistent dekker and jungerius 1990 laboratory scale experiments employed the roma apparatus jeyakumar et al 2014 discussed in the introduction this apparatus uses soil slabs 460 mm long 170 mm wide 50 mm deep to study the effects of soil water repellency on runoff triplicate soil slabs were gathered from the 20 and 30 slopes at both the n and s sites and then dried in the laboratory to constant mass prior to placement in the roma apparatus at this stage calculated volumetric water contents of the slabs ranged from 0 04 0 16 m3 m3 much drier than their field values when the slabs were collected 0 40 0 59 m3 m3 the soil slabs were set at a slope of 22 similar to that of the slope of the n20 and s20 runoff plots water was applied via a line of eight hypodermic needles which were positioned 10 mm above the soil surface and 20 mm apart at the top of the sloping soil slab the combined delivery rate of the water through the needles was fixed at 90 ml min once the water run was completed the wetted slabs were again air dried until their water contents were the same as those measured prior to the water run the roma experiment was then repeated using 30 ethanol instead of water in order to measure the runoff response of the soil slabs without the influence of soil water repellency 3 results 3 1 intrinsic infiltrability runoff data gathered over the duration of the trial are presented in figs 2 and 3 although the data loggers experienced sporadic and sometimes prolonged failures due to voltage spikes induced by nearby electric fences sufficient data were gathered to examine a number of runoff events and the rainfall intensities and the soil water status associated with them these runoff events will most likely have been induced by either a rainfall intensity that was greater than the infiltrability of the topsoil at the time of the event infiltration excess or by a perched water table which saturated the topsoil so that it was no longer able to receive all the rainfall saturation excess soil water repellency reduces the infiltrability of the topsoil making it more likely that infiltration excess runoff will occur in order to identify the repellency induced runoff events the intrinsic infiltrability of the topsoil must be ascertained intrinsic infiltrability is defined here as the minimum infiltration rate when the soil is not water repellent i e it will be similar to the saturated hydraulic conductivity to investigate the intrinsic infiltrability we examined those runoff events when both rainfall intensity and topsoil volumetric soil water contents were high due to recent lower intensity rainfall and or low evaporation rates but no runoff was observed rainfall intensity and runoff data for 2010 provided little opportunity to investigate the intrinsic infiltrability of the topsoil as when sufficiently high intensity rainfall events did occur they coincided with drier soil moisture conditions during the summer and autumn months however runoff responses to two rainfall events in 2011 were found which fitted the criteria described above the first of these events occurred on 7 may 2011 fig 3 when 8 3 mm of rain fell over an eleven minute period with a maximum intensity of 1 5 mm min during this event there was very little runoff from the n20 0 7 and 0 8 mm n30 0 3 and 0 3 mm and e30 0 0 and 0 1 mm plots the water content of the top 300 mm of soil immediately prior to the event ranged from 0 35 to 0 40 m3 m3 indicating that the topsoil was moist no runoff data were available for the s and e 30 plots the second such heavy rain event occurred over a 37 min period on 9 july 2011 fig 3 when 20 4 mm of rain fell at intensities up to 2 0 mm min runoff totals from the n20 7 6 and 8 5 mm s20 11 4 and 9 2 mm and s30 6 3 mm plots were large the missing value for the adjacent paired plots at the s30 location was the result of a logger malfunction but in contrast runoff responses from the n30 plots 0 4 and 1 3 mm the e30 plots 1 3 and 1 3 mm and the e 30 plots 0 2 and 0 2 mm were low with almost all of the rainfall infiltrating the soil surface the water content of the top 300 mm of soil immediately prior to the event was about 0 45 m3 m3 for the n plots and 0 50 m3 m3 for the s plots indicating that the soil was moist the runoff from the n20 and the s plots can be attributed to the presence of a perched water table probably largely due to interflow from above the plots inducing saturation excess runoff on these particular slopes and aspects similar saturation excess induced runoff from these plots but not from the n30 plot was observed from somewhat lower intensity rainfall in early to mid september in 2010 fig 2 the two events described above show that very high infiltration rates of between 1 5 and 2 mm min occurred on the n30 e30 and e 30 plots when the topsoil was moist and so that intrinsic infiltrabilities are greater than or equal to these values pedological examination indicated that the topsoil across the site was similar so all the plots were likely to have similarly high intrinsic infiltrability values of at least 1 5 mm min however no opportunity presented itself to observe this directly either due to missing data or due to the susceptibility of these sites to interflow and or a rising water table during wet soil conditions 3 2 identification of repellency induced runoff events as discussed above examination of the runoff patterns shown in figs 2 and 3 allows the two types of runoff to be differentiated saturation excess flow was observed on the s20 and s30 plots during winter when soils were wet saturation excess flow was also observed on the n20 plots during periods of prolonged and or intense rainfall in the winter and spring months however despite the high intrinsic infiltrability inferred above 1 5 2 mm min runoff also occurred when the topsoil was initially relatively dry usually during the summer and autumn months and the rainfall intensity was greater than about 0 1 mm min thus the infiltrability decreased as the topsoil became drier to a point where rainfall intensity above some threshold value generated infiltration excess runoff the obvious and most likely explanation for this behaviour is that the soil became water repellent on the basis of the repellency induced runoff criteria proposed above the nine runoff events described in table 1 were identified over the two years each occurring when the topsoil was initially quite dry and rainfall intensities were greater than 0 1 mm min for all nine events the timing of the runoff event almost exactly matched the timing of peak rainfall intensities providing further evidence that a water repellent surface had developed the summed runoff from these events was less than 5 of the total rainfall over the two year study period indicating that runoff induced by soil water repellency is not a major component of the annual water balance at the alfredton site heavy rain when the soil surface is dry can however induce significant runoff comparison of the runoff from the adjacent paired 2 m2 left l and right r plots in table 1 shows that runoff induced by soil water repellency is spatially highly variable two extreme examples of this are the 7 8 mm and 18 3 mm values for the e 30 plots on 23 01 2011 and the 13 5 mm and 3 2 mm values for the s30 plots on 3 10 2011 when mean values are calculated across all runoff plots for each of the nine events table 1 the standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean varies from 43 to 85 further emphasising the variable nature of repellency induced runoff at the plot scale 3 3 a detailed study of two heavy rain events in an attempt to further assess the characteristics of topsoil repellency behaviour event 1 in 2010 in table 1 has been analysed in some detail it was an unusual event in that after an initial 2 mm of lighter rain there was 18 mm of heavy and uniform rainfall with an intensity of 1 75 mm min which induced from 10 to 14 mm of runoff from the four n plots as shown in fig 4 and table 1 over the next 44 h 15 mm of much lighter rain fell followed by 14 mm of heavy rain as shown in fig 5 eight mm of this fell in five minutes with an average intensity of 1 54 mm minute in sharp contrast to the similar event two days earlier this event produced less than 0 3 mm of runoff from the steeper n and e plots this earlier event and the 15 mm of light rain over the intervening 44 h had been sufficient to effectively eliminate repellency on these plots the three 20 plots did shed about 1 5 mm of runoff while it is possible that this represents some residual repellency it is more likely that it is the first signs of the interflow and a rising perched water table saturation excess to which these plots were prone the majority of the runoff recorded in event 1 of 2010 is associated with the 10 min of heavy rainfall which was unusually consistent in intensity fig 4 the uniformity of this event provides an opportunity to study the changes in the repellency throttled infiltration rates and runoff over the 10 min rather than the longer 44 h period described above least squares regression was used to fit quadratic equations to the approximately linear sections of the rainfall and runoff data shown as the lines in fig 4 since these fitted equations describe the accumulation of rainfall and runoff with respect to time the derivatives of these equations give instantaneous rainfall intensities and runoff rates during the 10 min period these are shown in fig 6 over the ten minutes of heavy rainfall the rainfall intensity increased only very gradually from 1 74 mm min to 1 76 mm min the runoff responses from the plots were varied providing further evidence of the extent of the spatial unevenness of soil water repellency at the plot scale but follow one of two patterns the first pattern is shown by the four n plots in fig 6 with initial runoff rates being between 64 and 87 of the rainfall rate over the ten minutes of steady rainfall the runoff rate from these plots decreased to between 42 and 66 of the steady rainfall rate indicating that the soil was becoming less water repellent assuming a constant spatially averaged ponded water depth on each plot over the 10 min the infiltration rate can be estimated as the difference between the rainfall intensity and the runoff rate the infiltration rates so estimated were initially between 0 2 and 0 6 mm min ten minutes later they had increased to between 0 6 and 1 0 mm min indicating that the repellency had partly dissipated the second behaviour pattern is characterised by the three s20 l and e 30 plots in contrast to the n plots these plots show much lower initial runoff rates 3 30 of the rainfall rate which slowly increased over the ten minute period to 15 35 of the steady rainfall rate however these three plots had much less total runoff than the four n plots fig 3 3 4 laboratory scale runoff observations the inferred increase in infiltration rates on the n plots during the first 10 min of the intense rainfall event on 20 01 2010 prompted further examination of this behaviour in the laboratory the recent development and construction of the roma apparatus enabled us to study runoff from relatively large topsoil slabs taken from areas adjacent to the runoff plots the results are shown in fig 7 although the apparatus attempts to simulate field conditions the method it employs to apply water to the soil slab is quite different to rainfall and therefore the runoff results can only be interpreted in general terms the runoff event on 20 01 2010 involved rainfall intensities of 1 5 2 0 mm min if this rainfall had been applied uniformly to the sloping slabs in the roma apparatus the application rate would have been 1 3 mm min however the localised application rate under each of the eight needles was extremely large observations during the roma trials showed that this high application rate combined with topsoil repellency under the needles led to the formation of a number of irregular rivulets about 5 mm wide which rapidly induced runoff as they extended down the length of the soil slab these rivulets were no longer visible after about 20 min no topsoil field volumetric water content data were available immediately prior to the 20 01 2010 event to compare with those of the air dried soil slabs however the water contents of the air dried soil slabs were about as dry as the driest of the water content values recorded 0 11 m3 m3 for the 0 50 mm depth in the field over the duration of the field study thus it is likely that the soil slabs were at least as repellent as the topsoil prior to the 20 01 2010 event the peak runoff values ranged from 6 to 67 of the applied water rate again illustrating the large variability in repellency exhibited at this scale fig 7 the time taken to reach peak runoff was quite consistent ranging from five to ten minutes after the initiation of water application during which the rivulets described above developed of particular note in fig 7 is the marked and rapid decrease of runoff following peak runoff for eight of the eleven slabs the repellency induced runoff rate had dropped to less than 5 of the application rate after 30 min the results are consistent with but more variable than those of jeyakumar et al 2014 leaving aside the data for their organic soil following the water run a 30 ethanol solution was applied to each soil slab in order to demonstrate the response of the soil surface to infiltration and runoff without the influence of soil water repellency in all cases no runoff at all was observed during the 30 ethanol runs confirming that the runoff responses observed during the water run were the result of soil water repellency as already mentioned the application of water to just the top of the air dried soil slabs in the roma experiment is quite different to rainfall which would fall more evenly over the entire soil surface and thus presumably overcome the repellency more rapidly and effectively conversely the absence of subsoil under the shallow slabs may have allowed more preferential flow and drainage tending to reduce runoff however the fact that repellency induced runoff had become negligible on most slabs after the application of water over a 30 min period confirms the transient behaviour of soil water repellency doerr et al 2000 4 discussion this study attempted to quantify the amount of runoff generated from 2 m2 runoff plots on new zealand pastoral hill country as a fraction of rainfall as well as measure the changes in the infiltration rate of a water repellent soil surface during the early stages of a heavy rainfall event in order to identify those runoff events that were repellency induced the intrinsic infiltrability of the topsoil needed to be ascertained i e the minimum infiltration rate of the topsoil when it was not water repellent although rainfall intensity and runoff data collected during 2010 offered little opportunity to determine intrinsic infiltrability several events during 2011 intense rainfall and a non repellent topsoil suggested that intrinsic infiltrability of the topsoil was at least 1 5 mm min despite this high value examination of runoff patterns indicated that runoff was occurring on initially dry soils thereby excluding saturation excess runoff processes and also when rainfall intensity was greater than about 0 1 mm min and was more frequent during the summer and autumn months thus there was some process occurring whereby intrinsic infiltrability was compromised and infiltration excess runoff was generated the most likely explanation for this behaviour is that the soil became water repellent nine of these runoff events were identified over the two years of study each occurring when the topsoil was initially dry and rainfall intensities were greater than 0 1 mm min in all cases the runoff timing coincided closely with peak rainfall intensity further suggesting that these runoff events were repellency induced summed runoff from these events indicated that repellency induced runoff was less than 5 of the total rainfall over the 2 year period although in individual events runoff comprised up to 75 of rainfall comparison of runoff values between adjacent paired plots and of means and standard deviations across all plots within each of the nine events indicated high variability this variability makes modelling repellency effects difficult and extrapolation of the runoff data to larger scales problematic the movement of runoff down slope could either accumulate or dissipate as scale is increased from plot size to the sub catchment level in a following paper we plan to use stream flow data to investigate which behaviour dominates the disappearance and re appearance of repellency induced runoff on the same plots shows that there is a cyclic process occurring whereby soil water repellency develops as the soil dries out and then disappears once enough rainfall occurs an unusual rainfall event in january 2010 event 1 table 1 allowed a detailed examination of the changes in infiltrability of an initially repellent soil surface during the first 10 min of consistent and heavy rainfall the uniformity of the rainfall during this 10 min allowed measurement of changes in repellency throttled infiltration rates during this period and revealed two patterns of behaviour the first pattern showed an increase in infiltrability from an initial 0 2 0 6 mm min to 0 6 1 0 mm min by the end of the 10 min period indicating the partial dissipation of repellency the second pattern showed much lower initial runoff rates which slowly increased over the 10 min period the slowly increasing runoff rate may reflect a slowly diminishing rate of rainfall going into surface ponding rather than a slowly decreasing infiltration rate however even if this is not so the change in infiltration rates over the 10 min inferred from the data in fig 6 are quite different to the expected shape of curves depicting the infiltration rate of ponded water into non repellent dry soil in this situation infiltration rates are expected to drop rapidly from an initial very high value towards the intrinsic infiltrability as the capillary pull dissipates jury et al 1991 p 141 philip 1969 p 281 subsequent to this unusual rainfall event 15 mm of light rain fell over the next 44 h ending in 14 mm of heavy rain however in contrast to the earlier event described above only 0 3 mm of runoff was observed this earlier event and the 15 mm of light rain over the intervening 44 h had been sufficient to effectively eliminate repellency on these plots the increase in infiltration rates observed during the initial stages of event 1 table 1 invited further investigation using laboratory techniques as mentioned in the introduction the water droplet penetration time wdpt and molarity of ethanol droplet med tests are well established techniques for the measurement of soil water repellency the major drawbacks of these techniques are that they are highly susceptible to micro scale variations in soil water repellency on the soil surface and also that the resulting numbers cannot be directly related to repellency induced runoff in the field the recent development of the roma apparatus allowed detailed study of runoff from relatively large soil slabs taken from the field since all slabs were subjected to an application of 30 ethanol solution in which no runoff was observed then all runoff associated with the application of water were the result of soil water repellency for all slabs peak water runoff rates ranged from 6 to 67 of the applied water rate and after 30 min most slabs exhibited runoff rates that were less than 5 of the application rate the high variability of peak runoff values again emphasises the issue with variability at the slab plot scale despite this the observation that repellency induced runoff had become negligible on most slabs after 30 min confirms the transient nature of soil water repellency it is widely accepted that organic coatings are a common cause of water repellency doerr et al 2000 the reason for the transient behaviour of repellency may be due to the nature of the outermost layer of these coatings particularly if amphipathic or amphiphilic compounds are present as suggested by several authors doerr et al 2000 horne and mcintosh 2000 the latter study proposed several mechanisms for repellency in order to explain marked seasonal variations in soil water repellency in sandy soils found on the south west coast of the north island new zealand the outcomes of our study suggest that while repellency is overt during extended dry conditions at the study site there are much shorter term fluctuations driven by a succession of infrequent rainfall events and extended dry periods which trigger responses from amphipathic compounds present on the surfaces of organic coatings 5 conclusion examination of repellency induced runoff events from 2 m2 plots on hill slopes in the south east coast of new zealand showed that there were nine runoff events greater than 1 mm over two years and that runoff constituted less than 5 of the annual rainfall however during the first 10 min of infrequent heavy rainfall events up to 75 of that rain was found to run off the 2 m2 plots analysis of a 24 8 mm rainfall event during this period suggests that infiltration rates increased on the most repellent plots over the first ten minutes of steady heavy rain 1 75 mm min indicating some reduction in repellency over that time period a second and similar heavy rain event two days later produced negligible runoff indicating the topsoil was no longer water repellent laboratory experiments showed that repellency largely disappears after the application of water over a 30 min period funding this research did not receive any specific grant from external funding agencies in the

11532,to address the global environmental and resource crisis integrated efficient and sustainable agricultural practices need to be developed we examined the effects of combining one of two irrigation methods i e controlled irrigation and conventional flooding irrigation with one of four different levels of nitrogen fertilizer applications n 300 n0 270 n1 240 n2 and 180 kg n ha 1 n3 on grain yield water use efficiency and n production efficiency in rice additionally we analyzed nitrogen leaching at different soil depths 20 cm and 80 cm using lysimeters and n2o emission using a polyvinyl chloride chamber for each of the combinations examined we found that the irrigation regime and level of n application significantly affected rice yield and the rice yield in the controlled irrigation treatment was higher than that in the conventional flooding irrigation treatment by 2 12 12 30 of all the treatments combining controlled irrigation with the n1 fertilizer application resulted in the greatest grain yield loss of n was mainly caused by nitrate leaching controlled irrigation and reducing the amount of n fertilizer applied in the soil reduced n leaching and increased the n production efficiency while increasing n2o emission furthermore water use efficiency was increased under controlled irrigation conditions but reduced when less n fertilizer was applied thus an agricultural regime that uses less water and lower amounts of n fertilizer than are currently being used in standard practices would likely increase yield and n production efficiency in soils while reducing potential n leaching however the n2o emissions would also increase keywords lysimeters water saving irrigation nitrous oxide 1 introduction china has a population of over 1 37 billion people and the population is growing at an annual rate of 4 96 to meet the population s demands food production must be increased by 50 by 2050 huang et al 2014 this poses an enormous challenge for agricultural production in china especially considering the continued decrease of land that is available for agriculture due to processes of agricultural restructuring rural urbanization industrialization and economic reform cao and yin 2015 the required increase in food production can therefore only be met by increasing grain production per unit area china s grain production has already more than tripled in the past 50 years due to the use of fertilizers specifically synthetic nitrogen n fertilizer guo et al 2010 for instance in the taihu lake region where rice oryza sativa l is the main crop n fertilizer is widely used to improve crop yields in this densely populated and intensively farmed region paddy fields are fertilized with an average annual application of 350 kg n ha 1 with 40 of paddy fields being fertilized with more than 360 kg n ha 1 these levels are much higher than the mean n fertilizer input 300 kg n ha 1 for rice monoculture and n fertilizer use efficiency ranges from 25 to 35 zhao et al 2012 this excessive application of n fertilizer causes substantial n losses through surface runoff leaching and gaseous emission and results in nonpoint source pollution responsible for 59 of the n contributing to the eutrophication of taihu lake piirainen et al 2013 water in addition to n is another important factor that determines crop yield especially for rice which requires more water than any other crop under traditional flood irrigated conditions water consumption in paddy fields accounts for approximately 50 of all diverted freshwater in china ye et al 2013 the increased water demands of cities and industries coupled with a limited water supply highlight the need to reduce water usage moreover n leaching in the taihu lake region where submerged irrigation practices are combined with excessive n fertilization of paddy fields is a major cause of serious pollution of both groundwater and surface water indeed the taihu lake is transitioning from eutrophication to heavy eutrophication wu et al 2011 peng et al 2015 nitrous oxide n2o a long lived greenhouse gas ghg is mostly derived from agricultural practices and activities with about 4 5 tg n being produced worldwide per year wuebbles 2009 rice paddies covered with standing water creating the anaerobic conditions that facilitated the denitrification were considered to be an important source of n2o emissions das and adhya 2014 pandey et al 2014 furthermore n2o emissions increased significantly with an increase in the nitrogen application rate zou et al 2005 tariq et al 2017 therefore water and nutrient management are important factors determining n2o emissions from rice paddies pandey et al 2014 as n2o emissions are ghgs with high warming potentials ipcc 2007 there is an urgent need to reduce n2o emissions from agricultural ecosystems to improve n agronomic efficiency to minimize the environmental impacts of n fertilizers several techniques have been used to monitor drainage of water and n losses such as methods involving coring suction cups and lysimeters lysimeters have been shown to be the best method for analyzing the total water flow and n movement in soil specifically in the field basso and ritchie 2005 gu et al 2016 many studies of n in the soil have focused on the upper layer of soil horizon 0 0 2m however significant denitrification activity was found in anaerobic deeper layers which could be an important mechanism for the removal of excess no3 before it is leached to groundwater or discharged to the surface aquifer sotomayor and rice 1996 fenton et al 2009 bernard jannin et al 2017 therefore monitoring the water flow and n losses in the deep soil was necessary to address the impending environmental crisis and the increasing scarcity of water resources integrated environmentally friendly and high efficiency sustainable agricultural practices need to be developed many studies have shown that certain water saving irrigation regimes can reduce the total n loss from the paddy fields when compared with traditional flood irrigation although the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the percolation water increased peng et al 2011 tan et al 2013 peng et al 2015 furthermore the overuse of n fertilizer can reduce grain yield lowering the use of n fertilizer to the optimal nitrogen fertilizer rate 200 kg n ha 1 for the rice growing season in the taihu lake region especially during the early growth phases could minimize the risk of n leaching without compromising grain yields ju et al 2009 deng et al 2012 qiao et al 2013 irrigation regimes and proper n fertilizer application rates have been shown to act synergistically to improve crop yield water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency wang et al 2016 however n loss through leaching and emission and grain yields under various irrigation and fertilizer regimens have not been systematically assessed an improved understanding of the relationship between n input and irrigation volumes would pave the way for minimizing n leaching and optimizing rice yields in the taihu lake region in this study we developed an integrated high efficiency agricultural practice for reducing water and n use in rice paddies in addition we compared the effects of this integrated practice on grain yield and n losses through leaching measured using lysimeters or n2o emissions measured using a polyvinyl chloride chamber with data obtained here using traditional submersion irrigation and n fertilizer application methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted at xingeng village suzhou city jiangsu province 31 26 44 n 120 28 48 e in the lower part of the taihu lake basin the study area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 16 6 c and an annual precipitation of 1312 mm the top 15 cm layer of the soil in the experimental field contained 30 35 g kg 1 organic

22 6 of clay 68 2 of silt 9 2 of sand 2 2 experimental design the experiments were conducted during the rice growing season from 2010 to 2013 one of two irrigation treatments i e controlled irrigation ci and conventional flooding irrigation cf were combined with fertilization with one of four different levels of nitrogen fertilizer applications i e conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application n0 300 kg nha 1 90 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application n1 270 kg nha 1 80 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application n2 240 kg nha 1 and 60 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application n3 180 kg nha 1 the eight treatments that combined each irrigation method with each level of nitrogen fertilizer application are listed in table 1 a randomized complete block design was established for all treatments and three replications were performed in twenty four experimental field plots 5 0 m 4 0 m each plot was isolated using field ridges 40 cm at the base and 40 cm high that were covered with plastic foil to prevent lateral water movement the variety of rice oryza sativa l planted in this area was nanjing 46 a systematic breeding line from the jiangsu academy of agricultural sciences in 2012 and 2013 the rice seedlings were transplanted on june 28 three to four plants were transplanted in every hill and were harvested on december 5 local fertilization practices for rice cultivation were followed urea 46 n superphosphate 6 p and potassium chloride 54 k were applied urea was supplied in three applications with 45 kg nha 1 as a basal application before planting and 30 of the total n supplied at panicle formation and the rest supplied at the tillering period phosphorus and k were applied as basal fertilizers at the same level as basal application of n wang et al 2014 conventional flooding irrigation was the traditional irrigation method used in this region peng et al 2015 30 40 mm of standing water was constantly maintained after transplanting until the late tillering and ripening phases for the controlled irrigation 10 20 mm of standing water was maintained only during the re greening stage with limited subsequent irrigation to keep the soil moist 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 grain yield and yield components at the end of the growing season the grain yield was measured from a 5 m2 area in the center of each plot rice plants were harvested manually and threshed using a hand driven thresher grains were air dried before weighing yield parameters including effective panicle number per ha total number of grains per panicle percentage seed setting and 1000 grain weight were determined for 10 plants randomly selected from the plot in 2012 and 2013 ye et al 2013 2 3 2 soil nitrogen content after harvest soil samples 0 15 cm were collected using a 35 mm diameter core the total n concentration in the soil was measured using the kjeldahl method nh4 n and no3 n were extracted from the soil samples with 50 ml of 2 m kcl and then filtered through ashless filter paper the nh4 n and no3 n in the filtrates were determined using a continuous flow analyzer seal analytical autoanalyzer 3 germany wu et al 2015 2 3 3 nitrogen leaching analysis lysimeters porous polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china were installed at depths of 20 and 80 cm one year prior to collection of leachates from each plot wu et al 2015 the leachates were collected using an electric pump 11 kw 30 kpa suction pressure at different days in 2012 and 2013 the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n in the leachates were analyzed with a continuous flow analyzer seal analytical autoanalyzer 3 germany 2 3 4 nitrogen emission analysis a polyvinyl chloride collar was installed in each plot before flooding without covering the rice plants the top edge of the collar had a groove filled with water to seal the rim of a chamber that was attached to the collar during gas collection the n2o samples were collected using a closed polyvinyl chloride chamber of 0 5 0 5 0 5 m in the early stage of rice growth and 0 5 0 5 1 m in the late stage of rice growth the fluxes of n2o emissions from each plot were collected on the first third fifth and seventh days after fertilization and at 7 day intervals thereafter 24 times during 2012 and also during 2013 gas samples of 20 ml were collected between 8 and 10 a m at intervals of 10 min 0 min 10 min 20 min and 30 min after chamber closure the concentrations of n2o in a gas sample were simultaneously analyzed with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890d usa equipped with a 63ni electron capture detector the carrier gas 95 argon 5 methane was adjusted to a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 and the temperature of the oven injector and detector was 60 100 and 300 c respectively the variance coefficient of the standard sample 3 0 mg kg 1 n2o was within 0 1 0 4 at 10 h the flux and seasonal cumulative n2o were calculated according to wu et al 2015 2 3 5 calculation of nitrogen production efficiency and water use efficiency the nitrogen production efficiency was defined as the ratio of grain yield to the concentration of applied n wang et al 2015 the water use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of grain yield to the amount of water lost through evapotranspiration during the entire growth period of rice li et al 2007 water evapotranspiration and field seepage were measured according to qin et al 2006 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss version 20 0 for windows spss chicago illinois usa all data presented are the means of three replicates differences between means were analyzed using analysis of variance anova the least significant difference test was used to compare differences in means among treatments at the 0 05 probability level 3 results and discussion 3 1 grain yields and yield components water and n are considered to be two of the most important factors in optimizing rice yields a number of water efficient irrigation strategies have been tested and used in different rice growing regions of china among the various methods used alternate wetting and drying irrigation which is similar to the controlled irrigation used in our study is the most widely promoted method yao et al 2012 wang et al 2016 we showed here that controlled irrigation resulted in a higher grain yield than conventional flooding irrigation at the same nitrogen application level table 2 in the controlled irrigation treatment yields of plants subjected to the 90 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application treatment n1 were similar to those subjected to conventional flooding irrigation treatment with regular fertilizer supply n0 similar results were reported by ye et al 2013 who showed that alternate wetting and drying irrigation resulted in similar or better rice yields than did conventional irrigation an integrated practice combining controlled irrigation and 90 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application cin1 appears to be the most effective method of increasing grain yield resulting in yields that are slightly higher than those of plants subjected to conventional flooding irrigation and the maximum level of nitrogen fertilizer application cfn0 as well as those subjected to a decrease of 28 39 or 28 05 of water supply in 2012 and 2013 compared to the conventional irrigation table s1 furthermore evapotranspiration and field seepage were reduced due to the shorter flooding duration of the controlled irrigation treatment qin et al 2006 and fertilizer requirements were reduced the increased yield under the controlled irrigation regime might be due to the increased concentrations of total n nh4 n and no3 n in the soil table 3 in general after application of the same amount of fertilizer an increase of total n nh4 n and no3 n concentrations was measured in the soil under controlled irrigation when compared with conventional flooding irrigation although this increase was not significant for some treatments the reasons for this might because 1 during the early periods rice grew better and absorbed more nitrogen from the flooded soil and the nitrogen content in the soil was decreased qin et al 2006 and 2 less n was lost in the leachate under controlled irrigation treatment table 4 under the same water regime the concentration of total n nh4 n and no3 n in the soil decreased with the reduction in n level consistent results were obtained in both years furthermore under the same irrigation practices the yields did not significantly change among plants subjected to the n0 n1 and n2 treatment 300 kg nha 1 270 kg nha 1 and 240 kg nha 1 but were significantly reduced in those subjected to the n3 treatment 180 kg nha 1 p 0 05 the 1000 grain weight was comparable between the two irrigation treatments but decreased after the reduced application of n fertilizer especially in the n3 treatment 180 kg nha 1 furthermore the number of effective panicles total grains per panicle and the seed setting rate were similar under most treatments only showing a significant reduction in the n3 treatment the decreased yields and the agronomic traits of the grains suggested that the threshold of the n supply was 180 kg nha 1 which is in accordance with the suggested fertilizer application rate in most areas in china xu et al 2017 the application of more than 240 kg n ha 1 did not show any advantages in terms of the yields and the agronomic traits which could be attributed to higher n losses table 4 and the quadratic response i e that grain yield initially increased with increasing fertilizer n but later decreased in accordance with the law of diminishing returns xu et al 2017 the water regimes w and n treatments n significantly affected these agronomic traits moreover n treatment had a more significant effects on grain yield and 1000 grain weight than did the irrigation regime while the irrigation regime had a more significant effect on total grains per panicle grains and the seed setting rate similar results were reported by ye et al 2013 namely that more effective panicles and spikelets were found under alternate wetting and drying irrigation and that grain filling percentage was generally increased by n application regardless of the water treatment used 3 2 ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in water leakage n leaching poses a high risk in paddy soils nh4 n and no3 n are the main forms of the n leaching while the amount and form of fertilizer n leached depends on the soil type fertilizer property and duration of intermittent leaching wang and alva 1996 xiong et al 2010 therefore we measured the total amounts nh4 n and no3 n in the leachate at various times in agreement with the observation that permanent negatively charged paddy soil as used in this experiment limits nh4 n leaching phillips and burton 2005 xiong et al 2010 cao and yin 2014 nh4 n leaching was negligible whereas no3 n leaching was not fig s1 in the leachate collected at a 20 cm soil depth the nh4 n concentrations increased with increasing concentrations of n in the fertilizer peaking on the second day after fertilization and then gradually decreasing to basal levels within two weeks fig s1 the highest nh4 n concentrations were observed after application of fertilizer at the tillering stage when compared with the conventional flooding irrigation treatment the nh4 n concentrations in the leachate in the controlled irrigation treatment were a little higher although the difference was not statistically significant in the leachate collected at an 80 cm soil depth the nh4 n concentrations were significantly reduced and showed a similar trend as leachates collected at a 20 cm soil depth this observation might be related to the fact that nh4 n is usually retained in the upper soil and could therefore easily be absorbed by the rice plants in addition the exchange process caused the nh4 n to be absorbed by soil particles tan et al 2015 moreover the nh4 n concentrations in the leachates collected at a 20 cm soil depth for all the treatments in 2012 were higher than those in 2013 while the nh4 n concentrations in leachates collected at 80 cm depth were similar for all treatments and in both years too fig s1 this might due to the higher rainfall in 2013 486 7 mm than that in 2012 437 4 mm table s1 and the leachates collected at deep soil depths 80 cm being influenced to a lesser extent nitrate no3 n leaching is another form of n leaching loss when compared with nh4 n the no3 n concentrations in percolation water were higher and showed greater temporal variability fig 1 these observations might be due to the nh4 n retention by the negatively charged soil particles whereas no3 is naturally mobile cao and yin 2014 tan et al 2015 in the leachate that was collected at a depth of 20 cm peaks in no3 n concentrations occurred in close relation to irrigation and fertilization times for example the no3 n concentration in all treatments increased the day after the fertilizer was applied and were highest after fertilizer application at the tillering phase in addition to the three peaks that occurred immediately after the application of fertilizer no3 n concentrations but not nh4 n concentrations showed an additional peak between the tillering and panicle formation stage approximately 32 d after transplanting in both 2012 and 2013 which occurred on the day of re irrigation after drying of the paddy field in the sunshine nitrification is more common in aerobic conditions and dry fields provide such an aerobic soil environment resulting in increased no3 n concentrations a similar noticeable amount of no3 n was leached from soil when the soil water conditions were changed from drained to flooded xiong et al 2010 over time the increased no3 n concentration gradually declined reaching a stable level within 10 days when compared with the conventional flooding irrigation method the no3 n concentrations observed for the controlled irrigation method were slightly higher due to the significantly reduced irrigation volumes peng et al 2015 although in some cases the increases were not statistically significant in the leachates collected at 80 cm depth the no3 n concentrations were significantly reduced and showed a similar trend as the no3 n concentrations in the leachate collected at a 20 cm soil depth the changes in no3 n concentrations in all treatments tended to be similar in 2012 and 2013 3 3 ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen leaching losses considering that the groundwater is shallow in the research area with seasonal variation in the water table ranging from 1 to 3 m and that the crop root system coverage is less than 80 cm zhang and li 2009 zhang et al 2016 we used leachate collected at an 80 cm soil depth to evaluate nitrogen loss to calculate n leaching loss we multiplied the manually recorded drainage volumes by measured average n concentrations in the leachate at an 80 cm soil depth according to the method of he et al 2017 we found that the watering regime can significantly influenced nitrogen leaching the controlled irrigation method resulted in an increase in the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the leachate due to the lower water amount results in a higher n concentration even when the same amount of n was applied the increase in no3 n concentration was more pronounced when compared with the conventional flooding irrigation method table 4 the nitrogen loss to the groundwater at a depth of 80 cm was mainly in the form of no3 n which was present at 10 times higher levels than nh4 n this might also be related to the reduced water supply and the produced aerobic conditions that facilitated nitrification process xiong et al 2010 peng et al 2015 although the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the leachates increased under controlled irrigation the actual amount of total nitrogen lost was reduced when taking the water leakage volume into account table 4 to summarize drainage is lower under controlled irrigation compared to traditional irrigation table s1 and the latter results in greater n leaching even if the n concentration of the water losses is lower than that measured from the controlled irrigation reducing the concentration of n fertilizer could significantly decrease the average total n concentration and the no3 n concentration in the leachate the nh4 n and no3 n leaching losses from the paddy fields were significantly lower when the controlled irrigation method was used and when reduced level of n were used in addition the nitrogen production efficiency and the water use efficiency were higher under controlled irrigation than under conventional flooding irrigation table 4 previous studies demonstrated that excessive standing water tends to result in oxygen deficiency at the soil surface and an increase in water loss through evaporation while reducing the photosynthetic and water use efficiency ye et al 2013 shao et al 2014 it is plausible that in anaerobic conditions less nitrate was uptaken less amount in soil solution and less was conveyed to the foliage for reduction and assimilation therefore increased water productivity was consistently observed in paddies subjected to controlled irrigation compared with those subjected to conventional flooding furthermore different level of n application also influenced the nitrogen production efficiency and the water use efficiency and the nitrogen production efficiency increased with the application of lower levels of n while water use efficiency decreased with the application of reduced levels of n table 4 an appropriate reduction in fertilizer application is an effective means of reducing nitrogen loss and improving the nitrogen production efficiency while reducing the water use efficiency due to improved grain yield ye et al 2013 taken together the nitrogen production efficiency and water use efficiency are affected by the concentration of n applied and the irrigation method used the dynamics of nh4 n and no3 n leaching losses the nitrogen production efficiency and the water use efficiency during different treatments showed similar tendencies in 2012 and 2013 these results confirmed that controlled irrigation increased the nitrogen production efficiency and water use efficiency and that reducing the level of n fertilizer also increased the nitrogen production efficiency while decreasing the water use efficiency among all the treatments evaluated the integrated practice combining controlled irrigation and 90 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application cin1 improved the yield while reducing n loss considering the low n sorption capacities in this typical sandy clay loam soil used in our study which is typical of that found in the taihu lake region shan et al 2005 we recommend using the cin1 practice for rice paddies in the taihu lake region 3 4 n2o emissions nitrous oxide is produced via the biogeochemical processes of nitrification and denitrification that are greatly influenced by the soil water status and the amount and timing of n sources applied ku et al 2017 the temporal variations in n2o fluxes are shown in fig 2 the timing of n source application could significantly influence n2o emissions significant increases in n2o emissions occurred directly after fertilizer application especially after basal fertilizer application before planting while the amount of fertilizer used did not significantly influence the quantity of n2o emissions the direct n2o emissions from paddy fields throughout the rice growing season depend greatly on nitrogen inputs and the water regimes used n2o emissions mostly decreased with reduced nitrogen applied and were higher under controlled irrigation than conventional flooding irrigation table s2 controlled irrigation increased the direct n2o emissions especially in 2013 this might due to the submerged treatment producing anaerobic conditions that promote the release of n gas as n2 khalil et al 2004 however n loss by the direct n2o emissions was less than 2 of the no3 n leaching losses confirming that leaching of no3 n was the main factor determining loss of n similarly a previous study of rice found that n losses were greater through n leaching than through direct n2o emissions zhao et al 2009 4 conclusions in summary based on data collected over two growing seasons we found that an integrated practice combining controlled irrigation with a 10 reduction in fertilizer application cin1 was the most effective method to ensure high grain yield while reducing the use of water and fertilizer the loss of n was mainly through leaching in the form no3 n and no3 n concentrations in the percolation water were higher than nh4 n concentrations and showed greater temporal variability reducing fertilizer application reduces nitrogen loss and improves the nitrogen production efficiency controlled irrigation could also reduce nitrogen leaching loss and increase the nitrogen production efficiency and water use efficiency while increasing the total n2o emissions therefore it is important to evaluate the integrative effects of water management and fertilizer application on greenhouse gas emissions and non point pollution in rice paddy fields other techniques such as deep urea placement large urea granules could offer alternatives for n economy compliance with ethical

grain yield water use efficiency and n production efficiency in rice additionally we analyzed nitrogen leaching at different soil depths 20 cm and 80 cm using lysimeters and n2o emission using a polyvinyl chloride chamber for each of the combinations examined we found that the irrigation regime and level of n application significantly affected rice yield and the rice yield in the controlled irrigation treatment was higher than that in the conventional flooding irrigation treatment by 2 12 12 30 of all the treatments combining controlled irrigation with the n1 fertilizer application resulted in the greatest grain yield loss of n was mainly caused by nitrate leaching controlled irrigation and reducing the amount of n fertilizer applied in the soil reduced n leaching and increased the n production efficiency while increasing n2o emission furthermore water use efficiency was increased under controlled irrigation conditions but reduced when less n fertilizer was applied thus an agricultural regime that uses less water and lower amounts of n fertilizer than are currently being used in standard practices would likely increase yield and n production efficiency in soils while reducing potential n leaching however the n2o emissions would also increase keywords lysimeters water saving irrigation nitrous oxide 1 introduction china has a population of over 1 37 billion people

freshwater in china ye et al 2013 the increased water demands of cities and industries coupled with a limited water supply highlight the need to reduce water usage moreover n leaching in the taihu lake region where submerged irrigation practices are combined with excessive n fertilization of paddy fields is a major cause of serious pollution of both groundwater and surface water indeed the taihu lake is transitioning from eutrophication to heavy eutrophication wu et al 2011 peng et al 2015 nitrous oxide n2o a long lived greenhouse gas ghg is mostly derived from agricultural practices and activities with about 4 5 tg n being produced worldwide per year wuebbles 2009 rice paddies covered with standing water creating the anaerobic conditions that facilitated the denitrification were considered to be an important source of n2o emissions das and adhya 2014 pandey et al 2014 furthermore n2o emissions increased significantly with an increase in the nitrogen application rate zou et al 2005 tariq et al 2017 therefore water and nutrient management are important factors determining n2o emissions from rice paddies pandey et al 2014 as n2o emissions are ghgs with high warming potentials ipcc 2007 there is an urgent need to reduce n2o emissions from agricultural ecosystems to improve n agronomic efficiency to minimize the environmental impacts of n fertilizers several techniques have been used to monitor drainage of water and n losses such as methods involving coring suction cups and lysimeters lysimeters have been shown to be the best method for analyzing the total water flow and n movement in soil specifically in the field basso and ritchie 2005 gu et al 2016 many studies of n in the soil have focused on the upper layer of soil horizon 0 0 2m however significant denitrification activity was found in anaerobic deeper layers which could be an important mechanism for the removal of excess no3 before it is leached to groundwater or discharged to the surface aquifer sotomayor and rice 1996 fenton et al 2009 bernard jannin et al 2017 therefore monitoring the water flow and n losses in the deep soil was necessary to address the impending environmental crisis and the increasing scarcity of water resources integrated environmentally friendly and high efficiency sustainable agricultural practices need to be developed many studies have shown that certain water saving irrigation regimes can reduce the total n loss from the paddy fields when compared with traditional flood irrigation although the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the percolation water increased peng et al 2011 tan et al 2013 peng et al 2015 furthermore the overuse of n fertilizer can reduce grain yield lowering the use of n fertilizer to the optimal nitrogen fertilizer rate 200 kg n ha 1 for the rice growing season in the taihu lake region especially during the early growth phases could minimize the risk of n leaching without compromising grain yields ju et al 2009 deng et al 2012 qiao et al 2013 irrigation regimes and proper n fertilizer application rates have been shown to act synergistically to improve crop yield water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency wang et al 2016 however n loss through leaching and emission and grain yields under various irrigation and fertilizer regimens have not been systematically assessed an improved understanding of the relationship between n input and irrigation volumes would pave the way for minimizing n leaching and optimizing rice yields in the taihu lake region in this study we developed an integrated high efficiency agricultural practice for reducing water and n use in rice paddies in addition we compared the effects of this integrated practice on grain yield and n losses through leaching measured using lysimeters or n2o emissions measured using a polyvinyl chloride chamber with data obtained here using traditional submersion irrigation and n fertilizer application methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted at xingeng village suzhou city jiangsu province 31 26 44 n 120 28 48 e in the lower part of the taihu lake basin the study area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 16 6 c and an annual precipitation of 1312 mm the top 15 cm layer of the soil in the experimental field contained 30 35 g kg 1 organic

ci and conventional flooding irrigation cf were combined with fertilization with one of four different levels of nitrogen fertilizer applications i e conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application n0 300 kg nha 1 90 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application n1 270 kg nha 1 80 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application n2 240 kg nha 1 and 60 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application n3 180 kg nha 1 the eight treatments that combined each irrigation method with each level of nitrogen fertilizer application are listed in table 1 a randomized complete block design was established for all treatments and three replications were performed in twenty four experimental field plots 5 0 m 4 0 m each plot was isolated using field ridges 40 cm at the base and 40 cm high that were covered with plastic foil to prevent lateral water movement the variety of rice oryza sativa l planted in this area was nanjing 46 a systematic breeding line from the jiangsu academy of agricultural sciences in 2012 and 2013 the rice seedlings were transplanted on june 28 three to four plants were transplanted in every hill and were harvested on december 5 local fertilization practices for rice cultivation were followed urea 46 n superphosphate 6 p and potassium chloride 54 k were applied urea was supplied in three applications with 45 kg nha 1 as a basal application before planting and 30 of the total n supplied at panicle formation and the rest supplied at the tillering period phosphorus and k were applied as basal fertilizers at the same level as basal application of n wang et al 2014 conventional flooding irrigation was the traditional irrigation method used in this region peng et al 2015 30 40 mm of standing water was constantly maintained after transplanting until the late tillering and ripening phases for the controlled irrigation 10 20 mm of standing water was maintained only during the re greening stage with limited subsequent irrigation to keep the soil moist 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 grain yield and yield components at the end of the growing season the grain yield was measured from a 5 m2 area in the center of each plot rice plants were harvested manually and threshed using a hand driven thresher grains were air dried before weighing yield parameters including effective panicle number per ha total number of grains per panicle percentage seed setting and 1000 grain weight were determined for 10 plants randomly selected from the plot in 2012 and 2013 ye et al 2013 2 3 2 soil nitrogen content after harvest soil samples 0 15 cm were collected using a 35 mm diameter core the total n concentration in the soil was measured using the kjeldahl method nh4 n and no3 n were extracted from the soil samples with 50 ml of 2 m kcl and then filtered through ashless filter paper the nh4 n and no3 n in the filtrates were determined using a continuous flow analyzer seal analytical autoanalyzer 3 germany wu et al 2015 2 3 3 nitrogen leaching analysis lysimeters porous polyvinyl chloride pvc pipes institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china were installed at depths of 20 and 80 cm one year prior to collection of leachates from each plot wu et al 2015 the leachates were collected using an electric pump 11 kw 30 kpa suction pressure at different days in 2012 and 2013 the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n in the leachates were analyzed with a continuous flow analyzer seal analytical autoanalyzer 3 germany 2 3 4 nitrogen emission analysis a polyvinyl chloride collar was installed in each plot before flooding without covering the rice plants the top edge of the collar had a groove filled with water to seal the rim of a chamber that was attached to the collar during gas collection the n2o samples were collected using a closed polyvinyl chloride chamber of 0 5 0 5 0 5 m in the early stage of rice growth and 0 5 0 5 1 m in the late stage of rice growth the fluxes of n2o emissions from each plot were collected on the first third fifth and seventh days after fertilization and at 7 day intervals thereafter 24 times during 2012 and also during 2013 gas samples of 20 ml were collected between 8 and 10 a m at intervals of 10 min 0 min 10 min 20 min and 30 min after chamber closure the concentrations of n2o in a gas sample were simultaneously analyzed with a gas chromatograph agilent 7890d usa equipped with a 63ni electron capture detector the carrier gas 95 argon 5 methane was adjusted to a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 and the temperature of the oven injector and detector was 60 100 and 300 c respectively the variance coefficient of the standard sample 3 0 mg kg 1 n2o was within 0 1 0 4 at 10 h the flux and seasonal cumulative n2o were calculated according to wu et al 2015 2 3 5 calculation of nitrogen production efficiency and water use efficiency the nitrogen production efficiency was defined as the ratio of grain yield to the concentration of applied n wang et al 2015 the water use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of grain yield to the amount of water lost through evapotranspiration during the entire growth period of rice li et al 2007 water evapotranspiration and field seepage were measured according to qin et al 2006 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss version 20 0 for windows spss chicago illinois usa all data presented are the means of three replicates differences between means were analyzed using analysis of variance anova the least significant difference test was used to compare differences in means among treatments at the 0 05 probability level 3 results and discussion 3 1 grain yields and yield components water and n are considered to be two of the most important factors in optimizing rice yields a number of water efficient irrigation strategies have been tested and used in different rice growing regions of china among the various methods used alternate wetting and drying irrigation which is similar to the controlled irrigation used in our study is the most widely promoted method yao et al 2012 wang et al 2016 we showed here that controlled irrigation resulted in a higher grain yield than conventional flooding irrigation at the same nitrogen application level table 2 in the controlled irrigation treatment yields of plants subjected to the 90 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application treatment n1 were similar to those subjected to conventional flooding irrigation treatment with regular fertilizer supply n0 similar results were reported by ye et al 2013 who showed that alternate wetting and drying irrigation resulted in similar or better rice yields than did conventional irrigation an integrated practice combining controlled irrigation and 90 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application cin1 appears to be the most effective method of increasing grain yield resulting in yields that are slightly higher than those of plants subjected to conventional flooding irrigation and the maximum level of nitrogen fertilizer application cfn0 as well as those subjected to a decrease of 28 39 or 28 05 of water supply in 2012 and 2013 compared to the conventional irrigation table s1 furthermore evapotranspiration and field seepage were reduced due to the shorter flooding duration of the controlled irrigation treatment qin et al 2006 and fertilizer requirements were reduced the increased yield under the controlled irrigation regime might be due to the increased concentrations of total n nh4 n and no3 n in the soil table 3 in general after application of the same amount of fertilizer an increase of total n nh4 n and no3 n concentrations was measured in the soil under controlled irrigation when compared with conventional flooding irrigation although this increase was not significant for some treatments the reasons for this might because 1 during the early periods rice grew better and absorbed more nitrogen from the flooded soil and the nitrogen content in the soil was decreased qin et al 2006 and 2 less n was lost in the leachate under controlled irrigation treatment table 4 under the same water regime the concentration of total n nh4 n and no3 n in the soil decreased with the reduction in n level consistent results were obtained in both years furthermore under the same irrigation practices the yields did not significantly change among plants subjected to the n0 n1 and n2 treatment 300 kg nha 1 270 kg nha 1 and 240 kg nha 1 but were significantly reduced in those subjected to the n3 treatment 180 kg nha 1 p 0 05 the 1000 grain weight was comparable between the two irrigation treatments but decreased after the reduced application of n fertilizer especially in the n3 treatment 180 kg nha 1 furthermore the number of effective panicles total grains per panicle and the seed setting rate were similar under most treatments only showing a significant reduction in the n3 treatment the decreased yields and the agronomic traits of the grains suggested that the threshold of the n supply was 180 kg nha 1 which is in accordance with the suggested fertilizer application rate in most areas in china xu et al 2017 the application of more than 240 kg n ha 1 did not show any advantages in terms of the yields and the agronomic traits which could be attributed to higher n losses table 4 and the quadratic response i e that grain yield initially increased with increasing fertilizer n but later decreased in accordance with the law of diminishing returns xu et al 2017 the water regimes w and n treatments n significantly affected these agronomic traits moreover n treatment had a more significant effects on grain yield and 1000 grain weight than did the irrigation regime while the irrigation regime had a more significant effect on total grains per panicle grains and the seed setting rate similar results were reported by ye et al 2013 namely that more effective panicles and spikelets were found under alternate wetting and drying irrigation and that grain filling percentage was generally increased by n application regardless of the water treatment used 3 2 ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in water leakage n leaching poses a high risk in paddy soils nh4 n and no3 n are the main forms of the n leaching while the amount and form of fertilizer n leached depends on the soil type fertilizer property and duration of intermittent leaching wang and alva 1996 xiong et al 2010 therefore we measured the total amounts nh4 n and no3 n in the leachate at various times in agreement with the observation that permanent negatively charged paddy soil as used in this experiment limits nh4 n leaching phillips and burton 2005 xiong et al 2010 cao and yin 2014 nh4 n leaching was negligible whereas no3 n leaching was not fig s1 in the leachate collected at a 20 cm soil depth the nh4 n concentrations increased with increasing concentrations of n in the fertilizer peaking on the second day after fertilization and then gradually decreasing to basal levels within two weeks fig s1 the highest nh4 n concentrations were observed after application of fertilizer at the tillering stage when compared with the conventional flooding irrigation treatment the nh4 n concentrations in the leachate in the controlled irrigation treatment were a little higher although the difference was not statistically significant in the leachate collected at an 80 cm soil depth the nh4 n concentrations were significantly reduced and showed a similar trend as leachates collected at a 20 cm soil depth this observation might be related to the fact that nh4 n is usually retained in the upper soil and could therefore easily be absorbed by the rice plants in addition the exchange process caused the nh4 n to be absorbed by soil particles tan et al 2015 moreover the nh4 n concentrations in the leachates collected at a 20 cm soil depth for all the treatments in 2012 were higher than those in 2013 while the nh4 n concentrations in leachates collected at 80 cm depth were similar for all treatments and in both years too fig s1 this might due to the higher rainfall in 2013 486 7 mm than that in 2012 437 4 mm table s1 and the leachates collected at deep soil depths 80 cm being influenced to a lesser extent nitrate no3 n leaching is another form of n leaching loss when compared with nh4 n the no3 n concentrations in percolation water were higher and showed greater temporal variability fig 1 these observations might be due to the nh4 n retention by the negatively charged soil particles whereas no3 is naturally mobile cao and yin 2014 tan et al 2015 in the leachate that was collected at a depth of 20 cm peaks in no3 n concentrations occurred in close relation to irrigation and fertilization times for example the no3 n concentration in all treatments increased the day after the fertilizer was applied and were highest after fertilizer application at the tillering phase in addition to the three peaks that occurred immediately after the application of fertilizer no3 n concentrations but not nh4 n concentrations showed an additional peak between the tillering and panicle formation stage approximately 32 d after transplanting in both 2012 and 2013 which occurred on the day of re irrigation after drying of the paddy field in the sunshine nitrification is more common in aerobic conditions and dry fields provide such an aerobic soil environment resulting in increased no3 n concentrations a similar noticeable amount of no3 n was leached from soil when the soil water conditions were changed from drained to flooded xiong et al 2010 over time the increased no3 n concentration gradually declined reaching a stable level within 10 days when compared with the conventional flooding irrigation method the no3 n concentrations observed for the controlled irrigation method were slightly higher due to the significantly reduced irrigation volumes peng et al 2015 although in some cases the increases were not statistically significant in the leachates collected at 80 cm depth the no3 n concentrations were significantly reduced and showed a similar trend as the no3 n concentrations in the leachate collected at a 20 cm soil depth the changes in no3 n concentrations in all treatments tended to be similar in 2012 and 2013 3 3 ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen leaching losses considering that the groundwater is shallow in the research area with seasonal variation in the water table ranging from 1 to 3 m and that the crop root system coverage is less than 80 cm zhang and li 2009 zhang et al 2016 we used leachate collected at an 80 cm soil depth to evaluate nitrogen loss to calculate n leaching loss we multiplied the manually recorded drainage volumes by measured average n concentrations in the leachate at an 80 cm soil depth according to the method of he et al 2017 we found that the watering regime can significantly influenced nitrogen leaching the controlled irrigation method resulted in an increase in the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the leachate due to the lower water amount results in a higher n concentration even when the same amount of n was applied the increase in no3 n concentration was more pronounced when compared with the conventional flooding irrigation method table 4 the nitrogen loss to the groundwater at a depth of 80 cm was mainly in the form of no3 n which was present at 10 times higher levels than nh4 n this might also be related to the reduced water supply and the produced aerobic conditions that facilitated nitrification process xiong et al 2010 peng et al 2015 although the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in the leachates increased under controlled irrigation the actual amount of total nitrogen lost was reduced when taking the water leakage volume into account table 4 to summarize drainage is lower under controlled irrigation compared to traditional irrigation table s1 and the latter results in greater n leaching even if the n concentration of the water losses is lower than that measured from the controlled irrigation reducing the concentration of n fertilizer could significantly decrease the average total n concentration and the no3 n concentration in the leachate the nh4 n and no3 n leaching losses from the paddy fields were significantly lower when the controlled irrigation method was used and when reduced level of n were used in addition the nitrogen production efficiency and the water use efficiency were higher under controlled irrigation than under conventional flooding irrigation table 4 previous studies demonstrated that excessive standing water tends to result in oxygen deficiency at the soil surface and an increase in water loss through evaporation while reducing the photosynthetic and water use efficiency ye et al 2013 shao et al 2014 it is plausible that in anaerobic conditions less nitrate was uptaken less amount in soil solution and less was conveyed to the foliage for reduction and assimilation therefore increased water productivity was consistently observed in paddies subjected to controlled irrigation compared with those subjected to conventional flooding furthermore different level of n application also influenced the nitrogen production efficiency and the water use efficiency and the nitrogen production efficiency increased with the application of lower levels of n while water use efficiency decreased with the application of reduced levels of n table 4 an appropriate reduction in fertilizer application is an effective means of reducing nitrogen loss and improving the nitrogen production efficiency while reducing the water use efficiency due to improved grain yield ye et al 2013 taken together the nitrogen production efficiency and water use efficiency are affected by the concentration of n applied and the irrigation method used the dynamics of nh4 n and no3 n leaching losses the nitrogen production efficiency and the water use efficiency during different treatments showed similar tendencies in 2012 and 2013 these results confirmed that controlled irrigation increased the nitrogen production efficiency and water use efficiency and that reducing the level of n fertilizer also increased the nitrogen production efficiency while decreasing the water use efficiency among all the treatments evaluated the integrated practice combining controlled irrigation and 90 of the conventional level of nitrogen fertilizer application cin1 improved the yield while reducing n loss considering the low n sorption capacities in this typical sandy clay loam soil used in our study which is typical of that found in the taihu lake region shan et al 2005 we recommend using the cin1 practice for rice paddies in the taihu lake region 3 4 n2o emissions nitrous oxide is produced via the biogeochemical processes of nitrification and denitrification that are greatly influenced by the soil water status and the amount and timing of n sources applied ku et al 2017 the temporal variations in n2o fluxes are shown in fig 2 the timing of n source application could significantly influence n2o emissions significant increases in n2o emissions occurred directly after fertilizer application especially after basal fertilizer application before planting while the amount of fertilizer used did not significantly influence the quantity of n2o emissions the direct n2o emissions from paddy fields throughout the rice growing season depend greatly on nitrogen inputs and the water regimes used n2o emissions mostly decreased with reduced nitrogen applied and were higher under controlled irrigation than conventional flooding irrigation table s2 controlled irrigation increased the direct n2o emissions especially in 2013 this might due to the submerged treatment producing anaerobic conditions that promote the release of n gas as n2 khalil et al 2004 however n loss by the direct n2o emissions was less than 2 of the no3 n leaching losses confirming that leaching of no3 n was the main factor determining loss of n similarly a previous study of rice found that n losses were greater through n leaching than through direct n2o emissions zhao et al 2009 4 conclusions in summary based on data collected over two growing seasons we found that an integrated practice combining controlled irrigation with a 10 reduction in fertilizer application cin1 was the most effective method to ensure high grain yield while reducing the use of water and fertilizer the loss of n was mainly through leaching in the form no3 n and no3 n concentrations in the percolation water were higher than nh4 n concentrations and showed greater temporal variability reducing fertilizer application reduces nitrogen loss and improves the nitrogen production efficiency controlled irrigation could also reduce nitrogen leaching loss and increase the nitrogen production efficiency and water use efficiency while increasing the total n2o emissions therefore it is important to evaluate the integrative effects of water management and fertilizer application on greenhouse gas emissions and non point pollution in rice paddy fields other techniques such as deep urea placement large urea granules could offer alternatives for n economy compliance with ethical

11533,traditionally surface water supplies are the sole sources to satisfy crop water requirements in large irrigation schemes such as those in the fergana valley central asia recent studies indicate that 23 30 of these requirements are met from shallow groundwater but this is not usually quantified to manage favorable groundwater levels i e without increasing soil salinity and nutrient leaching and reducing crop yields information on and quantification of groundwater recharge and discharge rates at large spatial and temporal scales as well as understanding their mechanisms of interaction is indispensable with the aim to quantify groundwater recharge discharge and their interaction a conceptual water balance model at a scale of a water consumers association was established on a monthly basis for a 10 year period average groundwater recharge was estimated as 780 75 7 mm representing 62 of surface water supplies the highest average annual recharge 930 mm driven by excessive precipitation and water supply was in 2010 and the lowest 667 726 mm was in years of lower water availability 2006 2008 and 2012 the net groundwater recharge was 82 4 79 mm and determined the groundwater level fluctuations the highest positive net groundwater recharge rate 247 mm and the shallowest groundwater level 123 cm also occurred in 2010 the negative net recharge in 2006 11 mm 2008 41 mm and 2012 5 mm indicated deeper groundwater levels during these periods the groundwater recharge values were excessively high even for this large irrigation scheme to save limited freshwater resources groundwater discharge should be reduced with one option being to reduce excessive drainage outflow keywords groundwater recharge net groundwater recharge water balance crop water requirements 1 introduction groundwater is a critically important global water resource and it is intensively extracted at the rate of 982 km3 yr 1 margat and van der gun 2013 of which around 60 is used for agriculture and the rest for domestic and industrial uses vrba and van der gun 2004 around 38 of the irrigated areas worldwide have facilities for direct use of groundwater siebert et al 2010 in other areas capillary rise from shallow groundwater contributes around 20 25 to total crop water requirements awan et al 2014 ayars et al 2006 kahlown et al 2005 kazmi et al 2012 shallow groundwater within a few centimeters of the surface is however also a source of waterlogging and secondary soil salinization awan et al 2011a kahlown et al 2005 in many regions e g north africa arabian peninsula and south asia groundwater is intensively extracted at rates that have resulted in declines in groundwater levels awan and ismaeel 2015 george et al 2011 venot et al 2010 in the other areas the contribution from shallow groundwater to crop water requirements is not accounted for awan et al 2017 leading to freshwater over supply and eventual waterlogging hence appropriate groundwater management is a prerequisite for sustainable management of surface and groundwater resources in large irrigation schemes water from the amudarya and syrdarya rivers is a main source of irrigation in central asian countries and drainage and groundwater serve as a safety net during severe droughts fao 2001 in central asia such as in the fergana valley karimov et al 2014 and khorezm awan et al 2017 provinces of uzbekistan groundwater serves as a storage of water that infiltrates due to excessive water applications in agricultural fields and seepage from earthen irrigation networks the groundwater level reaches 1 3 m below the land surface during intensive irrigation and thus contributes to soil moisture enhancement through capillary rise due to uncertainty concerning timely surface water supplies farmers rely on shallow groundwater of low salinity by blocking field drains at the same time the ratio between drainage discharge and irrigation water supplies from agricultural fields in uzbekistan is extremely high for example awan et al 2011b reported that in khorezm province 55 of the surface water supply is drained out from the agricultural system much above the target value of 10 for large irrigation schemes bastiaanssen and bos 1999 this drainage discharge during cropping seasons in the central asian lowlands is unsustainably excessive simulation scenarios of future climate change using global circulation models showed that the surface water supplies in central asia will be reduced immerzeel et al 2012 due to reduced thickness of glaciers this may lead to conflicts concerning water sharing due to the transboundary nature of the flow of the main central asian rivers and the intensified competition for water among various sectors such as domestic water use agriculture industry and the environment therefore changes in surface water supply will impact recharge and thus discharge rates in turn under maintained high drainage discharge rates lower groundwater levels will contribute less to crop water requirements forcing farmers to utilize more surface water for irrigation tischbein et al 2013 it is thus a prerequisite to better understand the interaction between the surface and groundwater resources to develop a groundwater management policy that will not only consider the recharge into but also the discharge from the groundwater reservoir various methods of estimating groundwater recharge and discharge have been developed the groundwater recharge methods vary from the small field scale to large irrigation schemes and from simple water balance estimations scanlon et al 2002 to complex recharge models awan et al 2013 beekman et al 1999 lerner et al 1990 massuel et al 2013 sylvain et al 2014 it is necessary to choose a groundwater recharge estimation method based on appropriate spatial and temporal scales and to account for the range and reliability of the method scanlon et al 2002 in the current study the traditional root zone water balance method based on the concept of estimating the incoming and outgoing components and changes within the soil profile was chosen for its simplicity and ease of capturing real field conditions this method in combination with groundwater modeling has been used in the irrigated areas of the indus basin to simulate groundwater flow and so predict changes in groundwater levels in response to intervention scenarios in irrigation practices sarwar and eggers 2006 maréchal et al 2006 used the water balance method to estimate specific yield and groundwater recharge in an unconfined aquifer with significant seasonal fluctuations in the water table they noted that the method has the advantage of estimating these parameters at the scale of interest without the need for extensive data and measurements yin et al 2011 applied three methods to estimate groundwater recharge including the water balance method and concluded that each method had inherent uncertainty the water balance method is easy to apply inexpensive and produces low estimation errors implementing it requires data that are easy to collect discharge can be estimated by measuring field level drainage discharge or groundwater abstraction from tube wells estimating upward flux is another way of measuring groundwater discharge the groundwater abstraction can also be estimated using remote sensing techniques awan et al 2016 the objectives of this work were to quantify groundwater recharge discharge and net groundwater recharge recharge minus discharge at a water consumers association wca level the irrigated areas of the fergana valley in uzbekistan were chosen for this study and analyses were conducted on a monthly basis for the period 2004 2011 policymakers in the region can use this knowledge to manage the surface and groundwater resources in a sustainable way under changing climate situations 2 materials and methods the study area for this research is a typical environmental setting in fergana valley with low precipitation and hence frequent irrigation applications shallow groundwater levels and massive irrigation and drainage networks the activities included obtaining datasets of irrigation water supplies and drainage discharge climate and cropping patterns to construct a water balance model components of the water balance such as actual crop specific evapotranspiration net groundwater inflow and outflow including capillary rise from groundwater into the vadose zone were estimated using secondary data obtained from official agencies 2 1 research area and environmental setting the fergana valley in central asia is situated within 40 15 41 50 n and 70 30 73 15 e in uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and is 22 km2 in size fig 1 agriculture occupies approximately 40 of the area and most of this lies in uzbekistan due to the arid to semiarid climate with long term potential evapotranspiration of 1133 1294 mm and precipitation of 109 502 mm 1972 2010 all agricultural crops are irrigated with surface water diverted from the syrdarya river large scale irrigation schemes were constructed during the soviet era to provide irrigation water to all agricultural areas according to the official meteorological data from the hydrometeorological organization uzbekistan uzhydromet the average annual temperature in the fergana valley is 13 1 c ranging from 8 c to 3 c in january and from 17 c to 36 c in july fig 2 cropping is dominated by cotton and winter wheat which occupy more than 80 of the irrigated areas annually and orchards and vegetables are grown in the rest of the area abdullaev et al 2009 surface and subsurface drainage networks are used to lower the groundwater levels and to regulate the air moisture balance within the soil root zone furrow irrigation is the sole water application method used for crops the water application efficiency is approximately 43 awan et al 2011b and is the main cause of groundwater level rises tischbein et al 2012 according to the state hydrogeological amelioration expedition in uzbekistan groundwater levels are generally within 1 3 m of the soil surface during cropping seasons detailed data on groundwater depth and other pertinent information were collected from the oktepa zilol chashmasi water consumers association wca in the fergana province of uzbekistan the wca s total area is 1946 ha of which 1438 ha are irrigated fig 1 mapping of the hydrogeological zones was carried out by the institute of hydrology and engineering geology mirzaev 1974 analysis of the zoning indicated existence of three areas in the fergana valley a natural groundwater recharge zone mainly along the river pathways spring discharge zone and dispersion zone with discharge to drains karimov et al 2010 the oktepa zilol chashmasi wca is located in the groundwater dispersion zone this zone is characterized by a limited transmissivity and groundwater levels are controlled by drainage networks groundwater recharge groundwater discharge and net groundwater recharge was estimated in this study groundwater recharge includes the amount of water entering in the groundwater aquifer after satisfying the crop water requirements and soil moisture storage groundwater discharge in the wca occurs mainly by outflow through the drains and upward fluxes capillary rise the difference between groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge is considered as the net groundwater recharge the methods used to estimate the groundwater recharge and discharge is explained in section 2 2 and 2 3 whereas net groundwater recharge was taken as simply a difference between groundwater recharge and discharge 2 2 groundwater recharge estimation by a conceptual water balance model a conceptual root zone water balance model was established for the oktepa zilol chashmasi wca in general a water balance model accounts for the changes in water flow in and out of the area under consideration including changes in soil moisture storage using the water balance method groundwater recharge is estimated by the following formula 1 groundwater recharge gross irrigation r cr gwin etc gwout where r is effective precipitation cr is capillary rise from groundwater into a vadose zone gwin and gwout lateral volumes of subsurface flow in and out of the area respectively and etc is actual crop evapotranspiration all components are in mm per unit time the water balance model was adapted to the real situation mirzaev 1974 reported that vertical groundwater flow prevailed in this region and so lateral flow inside or outside of the area could be neglected therefore as eq 1 shows the groundwater recharge thus is k times the inflow minus outflow from the root zone the k denotes the change in soil moisture storage which awan et al 2013 found to be 90 thus the final equation for estimating recharge will be 2 groundwater recharge gross irrigation r cr etc k following schematic diagram shows the groundwater recharge and discharge phenomenon 2 2 1 estimating gross irrigation amounts of irrigation water supply at the head of each canal gross irrigation were cumulated on a 10 d basis by the local irrigation management organization of the oktepa zilol chashmasi wca the outflowing water amounts were subtracted from these measurements 2 2 2 crop specific evapotranspiration and effective precipitation crop specific evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration for different crops was estimated using the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 effective precipitation brouwer and heibloem 1986 relative humidity air temperature wind speed and solar radiation data were obtained from the hydrometeorological department situated in the kuva district of fergana province wind speed is traditionally measured at a height of 10 12 m and these readings were converted into 2 m values according to fao 56 methodology the etc was estimated in this study for the typical cropping patterns in all provinces of uzbekistan consisting of a cotton winter wheat rotation followed by maize and vegetables the values for the physiological variables of these crops were taken from previous studies and included crop height crop coefficients and root depth the major crops cultivated in the study area are upland cotton gossypium hirsutum which is usually planted during the first 10 days of april and harvested in mid september followed by winter wheat planted in the first 10 days of october and harvested in mid or late june the typical rooting depths of cotton and wheat varieties are approximately 100 and 90 cm respectively both crops develop extensive aboveground biomass the crop coefficient values of these crops were obtained from studies of the scientific production association saniiri of uzbekistan 2 2 3 capillary rise capillary rise is another important factor affecting groundwater recharge in conditions of shallow groundwater and prevailing etc exceeding precipitation upward moisture movement from groundwater into the soil root zone is high the values of capillary rise were obtained from the studies of awan et al 2017 conducted in the same region the upward capillary flux took place during april september and became negligible in october when etc rates were substantially reduced and groundwater levels declined fig 3 massive irrigation events reduce capillary rise which increases again during the period between irrigations 2 3 groundwater discharge the discharge from groundwater in fergana valley defined in eq 1 as gwout occurs by outflow from the drainage system through a huge network of surface drains the data on drainage outflow were obtained from the hydrogeological melioration expedition which measures drainage flow within the individual surface collector drains the difference in the drainage volumes generated within and outflow from the area gives the estimation of the approximate volume of the drainage discharge the other parameter for groundwater discharge is capillary rise contribution the data for drainage outflows and capillary rise contribution were used in eq 3 to estimate groundwater discharge 3 groundwater discharge drainage outflow cr 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of groundwater recharge over the study period the average annual groundwater recharge constituted 780 75 7 mm or 62 of the average gross irrigation water supply these groundwater recharge values are similar to the estimates of abdullaev et al 2009 for the environmental and management settings of the fergana valley the highest groundwater recharge was during 2010 930 mm due mainly to excessive precipitation and gross irrigation and the lowest recharge was in 2006 2008 667 726 mm and 2012 685 mm because of lower water availability in these years fig 4 this interrelation between the groundwater recharge and gross irrigation water supply indicates that recharge strongly depends on water supplies through the irrigation networks the monthly variation of recharge during the last 10 year period showed that the recharge was at a maximum during the cropping season april september mainly because of elevated water losses from the irrigation scheme depleted fraction of 0 4 the value of the depleted fraction is approximately 30 lower compared with the target fraction and these water losses recharge the groundwater aquifer fig 4 3 2 yearly groundwater recharge versus groundwater levels during 2003 2014 over the study years the average groundwater levels measured as distance from ground level changed following the recharge rates r2 0 74 fig 5 the groundwater levels were deeper during the drought years 2006 2008 and 2012 and shallower during years when water was ample 2010 the average groundwater levels in the oktepa zilol chashmasi wca were 159 16 cm below the surface shallowest during cropping seasons and deeper at other times the recharge into groundwater also closely followed the annual water availability increasing in years with ample water 2010 and decreasing in years with low water 2006 2008 and 2012 fig 5 3 3 average monthly groundwater recharge versus groundwater levels during 2003 2014 the effect of long term monthly average groundwater recharge rates on groundwater levels is shown in fig 6 as expected the recharge rates increased during irrigation periods and led to groundwater becoming shallower during may september the monthly average groundwater recharge was 99 24 mm mainly as surplus freshwater that recharged the aquifer the recharge rates were lowest during october february and increased following a pre season leaching period i e washing salts out of the root zone by applying large volumes of water before the period of crop irrigation the increase in recharge from 25 mm in january to 127 mm in july caused a groundwater level rise from 172 to 155 cm below the surface these results indicate that elevated recharge rates during the leaching and irrigation periods were the main reasons for the groundwater level rise 3 4 variation of yearly groundwater discharge during 2003 2014 during the study period the estimated average groundwater discharge yearly was 701 59 mm with the highest values of 705 mm in 2005 and 708 mm in 2008 and the lowest of 684 mm in 2004 and 683 mm in 2010 fig 7 on average 45 mm 7 of groundwater was discharged with drainage during leaching periods high groundwater discharge rates of 570 mm 81 were observed during the cropping periods part of this discharge was replenishment of soil moisture through capillary rise the lowest discharge occurred in 2010 683 mm and 2004 684 mm and the highest in 2008 708 mm awan et al 2011b reported that the ratio of groundwater discharge through the drainage system was 55 in a properly functioning and well designed irrigation scheme the drainage outflow should not exceed 10 of the surface water supply bastiaanssen and bos 1999 excessive outflow with drainage keeps the groundwater levels below unacceptably critical levels during cropping periods 3 5 monthly variation of net groundwater recharge during 2003 2014 the pattern of monthly net groundwater recharge defined as the difference between the recharge and discharge rates was similar throughout the study years despite differences in actual recharge values fig 8 the net recharge values were positive in all months except during june september this period was characterized by high upward capillary fluxes following peak crop moisture demand thus resulting in negative net recharge rates the maximum net recharge took place in the leaching periods november march excessive irrigation to leach the salts during these months the applied volumes of water exceeded actual evapotranspiration the downward water movement with surface water for irrigation leaching and precipitation caused the downward infiltration and hence positive net recharge outside the irrigation and precipitation events the downward infiltration ceased and high evaporative demand resulted in upward capillary flux and negative net recharge the positive peak net recharge which fed the groundwater aquifer occurred during april may with rates of 85 2 1 mm in the leaching period the long term average net recharge was estimated as 101 4 2 mm on an inter annual basis the highest average monthly net recharge of 58 3 mm occurred during april july 2010 because of the high water application rates for irrigation and elevated precipitation 3 6 annual net groundwater recharge vs groundwater levels during the study period the annual average net groundwater recharge was 82 4 79 mm the net recharge dictated the changes in groundwater levels fig 9 which varied substantially and fluctuated within the range from 182 cm in 2006 123 cm in 2010 the highest positive net groundwater recharge rate of 247 mm was in 2010 and was followed by the shallowest groundwater levels 123 cm the net groundwater recharge was negative in 2006 11 mm 2008 41 mm and 2012 5 mm indicating that groundwater levels were deeper during these periods 4 conclusion irrigated agriculture exerts high pressure on central asian surface water resources which are virtually fully utilized in the fergana valley the shallow groundwater is hydrologically connected to surface water resources high groundwater recharge during the irrigation season raises the groundwater level close to the drainage depth the surplus groundwater recharge is drained into the extensive drainage system the irrigation to drainage ratio is around 55 whereas the groundwater recharge is 40 higher than the crop water requirements analysis of the last ten years of data showed hardly any differences in groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge quantification of the surface water groundwater relationship indicated a high groundwater recharge of 62 from the total surface water supply and the groundwater discharge was 701 59 mm although there was significant variation in groundwater levels under existing conditions groundwater rose to 1 m during the vegetation season and dropped to 3 m below the surface at other times however groundwater levels depended largely on surface water supplies any reduction in canal water supplies may strongly influence the groundwater recharge and discharge and eventually groundwater levels quantification of groundwater recharge and discharge for the last ten years provides baselines for water managers in the region to consider the correlation between the two resources and hence provide alternative strategies to cope with future water scarcity acknowledgements the international center for agricultural research receives financial support from the cgiar research program on water land and ecosystems wle which was used to support this study 
11533,traditionally surface water supplies are the sole sources to satisfy crop water requirements in large irrigation schemes such as those in the fergana valley central asia recent studies indicate that 23 30 of these requirements are met from shallow groundwater but this is not usually quantified to manage favorable groundwater levels i e without increasing soil salinity and nutrient leaching and reducing crop yields information on and quantification of groundwater recharge and discharge rates at large spatial and temporal scales as well as understanding their mechanisms of interaction is indispensable with the aim to quantify groundwater recharge discharge and their interaction a conceptual water balance model at a scale of a water consumers association was established on a monthly basis for a 10 year period average groundwater recharge was estimated as 780 75 7 mm representing 62 of surface water supplies the highest average annual recharge 930 mm driven by excessive precipitation and water supply was in 2010 and the lowest 667 726 mm was in years of lower water availability 2006 2008 and 2012 the net groundwater recharge was 82 4 79 mm and determined the groundwater level fluctuations the highest positive net groundwater recharge rate 247 mm and the shallowest groundwater level 123 cm also occurred in 2010 the negative net recharge in 2006 11 mm 2008 41 mm and 2012 5 mm indicated deeper groundwater levels during these periods the groundwater recharge values were excessively high even for this large irrigation scheme to save limited freshwater resources groundwater discharge should be reduced with one option being to reduce excessive drainage outflow keywords groundwater recharge net groundwater recharge water balance crop water requirements 1 introduction groundwater is a critically important global water resource and it is intensively extracted at the rate of 982 km3 yr 1 margat and van der gun 2013 of which around 60 is used for agriculture and the rest for domestic and industrial uses vrba and van der gun 2004 around 38 of the irrigated areas worldwide have facilities for direct use of groundwater siebert et al 2010 in other areas capillary rise from shallow groundwater contributes around 20 25 to total crop water requirements awan et al 2014 ayars et al 2006 kahlown et al 2005 kazmi et al 2012 shallow groundwater within a few centimeters of the surface is however also a source of waterlogging and secondary soil salinization awan et al 2011a kahlown et al 2005 in many regions e g north africa arabian peninsula and south asia groundwater is intensively extracted at rates that have resulted in declines in groundwater levels awan and ismaeel 2015 george et al 2011 venot et al 2010 in the other areas the contribution from shallow groundwater to crop water requirements is not accounted for awan et al 2017 leading to freshwater over supply and eventual waterlogging hence appropriate groundwater management is a prerequisite for sustainable management of surface and groundwater resources in large irrigation schemes water from the amudarya and syrdarya rivers is a main source of irrigation in central asian countries and drainage and groundwater serve as a safety net during severe droughts fao 2001 in central asia such as in the fergana valley karimov et al 2014 and khorezm awan et al 2017 provinces of uzbekistan groundwater serves as a storage of water that infiltrates due to excessive water applications in agricultural fields and seepage from earthen irrigation networks the groundwater level reaches 1 3 m below the land surface during intensive irrigation and thus contributes to soil moisture enhancement through capillary rise due to uncertainty concerning timely surface water supplies farmers rely on shallow groundwater of low salinity by blocking field drains at the same time the ratio between drainage discharge and irrigation water supplies from agricultural fields in uzbekistan is extremely high for example awan et al 2011b reported that in khorezm province 55 of the surface water supply is drained out from the agricultural system much above the target value of 10 for large irrigation schemes bastiaanssen and bos 1999 this drainage discharge during cropping seasons in the central asian lowlands is unsustainably excessive simulation scenarios of future climate change using global circulation models showed that the surface water supplies in central asia will be reduced immerzeel et al 2012 due to reduced thickness of glaciers this may lead to conflicts concerning water sharing due to the transboundary nature of the flow of the main central asian rivers and the intensified competition for water among various sectors such as domestic water use agriculture industry and the environment therefore changes in surface water supply will impact recharge and thus discharge rates in turn under maintained high drainage discharge rates lower groundwater levels will contribute less to crop water requirements forcing farmers to utilize more surface water for irrigation tischbein et al 2013 it is thus a prerequisite to better understand the interaction between the surface and groundwater resources to develop a groundwater management policy that will not only consider the recharge into but also the discharge from the groundwater reservoir various methods of estimating groundwater recharge and discharge have been developed the groundwater recharge methods vary from the small field scale to large irrigation schemes and from simple water balance estimations scanlon et al 2002 to complex recharge models awan et al 2013 beekman et al 1999 lerner et al 1990 massuel et al 2013 sylvain et al 2014 it is necessary to choose a groundwater recharge estimation method based on appropriate spatial and temporal scales and to account for the range and reliability of the method scanlon et al 2002 in the current study the traditional root zone water balance method based on the concept of estimating the incoming and outgoing components and changes within the soil profile was chosen for its simplicity and ease of capturing real field conditions this method in combination with groundwater modeling has been used in the irrigated areas of the indus basin to simulate groundwater flow and so predict changes in groundwater levels in response to intervention scenarios in irrigation practices sarwar and eggers 2006 maréchal et al 2006 used the water balance method to estimate specific yield and groundwater recharge in an unconfined aquifer with significant seasonal fluctuations in the water table they noted that the method has the advantage of estimating these parameters at the scale of interest without the need for extensive data and measurements yin et al 2011 applied three methods to estimate groundwater recharge including the water balance method and concluded that each method had inherent uncertainty the water balance method is easy to apply inexpensive and produces low estimation errors implementing it requires data that are easy to collect discharge can be estimated by measuring field level drainage discharge or groundwater abstraction from tube wells estimating upward flux is another way of measuring groundwater discharge the groundwater abstraction can also be estimated using remote sensing techniques awan et al 2016 the objectives of this work were to quantify groundwater recharge discharge and net groundwater recharge recharge minus discharge at a water consumers association wca level the irrigated areas of the fergana valley in uzbekistan were chosen for this study and analyses were conducted on a monthly basis for the period 2004 2011 policymakers in the region can use this knowledge to manage the surface and groundwater resources in a sustainable way under changing climate situations 2 materials and methods the study area for this research is a typical environmental setting in fergana valley with low precipitation and hence frequent irrigation applications shallow groundwater levels and massive irrigation and drainage networks the activities included obtaining datasets of irrigation water supplies and drainage discharge climate and cropping patterns to construct a water balance model components of the water balance such as actual crop specific evapotranspiration net groundwater inflow and outflow including capillary rise from groundwater into the vadose zone were estimated using secondary data obtained from official agencies 2 1 research area and environmental setting the fergana valley in central asia is situated within 40 15 41 50 n and 70 30 73 15 e in uzbekistan kyrgyzstan and tajikistan and is 22 km2 in size fig 1 agriculture occupies approximately 40 of the area and most of this lies in uzbekistan due to the arid to semiarid climate with long term potential evapotranspiration of 1133 1294 mm and precipitation of 109 502 mm 1972 2010 all agricultural crops are irrigated with surface water diverted from the syrdarya river large scale irrigation schemes were constructed during the soviet era to provide irrigation water to all agricultural areas according to the official meteorological data from the hydrometeorological organization uzbekistan uzhydromet the average annual temperature in the fergana valley is 13 1 c ranging from 8 c to 3 c in january and from 17 c to 36 c in july fig 2 cropping is dominated by cotton and winter wheat which occupy more than 80 of the irrigated areas annually and orchards and vegetables are grown in the rest of the area abdullaev et al 2009 surface and subsurface drainage networks are used to lower the groundwater levels and to regulate the air moisture balance within the soil root zone furrow irrigation is the sole water application method used for crops the water application efficiency is approximately 43 awan et al 2011b and is the main cause of groundwater level rises tischbein et al 2012 according to the state hydrogeological amelioration expedition in uzbekistan groundwater levels are generally within 1 3 m of the soil surface during cropping seasons detailed data on groundwater depth and other pertinent information were collected from the oktepa zilol chashmasi water consumers association wca in the fergana province of uzbekistan the wca s total area is 1946 ha of which 1438 ha are irrigated fig 1 mapping of the hydrogeological zones was carried out by the institute of hydrology and engineering geology mirzaev 1974 analysis of the zoning indicated existence of three areas in the fergana valley a natural groundwater recharge zone mainly along the river pathways spring discharge zone and dispersion zone with discharge to drains karimov et al 2010 the oktepa zilol chashmasi wca is located in the groundwater dispersion zone this zone is characterized by a limited transmissivity and groundwater levels are controlled by drainage networks groundwater recharge groundwater discharge and net groundwater recharge was estimated in this study groundwater recharge includes the amount of water entering in the groundwater aquifer after satisfying the crop water requirements and soil moisture storage groundwater discharge in the wca occurs mainly by outflow through the drains and upward fluxes capillary rise the difference between groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge is considered as the net groundwater recharge the methods used to estimate the groundwater recharge and discharge is explained in section 2 2 and 2 3 whereas net groundwater recharge was taken as simply a difference between groundwater recharge and discharge 2 2 groundwater recharge estimation by a conceptual water balance model a conceptual root zone water balance model was established for the oktepa zilol chashmasi wca in general a water balance model accounts for the changes in water flow in and out of the area under consideration including changes in soil moisture storage using the water balance method groundwater recharge is estimated by the following formula 1 groundwater recharge gross irrigation r cr gwin etc

actual crop evapotranspiration all components are in mm per unit time the water balance model was adapted to the real situation mirzaev 1974 reported that vertical groundwater flow prevailed in this region and so lateral flow inside or outside of the area could be neglected therefore as eq 1 shows the groundwater recharge thus is k times the inflow minus outflow from the root zone the k denotes the change in soil moisture storage which awan et al 2013 found to be 90 thus the final equation for estimating recharge will be 2 groundwater recharge gross irrigation r cr etc k following schematic

april and harvested in mid september followed by winter wheat planted in the first 10 days of october and harvested in mid or late june the typical rooting depths of cotton and wheat varieties are approximately 100 and 90 cm respectively both crops develop extensive aboveground biomass the crop coefficient values of these crops were obtained from studies of the scientific production association

capillary rise which increases again during the period between irrigations 2 3 groundwater discharge the discharge from groundwater in fergana valley defined in eq 1 as gwout occurs by outflow from the drainage system through a huge network of surface drains the data on drainage outflow were obtained from the hydrogeological melioration expedition which measures drainage flow within the individual surface collector drains the difference in the drainage volumes generated within and outflow from the area gives the estimation of the approximate volume of the drainage discharge the other parameter for groundwater discharge is capillary rise contribution the data for drainage outflows and capillary rise contribution were used in eq 3 to estimate groundwater discharge 3 groundwater discharge drainage outflow cr 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamics of groundwater recharge over the study period the average annual groundwater recharge constituted 780 75 7 mm or 62 of the average gross irrigation water supply these groundwater recharge values are similar to the estimates of abdullaev et al 2009 for the environmental and management settings of the fergana valley the highest groundwater recharge was during 2010 930 mm due mainly to excessive precipitation and gross irrigation and the lowest recharge was in 2006 2008 667 726 mm and 2012 685 mm because of lower water availability in these years fig 4 this interrelation between the groundwater recharge and gross irrigation water supply indicates that recharge strongly depends on water supplies through the irrigation networks the monthly variation of recharge during the last 10 year period showed that the recharge was at a maximum during the cropping season april september mainly because of elevated water losses from the irrigation scheme depleted fraction of 0 4 the value of the depleted fraction is approximately 30 lower compared with the target fraction and these water losses recharge the groundwater aquifer fig 4 3 2 yearly groundwater recharge versus groundwater levels during 2003 2014 over the study years the average groundwater levels measured as distance from ground level changed following the recharge rates r2 0 74 fig 5 the groundwater levels were deeper during the drought years 2006 2008 and 2012 and shallower during years when water was ample 2010 the average groundwater levels in the oktepa zilol chashmasi wca were 159 16 cm below the surface shallowest during cropping seasons and deeper at other times the recharge into groundwater also closely followed the annual water availability increasing in years with ample water 2010 and decreasing in years with low water 2006 2008 and 2012 fig 5 3 3 average monthly groundwater recharge versus groundwater levels during 2003 2014 the effect of long term monthly average groundwater recharge rates on groundwater levels is shown in fig 6 as expected the recharge rates increased during irrigation periods and led to groundwater becoming shallower during may september the monthly average groundwater recharge was 99 24 mm mainly as surplus freshwater that recharged the aquifer the recharge rates were lowest during october february and increased following a pre season leaching period i e washing salts out of the root zone by applying large volumes of water before the period of crop irrigation the increase in recharge from 25 mm in january to 127 mm in july caused a groundwater level rise from 172 to 155 cm below the surface these results indicate that elevated recharge rates during the leaching and irrigation periods were the main reasons for the groundwater level rise 3 4 variation of yearly groundwater discharge during 2003 2014 during the study period the estimated average groundwater discharge yearly was 701 59 mm with the highest values of 705 mm in 2005 and 708 mm in 2008 and the lowest of 684 mm in 2004 and 683 mm in 2010 fig 7 on average 45 mm 7 of groundwater was discharged with drainage during leaching periods high groundwater discharge rates of 570 mm 81 were observed during the cropping periods part of this discharge was replenishment of soil moisture through capillary rise the lowest discharge occurred in 2010 683 mm and 2004 684 mm and the highest in 2008 708 mm awan et al 2011b reported that the ratio of groundwater discharge through the drainage system was 55 in a properly functioning and well designed irrigation scheme the drainage outflow should not exceed 10 of the surface water supply bastiaanssen and bos 1999 excessive outflow with drainage keeps the groundwater levels below unacceptably critical levels during cropping periods 3 5 monthly variation of net groundwater recharge during 2003 2014 the pattern of monthly net groundwater recharge defined as the difference between the recharge and discharge rates was similar throughout the study years despite differences in actual recharge values fig 8 the net recharge values were positive in all months except during june september this period was characterized by high upward capillary fluxes following peak crop moisture demand thus resulting in negative net recharge rates the maximum net recharge took place in the leaching periods november march excessive irrigation to leach the salts during these months the applied volumes of water exceeded actual evapotranspiration the downward water movement with surface water for irrigation leaching and precipitation caused the downward infiltration and hence positive net recharge outside the irrigation and precipitation events the downward infiltration ceased and high evaporative demand resulted in upward capillary flux and negative net recharge the positive peak net recharge which fed the groundwater aquifer occurred during april may with rates of 85 2 1 mm in the leaching period the long term average net recharge was estimated as 101 4 2 mm on an inter annual basis the highest average monthly net recharge of 58 3 mm occurred during april july 2010 because of the high water application rates for irrigation and elevated precipitation 3 6 annual net groundwater recharge vs groundwater levels during the study

negative in 2006 11 mm 2008 41 mm and 2012 5 mm indicating that groundwater levels were deeper during these periods 4 conclusion irrigated agriculture exerts high pressure on central asian surface

11534,kinetic energy of droplets from big gun sprinklers relates closely to the infiltration process and soil erosion as well as severely affects the energy consumption of hose drawn travelers however research work related to the kinetic energy distribution of big gun sprinklers is seldom performed in this study the radial water application distribution droplet size distribution and droplet velocity distribution of a big gun sprinkler were measured based on the experimental data a calculation method was developed to determine the kinetic energy of big gun sprinkler under stationary and moving states volume weighted mean particle size and the corresponding equivalent landing velocity were adopted as the feature size and velocity of the point located at any distance from the sprinkler the droplets landing velocities present a logarithmic relationship with droplet size and velocities rise with the increase of droplet size the operating pressure should not be lower than 0 2 mpa since the peak value of specific power will rise rapidly below this operating pressure for positions receiving the same kinetic energy obvious difference may exist in the amount of water and the dynamic process curves of specific power with the increase in travel speed of the hose drawn traveler both the cumulative kinetic energy and the irrigation duration decrease proportionally compared to the spray plate sprinklers applied to center pivots the big gun sprinkler shows a milder precipitation process but the water application lasts longer and carries more kinetic energy reaching 2 4 times for the same amount of water the infiltration rate of each location decreases linearly along with an increase in distance to the travel lane and the infiltration rate decreases to approximately 20 mm h at the end of the spraying area keywords high volume sprinkler specific power radial distribution cumulative kinetic energy working condition 1 introduction big gun sprinklers possess features of large flow rates wide wetted diameters and they have been used in combination with both hose drawn travelers and center pivot systems the hose drawn traveler has the advantages of having a relatively large control area low investment per unit area and great mobility while also being adaptable to different soil types silva et al 2007 however this continuously moving irrigator also presents disadvantages such as high input pressure low distribution uniformity as well as large droplets and large application rates keller and bliesner 1990 the relatively large amount of kinetic energy carried by the water which strikes the young crops and topsoil may damage the crop canopy and cause soil compaction despite the severity of these disadvantages little work has been done to develop improvement strategies specially related to the kinetic energy distribution of the big gun sprinkler kinetic energy contained in droplets as they compact the soil surface affects both the water infiltration processes and soil erosion kincaid 1996 there is a strong correlation between the kinetic energy of water droplets and the change in physical properties of the surface soil thompson and james 1985 analyzed the increase in hydraulic resistance of the soil surface layer as the drop kinetic energy per unit soil surface area also increased mohammed and kohl 1987 found that droplet kinetic energy had a significant influence on the formation of surface seals and times to runoff the infiltration rates on a loam soil were found to decrease rapidly as water was applied with increased kinetic energy agassi et al 1994 noted that the final infiltration rate decreased exponentially with an increase of drop kinetic energy yan s 2011 work also indicated that infiltration rate was inversely proportional to drop kinetic energy raindrop impact is the key mechanism for disaggregating and mobilizing soil particles however it depends on the kinetic energy of raindrops angulo martínez and barros 2015 decreasing rainfall impact energy by 89 without reducing rainfall intensity decreased soil losses by 90 or more young and wiersma 1973 kinetic energy was identified as the greatest contributor to erosivity morgan 1995 shin et al 2015 thus kinetic energy is an important indicator of sprinkler irrigation quality kinetic energy of sprinkler water was determined by drop characterization which refers to the statistical determination of static and dynamic properties of the drops properties such as droplet diameter and droplet velocity bautista capetillo et al 2012 a significant amount of research has been performed related to the distribution of droplet diameters and velocities for sprinkler irrigation kohl 1974 li et al 1994 kincaid 1996 kincaid et al 1996 king and bjorneberg 2010 bautista capetillo et al 2012 ge et al 2016 however most of the research objects were confined to fixed spray plate sprinklers king and bjorneberg 2010 yan et al 2011 ouazaa et al 2014 rotating spray plate sprinklers kohl and deboer 1990 deboer and monnens 2001 deboer 2002 or middle sized impact sprinklers stillmunkes and james 1982 sanchez et al 2011 stambouli et al 2014 studies conducted with big gun sprinklers that include work with high flow rates greater than 5ls 1 were found to be uncommon sheikhesmaeili et al 2016 even though big gun sprinklers have a wide variety of applications in agriculture and industry and are being more commonly used for field crop irrigation in china the kinetic energy of big gun sprinklers is also closely related to the energy consumption of the hose drawn traveler due to its relationship with operating pressure kohl et al 1985 reported that a reduction of operating pressure leads to an increase in kinetic energy per unit volume of discharged water similar results have been obtained by basahi 1998 when determining the specific power of experimental water drops impacting a surface high energy consumption is an accepted shortcoming of the hose drawn traveler due to the high operating pressure of a big gun sprinkler sheikhesmaeili et al 2016 noted that an increase of pressure from 0 45 mpa to 0 5 mpa supposes an increase of energy cost of 18 therefore reducing operating pressure slightly can significantly bring down the operating cost martínez et al 2004 thus the distribution of kinetic energy can be used in determining a reasonable operating pressure of a big gun sprinkler this can help to avoid centralized distribution of kinetic energy due to low operating pressure while also lowering the system energy consumption by reducing the operating pressure reasonably information of big gun sprinklers provided by the manufactures however is restricted to basic parameters such as available operating pressure ranges and flow rates which does not offer information related to the kinetic energy distribution this study aims to put forward a calculation method for determining the kinetic energy of a big gun sprinkler under stationary and moving conditions this method will also be used to provide guidance for the management and operation of hose drawn travelers for field irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 solid set sprinkler test the test was performed in northwest china yangling central part of the shaanxi province 108 4 28 e and 34 16 56 n this region is characterized by a temperate continental climate with an altitude of 521 m and an annual frost free period of 210 days water was supplied from a hydrant in the field was then delivered to a variable frequency pump via pvc pipe to regulate the working pressure of the sprinkler a big gun 50 pyc vertical impact sprinkler made by tianshui corp jiangsu china was adopted for the experimental test and the sprinkler nozzle was 20 mm in diameter in order to obtain the spray characteristic under low operating pressure the operating pressure tested in this study ranges from 0 1 mpa to 0 45 mpa with the minimum working pressure lower than the operating pressure recommended by the manufacturer and with the corresponding flow rate range being 13 4 43 8m3h 1 the sprinkler was placed 1 7 m above the ground and the trajectory angle of the spray jet was 24 a cyb13i pressure transmitter produced by xi an xinmin electronics co ltd range 0 1 mpa accuracy of 0 1 the output signal is 4 20 ma was situated 0 2 m under the nozzle flow rates were measured via an emf5000 electronic flow meter range 0 60 m3 h three lines of catch cans were installed in the radial direction of the spray jet to measure radial water distribution faci et al 2001 with 25 catch cans in each line and 2 m spacing distance between each catch can the catch cans used in the test were plastic cylinder barrels with a height of 25 7 cm and with inner and outer diameters of 15 2 and 17 cm respectively the duration of each test was one hour and the weight of water in each catch can was recorded immediately after each test to reduce error due to water evaporation edling and chowdhury 1985 playán et al 2005 the testing procedure followed complied with the standard asae s398 1 2001 a two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd produced by joanneum research corp austria was used to measure the droplet size and velocities two vertically disposed ccd cameras inside the instrument make linear scans of droplets passing through the test area and record the precipitation rate individual drop size and the vertical and horizontal velocity components schönhuber et al 2000 seginer et al 2001 huang et al 2008 the test accuracy of drop size is 0 19 mm and the measuring scope is 100 mm 100 mm the 2dvd was placed along the radial direction of water jet with 2 m spacing distance and with each test measurement lasting 3 min in order to facilitate the movement of the 2dvd between different measuring points the original fixed bracket of the 2dvd was replaced by a modified frame equipped with four universal wheels as shown in fig 1 the operating pressures of the big gun sprinkler were 150 250 350 and 450 kpa during the drop size and velocity test 2 2 radial water distribution some simplifications of the radial water distribution patterns of the sprinkler had been made according to the single leg test data prado et al 2012 martín benito et al 2014 simplifications such as elliptical shapes triangular shapes and torus shapes however the water distribution patterns are always irregular and distortion of the patterns occurs with the variation of operating pressure simplified shapes may lead to considerable calculation error in this study the radial water distribution curve under different working conditions was obtained by polynomial fitting using the least squares method in order to form a more realistic reflection of the radial water distribution the fitting function can be expressed as eq 1 1 p d a i d i 0 d r 0 d r where d is the distance from the measuring point to the sprinkler in meters p d is the sprayed droplet intensity in mm h ai is the fitting coefficient for the water distribution curve i 0 1 2 6 2 3 radial drop size and drop velocity 2 3 1 drop size the two orthogonal projections provided by the line scan cameras of the 2dvd in principle provide the three dimensional raindrop shape information which allows the computation of the drop volume and equivalent drop diameter kruger and krajewski 2002 droplets at each point are composed by a clear distribution of range in size ge et al 2016 and an average diameter is required for the characteristic size at this point the commonly used average size is expressed as the arithmetic average particle size volume weighted average particle size and median particle size the volume weighted mean particle size vad shows a satisfactory response to the droplet size distribution kohl 1974 kincaid et al 1996 which can be calculated by eq 2 seginer 1963 bautista capetillo carlos et al 2009 therefore the volume weighted mean particle size was adopted in this study 2 d v i 1 n d i 4 i 1 n d i 3 where dv is the volume weighted average particle size mm n is the amount of droplets at certain point di is the diameter of the drop mm 2 3 2 drop velocity the 2dvd used two parallel placed light sheets to measure the drop velocity the installing space between the two light sheets was 6 2 mm by monitoring the time of a drop pass through the space the vertical velocity could be calculated and the horizontal velocity of the drop could be estimated using the same principle kruger and krajewski 2002 2 4 radial kinetic energy distribution sp jm 2 s 1 stands for specific power and is sometimes also referred to as def thompson and james 1985 thompson et al 2001 or ketime salles and poesen 1999 fornis et al 2005 sp was determined to have the closest relationship with runoff and soil erosion thompson et al 2001 brodowski 2013 wang et al 2014 king and bjorneberg 2010 have given the following formula for determining sp 3 s p i j 1 n d i ρ w π d j 3 v j 2 12 1000 j 1 n d i π d j 3 6 a r i 3600 where r is the number of radial measurement locations ndi is the number of drops measured at the ith radial location ρω is the mass density of water kgm 3 dj is the measured diameter of the jth drop mm vj is the measured velocity of the jt h drop ms 1 and a is the wetted area associated with ith radial location m2 area specific kinetic energy ke jm 2 reflects the total energy strikes at certain positions during an irrigation process and can be determined by integrating the distribution curve of sp distribution perpendicular to the sprinkler lateral with respect to time 4 k e i 0 t i s p t d t where ti is the duration of precipitation at the ith location h volume specific kinetic energy kea jm 2 mm 1 expresses the applied kinetic energy per unit volume of water application kea is correlated to the actual kinetic energy and is a more intuitive unit of measure than ked which is traditionally used as the kinetic energy indicator because of this ked reflects the kinetic energy per unit discharge and heavily weighs the effect of large drops king and bjorneberg 2012 kea can be achieved by dividing the total applied kinetic energy by application depth of water 5 k e i a k e i d i where di is the application depth at the ith location mm the diameter and velocity of each drop are needed in eq 3 while in many cases it is difficult to achieve appropriate test conditions due to large time requirements or costly instruments some changes have been made to eq 3 according to the spray hydraulic characteristic of the big gun sprinkler to be used as alternatives in the case that the radial water application curve has been obtained and can be written as p d mmh 1 the volume of spay water that falls to the ground per unit time per unit area can be determined using eq 6 6 v d p d a t 1000 and the weight of water g is 7 m d ρ w v d 1000 p d since the spray water is composed of droplets with different diameters at the same point and the velocity of droplets varied greatly as well ge et al 2016 a statistical equivalent velocity in this situation can be helpful in describing the kinetic energy distribution take the volume of water as a whole and give it an equivalent velocity μeq which relates to the volume weighted diameter of droplet then the kinetic energy gm2 s 2 carried by the water is 8 e k d 1 2 m d μ e q d v 2 500 p d μ e q d v 2 similarly the unit of ek d in the above equation from gm2 s 2 to j eq 8 can be expressed as eq 9 9 e k d 0 5 p d μ e q d v 2 since sp is defined as the energy transfer to the soil per unit time per unit area the specific power can be described by eq 10 10 s p d e k d a t p d μ e q d v 2 7200 comparing the expression forms of sp in eqs 3 and 10 with the latter it is easier to obtain the radial water application curve of the big gun sprinkler the general expression of the equivalent velocity and volume weighted mean particle size can be derived from limited observational data 2 5 traveling cumulative kinetic energy distribution the big gun sprinkler rotates periodically while moving in the direction of travel the actual spray trajectory is the combination of two movements which can be characterized by a circular spiral overlapping area with notches fig 2 a in this study the location of sprinkler is supposed to be stationary and only does periodic rotating spray around point o while point m locating at a distance of x from the travel lane moves in the opposite direction of the cart and receives kinetic energy along with water from point mstart to point mend fig 2b kinetic energy received during this process is equal to the cumulative kinetic energy of point m according to the relativity of movement due to the relatively slow speed of the traveling cart and that the displacement is limited within a rotation period of the sprinkler two assumptions are made 1 energy and water are evenly distributed at point m during a rotation period and 2 the variation of distance from point m to the sprinkler caused by the movement in the travel direction in a rotation cycle is negligible the spraying area is then divided into an upper semi circular surface and a lower quadrant surface by the x axis the distances to receive water and energy in the two regions are lup and ldown respectively among which 11 l u p r 2 x 2 where r is the spray range of sprinkler m and x is the distance from point m to the travel lane m setting the cart moving velocity to be v the rotation cycle to be t and the moving distance of cart in one rotation cycle to be δl lup is divided into n units taking δl as the unit length and each unit is numbered where 12 n i n t l u p δ l 1 for the jth calculation unit each point in this unit has the same distance to the sprinkler due to the assumption the vertical distance from the horizontal coordinate axis to the unit is 13 l v j δ l and the distance from the jth unit to the sprinkler can be expressed by 14 l j l v 2 x 2 j δ l 2 x 2 substitute lj into eq 10 to get the sp at the jth unit 15 s p l j e k l j a t p l j μ e q d v 2 7200 put j 0 n into the calculation and in turn get the specific power at each unit as well as the corresponding time point it will then be possible to obtain a series of sp t relationship points it is also possible to obtain the relationship between the duration of precipitation and specific power by creating a polynomial fitting to these points based on the least square method as shown in eq 16 16 s p t b i t i where t is the point in time of m in the spraying area h sp t is the specific power at moment t j m 2 s 1 bi is the fitting coefficient i 0 1 2 6 from eq 4 the accumulated kinetic energy of the upper semicircle can be achieved by integrating with sp t in the interval of 0 tup 17 k e u p x 0 t u p x s p t d t where tup x is the length of time for the gun cart pass through the upside semicircle 18 t u p x r 2 x 2 v similarly the relationship between the precipitation duration and the specific power of point m when passing through the fan shaped spraying area can also be expressed by eq 16 the cumulative kinetic energy kedown x can be calculated by eq 19 19 k e d o w n x 0 t d o w n x s p t d t where tdown x is the length of time for the gun cart to pass through the downside fan shaped area which is 20 t d o w n x x tan α 180 2 v 0 x r cos α 180 2 r 2 x 2 v r cos α 180 2 x r where α is the rotation angle of the sprinkler in degrees the area specific kinetic energy of point m can then be calculated as 21 k e x k e u p x k e d o w n x and the total precipitation duration of point m is 22 t x t u p x t d o w n x the area specific kinetic energy and precipitation duration can be obtained for any point vertical of the travel lane using the above equations additionally the volume specific kinetic energy can be achieved by 23 k e a x k e x p x where p x is the water depth at certain point mm 2 6 experimental verification water is the carrier of kinetic energy however the accumulated energy is not visible and it is inconvenient to capture and measure in this study the feasibility and accuracy of the method calculating the cumulative kinetic energy was indirectly verified by comparing the calculated irrigation depth with the measured irrigation depth the experiment was carried out in the northwest a f university agricultural research institute of water saving agriculture before the mobile spraying occurred the radial water application rate of the big gun sprinkler was measured by a fixed spray test instead of the radial sp in order to obtain the cumulative water depth under moving condition 3 rows of catch cans were perpendicular placed to the direction of the travel lane with catch can spacing and row spacing being 2 m a jp75 300 hard hose irrigator was used to drag the sprinkler cart at a speed of 40m h the nozzle diameter of the sprinkler was 20 mm the operating pressure was 0 3 mpa and the rotation sector angle was 270 fig 3 the water depth of each catch can was calculated by a weighing method and the average depth value of the three rows was taken as the measured value of the irrigation depth a calculated value was obtained according to the method provided above and then compared with the measured value 3 results 3 1 radial water distribution the radial water application intensity of 50 pyc under the operating pressure of 0 15 mpa and 0 35 mpa can be viewed in fig 4 the water application pattern viewed in fig 4 has irregular peaks and valleys neither elliptical nor triangular in form the polynomial fitting curves based on the least squares method were a good match to the water distribution characteristics with the fitting coefficients of the two fitting curves equaling 0 981 and 0 971 respectively therefore the radial spray distribution pattern can be described once the fitting coefficients of the polynomial are known for convenience of quotation the polynomial fitting coefficients for radial water distribution of 50 pyc sprinkler can be found in table 1 3 2 radial drop size and drop velocity distribution 3 2 1 drop size distribution an image of droplets captured by the cameras placed inside the 2dvd can be viewed in fig 5 the different sizes of droplets that passed through the test area at the same time viewed in fig 5 had diameters ranging from less than 0 5 mm to more than 6 mm interestingly a droplet diameter of 6 mm was considered to be the largest diameter of droplet that can exist without fragment under natural conditions blanchard and spencer 1970 mctaggartcowan and list 1975 further analysis of the quantity cumulative frequency and volume fraction of the spray droplets are provided in fig 6 the operating pressure of the big gun sprinkler was 0 2 mpa and the distances from nozzle to the measuring points were 4m 8m 12 m and 16m respectively the number of droplets that passed through the test area at the four measuring points in three minutes were 50438 29426 22018 and 6588 and the total volumes of these droplets were 6730 8710 12020 and 2910 mm3 respectively although the number of droplets with diameters smaller than 1 mm occupied greater than 90 of the total amounts the small diameter droplets contribution of water to the total volume were much lower especially at distances relatively far from the sprinkler as viewed in fig 6 the ratio of volume composed by large size droplets to the total droplet volume grows with the increase of distance from the measuring points to the sprinkler indicating an increase of the volume weighted average particle size eq 2 was adopted to acquire the vad as shown in fig 7 fig 7a shows that the vad increases exponentially along with the increase of distance to the sprinkler under various operating pressures this is consistent with the conclusion of montero et al 2003 fig 7b presents the influence of operating pressure on vad the distance of the five measuring points to the sprinkler are 4 8 12 16 and 20m respectively the result shows a significant effect of the operating pressure on vad and the correlation between the vad and operating pressure satisfy the power function this result is in agreement with chen and wallender s 1985 conclusion considering factors of operating pressure and distance to sprinklers on the influence of droplet size distribution an equation of vad was derived and is shown below eq 9 24 d v 0 578 0 00774 p 1 182 d 1 302 d r 0 r 2 0 921 where p is the operating pressure mpa d is the distance to the nozzle m and r0 is the throw distance m 25 r 0 13 389 l n p 49 772 r 2 0 976 the comparison between the measured and calculated values of diameter can be viewed in fig 8 a it was then determined that eq 9 could well predict the distribution of vad the two sets of data the measured and calculated values of vad distribute closely around the 1 1 line showing a high consistency to further evaluate the computing accuracy the root mean square error rmse was calculated by eq 26 chai and draxler 2014 the value of rmse is 0 2504 which is acceptable 26 r m s e i 1 n x m e a i x c a l i 2 n where n is the measurement time xmea i is the average diameter through measurement mm and xcal i is the average diameter through calculation mm the droplet size distribution under various operating pressures and distances was visible in fig 8b with the increasing operating pressure the throw distance increases gradually ranging from around 19 m at 0 1 mpa to 40 5 m at 0 5 mpa meanwhile the vad at the outer end of throw range are relatively high when the operating pressure is lower than 0 25 mpa reaching 4 mm or higher 3 2 2 drop velocity distribution the equivalent velocities of droplets with different diameters under various operating pressures and distances to the sprinkler can be viewed in fig 9 as viewed in the figure the velocity of a droplet relates only to the particle size not the variance in operating pressure or distance to the sprinkler atlas and ulbrich 1977 has given a power function derived from test data to estimate the terminal velocity of raindrops from natural rainfall as shown in eq 27 and fig 9 27 μ t d 3 778 d 0 67 where d is the diameter of the raindrops mm there is a good significant between the equivalent velocity of spray droplets and the terminal velocity of droplets from natural rainfall despite the formation mechanism of the droplets being entirely different this may be attributed to the fact that horizontal velocity of the sprayed droplets makes up for the shortage of vertical velocity due to the limit of falling height ge et al 2016 however there still exist droplets that show relative high deviation between μt and μeq some of which exceed 10 for instance μeq of droplets with diameter between 1 5 mm and 2 mm is higher than μt which can be attributed to the large proportion of the droplets horizontal velocities while μeq of spray droplets with diameters larger than 3 5 mm were lower than μt which can be attributed to the limited falling height of the spray droplets the horizontal velocity component cannot trade off the difference between vertical velocity and μt because the kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity the difference in velocity will lead to a difference of around 20 in kinetic energy therefore this deviation between calculation and actual values cannot be neglected the relationship between equivalent velocity and drop diameter was reevaluated and a logarithm equation was found to fit the relationship well with the fitting coefficient of 0 949 as shown below 28 μ e q d v 3 1742 l n d v 4 2095 r 2 0 949 3 3 radial specific power distribution introduce eq 24 and eq 28 into eq 10 and the expression of sp can be written in the form of eq 29 this equation provided a more accessible way to obtain the sp distribution of the big gun sprinkler as long as the spray intensity and operating pressure are known the specific power at any distance to the sprinkler can be obtained 29 s p d p d 3 1742 l n 0 578 0 00774 p 1 182 d 1 302 4 2095 2 7200 to verify the calculation accuracy of the above equation a verification experiment was carried out to test the radial kinetic energy distribution of 50 pyc under the operating pressure of 0 3 mpa the measured sp was compared to the calculated value as shown in fig 10 the line including circles and the dashed line with squares represent the radial distribution of specific power respectively these two lines show high coherence with a rmse value of 0 0057 the distribution of kinetic energy shows as a torus shape with the peak value of specific power at approximately around 70 of the throw range to gain a more intuitive view the radial curve was converted to surface distribution with a sector angle of 180 using surfer software as shown in fig 10b the big gun sprinkler was placed at point 30 0 as shown in the diagram the peak value of sp was around 0 12 jm 2 s 1 for both the predicted value and the measured value some small differences still exist but bring no influence to the overall consistency of radial specific power distribution 3 4 traveling cumulative kinetic energy distribution 3 4 1 experimental results the measured and calculated water application depth can be viewed in fig 11 with the 50pyc sprinkler gun working at 0 3 mpa and recycling at a speed of 40 m h from fig 11 it can be determined that the calculated values of water depth are in good agreement with the measured values the calculation method can predict both the shape and the numerical value of irrigation depth accurately in addition to that the deviation rates at the end zone of spraying area can reach up to 20 and the deviation rates at the remaining points could be controlled within 5 there were many influencing factors leading to the deviation between the calculated and measured values including but not limited to fitting error test error evaporation and drift of the droplets overall the calculation method presented above is an efficient way to calculate the cumulative water and kinetic energy distribution for a big gun sprinkler 3 4 2 cumulative kinetic energy the area specific kinetic energy and the precipitation duration for the positions at various distances from the travel lane were calculated and the volume specific kinetic energy was obtained by dividing by the water depth the results can be viewed in table 2 the cumulative kinetic energy and water depth at each point along the vertical travel lane direction can be viewed in fig 12 the cumulative kinetic energy and water quantity first increased and then decreased with increasing distance to travel lane as viewed in the figure the maximum depth of irrigation water was 15 9 mm located 13 5 m from the travel lane which was approximately 44 5 of the wetted diameter the christiansen uniformity coefficient of the water distribution was 68 9 the maximum cumulative kinetic energy was approximately 392 7 jm 2 located 19 m from the travel lane which was about 65 5 of the gun s throw range the distribution uniformity coefficient of kinetic energy was found to be 69 5 comparing the cumulative water distribution and kinetic energy distribution it was found that there exists a slight variation in the uniformity coefficient the peak value point of kinetic energy moves away from the travel lane than the water peak point indicating that the kinetic energy per unit volume of water increases with increasing distance to the travel lane as viewed in the last column of table 2 3 4 3 specific power sp was confirmed to be closely related to surface runoff infiltration rate and soil erosion the points at distances of 1 9 17 and 25 m from the travel lane were taken as the representative points of the proximal zone middle zone and end zone of the whole spraying area the dynamic process curve of sp at these points were studied to analyze the characteristics of kinetic energy transmission during a spray process the cumulative kinetic energies at the four points were 165 08 236 36 366 65 and 249 47 jm 2 while the precipitation durations were 48 58 2 64 2 and 55 2 min respectively the sp process curve was achieved by the use of eq 16 as shown in fig 13 the peak values of sp of the four points were almost the same reaching approximately 0 12 jm 2 s 1 however the sp process curves show significant differences in shape the sp process of the proximal and terminal points show unimodal distribution while the midpoint sp process shows irregular saddle like distribution unlike the evenly distributed natural rainfall in a limited range of area the distribution of kinetic energy and sp process at different locations vary greatly and can be treated as independent precipitation process even if the locations are quite close the application of water depth at the locations of 9 m and 17 m from the travel lane were 14 46 mm and 15 09 mm which shows little difference in precipitation however there exists a significant difference in the cumulative kinetic energy which were found to be 236 36 and 366 65 j m2 respectively as viewed in fig 13 the irrigation process at 17 m had a greater duration than that of the 9 m location sp at 17 m remained higher than 0 1 j m2s for a long period of time and by contrast sp at 9 m was relatively lower although it reached 0 1 j m2s or more at the end zone of spray area the time duration for which the 9 m sp reached 0 1 j m2s was much shorter than that of sp at 17 m even though the water application depth in the spray area was relatively the same for the continuous moving big gun sprinkler the total kinetic energy of the water and the density flux of kinetic energy were found to be quite different resulting in different feedback related to the infiltration rates and the soil erosion effects similarly for the locations with same cumulative kinetic energy there exists obvious difference in the depth of water application and the process curve of sp as viewed in fig 13 and table 2 the cumulative kinetic energy for points at distance of 9 m and 25 m from the travel lane were 236 36 and 249 47 j m2 and at approximately the same the irrigation depth of the two points were 14 46 and 7 49 mm the water depth at the 25 m point was approximately half of the 9 m point the process curve of sp at the two points were also different creating shapes of an irregular saddle and a unimodal respectively with the 25 m point exposed to relatively high sp for a longer period of time if the overlap of irrigation areas had been considered to increase the depth of water at 25 m location for the purpose of water application uniformity the cumulative kinetic energy and precipitation duration at this point would have also increased a lot which would put the area at an increased potential risk of surface runoff and soil erosion 4 discussion 4 1 effects of operating pressure on radial sp distribution operating pressure has been reported to be a significant influence on water droplet size distribution martín benito et al 2014 while its influence on kinetic energy distribution has been rarely mentioned especially for big gun sprinklers the radial sp distribution of 50 pyc under different operating pressures from 0 1 mpa to 0 45 mpa can be viewed in fig 14 the distribution pattern viewed in the figure of specific power conforms to a triangular form under each operating pressure with a gradually increasing trend at the front and a rapidly falling at the end of the throw range the values of sp under 0 1 mpa and 0 15 mpa were significantly higher than those under other working conditions reaching almost twice the working condition values fig 14 also presents the peak value of sp under each operating pressure the peak value of sp initially dropped rapidly from 0 2 jm 2 s 1 to less than 0 1 jm 2 s 1 when the operating pressure reached 0 2 mpa the peak value of sp fluctuated within a range of 0 05 0 1 jm 2 s 1 it is understood that along with the increase of sprinkler s working pressure the peak sp is not always decreasing due to the intensive energy distribution 0 1 mpa and 0 15 mpa were determined to be unacceptable options for working pressure what should be noted is the application rate adopted here is an average value over a certain period of time which means the value of sp is also an average value the instantaneous application rate as well as the instantaneous sp can however be several times higher than the average values providing a potential maximum value of application rate of 1 jm 2 s 1 under relatively low working pressure according to the research work of thompson et al 2001 when sp reaches 0 6 jm 2 s 1 or higher the infiltrated depth will approach a constant value and may cause large runoff and sediment yield even though the low operating pressure had the potential to reduce the energy consumption of the unit the low pressure is still inadvisable considering the side effects of the kinetic energy on infiltration rate and runoff for this 50 pyc big size sprinkler the minimum required working pressure is 0 2 mpa 4 2 effects of operating pressure on cumulative kinetic energy due to the effect of operating pressure on radial range droplet distribution and sp distribution chen and wallender 1985 solomon et al 1985 kincaid et al 1996 the operating pressure would also show the impact on the cumulative kinetic energy of traveling big gun sprinkler the cumulative kinetic energy of the points perpendicular to the travel direction under 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa were obtained fig 15 influenced by the spray range the spraying domain area increased with the increase of operating pressure for the big gun sprinkler working at a pressure of 0 15 mpa the cumulative kinetic energy of each point was found to be significantly higher than that working under pressures of 0 25 0 35 or 0 45 mpa the peak value was 528 3j m2 located a distance of 17 m from the travel lane the cumulative kinetic energy under 0 25 and 0 45 mpa were relatively lower and the maximum cumulative kinetic energy of the spray gun was 371 2 and 368 3 j m2 located at 19 m and 25 m from the travel lane respectively the cumulative kinetic energy of the gun sprinkler at 0 35 mpa was found to be significantly higher than that at working pressures of 0 25 and 0 45 mpa this can be explained by the distribution of radial sp of the spray gun at different operating pressures fig 14 when the sprinkler was working at 0 15 mpa the radial sp was significantly higher than the rest the spraying tongue was not fully broken and both the water distribution and kinetic energy were intensively distributed meaning the big gun sprinkler was still not working normally when the working pressure increased to 0 25 mpa the range of big gun sprinkler increased significantly and the value of sp fell expectedly a further increase in the working pressure up to 0 35 mpa the range of the gun sprinkler was higher than 0 25 mpa but the sp showed no obvious changes when the working pressure of the gun was 0 45 mpa sp of the radial points decreases further and the range increased only slightly it can be viewed in eq 15 that the irrigation duration increases with an increase of range additionally the points under 0 35 mpa working pressure have experienced both relatively high sp and long irrigation duration thus making the cumulative kinetic energy higher than 0 25 and 0 45 mpa in summary the operating pressure exerts an effect on the cumulative kinetic energy of the spraying area by influencing the value of sp and the length of precipitation duration 4 3 effects of rotation sector angle and recycling speed on kinetic energy distribution in order to keep the surface of the travel lane dry during the recycling process the big gun sprinkler was always adjusted to do fan shaped spray but there was no clear requirement for the fan angle value the typical rotation sector angle provided by the north carolina state university was 180 to 315 and prado et al 2012 shows that radiation angle of 180 to 230 can obtain a higher water application uniformity ge et al 2016 s study shows that with the increase of the rotation angle the irrigation uniformity increases slightly the cumulative kinetic energy and rainfall duration of different locations with the big gun sprinkler rotating at a sector angle of 180 220 and 270 were calculated according to the above mentioned method fig 16 the cumulative kinetic energy distribution varied from trapezoidal form to triangular form with the increase of rotation sector angle also the uniformity coefficient correspondingly reduced from 78 to 69 5 which was consistent with the change of cumulative water distribution that varied from triangular form to trapezoidal form fig 16b shows the precipitation duration at different radiation angles with the increase of the radiation angle the precipitation of each point also increased significantly which effectively reduced the average value of sp taking the location 21 m away from the travel lane as an example the precipitation duration of 180 220 and 270 were respectively 34 2 45 7 and 65 7 min and the cumulative kinetic energies were 295 7 356 2 and 384 7 j m2 the average values of sp were 0 144 0 129 and 0 0976 j m2s respectively although the cumulative kinetic energy had increased the average sp at this point decreased more obviously this further illustrates that the rotation sector angle should not be too small from the perspective of kinetic energy distribution different crops have different irrigation quotas which put forward the requirement that the sprinkler should maintain different walking speeds to match the crops need to avoid excessive or insufficient irrigation the walking speed can generally be controlled by the water turbine or the drive motor how does the change in walking speed affect the distribution of kinetic energy compare the energy distribution when the sprinkler cart was traveling at speeds of 20 40 and 60 m h as viewed in fig 17 the cumulative kinetic energy at each point is inversely proportional to the walking speed of the sprinkler cart while the shape and uniformity of the cumulative kinetic energy shows no change the cumulative kinetic energy at each point of the 20 m h traveling speed was three times greater than the energy at a speed of 60 m h fig 17a which is the same as the effect of walking speed on irrigation depth similarly the irrigation time at each point was inversely proportional to the walking speed as the walking speed increases the irrigation time at each point showed a proportional decrease fig 17b this result is consistent with the finding of dogan et al 2008 on water application depth apart from producing the expected doubled water depth when the speed of a linear moving irrigation system was halved there was no other significant effects 4 4 comparison with center pivot used spray plate sprinkler king and bjorneberg 2010 and king 2016 have carried out extensive studies on the kinetic energy distribution of some commercially used spray plate sprinklers which provided a basis for reasonable selection of sprinklers for a center pivot in this study the mobile cumulative kinetic energy of big gun sprinkler was compared with the moving spray plate kinetic energy to further analyze its kinetic energy distribution characteristics fig 18 a shows the process curve of sp and ke for five types of spray plate sprinklers at an irrigation depth of 25 mm fig 18b is the process curve of sp and ke of four points at different distances to the travel lane with a same irrigation depth of 25 mm the transient sp of big gun sprinkler is smaller than the sp value of a spray plate sprinkler for a big gun sprinkler the value of sp is around 0 05 0 12 j m2s while for sprinklers such as senninger i wbo and nelson the value of sp is 0 15 0 3 j m2s among which sp of a fixed plate spray sprinkler nelson d3000 is even higher reaching almost to 0 8 j m2s for a same irrigation depth the irrigation time at each point of the big gun sprinkler is much longer reaching 8 10 times as much as that of senninger and nelson nozzles the kinetic energy carried by the same amount of water from the big gun sprinkler is also higher than that from senninger or nelson nozzles which is about 2 4 times for the same application depth of 25 mm ke of each point increases with an increase of distance from the travel lane the cumulative kinetic energy and distance to the travel lane show an exponential relationship as shown in eq 30 overall compared with the spray plate sprinklers the big gun sprinkler presents a milder precipitation process but the precipitation lasts longer and carries more kinetic energy 30 e k 457 41 e 0 043 l r 2 0 997 4 5 effects of kinetic energy on infiltration rate mohammed and kohl 1987 have studied the effect of ke and kea on infiltration rates the changes in the rate of infiltration with the increase of ke was obtained for four values of kea as shown in fig 19 a according to mohammed s experimental data the relationship among the infiltration rate ke and kea were fitted to obtain the following equation eq 31 the infiltration rate was affected by both ke and kea the weight coefficient of ke is about 0 768 and the weight coefficient of kea was about 0 232 when the value of kea was less than 12 2 j m2mm or when the value of ke was less than 135 8 j m2 their influence on the infiltration rate was negligible 31 ir 147 1 ke a 12 2 ke 135 8 34 1 113 1 k e 135 8 357 2 ke a 12 2 ke 135 8 113 34 1 1 k e a 12 2 17 7 2 ke a 12 2 ke 135 8 34 1 1 k e a 12 2 17 7 2 113 1 k e 135 8 357 2 ke a 12 2 ke 135 8 where ir is the infiltration rate mm h it was found that the value of kea under the spraying of a big gun sprinkler increased with an increase of distance to the travel lane and decreased with the increase of the working pressure the range of kea in this study was 11 74 60 09 j m2mm among which the value of kea in a large spraying area was higher than the upper limit in mohammed s test which was 24 4 j m2mm fig 19b assuming the above equation is valid while kea is higher than 24 4 j m2mm induce the value of ke and kea into eq 31 and the infiltration rate of each point perpendicular to the travel lane can be obtained as shown in fig 20 the infiltration rate of each point decreases linearly with the increase of the distance from the travel lane and the fitting formula is y 2 7461x 90 735 r2 0 991 the infiltration rate is less than 40 mm h at the outer 1 3 of spraying area and even falls down to around 20 mm h at the outer end zone of the spraying area which means that the surface ponding and runoff are more easily generated during the irrigation process 5 conclusions the radial water application distribution droplet size distribution and droplet velocity distribution of a big gun sprinkler were measured in this study based on the experimental data an equation of radial kinetic energy was summarized the radial sp at any distance to the sprinkler can be achieved by introducing two parameters to this equation those two parameters being the operating pressure and the application rate by considering the operation characteristics of a big gun sprinkler and a hose drawn traveler a calculation method to determine the continuous moving kinetic energy distribution of the big gun sprinkler was proposed test results showed that the calculation method predicted both the shape and numerical values accurately the cumulative kinetic energy perpendicular to the travel lane increased first and then decreased and the volume specific kinetic energy increased with an increase in distance from the travel lane the process curve of sp for points at different distances from the travel lane presented significant differences the distribution of kinetic energy and specific power process varied greatly even though the locations were relatively close to each other the cumulative kinetic energy and sp of the water could be quite different even if the water application depth was the same similarly for the points with the same cumulative kinetic energy there existed obvious differences in the depth of water and the dynamic process curve of sp the influence of operating pressure on kinetic energy has been investigated for the operating pressures lower than 0 2 mpa the peak value of radial sp remained at a high level while the peak value fell dramatically and showed fluctuating changes while the operating pressure was found to be higher than 0 2 mpa the operating pressure showed effects on the cumulative kinetic energy by influencing the value of sp and precipitation duration the cumulative kinetic energy increased with the increase of rotation angle with an increase of recycling speed both the cumulative kinetic energy and irrigation duration decreased proportionally compared with the spray plate sprinklers utilized in center pivots the big gun sprinkler showed a milder precipitation process but the precipitation lasted longer and carried more energy reaching 2 4 times for the same amount of water the infiltration rate under the big gun sprinkler decreased linearly with the increase in distance from the travel lane at the end zone of the spray area the infiltration rate dropped to around 20 mm h

11534,kinetic energy of droplets from big gun sprinklers relates closely to the infiltration process and soil erosion as well as severely affects the energy consumption of hose drawn travelers however research work related to the kinetic energy distribution of big gun sprinklers is seldom performed in this study the radial water application distribution droplet size distribution and droplet velocity distribution of a big gun sprinkler were measured based on the experimental data a calculation method was developed to determine the kinetic energy of big gun sprinkler under stationary and moving states volume weighted mean particle size and the corresponding equivalent landing velocity were adopted as the feature size and velocity of the point located at any distance from the sprinkler the droplets landing velocities present a logarithmic relationship with droplet size and velocities rise with the increase of droplet size the operating pressure should not be lower than 0 2 mpa since the peak value of specific power will rise rapidly below this operating pressure for positions receiving the same kinetic energy obvious difference may exist in the amount of water and the dynamic process curves of specific power with the increase in travel speed of the hose drawn traveler both the cumulative kinetic energy and the irrigation duration decrease proportionally compared to the spray plate sprinklers applied to center pivots the big gun sprinkler shows a milder precipitation process but the water application lasts longer and carries more kinetic energy reaching 2 4 times for the same amount of water the infiltration rate of each location decreases linearly along with an increase in distance to the travel lane and the infiltration rate decreases to approximately 20 mm h at the end of the spraying area keywords high volume sprinkler specific power radial distribution cumulative kinetic energy working condition 1 introduction big gun sprinklers possess features of large flow rates wide wetted diameters and they have been used in combination with both hose drawn travelers and center pivot systems the hose drawn traveler has the advantages of having a relatively large control area low investment per unit area and great mobility while also being adaptable to different soil types silva et al 2007 however this continuously moving irrigator also presents disadvantages such as high input pressure low distribution uniformity as well as large droplets and large application rates keller and bliesner 1990 the relatively large amount of kinetic energy carried by the water which strikes the young crops and topsoil may damage the crop canopy and cause soil compaction despite the severity of these disadvantages little work has been done to develop improvement strategies specially related to the kinetic energy distribution of the big gun sprinkler kinetic energy contained in droplets as they compact the soil surface affects both the water infiltration processes and soil erosion kincaid 1996 there is a strong correlation between the kinetic energy of water droplets and the change in physical properties of the surface soil thompson and james 1985 analyzed the increase in hydraulic resistance of the soil surface layer as the drop kinetic energy per unit soil surface area also increased mohammed and kohl 1987 found that droplet kinetic energy had a significant influence on the formation of surface seals and times to runoff the infiltration rates on a loam soil were found to decrease rapidly as water was applied with increased kinetic energy agassi et al 1994 noted that the final infiltration rate decreased exponentially with an increase of drop kinetic energy yan s 2011 work also indicated that infiltration rate was inversely proportional to drop kinetic energy raindrop impact is the key mechanism for disaggregating and mobilizing soil particles however it depends on the kinetic energy of raindrops angulo martínez and barros 2015 decreasing rainfall impact energy by 89 without reducing rainfall intensity decreased soil losses by 90 or more young and wiersma 1973 kinetic energy was identified as the greatest contributor to erosivity morgan 1995 shin et al 2015 thus kinetic energy is an important indicator of sprinkler irrigation quality kinetic energy of sprinkler water was determined by drop characterization which refers to the statistical determination of static and dynamic properties of the drops properties such as droplet diameter and droplet velocity bautista capetillo et al 2012 a significant amount of research has been performed related to the distribution of droplet diameters and velocities for sprinkler irrigation kohl 1974 li et al 1994 kincaid 1996 kincaid et al 1996 king and bjorneberg 2010 bautista capetillo et al 2012 ge et al 2016 however most of the research objects were confined to fixed spray plate sprinklers king and bjorneberg 2010 yan et al 2011 ouazaa et al 2014 rotating spray plate sprinklers kohl and deboer 1990 deboer and monnens 2001 deboer 2002 or middle sized impact sprinklers stillmunkes and james 1982 sanchez et al 2011 stambouli et al 2014 studies conducted with big gun sprinklers that include work with high flow rates greater than 5ls 1 were found to be uncommon sheikhesmaeili et al 2016 even though big gun sprinklers have a wide variety of applications in agriculture and industry and are being more commonly used for field crop irrigation in china the kinetic energy of big gun sprinklers is also closely related to the energy consumption of the hose drawn traveler due to its relationship with operating pressure kohl et al 1985 reported that a reduction of operating pressure leads to an increase in kinetic energy per unit volume of discharged water similar results have been obtained by basahi 1998 when determining the specific power of experimental water drops impacting a surface high energy consumption is an accepted shortcoming of the hose drawn traveler due to the high operating pressure of a big gun sprinkler sheikhesmaeili et al 2016 noted that an increase of pressure from 0 45 mpa to 0 5 mpa supposes an increase of energy cost of 18 therefore reducing operating pressure slightly can significantly bring down the operating cost martínez et al 2004 thus the distribution of kinetic energy can be used in determining a reasonable operating pressure of a big gun sprinkler this can help to avoid centralized distribution of kinetic energy due to low operating pressure while also lowering the system energy consumption by reducing the operating pressure reasonably information of big gun sprinklers provided by the manufactures however is restricted to basic parameters such as available operating pressure ranges and flow rates which does not offer information related to the kinetic energy distribution this study aims to put forward a calculation method for determining the kinetic energy of a big gun sprinkler under stationary and moving conditions this method will also be used to provide guidance for the management and operation of hose drawn travelers for field irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 solid set sprinkler test the test was performed in northwest china yangling central part of the shaanxi province 108 4 28 e and 34 16 56 n this region is characterized by a temperate continental climate with an altitude of 521 m and an annual frost free period of 210 days water was supplied from a hydrant in the field was then delivered to a variable frequency pump via pvc pipe to regulate the working pressure of the sprinkler a big gun 50 pyc vertical impact sprinkler made by tianshui corp jiangsu china was adopted for the experimental test and the sprinkler nozzle was 20 mm in diameter in order to obtain the spray characteristic under low operating pressure the operating pressure tested in this study ranges from 0 1 mpa to 0 45 mpa with the minimum working pressure lower than the operating pressure recommended by the manufacturer and with the corresponding flow rate range being 13 4 43 8m3h 1 the sprinkler was placed 1 7 m above the ground and the trajectory angle of the spray jet was 24 a cyb13i pressure transmitter produced by xi an xinmin electronics co ltd range 0 1 mpa accuracy of 0 1 the output signal is 4 20 ma was situated 0 2 m under the nozzle flow rates were measured via an emf5000 electronic flow meter range 0 60 m3 h three lines of catch cans were installed in the radial direction of the spray jet to measure radial water distribution faci et al 2001 with 25 catch cans in each line and 2 m spacing distance between each catch can the catch cans used in the test were plastic cylinder barrels with a height of 25 7 cm and with inner and outer diameters of 15 2 and 17 cm respectively the duration of each test was one hour and the weight of water in each catch can was recorded immediately after each test to reduce error due to water evaporation edling and chowdhury 1985 playán et al 2005 the testing procedure followed complied with the standard asae s398 1 2001 a two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd produced by joanneum research corp austria was used to measure the droplet size and velocities two vertically disposed ccd cameras inside the instrument make linear scans of droplets passing through the test area and record the precipitation rate individual drop size and the vertical and horizontal velocity components schönhuber et al 2000 seginer et al 2001 huang et al 2008 the test accuracy of drop size is 0 19 mm and the measuring scope is 100 mm 100 mm the 2dvd was placed along the radial direction of water jet with 2 m spacing distance and with each test measurement lasting 3 min in order to facilitate the movement of the 2dvd between different measuring points the original fixed bracket of the 2dvd was replaced by a modified frame equipped with four universal wheels as shown in fig 1 the operating pressures of the big gun sprinkler were 150 250 350 and 450 kpa during the drop size and velocity test 2 2 radial water distribution some simplifications of the radial water distribution patterns of the sprinkler had been made according to the single leg test data prado et al 2012 martín benito et al 2014 simplifications such as elliptical shapes triangular shapes and torus shapes however the water distribution patterns are always irregular and distortion of the patterns occurs with the variation of operating pressure simplified shapes may lead to considerable calculation error in this study the radial water distribution curve under different working conditions was obtained by polynomial fitting using the least squares method in order to form a more realistic reflection of the radial water distribution the fitting function can be expressed as eq 1 1 p d a i d i 0 d r 0 d r where d is the distance from the measuring point to the sprinkler in meters p d is the sprayed droplet intensity in mm h ai is the fitting coefficient for the water distribution curve i 0 1 2 6 2 3 radial drop size and drop velocity 2 3 1 drop size the two orthogonal projections provided by the line scan cameras of the 2dvd in principle provide the three dimensional raindrop shape information which allows the computation of the drop volume and equivalent drop diameter kruger and krajewski 2002 droplets at each point are composed by a clear distribution of range in size ge et al 2016 and an average diameter is required for the characteristic size at this point the commonly used average size is expressed as the arithmetic average particle size volume weighted average particle size and median particle size the volume weighted mean particle size vad shows a satisfactory response to the droplet size distribution kohl 1974 kincaid et al 1996 which can be calculated by eq 2 seginer 1963 bautista capetillo carlos et al 2009 therefore the volume weighted mean particle size was adopted in this study 2 d v i 1 n d i 4 i 1 n d i 3 where dv is the volume weighted average particle size mm n is the amount of droplets at certain point di is the diameter of the drop mm 2 3 2 drop velocity the 2dvd used two parallel placed light sheets to measure the drop velocity the installing space between the two light sheets was 6 2 mm by monitoring the time of a drop pass through the space the vertical velocity could be calculated and the horizontal velocity of the drop could be estimated using the same principle kruger and krajewski 2002 2 4 radial kinetic energy distribution sp jm 2 s 1 stands for specific power and is sometimes also referred to as def thompson and james 1985 thompson et al 2001 or ketime salles and poesen 1999 fornis et al 2005 sp was determined to have the closest relationship with runoff and soil erosion thompson et al 2001 brodowski 2013 wang et al 2014 king and bjorneberg 2010 have given the following formula for determining sp 3 s p i j 1 n d i ρ w π d j 3 v j 2 12 1000 j 1 n d i π d j 3 6 a r i 3600 where r is the number of radial measurement locations ndi is the number of drops measured at the ith radial location ρω is the mass density of water kgm 3 dj is the measured diameter of the jth drop mm vj is the measured velocity of the jt h drop ms 1 and a is the wetted area associated with ith radial location m2 area specific kinetic energy ke jm 2 reflects the total energy strikes at certain positions during an irrigation process and can be determined by integrating the distribution curve of sp distribution perpendicular to the sprinkler lateral with respect to time 4 k e i 0 t i s p t d t where ti is the duration of precipitation at the ith location h volume specific kinetic energy kea jm 2 mm 1 expresses the applied kinetic energy per unit volume of water application kea is correlated to the actual kinetic energy and is a more intuitive unit of measure than ked which is traditionally used as the kinetic energy indicator because of this ked reflects the kinetic energy per unit discharge and heavily weighs the effect of large drops king and bjorneberg 2012 kea can be achieved by dividing the total applied kinetic energy by application depth of water 5 k e i a k e i d i where di is the application depth at the ith location mm the diameter and velocity of each drop are needed in eq 3 while in many cases it is difficult to achieve appropriate test conditions due to large time requirements or costly instruments some changes have been made to eq 3 according to the spray hydraulic characteristic of the big gun sprinkler to be used as alternatives in the case that the radial water application curve has been obtained and can be written as p d mmh 1 the volume of spay water that falls to the ground per unit time per unit area can be determined using eq 6 6 v d p d a t 1000 and the weight of water g is 7 m d ρ w v d 1000 p d since the spray water is composed of droplets with different diameters at the same point and the velocity of droplets varied greatly as well ge et al 2016 a statistical equivalent velocity in this situation can be helpful in describing the kinetic energy distribution take the volume of water as a whole and give it an equivalent velocity μeq which relates to the volume weighted diameter of droplet then the kinetic energy gm2 s 2 carried by the water is 8 e k d 1 2 m d μ e q d v 2 500 p d μ e q d v 2 similarly the unit of ek d in the above equation from gm2 s 2 to j eq 8 can be expressed as eq 9 9 e k d 0 5 p d μ e q d v 2 since sp is defined as the energy transfer to the soil per unit time per unit area the specific power can be described by eq 10 10 s p d e k d a t p d μ e q d v 2 7200 comparing the expression forms of sp in eqs 3 and 10 with the latter it is easier to obtain the radial water application curve of the big gun sprinkler the general expression of the equivalent velocity and volume weighted mean particle size can be derived from limited observational data 2 5 traveling cumulative kinetic energy distribution the big gun sprinkler rotates periodically while moving in the direction of travel the actual spray trajectory is the combination of two movements which can be characterized by a circular spiral overlapping area with notches fig 2 a in this study the location of sprinkler is supposed to be stationary and only does periodic rotating spray around point o while point m locating at a distance of x from the travel lane moves in the opposite direction of the cart and receives kinetic energy along with water from point mstart to point mend fig 2b kinetic energy received during this process is equal to the cumulative kinetic energy of point m according to the relativity of movement due to the relatively slow speed of the traveling cart and that the displacement is limited within a rotation period of the sprinkler two assumptions are made 1 energy and water are evenly distributed at point m during a rotation period and 2 the variation of distance from point m to the sprinkler caused by the movement in the travel direction in a rotation cycle is negligible the spraying area is then divided into an upper semi circular surface and a lower quadrant surface by the x axis the distances to receive water and energy in the two regions are lup and ldown respectively among which 11 l u p r 2 x 2 where r is the spray range of sprinkler m and x is the distance from point m to the travel lane m setting the cart moving velocity to be v the rotation cycle to be t and the moving distance of cart in one rotation cycle to be δl lup is divided into n units taking δl as the unit length and each unit is numbered where 12 n i n t l u p δ l 1 for the jth calculation unit each point in this unit has the same distance to the sprinkler due to the assumption the vertical distance from the horizontal coordinate axis to the unit is 13 l v j δ l and the distance from the jth unit to the sprinkler can be expressed by 14 l j l v 2 x 2 j δ l 2 x 2 substitute lj into eq 10 to get the sp at the jth unit 15 s p l j e k l j a t p l j μ e q d v 2 7200 put j 0 n into the calculation and in turn get the specific power at each unit as well as the corresponding time point it will then be possible to obtain a series of sp t relationship points it is also possible to obtain the relationship between the duration of precipitation and specific power by creating a polynomial fitting to these points based on the least square method as shown in eq 16 16 s p t b i t i where t is the point in time of m in the spraying area h sp t is the specific power at moment t j m 2 s 1 bi is the fitting coefficient i 0 1 2 6 from eq 4 the accumulated kinetic energy of the upper semicircle can be achieved by integrating with sp t in the interval of 0 tup 17 k e u p x 0 t u p x s p t d t where tup x is the length of time for the gun cart pass through the upside semicircle 18 t u p x r 2 x 2 v similarly the relationship between the precipitation duration and the specific power of point m when passing through the fan shaped spraying area can also be expressed by eq 16 the cumulative kinetic energy kedown x can be calculated by eq 19 19 k e d o w n x 0 t d o w n x s p t d t where tdown x is the length of time for the gun cart to pass through the downside fan shaped area which is 20 t d o w n x x tan α 180 2 v 0 x r cos α 180 2 r 2 x 2 v r cos α 180 2 x r where α is the rotation angle of the sprinkler in degrees the area specific kinetic energy of point m can then be calculated as 21 k e x k e u p x k e d o w n x and the total precipitation duration of point m is 22 t x t u p x t d o w n x the area specific kinetic energy and precipitation duration can be obtained for any point vertical of the travel lane using the above equations additionally the volume specific kinetic energy can be achieved by 23 k e a x k e x p x where p x is the water depth at certain point mm 2 6 experimental verification water is the carrier of kinetic energy however the accumulated energy is not visible and it is inconvenient to capture and measure in this study the feasibility and accuracy of the method calculating the cumulative kinetic energy was indirectly verified by comparing the calculated irrigation depth with the measured irrigation depth the experiment was carried out in the northwest a f university agricultural research institute of water saving agriculture before the mobile spraying occurred the radial water application rate of the big gun sprinkler was measured by a fixed spray test instead of the radial sp in order to obtain the cumulative water depth under moving condition 3 rows of catch cans were perpendicular placed to the direction of the travel lane with catch can spacing and row spacing being 2 m a jp75 300 hard hose irrigator was used to drag the sprinkler cart at a speed of 40m h the nozzle diameter of the sprinkler was 20 mm the operating pressure was 0 3 mpa and the rotation sector angle was 270 fig 3 the water depth of each catch can was calculated by a weighing method and the average depth value of the three rows was taken as the measured value of the irrigation depth a calculated value was obtained according to the method provided above and then compared with the measured value 3 results 3 1 radial water distribution the radial water application intensity of 50 pyc under the operating pressure of 0 15 mpa and 0 35 mpa can be viewed in fig 4 the water application pattern viewed in fig 4 has irregular peaks and valleys neither elliptical nor triangular in form the polynomial fitting curves based on the least squares method were a good match to the water distribution characteristics with the fitting coefficients of the two fitting curves equaling 0 981 and 0 971 respectively therefore the radial spray distribution pattern can be described once the fitting coefficients of the polynomial are known for convenience of quotation the polynomial fitting coefficients for radial water distribution of 50 pyc sprinkler can be found in table 1 3 2 radial drop size and drop velocity distribution 3 2 1 drop size distribution an image of droplets captured by the cameras placed inside the 2dvd can be viewed in fig 5 the different sizes of droplets that passed through the test area at the same time viewed in fig 5 had diameters ranging from less than 0 5 mm to more than 6 mm interestingly a droplet diameter of 6 mm was considered to be the largest diameter of droplet that can exist without fragment under natural conditions blanchard and spencer 1970 mctaggartcowan and list 1975 further analysis of the quantity cumulative frequency and volume fraction of the spray droplets are provided in fig 6 the operating pressure of the big gun sprinkler was 0 2 mpa and the distances from nozzle to the measuring points were 4m 8m 12 m and 16m respectively the number of droplets that passed through the test area at the four measuring points in three minutes were 50438 29426 22018 and 6588 and the total volumes of these droplets were 6730 8710 12020 and 2910 mm3 respectively although the number of droplets with diameters smaller than 1 mm occupied greater than 90 of the total amounts the small diameter droplets contribution of water to the total volume were much lower especially at distances relatively far from the sprinkler as viewed in fig 6 the ratio of volume composed by large size droplets to the total droplet volume grows with the increase of distance from the measuring points to the sprinkler indicating an increase of the volume weighted average particle size eq 2 was adopted to acquire the vad as shown in fig 7 fig 7a shows that the vad increases exponentially along with the increase of distance to the sprinkler under various operating pressures this is consistent with the conclusion of montero et al 2003 fig 7b presents the influence of operating pressure on vad the distance of the five measuring points to the sprinkler are 4 8 12 16 and 20m respectively the result shows a significant effect of the operating pressure on vad and the correlation between the vad and operating pressure satisfy the power function this result is in agreement with chen and wallender s 1985 conclusion considering factors of operating pressure and distance to sprinklers on the influence of droplet size distribution an equation of vad was derived and is shown below eq 9 24 d v 0 578 0 00774 p 1 182 d 1 302 d r 0 r 2 0 921 where p is the operating pressure mpa d is the distance to the nozzle m and r0 is the throw distance m 25 r 0 13 389 l n p 49 772 r 2 0 976 the comparison between the measured and calculated values of diameter can be viewed in fig 8 a it was then determined that eq 9 could well predict the distribution of vad the two sets of data the measured and calculated values of vad distribute closely around the 1 1 line showing a high consistency to further evaluate the computing accuracy the root mean square error rmse was calculated by eq 26 chai and draxler 2014 the value of rmse is 0 2504 which is acceptable 26 r m s e i 1 n x m e a i x c a l i 2 n where n is the measurement time xmea i is the average diameter through measurement mm and xcal i is the average diameter through calculation mm the droplet size distribution under various operating pressures and distances was visible in fig 8b with the increasing operating pressure the throw distance increases gradually ranging from around 19 m at 0 1 mpa to 40 5 m at 0 5 mpa meanwhile the vad at the outer end of throw range are relatively high when the operating pressure is lower than 0 25 mpa reaching 4 mm or higher 3 2 2 drop velocity distribution the equivalent velocities of droplets with different diameters under various operating pressures and distances to the sprinkler can be viewed in fig 9 as viewed in the figure the velocity of a droplet relates only to the particle size not the variance in operating pressure or distance to the sprinkler atlas and ulbrich 1977 has given a power function derived from test data to estimate the terminal velocity of raindrops from natural rainfall as shown in eq 27 and fig 9 27 μ t d 3 778 d 0 67 where d is the diameter of the raindrops mm there is a good significant between the equivalent velocity of spray droplets and the terminal velocity of droplets from natural rainfall despite the formation mechanism of the droplets being entirely different this may be attributed to the fact that horizontal velocity of the sprayed droplets makes up for the shortage of vertical velocity due to the limit of falling height ge et al 2016 however there still exist droplets that show relative high deviation between μt and μeq some of which exceed 10 for instance μeq of droplets with diameter between 1 5 mm and 2 mm is higher than μt which can be attributed to the large proportion of the droplets horizontal velocities while μeq of spray droplets with diameters larger than 3 5 mm were lower than μt which can be attributed to the limited falling height of the spray droplets the horizontal velocity component cannot trade off the difference between vertical velocity and μt because the kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity the difference in velocity will lead to a difference of around 20 in kinetic energy therefore this deviation between calculation and actual values cannot be neglected the relationship between equivalent velocity and drop diameter was reevaluated and a logarithm equation was found to fit the relationship well with the fitting coefficient of 0 949 as shown below 28 μ e q d v 3 1742 l n d v 4 2095 r 2 0 949 3 3 radial specific power distribution introduce eq 24 and eq 28 into eq 10 and the expression of sp can be written in the form of eq 29 this equation provided a more accessible way to obtain the sp distribution of the big gun sprinkler as long as the spray intensity and operating pressure are known the specific power at any distance to the sprinkler can be obtained 29 s p d p d 3 1742 l n 0 578 0 00774 p 1 182 d 1 302 4 2095 2 7200 to verify the calculation accuracy of the above equation a verification experiment was carried out to test the radial kinetic energy distribution of 50 pyc under the operating pressure of 0 3 mpa the measured sp was compared to the calculated value as shown in fig 10 the line including circles and the dashed line with squares represent the radial distribution of specific power respectively these two lines show high coherence with a rmse value of 0 0057 the distribution of kinetic energy shows as a torus shape with the peak value of specific power at approximately around 70 of the throw range to gain a more intuitive view the radial curve was converted to surface distribution with a sector angle of 180 using surfer software as shown in fig 10b the big gun sprinkler was placed at point 30 0 as shown in the diagram the peak value of sp was around 0 12 jm 2 s 1 for both the predicted value and the measured value some small differences still exist but bring no influence to the overall consistency of radial specific power distribution 3 4 traveling cumulative kinetic energy distribution 3 4 1 experimental results the measured and calculated water application depth can be viewed in fig 11 with the 50pyc sprinkler gun working at 0 3 mpa and recycling at a speed of 40 m h from fig 11 it can be determined that the calculated values of water depth are in good agreement with the measured values the calculation method can predict both the shape and the numerical value of irrigation depth accurately in addition to that the deviation rates at the end zone of spraying area can reach up to 20 and the deviation rates at the remaining points could be controlled within 5 there were many influencing factors leading to the deviation between the calculated and measured values including but not limited to fitting error test error evaporation and drift of the droplets overall the calculation method presented above is an efficient way to calculate the cumulative water and kinetic energy distribution for a big gun sprinkler 3 4 2 cumulative kinetic energy the area specific kinetic energy and the precipitation duration for the positions at various distances from the travel lane were calculated and the volume specific kinetic energy was obtained by dividing by the water depth the results can be viewed in table 2 the cumulative kinetic energy and water depth at each point along the vertical travel lane direction can be viewed in fig 12 the cumulative kinetic energy and water quantity first increased and then decreased with increasing distance to travel lane as viewed in the figure the maximum depth of irrigation water was 15 9 mm located 13 5 m from the travel lane which was approximately 44 5 of the wetted diameter the christiansen uniformity coefficient of the water distribution was 68 9 the maximum cumulative kinetic energy was approximately 392 7 jm 2 located 19 m from the travel lane which was about 65 5 of the gun s throw range the distribution uniformity coefficient of kinetic energy was found to be 69 5 comparing the cumulative water distribution and kinetic energy distribution it was found that there exists a slight variation in the uniformity coefficient the peak value point of kinetic energy moves away from the travel lane than the water peak point indicating that the kinetic energy per unit volume of water increases with increasing distance to the travel lane as viewed in the last column of table 2 3 4 3 specific power sp was confirmed to be closely related to surface runoff infiltration rate and soil erosion the points at distances of 1 9 17 and 25 m from the travel lane were taken as the representative points of the proximal zone middle zone and end zone of the whole spraying area the dynamic process curve of sp at these points were studied to analyze the characteristics of kinetic energy transmission during a spray process the cumulative kinetic energies at the four points were 165 08 236 36 366 65 and 249 47 jm 2 while the precipitation durations were 48 58 2 64 2 and 55 2 min respectively the sp process curve was achieved by the use of eq 16 as shown in fig 13 the peak values of sp of the four points were almost the same reaching approximately 0 12 jm 2 s 1 however the sp process curves show significant differences in shape the sp process of the proximal and terminal points show unimodal distribution while the midpoint sp process shows irregular saddle like distribution unlike the evenly distributed natural rainfall in a limited range of area the distribution of kinetic energy and sp process at different locations vary greatly and can be treated as independent precipitation process even if the locations are quite close the application of water depth at the locations of 9 m and 17 m from the travel lane were 14 46 mm and 15 09 mm which shows little difference in precipitation however there exists a significant difference in the cumulative kinetic energy which were found to be 236 36 and 366 65 j m2 respectively as viewed in fig 13 the irrigation process at 17 m had a greater duration than that of the 9 m location sp at 17 m remained higher than 0 1 j m2s for a long period of time and by contrast sp at 9 m was relatively lower although it reached 0 1 j m2s or more at the end zone of spray area the time duration for which the 9 m sp reached 0 1 j m2s was much shorter than that of sp at 17 m even though the water application depth in the spray area was relatively the same for the continuous moving big gun sprinkler the total kinetic energy of the water and the density flux of kinetic energy were found to be quite different resulting in different feedback related to the infiltration rates and the soil erosion effects similarly for the locations with same cumulative kinetic energy there exists obvious difference in the depth of water application and the process curve of sp as viewed in fig 13 and table 2 the cumulative kinetic energy for points at distance of 9 m and 25 m from the travel lane were 236 36 and 249 47 j m2 and at approximately the same the irrigation depth of the two points were 14 46 and 7 49 mm the water depth at the 25 m point was approximately half of the 9 m point the process curve of sp at the two points were also different creating shapes of an irregular saddle and a unimodal respectively with the 25 m point exposed to relatively high sp for a longer period of time if the overlap of irrigation areas had been considered to increase the depth of water at 25 m location for the purpose of water application uniformity the cumulative kinetic energy and precipitation duration at this point would have also increased a lot which would put the area at an increased potential risk of surface runoff and soil erosion 4 discussion 4 1 effects of operating pressure on radial sp distribution operating pressure has been reported to be a significant influence on water droplet size distribution martín benito et al 2014 while its influence on kinetic energy distribution has been rarely mentioned especially for big gun sprinklers the radial sp distribution of 50 pyc under different operating pressures from 0 1 mpa to 0 45 mpa can be viewed in fig 14 the distribution pattern viewed in the figure of specific power conforms to a triangular form under each operating pressure with a gradually increasing trend at the front and a rapidly falling at the end of the throw range the values of sp under 0 1 mpa and 0 15 mpa were significantly higher than those under other working conditions reaching almost twice the working condition values fig 14 also presents the peak value of sp under each operating pressure the peak value of sp initially dropped rapidly from 0 2 jm 2 s 1 to less than 0 1 jm 2 s 1 when the operating pressure reached 0 2 mpa the peak value of sp fluctuated within a range of 0 05 0 1 jm 2 s 1 it is understood that along with the increase of sprinkler s working pressure the peak sp is not always decreasing due to the intensive energy distribution 0 1 mpa and 0 15 mpa were determined to be unacceptable options for working pressure what should be noted is the application rate adopted here is an average value over a certain period of time which means the value of sp is also an average value the instantaneous application rate as well as the instantaneous sp can however be several times higher than the average values providing a potential maximum value of application rate of 1 jm 2 s 1 under relatively low working pressure according to the research work of thompson et al 2001 when sp reaches 0 6 jm 2 s 1 or higher the infiltrated depth will approach a constant value and may cause large runoff and sediment yield even though the low operating pressure had the potential to reduce the energy consumption of the unit the low pressure is still inadvisable considering the side effects of the kinetic energy on infiltration rate and runoff for this 50 pyc big size sprinkler the minimum required working pressure is 0 2 mpa 4 2 effects of operating pressure on cumulative kinetic energy due to the effect of operating pressure on radial range droplet distribution and sp distribution chen and wallender 1985 solomon et al 1985 kincaid et al 1996 the operating pressure would also show the impact on the cumulative kinetic energy of traveling big gun sprinkler the cumulative kinetic energy of the points perpendicular to the travel direction under 0 15 0 25 0 35 and 0 45 mpa were obtained fig 15 influenced by the spray range the spraying domain area increased with the increase of operating pressure for the big gun sprinkler working at a pressure of 0 15 mpa the cumulative kinetic energy of each point was found to be significantly higher than that working under pressures of 0 25 0 35 or 0 45 mpa the peak value was 528 3j m2 located a distance of 17 m from the travel lane the cumulative kinetic energy under 0 25 and 0 45 mpa were relatively lower and the maximum cumulative kinetic energy of the spray gun was 371 2 and 368 3 j m2 located at 19 m and 25 m from the travel lane respectively the cumulative kinetic energy of the gun sprinkler at 0 35 mpa was found to be significantly higher than that at working pressures of 0 25 and 0 45 mpa this can be explained by the distribution of radial sp of the spray gun at different operating pressures fig 14 when the sprinkler was working at 0 15 mpa the radial sp was significantly higher than the rest the spraying tongue was not fully broken and both the water distribution and kinetic energy were intensively distributed meaning the big gun sprinkler was still not working normally when the working pressure increased to 0 25 mpa the range of big gun sprinkler increased significantly and the value of sp fell expectedly a further increase in the working pressure up to 0 35 mpa the range of the gun sprinkler was higher than 0 25 mpa but the sp showed no obvious changes when the working pressure of the gun was 0 45 mpa sp of the radial points decreases further and the range increased only slightly it can be viewed in eq 15 that the irrigation duration increases with an increase of range additionally the points under 0 35 mpa working pressure have experienced both relatively high sp and long irrigation duration thus making the cumulative kinetic energy higher than 0 25 and 0 45 mpa in summary the operating pressure exerts an effect on the cumulative kinetic energy of the spraying area by influencing the value of sp and the length of precipitation duration 4 3 effects of rotation sector angle and recycling speed on kinetic energy distribution in order to keep the surface of the travel lane dry during the recycling process the big gun sprinkler was always adjusted to do fan shaped spray but there was no clear requirement for the fan angle value the typical rotation sector angle provided by the north carolina state university was 180 to 315 and prado et al 2012 shows that radiation angle of 180 to 230 can obtain a higher water application uniformity ge et al 2016 s study shows that with the increase of the rotation angle the irrigation uniformity increases slightly the cumulative kinetic energy and rainfall duration of different locations with the big gun sprinkler rotating at a sector angle of 180 220 and 270 were calculated according to the above mentioned method fig 16 the cumulative kinetic energy distribution varied from trapezoidal form to triangular form with the increase of rotation sector angle also the uniformity coefficient correspondingly reduced from 78 to 69 5 which was consistent with the change of cumulative water distribution that varied from triangular form to trapezoidal form fig 16b shows the precipitation duration at different radiation angles with the increase of the radiation angle the precipitation of each point also increased significantly which effectively reduced the average value of sp taking the location 21 m away from the travel lane as an example the precipitation duration of 180 220 and 270 were respectively 34 2 45 7 and 65 7 min and the cumulative kinetic energies were 295 7 356 2 and 384 7 j m2 the average values of sp were 0 144 0 129 and 0 0976 j m2s respectively although the cumulative kinetic energy had increased the average sp at this point decreased more obviously this further illustrates that the rotation sector angle should not be too small from the perspective of kinetic energy distribution different crops have different irrigation quotas which put forward the requirement that the sprinkler should maintain different walking speeds to match the crops need to avoid excessive or insufficient irrigation the walking speed can generally be controlled by the water turbine or the drive motor how does the change in walking speed affect the distribution of kinetic energy compare the energy distribution when the sprinkler cart was traveling at speeds of 20 40 and 60 m h as viewed in fig 17 the cumulative kinetic energy at each point is inversely proportional to the walking speed of the sprinkler cart while the shape and uniformity of the cumulative kinetic energy shows no change the cumulative kinetic energy at each point of the 20 m h traveling speed was three times greater than the energy at a speed of 60 m h fig 17a which is the same as the effect of walking speed on irrigation depth similarly the irrigation time at each point was inversely proportional to the walking speed as the walking speed increases the irrigation time at each point showed a proportional decrease fig 17b this result is consistent with the finding of dogan et al 2008 on water application depth apart from producing the expected doubled water depth when the speed of a linear moving irrigation system was halved there was no other significant effects 4 4 comparison with center pivot used spray plate sprinkler king and bjorneberg 2010 and king 2016 have carried out extensive studies on the kinetic energy distribution of some commercially used spray plate sprinklers which provided a basis for reasonable selection of sprinklers for a center pivot in this study the mobile cumulative kinetic energy of big gun sprinkler was compared with the moving spray plate kinetic energy to further analyze its kinetic energy distribution characteristics fig 18 a shows the process curve of sp and ke for five types of spray plate sprinklers at an irrigation depth of 25 mm fig 18b is the process curve of sp and ke of four points at different distances to the travel lane with a same irrigation depth of 25 mm the transient sp of big gun sprinkler is smaller than the sp value of a spray plate sprinkler for a big gun sprinkler the value of sp is around 0 05 0 12 j m2s while for sprinklers such as senninger i wbo and nelson the value of sp is 0 15 0 3 j m2s among which sp of a fixed plate spray sprinkler nelson d3000 is even higher reaching almost to 0 8 j m2s for a same irrigation depth the irrigation time at each point of the big gun sprinkler is much longer reaching 8 10 times as much as that of senninger and nelson nozzles the kinetic energy carried by the same amount of water from the big gun sprinkler is also higher than that from senninger or nelson nozzles which is about 2 4 times for the same application depth of 25 mm ke of each point increases with an increase of distance from the travel lane the cumulative kinetic energy and distance to the travel lane show an exponential relationship as shown in eq 30 overall compared with the spray plate sprinklers the big gun sprinkler presents a milder precipitation process but the precipitation lasts longer and carries more kinetic energy 30 e k 457 41 e 0 043 l r 2 0 997 4 5 effects of kinetic energy on infiltration rate mohammed and kohl 1987 have studied the effect of ke and kea on infiltration rates the changes in the rate of infiltration with the increase of ke was obtained for four values of kea as shown in fig 19 a according to mohammed s experimental data the relationship among the infiltration rate ke and kea were fitted to obtain the following equation eq 31 the infiltration rate was affected by both ke and kea the weight coefficient of ke is about 0 768 and the weight coefficient of kea was about 0 232 when the value of kea was less than 12 2 j m2mm or when the value of ke was less than 135 8 j m2 their influence on the infiltration rate was negligible 31 ir 147 1 ke a 12 2 ke 135 8 34 1 113 1 k e 135 8 357 2 ke a 12 2 ke 135 8 113 34 1 1 k e a 12 2 17 7 2 ke a 12 2 ke 135 8 34 1 1 k e a 12 2 17 7 2 113 1 k e 135 8 357 2 ke a 12 2 ke 135 8 where ir is the infiltration rate mm h it was found that the value of kea under the spraying of a big gun sprinkler increased with an increase of distance to the travel lane and decreased with the increase of the working pressure the range of kea in this study was 11 74 60 09 j m2mm among which the value of kea in a large spraying area was higher than the upper limit in mohammed s test which was 24 4 j m2mm fig 19b assuming the above equation is valid while kea is higher than 24 4 j m2mm induce the value of ke and kea into eq 31 and the infiltration rate of each point perpendicular to the travel lane can be obtained as shown in fig 20 the infiltration rate of each point decreases linearly with the increase of the distance from the travel lane and the fitting formula is y 2 7461x 90 735 r2 0 991 the infiltration rate is less than 40 mm h at the outer 1 3 of spraying area and even falls down to around 20 mm h at the outer end zone of the spraying area which means that the surface ponding and runoff are more easily generated during the irrigation process 5 conclusions the radial water application distribution droplet size distribution and droplet velocity distribution of a big gun sprinkler were measured in this study based on the experimental data an equation of radial kinetic energy was summarized the radial sp at any distance to the sprinkler can be achieved by introducing two parameters to this equation those two parameters being the operating pressure and the application rate by considering the operation characteristics of a big gun sprinkler and a hose drawn traveler a calculation method to determine the continuous moving kinetic energy distribution of the big gun sprinkler was proposed test results showed that the calculation method predicted both the shape and numerical values accurately the cumulative kinetic energy perpendicular to the travel lane increased first and then decreased and the volume specific kinetic energy increased with an increase in distance from the travel lane the process curve of sp for points at different distances from the travel lane presented significant differences the distribution of kinetic energy and specific power process varied greatly even though the locations were relatively close to each other the cumulative kinetic energy and sp of the water could be quite different even if the water application depth was the same similarly for the points with the same cumulative kinetic energy there existed obvious differences in the depth of water and the dynamic process curve of sp the influence of operating pressure on kinetic energy has been investigated for the operating pressures lower than 0 2 mpa the peak value of radial sp remained at a high level while the peak value fell dramatically and showed fluctuating changes while the operating pressure was found to be higher than 0 2 mpa the operating pressure showed effects on the cumulative kinetic energy by influencing the value of sp and precipitation duration the cumulative kinetic energy increased with the increase of rotation angle with an increase of recycling speed both the cumulative kinetic energy and irrigation duration decreased proportionally compared with the spray plate sprinklers utilized in center pivots the big gun sprinkler showed a milder precipitation process but the precipitation lasted longer and carried more energy reaching 2 4 times for the same amount of water the infiltration rate under the big gun sprinkler decreased linearly with the increase in distance from the travel lane at the end zone of the spray area the infiltration rate dropped to around 20 mm h indicating a high risk of surface ponding and runoff during the irrigation process acknowledgements this work was supported by national science technology support plan projects 2015bad22b01 02
