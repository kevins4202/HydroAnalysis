2930,global climate change may influence the distribution and water uptake patterns of plants in the rocky mountainous areas of north china the change in climatic conditions with elevation in mountainous areas provides an opportunity to understand the potential impacts of global climate change on plant water use to assess the responses and adaptations of plants to the elevations three aspects were investigated for platycladus orientalis l franco and pinus tabuliformis carrière namely source of water used water use efficiency wue and specific leaf area sla these aspects were assessed for the selected species along an elevation from 100 to 1000 m 100 400 700 and 1000 m in a seasonally arid area the results showed that the soil water contents were significantly and positively correlated with the elevation p 0 05 the soil water content increased by 0 33 for every 100 m increase in elevation p orientalis l franco was sensitive to the change in elevation and showed plasticity with regard to the water source used while p tabuliformis carrière was not p orientalis mostly used water from the 60 100 cm soil layer 28 6 33 8 and groundwater 27 8 36 2 at four elevations the water utilization ratio of p orientalis at the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater decreased with elevation while that at the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers increased gradually with elevation the water sources of p tabuliformis exhibited no variation with elevation and growing stages p tabuliformis obtained over 60 of the water from the 60 100 cm soil layer 27 8 and groundwater 35 9 while small amounts were from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers the sla of p tabuliformis and p orientalis decreased by 0 73 and 0 70 cm2 g respectively for every 100 m elevation the sla and wue were significantly and negatively correlated with elevation at the same elevation range the sla of p tabuliformis was 1 5 higher than that of p orientalis while the wue of p tabuliformis was 3 4 lower than that of p orientalis the results indicated that p orientalis was better adapted to environmental changes than p tabuliformis p orientalis can change its source of water improve wue and reduce sla to adapt to the change in elevations showing a synergistic adaptation to elevation however p tabuliformis showed trade off adaptation to elevation by adjusting only wue and sla keywords elevation water sources water use efficiency leaf specific area data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the elevation has a very significant impact on environmental factors such as atmospheric temperature atmospheric humidity soil water and solar radiation midolo et al 2019a several researchers have reported that the elevation may affect local precipitation by changing microclimatic conditions e g uplift ryelet al 2003 evaristo et al 2016 szymczak et al 2020 moreover changes in hydrological processes and vegetation species along different elevations may affect the relationship between species and water in the rhizosphere dawson and ehleringer 1991 dickman et al 2015 robbins and dinneny 2018 sun et al 2018 chen et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 numerous researchers were concerned that the global climate change effect may restrict the water use adaptability of plant species to environmental variations indeed this has become a reality in some regions as reported by mills et al 2018 szymczak et al 2020 showed that water availability tends to be more restricted in the highest elevation making tree species vulnerable to climate change however quercus mongolica fisch ex ledeb has the high ability to use water from different soil layers along elevations since it has dimorphic roots zhou et al 2019 whereas zhu et al 2016 showed no response of water use by medicago sativa l along elevations water use efficiency wue is an important parameter for assessing the adaptability of plant species to water use changes philips et al 2005 it is also one of the important parameters for measuring the relationship between water and the carbon cycle keenan et al 2013 wue has been widely used in ecological and hydrological studies tarin et al 2019 indeed with the development of stable isotope techniques short duration wue can be determined using the stable carbon isotope δ13c composition of plant leaves gessler et al 2014 the normal physiological activities of plants may be disturbed by changes in the water environment resulting in abnormally high or low wue brienen 2017 kwak 2016 liu et al 2021 henn et al 2018 reported that potential changes in forest structure with elevation could lead to changes in plant leaf morphology and the carbon water relationship at the plant atmosphere interface several studies have demonstrated that the wue of trees at high elevations is more sensitive to climate change than those at lower elevations körner et al 1988 rowland et al 2015 indeed the wue of trees at low elevations is mainly affected by available soil water while that of trees at high elevations is mainly affected by physiological factors wright et al 2017 sun et al 2019 however due to the differences in climate and microenvironment in different regions this pattern is not valid in all regions choukri et al 2020 for example the wue of juniperus tibetica kom was constrained by both soil water and precipitation at high elevations in arid and semi arid areas midolo et al 2019a 2019b laura et al 2016 found that the increase in available soil water would reduce the wue of plants in addition sun et al 2019 revealed a lack of significant difference in the wue response of trees to climatic variables between different elevation values in addition some plant species can adapt their leaf morphology to changes in ecological conditions induced by changes in elevation pompa et al 2021 in fact cui et al 2018 found that the leaf length width ratio and leaf mass per area of trees were significantly lower at 2750 and 3050 m elevation respectively than those at other elevations although plant species have shown some degree of adaptation to changes in water availability using water at different soil depths and adjusting wue the confounding effects of global climate change and elevation are not well known for example there may be a tradeoff between carbon assimilation and water use therefore it is important to investigate the adaptation of plant species water use to elevation changes the objectives of this study are i to determine water uptake patterns of coniferous under different elevations ii to explore the relationship between the water source and wue of tree species as well as their adaptation to the effects of elevation on climatic variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was carried out at an experimental station located in a rocky and mountainous area 40 03 n 116 05 e in the jiufeng national forest in china the study area lies within a temperate humid monsoon climate zone the average annual temperature was 11 6 with maximum and minimum values of 41 6 and 11 6 respectively the average annual precipitation was 660 mm with approximately 70 of the annual precipitation occurring from june to september the annual potential evapotranspiration ranged from 1200 to 1600 mm on the other hand the elevation of the study area ranges from 43 to 1153 m indeed tree species composition varies along the elevation in the study area with a mixture of coniferous and broadleaved species at low elevations common tree species include mainly pinus tabuliformis carrière platycladus orientalis l franco q variabilis and robinia pseudoacacia l while the non tree species such as vitex negundo l var heterophylla franch rehder broussonetia papyrifera l l hér ex vent and rhamnus parvifolia bunge are present in the forest understory tree species diversity tends to decrease with elevation coniferous trees including p tabuliformis and p orientalis dominate high elevation areas in addition there is a transition in the parent rock from granite and tuff to volcanic angle and diabase with increasing elevation accompanied with decreasing in soil depth from 60 to 40 cm depth in cinnamon and brown soils respectively on the other hand the upper layers of the clay dominated soils of the study area are characterized by relatively high soil organic contents while the deeper horizons have high gravel contents compared to the upper horizons 2 2 experimental design due to the absence of broad leaved forests in high elevation areas the selected plots consisted of coniferous forests of p tabuliformis and p orientalis to assess the driving factors of water use by plants at different elevations four elevations 100 400 700 and 1000 m were established in the rocky mountain area in addition three 20 m 20 m plots of tree species were established at each elevation with a stand density of 870 n hm2 all the 12 experimental plots were located in the middle of sunny slopes with an average slope of 5 fig 1 in addition four weather stations were installed in the open area at the four elevations providing real time monitoring of meteorological parameters namely precipitation mm temperature total solar radiation air w m2 relative humidity and wind speed m s with a 30 min interval table 1 the water table depths at the four plots ranged from 4 to 8 m in order to better reflect the response of plant water use to environmental factors and to determine the impact of altitude variations on plant water use samples of soil branch bedrock fissure water and leaves were collected at different growth stages according to the vegetation growing season in the study area the annual growth stages of p tabuliformis and p orientalis can be classified into three stages namely early april and may middle june to september and last october and november growth stages 2 3 branche soil and bedrock fissure water sampling branch soil and bedrock fissure water samples were collected on typical sunny days each month during the plant growing season in 2018 normal water year in total 9 sampling campaigns were conducted at each growth stage at each experimental plot three mature plants with near average height and diameter at breast height dbh were selected from p tabuliformis and p orientalis tree species moreover three lignified branches about 4 6 cm were selected from each plant the green parts of the collected branches were removed by pruning while the xylem was retained on the other hand soil samples were collected in three replicates at 0 5 1 m from the selected plants from 6 consecutive soil layers 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm using a soil auger the collected soil samples were divided into three parts the first part of the soil samples was placed in a 50 ml sampling tube then sealed with parafilm and stored at 4 c in the laboratory for stable isotope analyses while the second part was placed in an aluminum box for soil water content swc determination using the gravimetric method the remaining part was used to determine soil texture as well as soil organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium contents at the same time as collecting branch and soil samples three bedrock fissure water samples groundwater were collected from nearly the sample plots the collected branches and bedrock fissure water samples were placed into a 50 ml sampling tube and then sealed with parafilm and stored at 4 c in the laboratory for stable isotope analyses 2 4 determination of isotopic values and discrimination of water sources before isotopic analyses water from soil and branches was extracted using the low temperature vacuum condensation method the δ2h and δ18o in the branch soil and bedrock fissure water samples were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr dli 100 usa all isotopic values were normalized to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow scale and reported in the units of standard parts per thousand relative to vsmow the error values were 0 32 and 0 17 for 2h and 18o respectively the isotopic ratio was calculated using the following formula 1 δ x r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δx is the isotopic ratio δ2h or δ18o of the sample r sample and r standard are the isotopic value 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the sample and standard vsmow respectively soil water and groundwater can be absorbed by plant roots and transported upward to the xylem therefore the isotopic compositions of branch water can provide information on water sources in addition the mixsiar model can be used to determine the contribution of water sources to tree water uptake based on the conservation of mass principle phillips gregg 2003 in this study the water sources with no significant difference in isotopic values were first combined and then their contribution ratios were calculated by the mixsiar model using the following formulas 2 δx c1δx1 c2δx2 c3δx3 c4δx4 c5δx5 3 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 1 where δx is the δ2h δ18o ratio of branch water x1 x2 x3 x4 and x5 are the δ2h δ18o ratio of each potential water source c1 c 2 c3 c4 and c5 are the water absorption ratio of trees according to each potential water source 2 5 sampling and analysis of leaves kwak 2016 and laura et al 2016 showed a good linear relationship between δ13c and the wue of leaves the δ13c composition in leaves can therefore be used to determine the wue of plants during soil sampling mature annual leaf samples were collected from three plants randomly selected then placed in aluminum boxes some of the collected leaves were used to determine carbon isotope while the remaining part was used to determine the specific leaf area sla leaf samples intended for isotopic analysis were cleaned dried in an oven at 70 to a constant weight ground and sieved through a 0 1 mm mesh the carbon isotope composition in leaves was analyzed using a stable carbon isotope analyzer ccia 36d ep los gatos research inc usa the error values of the measured carbon isotopic values were within 0 03 the remaining plant leaves were stored in darkness at 5 for 12 h after removing the water on the leaf surface using a filter paper and recording the fresh weight the leaves were subsequently oven dried at 80 for 24 h and then measured for weight the leaf area was calculated using winfolia 2007 after being scanned using an epsonperfection v700 photo scanner the sla was calculated using the following formula 4 sla s m where s and m are the leaf area cm2 and dry weight g respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 16 0 the descriptive statistics function was applied to calculate the mean and standard deviation values for each set of replicates moreover a two way anova was performed to assess the effect of growth stage and soil layer on swc n 9 for each soil profile this statistical test was used also to analyze the differences in carbon isotope ratios n 27 for each sampling date considering tree species and growth stage as independent factors in addition a three way anova was used to analyze the differences in the absorption ratio of trees to water sources n 9 for each soil stratum using soil layer tree species and growth stages as independent factors regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between the swc water source δ13c sla and elevation r 2 and p values were also computed using the spss 16 0 software all the data used followed normal distribution and homogeneity of variance 3 results 3 1 swc variation in the woodland along the elevation the results revealed an increase in the swc along the elevation fig 2 the average swc values observed at 100 400 700 and 1000 m were 13 16 13 84 15 68 and 16 20 respectively the swc at 1000 m was 17 8 higher than that observed at 100 m indicating that the swc increased by 0 33 for every 100 m elevation on the other hand the swc observed in the early growth stage was significantly lower and higher than those observed in the middle and last growth stages respectively p 0 05 indeed the swc value at the middle growth stage was 21 4 and 16 1 higher than those observed at the early and last growth stages respectively the swc initially increased reaching a maximum value at the 40 60 cm soil layer then decreased with increasing soil depth moreover the maximum swc at 100 400 700 and 1000 m were 17 8 18 1 24 7 and 24 3 respectively the swc observed at 40 60 cm was about 50 higher than those observed at 0 10 and 100 120 cm in addition there were no significant differences in the swc between the 0 10 cm and 100 120 cm soil layers at the early growth stage p 0 05 while the swc at 100 120 cm was significantly higher than that observed at 0 10 cm in the middle and last growth stages p 0 05 3 2 proportion of water sources absorbed by trees along the elevation according to the results of the mixsiar model different water use patterns were observed in p orientalis and p tabuliformis fig 3 water use by p orientalis from the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater decreased with elevation while water use from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers increased gradually with elevation most of the water used by p orientalis was from the 60 100 cm soil layer 28 6 33 8 and groundwater 27 8 36 2 at all elevation classes however less water amount was observed at these elevations from the 0 20 cm 13 8 22 9 and 20 60 cm 16 1 20 7 soil layers the water used by p orientalis from the 60 100 cm layer and groundwater in the middle growth stage was lower than that observed in the early and last growth stages contrary to p orientalis there were no significant differences in the water amount used by p tabuliformis between soil depths elevation and growing stages p 0 05 most of the water used by p tabuliformis was from the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater while small water amounts were used from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers over the period of the investigation the average utilization ratios of water sources in the 0 20 20 60 and 60 100 cm soil layers were 14 1 22 1 and 27 8 respectively while that from groundwater was 35 9 3 3 δ13c variations in tree species along the elevation the results showed a variation in the δ13c composition in p orientalis and p tabuliformis with elevation and growth stages fig 4 indeed δ13c in p orientalis and p tabuliformis decreased by 0 80 and 0 56 respectively for every 100 m of elevation the δ13c values of p orientalis and p tabuliformis were 23 5 and 23 9 respectively at 100 m elevation higher by 21 31 and 30 20 than those observed at 1000 m elevation in addition the δ13c values of p orientalis and p tabuliformis at the last growth stage were 4 1 higher and 3 4 lower than those observed in the early and middle growth stages respectively the δ13c value of p orientalis was higher than that of p tabuliformis indicating a higher wue of p orientalis than that of p tabuliformis 3 4 variation in sla of trees along the elevation the sla values of p tabuliformis and p orientalis were negatively correlated with elevation r 2 0 91 fig 5 the results showed decreases in the sla values of p tabuliformis and p orientalis by 0 73 and 0 70 cm2 g respectively for every 100 m of elevation moreover the sla values of p tabuliformis and p orientalis at 100 m elevation were 64 6 and 63 3 cm2 g which were 10 21 and 9 95 higher respectively than those observed at 1000 m elevation at the same elevation the sla of p tabuliformis was 1 5 higher than that of p orientalis on the other hand although the sla values of p tabuliformis and p orientalis showed no significant differences between the early and last growth stages p 0 05 they were significantly higher than those observed in the middle growth stage p 0 05 the slope of sla of p tabuliformis was larger than that of p orientalis over the observation period indicating that p tabuliformis was the most sensitive to elevation 3 5 effect of elevation on plant water use the results showed a significant positive correlation between the swc and elevation r 2 0 67 p 0 05 the slope of the regression line for p tabuliformis was higher than that of p orientalis indicating that the swc for p tabuliformis may be more responsive to elevation fig 7 the sla absorption ratio of water source and carbon isotope ratios showed significant negative correlations with elevation r 2 0 67 p 0 05 the negative effects associated with the changes reported above may result in a positive correlation between swc and elevation fig 6 the differences in the slope of the regression line i e elevation versus sla between tree species indicated that sla was significantly more responsive to elevation than the source of water used p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 water uptake by trees along the elevation water utilization by p orientalis from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers increased gradually with elevation p orientalis showed a sensitivity to the change in the elevation this may be related to the root distributions and moisture conditions in the soil layers beyer et al 2018 the distribution of tree roots affects the extent to which water can be absorbed indeed liu et al 2018 revealed that 50 of the lateral roots of p orientalis were distributed in the surface layer in addition the results showed that swc values in the high elevation were higher than those observed in the low elevation indicating that the water source of p orientalis was sensitive to the swc in the surface layer cuneo et al 2018 found that the water absorption capacity of plant root hair tissue was related to humidity while drought stress was associated with limited absorption by the roots p orientalis may absorb water from both shallow and deep soil layers at higher elevations for two reasons firstly the energy required to absorb water from a shallow soil source is lower than that required for a deeper soil source secondly the lower swc was not enough to activate the water absorption capacity of surface roots at low elevation while the water absorption characteristics of surface roots were activated by a high swc at high elevation feng et al 2017 hafner et al 2020 this pattern of water use by p orientalis was therefore consistent with what could be considered a dimorphic root system trees can preferentially absorb the most available and stable water sources song et al 2016 barbeta et al 2019 this finding explains why p orientalis absorbs water from surface soil layers with high swcs and changes its water sources to deeper soil layers under drought conditions during the growing season all these findings were consistent with the plasticity characteristics of p orientalis these characteristics were also observed in other tree species in several regions nie et al 2011 moreno et al 2012 yang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 maría et al 2019 liu et al 2020 this water use strategy not only allowed plants to resist drought stress but also reduced water competition with other tree species in contrast to p orientalis the root system of p tabuliformis typically has an obvious vertical main root taproot and smaller secondary roots the depth of the vertical main root can reach 1 m while some roots almost reach the parent material layer qi et al 2020 the water uptake by developed deep root systems of p tabuliformis may have counteracted the effect of water changes p tabuliformis can therefore uptake most water from deep soil layers and groundwater at low and high elevations previous studies have demonstrated that most plants tend to absorb water from deep soil layers with high and stable water content to maintain their growth song et al 2016 beyer et al 2018 barbeta et al 2019 pan et al 2020 the study area experienced obvious seasonal precipitation and a long period of low rainfall resulting in lower swcs in the surface soil layers than those in the deep soil layers p tabuliformis may have evolved to use deep soil water and groundwater as its main water sources to meet its physiological needs this result was consistent with the findings reported in previous studies showing that q variabilis tended to absorb water from deep soil layers without any seasonal changes in water uptakes liu et al 2018 2021 the water use patterns of p orientalis and p tabuliformis may be the result of long term adaptation to environmental conditions long term natural selection and adaptation have resulted in the ability of p orientalis to absorb water under various water conditions as global climate change has increased the frequency of extreme precipitation and long term drought events therefore p orientalis may be adapted more effectively to future climate change than p tabuliformis however the quantitative relationship between tree roots swc and water sources was complex requiring further studies 4 2 response of plant water use to the elevation the sla of p tabuliformis and p orientalis decreased gradually with increasing elevation suggesting an adaptation strategy to the high light and low temperature environment at high elevation table 1 indeed the light and radiation are more intense at higher elevations than those at lower elevations decreasing transpiration rates of plants by reducing leaf areas in contrast plants can adapt to relatively low light and radiation levels at low elevations by increasing leaf areas callis duehl et al 2017 garcía et al 2021 in addition poorter et al 2009 demonstrated that a water deficient environment can also reduce sla the results of our study revealed a significantly higher effect of radiation on sla than that of swc resulting in higher sla at 100 m elevation midolo et al 2019 also reported that plants are able to intercept high and low levels of light energy levels in a low and high light environment by increasing and decreasing their sla respectively the soil quality at higher elevations was poorer table 1 while the swc and sla were higher and lower respectively at higher elevations these results were slightly different from those reported by garcía et al 2021 which may be due to the dual effects of soil moisture and the availability of nutrients the n p of soil increased with elevation showing an opposite pattern to that of the swc indeed soil quality has a greater impact on sla than on swc ordoñez et al 2010 alonso forn et al 2020 low n p at high elevations caused a decrease in the nitrogen and phosphorus contents from plants to leaves which may limit the leaf area wu et al 2020 pointed out that to mitigate tissue damage caused by high light intensities plants at high elevations can reduce the allocation of n to the photosynthetic system and increase the allocation to protective structural components resulting in a decrease in the photosynthetic carbon sequestration and wue this finding is consistent with those revealed in the present study in fact p tabuliformis and p orientalis at low elevation exhibited higher wue than those at high elevation xu et al 2021 this can also explain why the wue in the middle growth period rainy season was lower than those observed in other growth stages in addition changes in environmental conditions associated with an increase in elevation such as lower temperatures lower water availability and higher ultraviolet radiation may reduce the photosynthetic capacity of leaves resulting in lower wue in the same habitat the sla and wue of p tabuliformis were higher and lower respectively than those of p orientalis indicating that the adaptability of p orientalis to water conditions was better than that of p tabuliformis this result was consistent with the findings reported by wright et al 2017 showing that plants with low sla were better adapted to low swcs and drought conditions than those with high sla liu et al 2021 showed that both wue and depth of water use ranges of p orientalis were higher than those of p tabuliformis our investigation revealed that p orientalis covered a larger area than p tabuliformis in northern china p orientalis showed a synergistic adaptation to the elevation by changing the depth of water sources wue and sla however p tabuliformis showed a trade off in adaptation to elevation by adjusting only wue and sla 5 conclusions in this study stable isotopes were used to determine the water sources and wue of coniferous tree species as well as their sla response to the elevation in a seasonally arid area the results revealed a significant positive correlation between swc and elevation in addition p orientalis was sensitive to elevation changes and exhibited plasticity to water sources p orientalis mostly used water from the 60 100 cm soil layer 28 6 33 8 and groundwater 27 8 36 2 at all four elevations considered in this study the water utilization ratio of p orientalis at the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater decreased with elevation while that at 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers increased gradually with elevation in addition there was no variation in the water source of p tabuliformis with elevation and growth stages most water used by p tabuliformis was from the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater while small water amounts were derived from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers the sla and wue of p tabuliformis and p orientalis showed negative correlations with elevation moreover the wue of p orientalis was higher than that of p tabuliformis our results demonstrated that the adaptability of p orientalis to the aridity was better than that of p tabuliformis indeed p orientalis can change its water source and adjust wue and sla to adapt to the change in elevation suggesting a synergistic adaptation of p orientalis to elevation in contrast p tabuliformis showed a trade off in adaptation to the elevations by adjusting only wue and sla the outcomes

2930,global climate change may influence the distribution and water uptake patterns of plants in the rocky mountainous areas of north china the change in climatic conditions with elevation in mountainous areas provides an opportunity to understand the potential impacts of global climate change on plant water use to assess the responses and adaptations of plants to the elevations three aspects were investigated for platycladus orientalis l franco and pinus tabuliformis carrière namely source of water used water use efficiency wue and specific leaf area sla these aspects were assessed for the selected species along an elevation from 100 to 1000 m 100 400 700 and 1000 m in a seasonally arid area the results showed that the soil water contents were significantly and positively correlated with the elevation p 0 05 the soil water content increased by 0 33 for every 100 m increase in elevation p orientalis l franco was sensitive to the change in elevation and showed plasticity with regard to the water source used while p tabuliformis carrière was not p orientalis mostly used water from the 60 100 cm soil layer 28 6 33 8 and groundwater 27 8 36 2 at four elevations the water utilization ratio of p orientalis at the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater decreased with elevation while that at the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers increased gradually with elevation the water sources of p tabuliformis exhibited no variation with elevation and growing stages p tabuliformis obtained over 60 of the water from the 60 100 cm soil layer 27 8 and groundwater 35 9 while small amounts were from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers the sla of p tabuliformis and p orientalis decreased by 0 73 and 0 70 cm2 g respectively for every 100 m elevation the sla and wue were significantly and negatively correlated with elevation at the same elevation range the sla of p tabuliformis was 1 5 higher than that of p orientalis while the wue of p tabuliformis was 3 4 lower than that of p orientalis the results indicated that p orientalis was better adapted to environmental changes than p tabuliformis p orientalis can change its source of water improve wue and reduce sla to adapt to the change in elevations showing a synergistic adaptation to elevation however p tabuliformis showed trade off adaptation to elevation by adjusting only wue and sla keywords elevation

such as atmospheric temperature atmospheric humidity soil water and solar radiation midolo et al 2019a several researchers have reported that the elevation may affect local precipitation by changing microclimatic conditions e g uplift ryelet al 2003 evaristo et al 2016 szymczak et al 2020 moreover changes in hydrological processes and vegetation species along different elevations may affect the relationship between species and water in the rhizosphere dawson and ehleringer 1991 dickman et al 2015 robbins and dinneny 2018 sun et al 2018 chen et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 numerous researchers were concerned that the global climate change effect may restrict the water use adaptability of plant species to environmental variations indeed this has become a reality in some regions as reported by mills et al 2018 szymczak et al 2020 showed that water availability tends to be more restricted in the highest elevation making tree species vulnerable to climate change however quercus mongolica fisch ex ledeb has the high ability to use water from different soil layers along elevations since it has dimorphic roots zhou et al 2019 whereas zhu et al 2016 showed no response of water use by

important parameters for measuring the relationship between water and the carbon cycle keenan et al 2013 wue has been widely used in ecological and hydrological studies tarin et al 2019 indeed with the development of stable isotope techniques short duration wue can be determined using the stable carbon isotope δ13c composition of plant leaves gessler et al 2014 the normal physiological activities of plants may be disturbed by changes in the water environment resulting in abnormally high or low wue brienen 2017 kwak 2016 liu et al 2021 henn et al 2018 reported that potential changes in forest structure with elevation could lead to changes in plant leaf morphology and the carbon water relationship at the plant atmosphere interface several studies have demonstrated that the wue of trees at high elevations is more sensitive to climate change than those at lower elevations körner et al 1988 rowland et al 2015 indeed the wue of trees at low elevations is mainly affected by available soil water while that of trees at high elevations is mainly affected by physiological factors wright et al 2017 sun et al 2019 however due to the differences in climate and microenvironment in different regions this pattern is not valid in all regions choukri et al 2020 for example the wue of juniperus tibetica kom was constrained by both soil water and precipitation at high elevations in arid and semi arid areas midolo et al 2019a 2019b laura et al 2016 found that the increase in available soil water would reduce the wue of plants in addition sun et al 2019 revealed a lack of significant difference in the wue response of trees to climatic variables between different elevation values in addition some plant species can adapt their leaf morphology to changes in ecological conditions induced by changes in elevation pompa et al 2021 in fact cui et al 2018 found that the leaf length width ratio and leaf mass per area of trees were significantly lower at 2750 and 3050 m elevation respectively than those at other elevations although plant species have shown some degree of adaptation to changes in water availability using water at different soil depths and adjusting wue the confounding effects of global climate change and elevation are not well known for example there may be a tradeoff between carbon assimilation and water use therefore it is important to investigate the adaptation of plant species water use to elevation changes the objectives of this study are i to determine water uptake patterns of coniferous under different elevations ii to explore the relationship between the water source and wue of tree species as well as their adaptation to the effects of elevation on climatic variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was carried out at an experimental station located in a rocky and mountainous area 40 03 n 116 05 e in the jiufeng national forest in china the study area lies within a temperate humid monsoon climate zone the average annual temperature was 11 6 with maximum and minimum values of 41 6 and 11 6 respectively the average annual precipitation was 660 mm with approximately 70 of the annual precipitation occurring from june to september the annual potential evapotranspiration ranged from 1200 to 1600 mm on the other hand the elevation of the study area ranges from 43 to 1153 m indeed tree species composition varies along the elevation in the study area with a mixture of coniferous and broadleaved species at low elevations common tree species include mainly pinus tabuliformis carrière platycladus orientalis l franco q variabilis and robinia pseudoacacia l while the non tree species such as vitex negundo l var heterophylla franch rehder broussonetia papyrifera l l hér ex vent and rhamnus parvifolia bunge are present in the forest understory tree species diversity tends to decrease with elevation coniferous trees including p tabuliformis and p orientalis dominate high elevation areas in addition there is a transition in the parent rock from granite and tuff to volcanic angle and diabase with increasing elevation accompanied with decreasing in soil depth from 60 to 40 cm depth in cinnamon and brown soils respectively on the other hand the upper layers of the clay dominated soils of the study area are characterized by relatively high soil organic contents while the deeper horizons have high gravel contents compared to the upper horizons 2 2 experimental design due to the absence of broad leaved forests in high elevation areas the selected plots consisted of coniferous forests of p tabuliformis and p orientalis to assess the driving factors of water use by plants at different elevations four elevations 100 400 700 and 1000 m were established in the rocky mountain area in addition three 20 m 20 m plots of tree species were established at each elevation with a stand density of 870 n hm2 all the 12 experimental plots were located in the middle of sunny slopes with an average slope of 5 fig 1 in addition four weather stations were installed in the open area at the four elevations providing real time monitoring of meteorological parameters namely precipitation mm temperature total solar radiation air w m2 relative humidity and wind speed m s with a 30 min interval table 1 the water table depths at the four plots ranged from 4 to 8 m in order to better reflect the response of plant water use to environmental factors and to determine the impact of altitude variations on plant water use samples of soil branch bedrock fissure water and leaves were collected at different growth stages according to the vegetation growing season in the study area the annual growth stages of p tabuliformis and p orientalis can be classified into three stages namely early april and may middle june to september and last october and november growth stages 2 3 branche soil and bedrock fissure water sampling branch soil and bedrock fissure water samples were collected on typical sunny days each month during the plant growing season in 2018 normal water year in total 9 sampling campaigns were conducted at each growth stage at each experimental plot three mature plants with near average height and diameter at breast height dbh were selected from p tabuliformis and p orientalis tree species moreover three lignified branches about 4 6 cm were selected from each plant the green parts of the collected branches were removed by pruning while the xylem was retained on the other hand soil samples were collected in three replicates at 0 5 1 m from the selected plants from 6 consecutive soil layers 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm using a soil auger the collected soil samples were divided into three parts the first part of the soil samples was placed in a 50 ml sampling tube then sealed with parafilm and stored at 4 c in the laboratory for stable isotope analyses while the second part was placed in an aluminum box for soil water content swc determination using the gravimetric method the remaining part was used to determine soil texture as well as soil organic matter total nitrogen total phosphorus and total potassium contents at the same time as collecting branch and soil samples three bedrock fissure water samples groundwater were collected from nearly the sample plots the collected branches and bedrock fissure water samples were placed into a 50 ml sampling tube and then sealed with parafilm and stored at 4 c in the laboratory for stable isotope analyses 2 4 determination of isotopic values and discrimination of water sources before isotopic analyses water from soil and branches was extracted using the low temperature vacuum condensation method the δ2h and δ18o in the branch soil and bedrock fissure water samples were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr dli 100 usa all isotopic values were normalized to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow scale and reported in the units of standard parts per thousand relative to vsmow the error values were 0 32 and 0 17 for 2h and 18o respectively the isotopic ratio was calculated using the following formula 1 δ x r sample r standard r standard 1000 where δx is the isotopic ratio δ2h or δ18o of the sample r sample and r standard are the isotopic value 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the sample and standard vsmow respectively soil water and groundwater can be absorbed by plant roots and transported upward to the xylem therefore the isotopic compositions of branch water can provide information on water sources in addition the mixsiar model can be used to determine the contribution of water sources to tree water uptake based on the conservation of mass principle phillips gregg 2003 in this study the water sources with no significant difference in isotopic values were first combined and then their contribution ratios were calculated by the mixsiar model using the following formulas 2 δx c1δx1 c2δx2 c3δx3 c4δx4 c5δx5 3 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 1 where δx is the δ2h δ18o ratio of branch water x1 x2 x3 x4 and x5 are the δ2h δ18o ratio of each potential water source c1 c 2 c3 c4 and c5 are the water absorption ratio of trees according to each potential water source 2 5 sampling and analysis of leaves kwak 2016 and laura et al 2016 showed a good linear relationship between δ13c and the wue of leaves the δ13c composition in leaves can therefore be used to determine the wue of plants during soil sampling mature annual leaf samples were collected from three plants randomly selected then placed in aluminum boxes some of the collected leaves were used to determine carbon isotope while the remaining part was used to determine the specific leaf area sla leaf samples intended for isotopic analysis were cleaned dried in an oven at 70 to a constant weight ground and sieved through a 0 1 mm mesh the carbon isotope composition in leaves was analyzed using a stable carbon isotope analyzer ccia 36d ep los gatos research inc usa the error values of the measured carbon isotopic values were within 0 03 the remaining plant leaves were stored in darkness at 5 for 12 h after removing the water on the leaf surface using a filter paper and recording the fresh weight the leaves were subsequently oven dried at 80 for 24 h and then measured for weight the leaf area was calculated using winfolia 2007 after being scanned using an epsonperfection v700 photo scanner the sla was calculated using the following formula 4 sla s m where s and m are the leaf area cm2 and dry weight g respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 16 0 the descriptive statistics function was applied to calculate the mean and standard deviation values for each set of replicates moreover a two way anova was performed to assess the effect of growth stage and soil layer on swc n 9 for each soil profile this statistical test was used also to analyze the differences in carbon isotope ratios n 27 for each sampling date considering tree species and growth stage as independent factors in addition a three way anova was used to analyze the differences in the absorption ratio of trees to water sources n 9 for each soil stratum using soil layer tree species and growth stages as independent factors regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between the swc water source δ13c sla and elevation r 2 and p values were also computed using the spss 16 0 software all the data used followed normal distribution and homogeneity of variance 3 results 3 1 swc variation in the woodland along the elevation the results revealed an increase in the swc along the elevation fig 2 the average swc values observed at 100 400 700 and 1000 m were 13 16 13 84 15 68 and 16 20 respectively the swc at 1000 m was 17 8 higher than that observed at 100 m indicating that the swc increased by 0 33 for every 100 m elevation on the other hand the swc observed in the early growth stage was significantly lower and higher than those observed in the middle and last growth stages respectively p 0 05 indeed the swc value at the middle growth stage was 21 4 and 16 1 higher than those observed at the early and last growth stages respectively the swc initially increased reaching a maximum value at the 40 60 cm soil layer then decreased with increasing soil depth moreover the maximum swc at 100 400 700 and 1000 m were 17 8 18 1 24 7 and 24 3 respectively the swc observed at 40 60 cm was about 50 higher than those observed at 0 10 and 100 120 cm in addition there were no significant differences in the swc between the 0 10 cm and 100 120 cm soil layers at the early growth stage p 0 05 while the swc at 100 120 cm was significantly higher than that observed at 0 10 cm in the middle and last growth stages p 0 05 3 2 proportion of water sources absorbed by trees along the elevation according to the results of the mixsiar model different water use patterns were observed in p orientalis and p tabuliformis fig 3 water use by p orientalis from the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater decreased with elevation while water use from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers increased gradually with elevation most of the water used by p orientalis was from the 60 100 cm soil layer 28 6 33 8 and groundwater 27 8 36 2 at all elevation classes however less water amount was observed at these elevations from the 0 20 cm 13 8 22 9 and 20 60 cm 16 1 20 7 soil layers the water used by p orientalis from the 60 100 cm layer and groundwater in the middle growth stage was lower than that observed in the early and last growth stages contrary to p orientalis there were no significant differences in the water amount used by p tabuliformis between soil depths elevation and growing stages p 0 05 most of the water used by p tabuliformis was from the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater while small water amounts were used from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers over the period of the investigation the average utilization ratios of water sources in the 0 20 20 60 and 60 100 cm soil layers were 14 1 22 1 and 27 8 respectively while that from groundwater was 35 9 3 3 δ13c variations in tree species along the elevation the results showed a variation in the δ13c composition in p orientalis and p tabuliformis with elevation and growth stages fig 4 indeed δ13c in p orientalis and p tabuliformis decreased by 0 80 and 0 56 respectively for every 100 m of elevation the δ13c values of p orientalis and p tabuliformis were 23 5 and 23 9 respectively at 100 m elevation higher by 21 31 and 30 20 than those observed at 1000 m elevation in addition the δ13c values of p orientalis and p tabuliformis at the last growth stage were 4 1 higher and 3 4 lower than those observed in the early and middle growth stages respectively the δ13c value of p orientalis was higher than that of p tabuliformis indicating a higher wue of p orientalis than that of p tabuliformis 3 4 variation in sla of trees along the elevation the sla values of p tabuliformis and p orientalis were negatively correlated with elevation r 2 0 91 fig 5 the results showed decreases in the sla values of p tabuliformis and p orientalis by 0 73 and 0 70 cm2 g respectively for every 100 m of elevation moreover the sla values of p tabuliformis and p orientalis at 100 m elevation were 64 6 and 63 3 cm2 g which were 10 21 and 9 95 higher respectively than those observed at 1000 m elevation at the same elevation the sla of p tabuliformis was 1 5 higher than that of p orientalis on the other hand although the sla values of p tabuliformis and p orientalis showed no significant differences between the early and last growth stages p 0 05 they were significantly higher than those observed in the middle growth stage p 0 05 the slope of sla of p tabuliformis was larger than that of p orientalis over the observation period indicating that p tabuliformis was the most sensitive to elevation 3 5 effect of elevation on plant water use the results showed a significant positive correlation between the swc and elevation r 2 0 67 p 0 05 the slope of the regression line for p tabuliformis was higher than that of p orientalis indicating that the swc for p tabuliformis may be more responsive to elevation fig 7 the sla absorption ratio of water source and carbon isotope ratios showed significant negative correlations with elevation r 2 0 67 p 0 05 the negative effects associated with the changes reported above may result in a positive correlation between swc and elevation fig 6 the differences in the slope of the regression line i e elevation versus sla between tree species indicated that sla was significantly more responsive to elevation than the source of water used p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 water uptake by trees along the elevation water utilization by p orientalis from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers increased gradually with elevation p orientalis showed a sensitivity to the change in the elevation this may be related to the root distributions and moisture conditions in the soil layers beyer et al 2018 the distribution of tree roots affects the extent to which water can be absorbed indeed liu et al 2018 revealed that 50 of the lateral roots of p orientalis were distributed in the surface layer in addition the results showed that swc values in the high elevation were higher than those observed in the low elevation indicating that the water source of p orientalis was sensitive to the swc in the surface layer cuneo et al 2018 found that the water absorption capacity of plant root hair tissue was related to humidity while drought stress was associated with limited absorption by the roots p orientalis may absorb water from both shallow and deep soil layers at higher elevations for two reasons firstly the energy required to absorb water from a shallow soil source is lower than that required for a deeper soil source secondly the lower swc was not enough to activate the water absorption capacity of surface roots at low elevation while the water absorption characteristics of surface roots were activated by a high swc at high elevation feng et al 2017 hafner et al 2020 this pattern of water use by p orientalis was therefore consistent with what could be considered a dimorphic root system trees can preferentially absorb the most available and stable water sources song et al 2016 barbeta et al 2019 this finding explains why p orientalis absorbs water from surface soil layers with high swcs and changes its water sources to deeper soil layers under drought conditions during the growing season all these findings were consistent with the plasticity characteristics of p orientalis these characteristics were also observed in other tree species in several regions nie et al 2011 moreno et al 2012 yang et al 2015 wang et al 2017 maría et al 2019 liu et al 2020 this water use strategy not only allowed plants to resist drought stress but also reduced water competition with other tree species in contrast to p orientalis the root system of p tabuliformis typically has an obvious vertical main root taproot and smaller secondary roots the depth of the vertical main root can reach 1 m while some roots almost reach the parent material layer qi et al 2020 the water uptake by developed deep root systems of p tabuliformis may have counteracted the effect of water changes p tabuliformis can therefore uptake most water from deep soil layers and groundwater at low and high elevations previous studies have demonstrated that most plants tend to absorb water from deep soil layers with high and stable water content to maintain their growth song et al 2016 beyer et al 2018 barbeta et al 2019 pan et al 2020 the study area experienced obvious seasonal precipitation and a long period of low rainfall resulting in lower swcs in the surface soil layers than those in the deep soil layers p tabuliformis may have evolved to use deep soil water and groundwater as its main water sources to meet its physiological needs this result was consistent with the findings reported in previous studies showing that q variabilis tended to absorb water from deep soil layers without any seasonal changes in water uptakes liu et al 2018 2021 the water use patterns of p orientalis and p tabuliformis may be the result of long term adaptation to environmental conditions long term natural selection and adaptation have resulted in the ability of p orientalis to absorb water under various water conditions as global climate change has increased the frequency of extreme precipitation and long term drought events therefore p orientalis may be adapted more effectively to future climate change than p tabuliformis however the quantitative relationship between tree roots swc and water sources was complex requiring further studies 4 2 response of plant water use to the elevation the sla of p tabuliformis and p orientalis decreased gradually with increasing elevation suggesting an adaptation strategy to the high light and low temperature environment at high elevation table 1 indeed the light and radiation are more intense at higher elevations than those at lower elevations decreasing transpiration rates of plants by reducing leaf areas in contrast plants can adapt to relatively low light and radiation levels at low elevations by increasing leaf areas callis duehl et al 2017 garcía et al 2021 in addition poorter et al 2009 demonstrated that a water deficient environment can also reduce sla the results of our study revealed a significantly higher effect of radiation on sla than that of swc resulting in higher sla at 100 m elevation midolo et al 2019 also reported that plants are able to intercept high and low levels of light energy levels in a low and high light environment by increasing and decreasing their sla respectively the soil quality at higher elevations was poorer table 1 while the swc and sla were higher and lower respectively at higher elevations these results were slightly different from those reported by garcía et al 2021 which may be due to the dual effects of soil moisture and the availability of nutrients the n p of soil increased with elevation showing an opposite pattern to that of the swc indeed soil quality has a greater impact on sla than on swc ordoñez et al 2010 alonso forn et al 2020 low n p at high elevations caused a decrease in the nitrogen and phosphorus contents from plants to leaves which may limit the leaf area wu et al 2020 pointed out that to mitigate tissue damage caused by high light intensities plants at high elevations can reduce the allocation of n to the photosynthetic system and increase the allocation to protective structural components resulting in a decrease in the photosynthetic carbon sequestration and wue this finding is consistent with those revealed in the present study in fact p tabuliformis and p orientalis at low elevation exhibited higher wue than those at high elevation xu et al 2021 this can also explain why the wue in the middle growth period rainy season was lower than those observed in other growth stages in addition changes in environmental conditions associated with an increase in elevation such as lower temperatures lower water availability and higher ultraviolet radiation may reduce the photosynthetic capacity of leaves resulting in lower wue in the same habitat the sla and wue of p tabuliformis were higher and lower respectively than those of p orientalis indicating that the adaptability of p orientalis to water conditions was better than that of p tabuliformis this result was consistent with the findings reported by wright et al 2017 showing that plants with low sla were better adapted to low swcs and drought conditions than those with high sla liu et al 2021 showed that both wue and depth of water use ranges of p orientalis were higher than those of p tabuliformis our investigation revealed that p orientalis covered a larger area than p tabuliformis in northern china p orientalis showed a synergistic adaptation to the elevation by changing the depth of water sources wue and sla however p tabuliformis showed a trade off in adaptation to elevation by adjusting only wue and sla 5 conclusions in this study stable isotopes were used to determine the water sources and wue of coniferous tree species as well as their sla response to the elevation in a seasonally arid area the results revealed a significant positive correlation between swc and elevation in addition p orientalis was sensitive to elevation changes and exhibited plasticity to water sources p orientalis mostly used water from the 60 100 cm soil layer 28 6 33 8 and groundwater 27 8 36 2 at all four elevations considered in this study the water utilization ratio of p orientalis at the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater decreased with elevation while that at 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers increased gradually with elevation in addition there was no variation in the water source of p tabuliformis with elevation and growth stages most water used by p tabuliformis was from the 60 100 cm soil layer and groundwater while small water amounts were derived from the 0 20 and 20 60 cm soil layers the sla and wue of p tabuliformis and p orientalis showed negative correlations with elevation moreover the wue of p orientalis was higher than that of p tabuliformis our results demonstrated that the adaptability of p orientalis to the aridity was better than that of p tabuliformis indeed p orientalis can change its water source and adjust wue and sla to adapt to the change in elevation suggesting a synergistic adaptation of p orientalis to elevation in contrast p tabuliformis showed a trade off in adaptation to the elevations by adjusting only wue and sla the outcomes

2931,actual evapotranspiration aet is an important component of the water cycle on the tibetan plateau remote sensing retrieval of aet requires further improvement in this region the objective of this study is to improve the process based land surface evapotranspiration heat fluxes algorithm p lsh by incorporating the impacts of incoming shortwave radiation and soil moisture on canopy conductance and optimizing the parameters based on observations from three fluxnet towers on the tibetan plateau five key parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm were determined by sobol sensitivity analysis among them the parameter b 3 which defines the relationship of potential canopy conductance g0 and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was identified as the parameter to which the algorithm was most sensitive we then utilized the differential evolution markov chain de mc method to analyze uncertainty of model parameters and posterior distributions of parameters were used to correct the response curve of g0 to ndvi in the improved p lsh algorithm and simulate daily aet the results show that uncertainty in five parameters is greatly reduced after the markov process and compared with the original algorithm the simulation of the improved p lsh algorithm is greatly upgraded specifically reflects in higher r2 0 93 vs 0 90 and lower rmse 11 39 w m 2 vs 15 11 w m 2 finally although reanalysis based net radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed were major sources of uncertainty of reanalysis driven aet estimates reanalysis driven aet estimates did not cause excessive errors compared to tower driven aet estimates r2 0 87 vs 0 93 rmse 15 76 w m 2 vs 11 39 w m 2 which provided a reasonable basis for further application of the improved p lsh algorithm to larger watershed scales keywords evapotranspiration canopy conductance improved p lsh algorithm sensitivity and uncertainty tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the terrestrial surface elements composed of plants soil snow and open water bodies routinely absorb solar radiation to convert liquid or solid water to gaseous water through the actual evapotranspiration aet process in addition transpiration in the aet process involves carbon exchange between the atmosphere and plants hence aet plays a critical role in water exchange between the hydrosphere atmosphere and pedosphere chao et al 2021 diak et al 2004 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 accurate estimation of aet is essential for quantitative estimation of energy partitioning water fluxes and climate change impacts however the high spatiotemporal variability and complexity of aet make it impossible to obtain large scale continuous data through direct measurements schwalm et al 2013 xu and singh 2005 zhang et al 2007 2010 satellites provide spatially continuous and temporally frequent measurements of surface biophysical variables that are closely related to aet including land surface temperature vegetation type and radiation making it possible to estimate aet from satellite observations furthermore continuous observation of the land surface from satellites at regional and global scales provides an economical and efficient way to estimate large scale aet given its repeatability and good accuracy so retrieval models based on satellite observations have become a popular method for large scale aet estimation kim et al 2014 longo et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 among different satellite remote sensing aet algorithms models the penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 is considered to be one of the most physically based models in hydrological practice even though canopy conductance gc in the equation is difficult to measure directly beven 1979 considering the response of plant stomata to the environment different models have been developed to estimate gc the jarvis stewart equation jarvis 1976 stewart 1988 describes gc by applying various stress factors related to climatic variables to the potential i e maximum canopy conductance g0 cleugh et al 2007 directly correlated gc with satellite observed leaf area index lai in the pm equation mu et al 2007 added vapor pressure deficit and minimum air temperature constraints on gc and used the lai to estimate gc leuning et al 2008 replaced the empirical model of gc with a biophysical two parameter model these various methods of calculating gc have led to different improved pm models the process based land surface evapotranspiration heat fluxes algorithm p lsh is a pm type aet algorithm in which an empirical biome specific ndvi based jarvis stewart type model is developed to estimate gc zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 this algorithm explains the response of stomata to temperature and vapor pressure deficit by accounting for various physiological characteristics of different biomes the gc term is determined by the empirical relationship between its potential value g0 and ndvi constrained by temperature and vapor pressure deficit zhang et al 2010 derived the biome specific gc function based on ndvi through 34 fluxnet towers around the world and chose another 48 towers for verification however the original p lsh algorithm hereafter called the original algorithm ignored the impacts of radiation and soil moisture on gc in reality water is transported from soil to vegetation and then dissipated through the transpiration of leaves due to the water potential gradient between leaf and air so soil moisture is the direct water pool of vegetation and determines the amount of water that can be extracted by vegetation roots liu et al 2020 based on the fact that soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit are coupled through land atmosphere interactions previous studies mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2019c mostly used the vapor pressure deficit as the moisture constraint however this coupling is not always tight and the variations of soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit are partly inconsistent xu et al 2022 so it is necessary to use the soil moisture constraint outside of the vpd constraint as a key source of available energy solar radiation can directly control the opening and closure of plant stomata wang et al 2017 reported that transpiration is mainly controlled by radiation and vapor pressure deficit in the cold environment and soil moisture is the main factor affecting transpiration during the periods with limited precipitation harris et al 2004 also reported that low gc value in the observations coincided with low soil moisture on a primary forest site jarvis 1976 and stewart 1988 reported that the solar radiation humidity deficit temperature and soil moisture deficit are the main factors affecting canopy conductance based on field experiments and statistical analyses hence it is necessary to consider the regulation of soil moisture and incoming shortwave radiation on gc and improve the p lsh algorithm in the original p lsh algorithm most biome specific parameters are empirical values so identification of sensitive parameters and their optimization are important for improving the performance of the algorithm global sensitivity analysis which can overcome the deficiency of traditional methods is designed for exploring the sensitivity of models to their parameters over the entire parameter space zhang et al 2013 and is suitable for high dimensional nonlinear aet algorithm cao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b regarding optimization some aet models used calibration to obtain biome specific parameters chen et al 2019 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019c and set the optimal parameters as fixed values however the combination of multiple parameters can cause equifinality which cannot be resolved and well quantified by the traditional calibration methods reinds et al 2008 shen et al 2017 in recent years parameter optimization and uncertainty analysis based on the bayesian theory have been adopted in some aet studies brust et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b the prior distribution is evolved to the posterior distribution by observations under the bayesian framework which can consider prior information of the parameters and accommodate unknown influences clark and gelfand 2006 the combination of global sensitivity analysis and bayesian theory would provide a reliable framework for sensitive parameter identification and uncertainty analysis of our improved p lsh algorithm known as the asian water tower the tibetan plateau is essential to asian monsoon development and concurrent water and energy cycles previous studies have reported considerable uncertainty in the existing aet algorithms and estimates for example the mod16 aet product has weak seasonal variability in the tibetan plateau headwaters compared to the observations li et al 2019 although the p lsh estimates are overall comparable to aet values derived from the water balance for the whole region large biases still exist in some areas of this region li et al 2019 li et al 2014 xue et al 2013 reported that different aet products have considerable uncertainty in two river basins on the tibetan plateau and a major source of uncertainty is the difference in forcing inputs wang et al 2022 pointed out that four remote sensing or reanalysis aet products are systematically lower than the observations of a typical alpine wetland on the central tibetan plateau peng et al 2016 pointed out that the existing global aet products show substantial differences in spatial and temporal patterns over the tibetan plateau and model optimization in this region is necessary khan et al 2018 took an extended triple collocation approach to characterize the uncertainty of three aet products and all datasets had relatively large uncertainties for low vegetation compared to tall vegetation a study by zou et al 2018 in the nagqu river basin suggested that the strong weighting of the ndvi in the priestley taylor model may contribute to the overestimation of aet hence there are still considerable uncertainties in aet over the tibetan plateau it is still necessary to further improve the accuracy of the aet algorithms to gain accurate estimation based on the aet measurements from three eddy covariance flux towers on the tibetan plateau the objectives of this study are 1 to determine whether soil moisture and incoming shortwave radiation can be used to constrain gc and improve the p lsh algorithm and 2 to provide a reliable framework to evaluate the sensitivity and uncertainty of the parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm 2 material and study area 2 1 study area as the highest plateau in the world the tibetan plateau has a total area of more than 2 5 million km2 and an average altitude of more than 4000 m because the area is difficult to access the tibetan plateau is less affected by human activities than other areas so it provides a good opportunity to test aet algorithms in natural watersheds our study is carried out at three eddy covariance flux towers located in the northeastern and southwestern of the tibetan plateau fig 1 the three flux towers are the cn dan cn ha2 and cn ham respectively according to the modis igbp classification these towers represent the same land cover type i e grassland it is worth explaining that the land cover of tower cn ha2 from fluxnet is wetland but according to the data sources chinaflux https chinaflux org and collection 6 modis land cover product sulla menashe et al 2019 the land cover of tower cn ha2 is grassland therefore this tower is considered as grassland in this study the three towers have similar alpine grassland ecosystems so the subsequent study makes a reasonable assumption that the three towers have the same biome specific parameters following zhang et al 2010 more details about the coordinates and elevations of these towers are listed in table 1 2 2 eddy covariance flux towers we collected observations from three flux towers of the fluxnet network located on the tibetan plateau to test and improve the p lsh algorithm and quantify parameter uncertainty in the improved p lsh algorithm the observation available periods of cn dan cn ha2 and cn ham are 2004 2005 2003 2005 and 2002 2004 respectively daily meteorological inputs from the flux towers include wind speed u m daylight air temperature t day vapor

meteorology inputs from flux towers this study also used reanalysis meteorology inputs to verify the accuracy of the improved p lsh algorithm driven by reanalysis data the daily incoming outgoing and

provided in appendix a the nasa gewex srb radiation and meteorological forcing data were interpolated to the locations of flux towers using bilinear interpolation in our study satellite based inputs include ndvi and soil moisture which were used to calculate canopy conductance the ndvi product used in this study is a merged product of the gimms ndvi university of arizona vegetation index and phenology lab vip ndvi and modis ndvi using the equidistant cumulative distribution function edcdf matching method by zhang et al 2015 the daily ndvi sequence for flux towers is interpolated from the merged gridded product using the bilinear interpolation method besides the tower measurements of soil moisture we also used satellite data to test the scalability of our improved algorithm in our study satellite soil moisture estimations were obtained from the soil moisture dataset of china based on microwave data assimilation 2002 2011 yang et al 2020 this dataset assimilated the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e brightness temperature data into a land surface model with 0 25 0 25 resolution and was verified in the arid and humid areas of the tibetan plateau yang et al 2016 we utilized surface soil moisture 0 5 cm and the bilinear interpolation method to interpolate the soil moisture data to the modelling spatial resolution monthly co2

methodology 3 1 the p lsh algorithm and its improvement in this study we improve an ndvi based aet algorithm named the p lsh algorithm proposed by zhang et al 2010 specifically we modify the response curve of biome specific potential canopy conductance g0 versus ndvi function by adding stress factors of incoming shortwave radiation and soil moisture using daily eddy covariance aet and associated meteorological measurements from flux towers on the tibetan plateau based on the penman monteith equation the p lsh algorithm quantifies vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation separately 1 λ e

same percentile n since three flux towers have similar ecosystem characteristics and n is a parameter obtained from calibration further details of the p lsh algorithm and its parameters are provided by zhang et al 2010 and zhang et al 2015 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis based on sobol sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity analysis is important for identifying the most sensitive model algorithm parameters and improving model algorithm performance freer et al 1996 wagener et al 2001 global sensitivity analysis can explore the sensitivity of models to parameters over the entire parameter space and is suitable for the testing of nonlinear models pappenberger et al 2008 yang 2011 zhang et al 2013 the sensitivity index of parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm is determined using an estimation proposed for nonlinear models by sobol 2001 based on the principle of variance decomposition sobol sensitivity analysis not only analyzes independent impacts of parameters on model outputs but also reflects the influence of interactions between parameters this method decomposes variances of model outputs into the sum of variances caused by different parameters and their synergies and presents sensitivities of parameters based on percentages of contribution to variance nonlinear and non monotonic models can be represented by the function y f x where x x 1 x 2 x d is a vector of d parameters while y is the selected univariate model output according to the principle of variance decomposition 13 v a r y i 1 d v i i j d v ij v 12 d where v i is the partial variance for the first order sensitivity of x i for the model output v ij is the partial variance for the second order sensitivity for the ith and jth parameter interaction and v 12 d is the partial variance for the dth order sensitivity for all parameter interactions further details of sobol sensitivity analysis are available in nossent et al 2011 and zhang et al 2013 3 3 bayesian optimization and uncertainty analysis of sensitive parameters with mature theory and improvements in computational efficiency bayesian theory has become more widely used in model parameter uncertainty analysis laloy et al 2010 liang et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 the prior distribution of parameters π x can be improved to the posterior distribution π x x through use of subjective prior information and or an observation sample x under the bayesian framework the posterior distribution of the parameter is proportional to the prior distribution and the likelihood function 14 π x x f x x π x where x is the sample x is the parameter set π x is the prior distribution which is assumed to be a uniform distribution in this study f x x is the likelihood function which can be expressed as follows zhu et al 2014 15 p o t x t 1 t 1 2 π σ 2 e x p o t s t 2 2 σ 2 where t is the total number of measurements o is measurements s is the simulated data σ is the standard deviation of the model error and is fixed during the observed period following braswell et al 2005 as a bayesian based method the de mc algorithm combines the differential evolution algorithm de and markov chain monte carlo mcmc and this combination aims to overcome the problem of proper search scale and orientation direction in the mcmc algorithm braak 2006 ter braak and vrugt 2008 meanwhile it also solves the problem of computational efficiency and makes the chain converge faster the de mc algorithm generates proposals based on two randomly selected chains then the two chains are subtracted and multiplied by the scaling factor and added to the current chain this algorithm chooses to accept or reject each proposal based on the metropolis ratio which is described as follows 16 x p x i γ x r 1 x r 2 ε where x p is the proposed parameter set x i is the current parameter set x r 1 and x r 2 are two sets of parameters randomly selected from the population that excludes x i γ is the scaling factor equal to 2 38 2 d where d is the number of parameters ε is designed to introduce probability acceptance rules for the de mc with ε n 0 b d for some tiny b the stable convergence of multiple sequences can be judged by the scale reduction score sr which depends on the variance of each markov chain gelman and rubin 1992 believe that the algorithm converges to a stable posterior distribution when the sr is lower than 1 2 3 4 evaluation of algorithm performance we first determined the sensitive parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm using all observations according to sobol sensitivity analysis two strategies are then applied to analyze the uncertainty of parameters using the de mc algorithm one strategy is that all observations are used for parameter optimization based on which the performance and parameter characteristics of the improved algorithm are discussed hereafter called calibration mode the other strategy is to evaluate the robustness of the improved algorithm by the leave one out cross validation following zhang et al 2019c hereafter called cross validation mode in the cross validation mode all observations of flux towers are randomly divided into ten groups nine of the ten groups are used for model optimization each time while the model results using the resultant optimized parameters are validated using the left one group this process is repeated to ensure that each of the ten groups is predicted then the predicted values and observations of aet are tested to explore the transferability of the improved algorithm in terms of the evaluation of the model performance we produced two sets of aet estimates driven by tower measured meteorology hereafter called tower driven aet estimates and reanalysis meteorology that is spatially interpolated to the locations of the towers hereafter called reanalysis driven aet estimates we utilized the root mean square error rmse between aet from measurements and estimates obtained from the improved p lsh algorithm as the objective function we chose the coefficient of determination r 2 the deviation bias and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse to quantify the deviation between model outputs and measurements more details about the above efficiency criteria are available in krause et al 2005 17 rmse 1 t i 1 t o i s i 2 18 r 2 i 1 t o i o s i s i 1 t o i o 2 i 1 t s i s 2 2 19 bias 1 t i 1 t o i s i 20 nse 1 i 1 t o i s i 2 i 1 t o i o 2 where t is the total number of measurements o is the measurement of aet s is the simulated aet o is the average of all measurements o i s is the average of all simulation s i we used root mean square deviation rmsd to quantify the difference between tower driven and reanalysis driven daily aet estimates as well as differences between tower measured meteorology and interpolated reanalysis meteorology the statistic rmsd is defined as 21 rmsd 1 t i 1 t x i y i 2 where t is the total number of estimates x i is the tower driven aet estimate or tower measured meteorology y i is reanalysis driven aet estimate or reanalysis meteorology the meteorological variables we evaluated include seven variables t max t min t avg vpd r n u m and sm we further analyzed the impacts of the uncertainty of these variables on the accuracy of reanalysis driven daily aet estimates 4 results 4 1 energy balance closure correction and seasonal variability of aet the energy balance closure test is a key means to check the quality of flux data it is judged by linear regression between daily available energy i e the difference of net radiation flux rn and soil heat flux g and the sum of latent heat flux le and sensible heat flux h for each tower the results across different towers indicate that the energy balance closure varied from 0 67 to 0 80 fig 2 a which is smaller than 0 76 to 0 93 from zhang et al 2019b the intercept values range from 0 29 w m 2 to 27 13 w m 2 and r2 values range from 0 86 to 0 90 the slopes of linear regression are all lower than 1 and the intercepts are all higher than 0 indicating that the eddy covariance system has some deviation at the three towers combined with the deviation the energy closure deviation defined as rn g le h of cn dan is 14 5 20 1 w m 2 while those of cn ha2 and cn ham are 3 6 22 7 w m 2 and 28 4 18 8 w m 2 respectively namely the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes at cn dan are largely overestimated while those at cn ham are largely underestimated hence we use the bowen ratio method to correct the measurements of towers which distributes the residual error of energy balance closure to the latent and sensible heat flux in proportion bowen 1926 after correction we analyzed the monthly average aet from three flux towers during their data available periods each flux tower shows obvious seasonality with high values in summer and low values in winter fig 2b and the solid and dash line represent the aet measurements and correction respectively compared with the original measurements aet corrections of each month have decreased at tower cn dan with an average decrease of 10 9 w m 2 per month at tower cn ham the aet corrections have increased each month with the largest increase of 24 2 w m 2 in july and an average increase of 8 87 w m 2 per month in contrast tower cn ha2 has the least corrections which has increased from june to september and decreased in the remaining months 4 2 parameter sensitivity of the improved p lsh algorithm the improved p lsh algorithm has 14 parameters which have been subjected to sensitivity analysis to quantify their impacts on model outputs the meanings and prior ranges of parameters are shown in table 2 based on prior distributions of 14 parameters we generated 10 000 sobol type random point sets and then calculated the first order and total order sensitivity index si values of each parameter in the improved p lsh algorithm fig 3 shows the first order and total order si values of all parameters and demonstrates that the empirical parameter b 3 has the highest first order si i e the impact of a single factor on the result reaching 39 t opt and r tot also have high first order si values both reaching 12 the first order si values of t c l o s e m i n t c l o s e m a x vpd open vpd close n and k 1 are all close to zero indicating that influences of these parameters on model outputs are negligible as in the first order si distribution the model is most sensitive to b 3 with the highest total order si reaching 51 t opt and r tot have the second and third highest sensitivities with values reaching 22 and 17 respectively the total order si values of t c l o s e m i n t c l o s e m a x vpd open vpd close n and k 1 are also close to zero indicating that they are insensitive parameters again sobol sensitivity analysis results show model outputs are sensitive to the following five parameters β t opt k r tot and b 3 based on a threshold value of 10 for the total order si zhang et al 2013 among them b 3 and t opt are the key parameters that have significant influences although n is an insensitive parameter we added it for the subsequent uncertainty analysis since the quantile method is used for soil moisture constraints for the first time in this study besides b 1 b 2 and b 3 jointly affect the canopy conductance and values of some of them cannot be given directly therefore we add parameters b 1 b 2 and n to the sobol sensitivity analysis results for uncertainty analysis of parameters and there are eight parameters in total 4 3 uncertainty and optimization of parameters of the improved p lsh algorithm in this study 10 markov chains were constructed for parallel crossover operations and each chain performed 30 000 iterations with 5000 iterations as a burn in period in the sampling process all observations were used for calibration that is called the calibration mode and a value of scale reduction score sr lower than 1 2 between multiple chains was used to indicate convergence the reasonable scale and orientation in the de mc algorithm make most of parameters converge quickly and stable convergence conditions are met within 2000 iterations fig 4 compared with others the convergence of r tot is relatively slow yet it is able to converge stably in 5000 times the histograms of posterior distributions of eight parameters are shown in fig 5 and median values and 95 credible intervals are summarized in table 3 these results clearly show that the de mc method was in most cases successful in reducing the assumed prior ranges of parameter values to a large extent compared with the original algorithm the parameters b 1 b 2 and b 3 in the improved algorithm have changed greatly resulting in considerable variation in the g0 ndvi curve the parameters β and t opt in the temperature stress factor decreased from 30 c and 20 c to current 11 9 c and 13 7 c respectively which strengthened inhibition of canopy transpiration in winter the parameter k is not very different from the original with its value changing from 500 pa to 359 1 pa while r tot dropped from 1000 s m 1 to 462 4 s m 1 with a substantial change all parameters show a great degree of updating and relatively large uncertainty reductions defined as 1 ci posterior ci prior where ci is the range of the 95 credible interval ranging from 0 605 to 0 990 via bayesian inference as a result we believe parameters of the improved p lsh algorithm were well optimized using the de mc algorithm 4 4 evaluation of the improved p lsh algorithm among the 14 parameters we chose 8 parameters to be optimized including the five most sensitive parameters and three empirical parameters without prior knowledge the median values of posterior distributions of above eight parameters were used as optimized values table 3 in addition there were six non sensitive parameters including t c l o s e m i n t c l o s e m a x vpd open vpd close r c and k 1 whose values were calculated based on biome specific constants for grassland following previous studies zhang et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 and were set as 8 c 40 c 650 pa 3800 pa 1000 s m 1 and 294 8 w m 2 for grassland respectively these values of parameters are considered as a set of optimized parameter values we evaluated the performance of the improved p lsh algorithm by comparing daily aet from the original and improved algorithms with measurements from flux towers and the improved algorithm using the improved gc model and optimized parameters the parameter set is optimized from all of tower samples which leads to the calibration mode the taylor diagram in fig 6 compares the performance of the algorithm with two axes representing the standard deviation of measurements the curve representing the pearson s correlation coefficient and the dotted line representing the root mean square error compared with the original algorithm the rmse for the improved algorithm in the calibration mode has been improved at each tower with the average value dropping from 15 11 w m 2 to 11 39 w m 2 although the improved algorithm slightly overestimates aet at tower cn ham and the deviation is slightly higher than the original algorithm the overall deviation drops from 1 55 w m 2 to 0 91 w m 2 at all towers similarly the improved algorithm has higher nse and r2 than the original algorithm table 4 suggesting the improved algorithm significantly improves the accuracy for estimating aet the performance of the improved p lsh algorithm in the cross validation mode is comparable to that in the calibration mode fig 6 with an rmse of 11 96 w m 2 and an r2 of 0 93 the cross validation results are only slightly degraded with rmse increased by 0 57 w m 2 and the nse or r2 values similar to those of the calibration mode table 4 the improved algorithm outperforms the original algorithm in both of the calibration and cross validation modes demonstrating that the improved algorithm and parameters in the calibration mode are stable and robust across three towers therefore we conducted the subsequent analyses based on the calibration mode results the g 0 n d v i response curve composed of parameters b 1 b 2 and b 3 is the key to the improved p lsh algorithm previous research zhang et al 2010 inverted the pm equation to derive g 0 and then established the response curve with the corresponding ndvi in this study posterior distributions of parameters b 1 b 2 and b 3 were obtained by de mc to determine the response curve fig 7 a shows the difference between the two curves the corrected curve rises sharply when ndvi is higher than 0 2 and approaches saturation after ndvi is higher than 0 45 there are two explanations for this change on the one hand the ndvi sequence for flux towers in this study is mainly with a low value and 68 of ndvi values are below 0 45 fig 7b on the other hand constraints of extra meteorological factors cause g0 to reduce reliance on ndvi since ndvi has a moderately positive correlation with soil moisture r 0 44 p 0 001 the constraint of ndvi on g0 is partly replaced by soil moisture compared with the original algorithm the stress factor m in the improved algorithm decreases to various degrees at most times for each tower fig 8 a this is because gc is always radiation limited except in summer and soil moisture limited in winter fig 8d which causes a lower composite stress factor the stress factor m r s ranges from 0 13 to 1 and shows the same temporal and spatial pattern as that of r s fig 8d leading to gc varying drastically between adjacent days the stress factor of soil moisture has a strong constraint in winter and a weak constraint in summer the parameter n has an optimized value of 80 4 suggesting that 80 4 of the samples at each tower are subject to moisture constraints while the other 19 6 of the samples are unconstrained the parameters β a n d t opt with optimized values determined by the bayesian method constrain gc for each tower fig 8b the average value of gc is reduced from 0 28 m m s 1 to 0 01 m m s 1 in winter fig 8c which shows that lower temperatures generally inhibit canopy transpiration in winter compared with the original the improved gc has increased from 4 60 m m s 1 to 6 40 m m s 1 in summer fig 8c which contributes to better performance of the simulated aet specifically in rmse reducing from 17 87 w m 2 to 14 37 w m 2 in summer 4 5 the impacts of reanalysis meteorology on the aet retrieval after parameterizing the improved p lsh algorithm we produced two sets of daily aet estimates at the tower level the first set was produced by tower measured meteorology while the second set was produced by reanalysis meteorology then we compared both outputs with corresponding aet measurements from flux towers a summary of the performance of the aet algorithm for each tower is shown in table 5 the bias values of tower driven aet estimates are all within 2 w m 2 while the rmse values are almost below 12 w m 2 the r 2 values between tower driven aet estimates and aet measurements are all higher than 0 9 with the lowest r 2 of 0 93 at tower cn ha2 the reanalysis driven aet estimates are similar to tower driven aet estimates however compared to the tower driven estimates the reanalysis driven aet estimates have larger bias and rmse and lower r 2 especially in tower cn dan which are attributed to differences between the coarse reanalysis meteorology 0 1 0 1 resolution and nasa gewex srb solar radiation 1 0 1 0 resolution and local micrometeorology from flux towers fig 9 shows tower driven and reanalysis driven aet estimates which are plotted with corresponding aet measurements of towers fig 9 suggests that both sets of aet estimates are roughly consistent with aet measurements and are able to capture their seasonal variability interannual variability and associated differences meanwhile reanalysis driven aet estimates do not cause excessive errors compared to tower driven aet estimates which provides a basis for further application of the improved p lsh algorithm to larger watershed scales in general reanalysis based temperature variables t day t max and t min show the highest correspondence with tower measurements and explain more than 90 of the variability while sm explains the least table 6 the correspondence r 2 between tower measurements and nasa gewex srb r n reanalysis vpd and u m are generally between the above results the error distributions of temperature variables are narrow and their average errors are within 3 c reanalysis based vpd and nasa gewex srb r n are generally overestimated relative to tower measurements and show considerable error distributions while reanalysis based u m and sm are slightly underestimated table 6 suggests that reanalysis based sm has the largest uncertainty followed by u m r n and vpd while the temperature variables have the lowest uncertainty the impacts of uncertainty of these seven meteorological variables on aet vary in different months for each flux tower we calculated rmsd for aet and seven meteorological variables between tower measurements and reanalysis meteorology or reanalysis driven aet estimates for each month results show that correlation coefficients of rmsd aet with rmsd t day rmsd t max rmsd t min rmsd vpd rmsd r n rmsd u m and rmsd sm are 0 23 p 0 1 0 19 p 0 1 0 25 p 0 1 0 20 p 0 1 0 42 p 0 001 0 20 p 0 1 and 0 04 p 0 1 for a total of 96 months respectively this indicates that uncertainty of reanalysis meteorology has various impacts on reanalysis driven aet estimates in different months for each flux tower overall rmsd aet has the strongest correlation with rmsd r n followed by rmsd t min rmsd t day rmsd vpd and rmsd u m but no obvious correlation with rmsd t max and rmsd sm in summary the uncertainty of r n vpd and u m are the major sources of the uncertainty of reanalysis driven aet estimates 4 6 comparison of the improved p lsh aet with the other remote sensing products we further compared the improved p lsh aet driven by reanalysis meteorology with other remote sensing products including the pmlv2 zhang et al 2019c and mod16a2 mu et al 2011 data the improved p lsh algorithm provides daily aet estimations while both pmlv2 and mod16a2 only provide the 8 day composites to make them comparable we aggregated the improved p lsh daily data into 8 day data it is clear that the results of the improved p lsh algorithm outperform the other products at all of the three towers fig 10 with an rmse of 3 36 mm and an r2 of 0 92 for all data series from the three towers the pmlv2 estimation has the second best performance but it has a relatively poor performance in simulating the seasonal variation at cn dan the mod16a2 has the lowest performance at all of the three sites and has large biases in summary the improved p lsh algorithm significantly improves the aet estimation of grassland over the tibetan plateau 5 discussion and conclusions generally speaking the sources of errors and uncertainty in the improved p lsh algorithm can be mainly divided into the following categories uncertainty of model structure uncertainty of model parameters uncertainty of inputs and uncertainty of the natural environment this study added incoming shortwave radiation and soil moisture as constraints in the estimation of canopy conductance which improved the model structure to a certain extent however the understanding of the physical process of aet is still incomplete specifically because the impact factors of canopy conductance have not been developed with a unified theory and interference between various factors increases the difficulty of accurately describing the physical process of aet zhang et al 2016 pointed out that the interactive effects between climatic variables in the jarvis stewart equation could not be well considered because of multiplying concomitant and the impacts of intercorrelation of different factors for the three tibetan plateau grasslands the correlation coefficient between the stress factors of temperature and soil moisture reaches 0 71 p 0 001 and multiple constraints of these factors may result in underestimation of the composite stress factor as a result the optimized g0 may be overestimated to offset this effect this suggests that although refinement of the model structure can improve simulation accuracy there is always a risk of introducing new uncertainty as the complexity of the model increases besides the roughness lengths and zero plane displacement height are simplified as linear functions of vegetation height in this study although such simplification has been widely used in aet estimation tang and li 2017 zhang et al 2019c the aerodynamic roughness lengths have some seasonal variability which can change as snow melts and vegetation grows li et al 2021 in recent years some studies have combined the wind profile equation with remote sensing inputs to estimate high resolution roughness lengths liu et al 2021 peng et al 2022 which can help improve the estimation of aet especially in the eastern and southern shrub and forest areas of the tibetan plateau the model structure improved in this study has been well applied in the grassland ecosystem of the tibetan plateau and the impacts of reanalysis meteorology on the aet have proved the feasibility of applying the algorithm on the pixel and watershed scales however due to the highly heterogenous climate topography and land cover of the tibetan plateau it is important to incorporate more observations and test the robustness of the algorithm in the other ecosystems such as shrublands and forests besides there are numerous bare soil and frozen soil on the tibetan plateau how to accurately quantify the soil moisture constraint on aet in these areas need be further studied in addition to structural errors of models unreasonable values of parameters also bring considerable uncertainty to model outputs hence scientists are committed to obtaining optimal parameter estimation that reflects the heterogeneity of land surface and vegetation for large scale aet assessment the most scientific and reasonable way is to calibrate parameters by measurements according to their physical meanings yet this is limited on a large scale the sobol and bayesian inference framework used in this study provides a valid approach to constrain model parameters by measurements we used sobol sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm results suggested that simulated aet was most sensitive to five parameters β t opt k r tot and b 3 which significantly influenced the accuracy of the simulation and three of above five parameters were related to conductance based on measurements from three flux towers the de mc method was applied to optimize the five sensitive parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm as well as three non sensitive parameters the posterior distributions of parameters were generally well constrained by measurements from flux towers based on the improved p lsh algorithm and optimized parameters this study more accurately simulated daily aet for three flux towers on the tibetan plateau compared with the original p lsh algorithm the improved algorithm optimized the daily simulation accuracy with r2 increasing from 0 90 to 0 93 and rmse dropping from 15 11 w m 2 to 11 39 w m 2 compared with two other remote sensing aet products the improved p lsh estimation has a better performance at all of the three towers indicating that the improved model structure and optimized parameters are the correct strategies for aet estimation we have discussed the improved stress factor m and the g0 ndvi response curve the optimized parameters β and t opt constrained gc for each tower and strengthened the inhibitory of lower temperature on canopy transpiration in winter the constraint of incoming shortwave radiation caused gc to deviate away from the previous smooth and continuous state while soil moisture restricted gc for all three towers except sometime in summer by considering the constraints of incoming shortwave radiation and soil moisture gc no longer highly relied on ndvi the corrected curve rose sharply when ndvi was higher than 0 2 and approached saturation after ndvi was higher than 0 45 one explanation was the limitation of measurements for calibration while another was that the constraint of ndvi on gc was replaced by soil moisture to a certain extent uncertainties in inputs lie mainly in errors of aet measurements and uncertainty of forcing data the existing flux towers are based on eddy covariance and there is an associated lack of energy balance closure due to complexity in wind patterns footprint representation and sampling variability wilson et al 2002 although we have corrected the errors in the energy balance closure via the bowen ratio method there is a certain uncertainty in estimating soil heat flux by an empirical formula for lack of measurements at towers cn dan and cn ha2 meanwhile eddy covariance flux towers provide aet measurements rather than its components i e canopy transpiration and soil evaporation which may result in errors offset in our calibration process thus sap flow or stable isotope technologies williams et al 2004 xu et al 2018 are needed to directly measure canopy transpiration and segment aet components and these approaches would help to further refine the model structure and parameters in terms of forcing data we compared tower driven and reanalysis driven aet estimates and found that they had similar performance compared with tower driven aet estimates the reanalysis driven aet estimates have slightly higher bias rmse and lower r2 mainly attributed to the difference between coarse resolution and local micrometeorology then we analyzed the uncertainty of coarse resolution reanalysis meteorological inputs and their impacts on model outputs and results showed that considerable uncertainty of rn vpd and um are major sources of uncertainty of reanalysis driven aet estimates nevertheless reanalysis driven aet estimates did not cause excessive errors the comprehensive r2 was reduced from 0 93 to 0 87 and annual and interannual variations of different towers could be captured two sets of aet estimates at the tower level showed generally favorable agreement with tower measurements at the daily scale which provided a basis for further application of the improved p lsh algorithm to larger watersheds although this study tested the impact of soil moisture constraint from a specific dataset on aet it may not be suitable for long term aet estimation because of the limited duration of 10 years in recent years more and more satellite microwave sensors have been widely used to estimate regional and global surface soil moisture and some representatives include smap entekhabi et al 2010 smos kerr et al 2012 amse2 parinussa et al 2015 and fengyun series parinussa et al 2014 when they are used to estimate aet in a large watershed or even on a global scale the availability of their daily soil moisture should be paid attention to because the revisit rates of various satellites are usually two days or even more in addition their coarse resolution and limited period may hinder the development of long term soil moisture driven aet estimates encouragingly more and more machine learning methods chen et al 2021 o and orth 2021 multi satellite joint retrieval zhang et al 2019a and downscaling method peng et al 2017 song et al 2022 of soil moisture have been developed in recent years which will promote the satellite retrieval of the soil moisture and aet communities finally the aet process is comprehensively affected by initial conditions boundary conditions complex physical factors noise and many other random and uncertain factors uncertainty of the natural environment mainly refers to the inherent randomness in the aet process spatially and temporally which results in the randomness of outputs this being the most uncontrollable factor in all situations in response to this it is possible to introduce stochastic processes into deterministic models in the future credit authorship contribution statement jin feng conceptualization methodology writing original draft visualization ke zhang

2931,actual evapotranspiration aet is an important component of the water cycle on the tibetan plateau remote sensing retrieval of aet requires further improvement in this region the objective of this study is to improve the process based land surface evapotranspiration heat fluxes algorithm p lsh by incorporating the impacts of incoming shortwave radiation and soil moisture on canopy conductance and optimizing the parameters based on observations from three fluxnet towers on the tibetan plateau five key parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm were determined by sobol sensitivity analysis among them the parameter b 3 which defines the relationship of potential canopy conductance g0 and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was identified as the parameter to which the algorithm was most sensitive we then utilized the differential evolution markov chain de mc method to analyze uncertainty of model parameters and posterior distributions of parameters were used to correct the response curve of g0 to ndvi in the improved p lsh algorithm and simulate daily aet the results show that uncertainty in five parameters is greatly reduced after the markov process and compared with the original algorithm the simulation of the improved p lsh algorithm is greatly upgraded specifically reflects in higher r2 0 93 vs 0 90 and lower rmse 11 39 w m 2 vs 15 11 w m 2 finally although reanalysis based net radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed were major sources of uncertainty of reanalysis driven aet estimates reanalysis driven aet estimates did not cause excessive errors compared to tower driven aet estimates r2 0 87 vs 0 93 rmse 15 76 w m 2 vs 11 39 w m 2 which provided a reasonable basis for further application of the improved p lsh algorithm to larger watershed scales keywords evapotranspiration canopy conductance improved p lsh algorithm sensitivity and uncertainty tibetan plateau data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the terrestrial surface elements composed of plants soil snow and open water bodies routinely absorb solar radiation to convert liquid or solid water to gaseous water through the actual evapotranspiration aet process in addition transpiration in the aet process involves carbon exchange between the atmosphere and plants hence aet plays a critical role in water exchange between the hydrosphere atmosphere and pedosphere chao et al 2021 diak et al 2004 wang and dickinson 2012 zhang et al 2016 accurate estimation of aet is essential for quantitative estimation of energy partitioning water fluxes and climate change impacts however the high spatiotemporal variability and complexity of aet make it impossible to obtain large scale continuous data through direct measurements schwalm et al 2013 xu and singh 2005 zhang et al 2007 2010 satellites provide spatially continuous and temporally frequent measurements of surface biophysical variables that are closely related to aet including land surface temperature vegetation type and radiation making it possible to estimate aet from satellite observations furthermore continuous observation of the land surface from satellites at regional and global scales provides an economical and efficient way to estimate large scale aet given its repeatability and good accuracy so retrieval models based on satellite observations have become a popular method for large scale aet estimation kim et al 2014 longo et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 among different satellite remote sensing aet algorithms models the penman monteith pm equation monteith 1965 is considered to be one of the most physically based models in hydrological practice even though canopy conductance gc in the equation is difficult to measure directly beven 1979 considering the response of plant stomata to the environment different models have been developed to estimate gc the jarvis stewart equation jarvis 1976 stewart 1988 describes gc by applying various stress factors related to climatic variables to the potential i e maximum canopy conductance g0 cleugh et al 2007 directly correlated gc with satellite observed leaf area index lai in the pm equation mu et al 2007 added vapor pressure deficit and minimum air temperature constraints on gc and used the lai to estimate gc leuning et al 2008 replaced the empirical model of gc with a biophysical two parameter model these various methods of calculating gc have led to different improved pm models the process based land surface evapotranspiration heat fluxes algorithm p lsh is a pm type aet algorithm in which an empirical biome specific ndvi based jarvis stewart type model is developed to estimate gc zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 this algorithm explains the response of stomata to temperature and vapor pressure deficit by accounting for various physiological characteristics of different biomes the gc term is determined by the empirical relationship between its potential value g0 and ndvi constrained by temperature and vapor pressure deficit zhang et al 2010 derived the biome specific gc function based on ndvi through 34 fluxnet towers around the world and chose another 48 towers for verification however the original p lsh algorithm hereafter called the original algorithm ignored the impacts of radiation and soil moisture on gc in reality water is transported from soil to vegetation and then dissipated through the transpiration of leaves due to the water potential gradient between leaf and air so soil moisture is the direct water pool of vegetation and determines the amount of water that can be extracted by vegetation roots liu et al 2020 based on the fact that soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit are coupled through land atmosphere interactions previous studies mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 zhang et al 2019c mostly used the vapor pressure deficit as the moisture constraint however this coupling is not always tight and the variations of soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit are partly inconsistent xu et al 2022 so it is necessary to use the soil moisture constraint outside of the vpd constraint as a key source of available energy solar radiation can directly control the opening and closure of plant stomata wang et al 2017 reported that transpiration is mainly controlled by radiation and vapor pressure deficit in the cold environment and soil moisture is the main factor affecting transpiration during the periods with limited precipitation harris et al 2004 also reported that low gc value in the observations coincided with low soil moisture on a primary forest site jarvis 1976 and stewart 1988 reported that the solar radiation humidity deficit temperature and soil moisture deficit are the main factors affecting canopy conductance based on field experiments and statistical analyses hence it is necessary to consider the regulation of soil moisture and incoming shortwave radiation on gc and improve the p lsh algorithm in the original p lsh algorithm most biome specific parameters are empirical values so identification of sensitive parameters and their optimization are important for improving the performance of the algorithm global sensitivity analysis which can overcome the deficiency of traditional methods is designed for exploring the sensitivity of models to their parameters over the entire parameter space zhang et al 2013 and is suitable for high dimensional nonlinear aet algorithm cao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b regarding optimization some aet models used calibration to obtain biome specific parameters chen et al 2019 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019c and set the optimal parameters as fixed values however the combination of multiple parameters can cause equifinality which cannot be resolved and well quantified by the traditional calibration methods reinds et al 2008 shen et al 2017 in recent years parameter optimization and uncertainty analysis based on the bayesian theory have been adopted in some aet studies brust et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b the prior distribution is evolved to the posterior distribution by observations under the bayesian framework which can consider prior information of the parameters and accommodate unknown influences clark and gelfand 2006 the combination of global sensitivity analysis and bayesian theory would provide a reliable framework for sensitive parameter identification and uncertainty analysis of our improved p lsh algorithm known as the asian water tower the tibetan plateau is essential to asian monsoon development and concurrent water and energy cycles previous studies have reported considerable uncertainty in the existing aet algorithms and estimates for example the mod16 aet product has weak seasonal variability in the tibetan plateau headwaters compared to the observations li et al 2019 although the p lsh estimates are overall comparable to aet values derived from the water balance for the whole region large biases still exist in some areas of this region li et al 2019 li et al 2014 xue et al 2013 reported that different aet products have considerable uncertainty in two river basins on the tibetan plateau and a major source of uncertainty is the difference in forcing inputs wang et al 2022 pointed out that four remote sensing or reanalysis aet products are systematically lower than the observations of a typical alpine wetland on the central tibetan plateau peng et al 2016 pointed out that the existing global aet products show substantial differences in spatial and temporal patterns over the tibetan plateau and model optimization in this region is necessary khan et al 2018 took an extended triple collocation approach to characterize the uncertainty of three aet products and all datasets had relatively large uncertainties for low vegetation compared to tall vegetation a study by zou et al 2018 in the nagqu river basin suggested that the strong weighting of the ndvi in the priestley taylor model may contribute to the overestimation of aet hence there are still considerable uncertainties in aet over the tibetan plateau it is still necessary to further improve the accuracy of the aet algorithms to gain accurate estimation based on the aet measurements from three eddy covariance flux towers on the tibetan plateau the objectives of this study are 1 to determine whether soil moisture and incoming shortwave radiation can be used to constrain gc and improve the p lsh algorithm and 2 to provide a reliable framework to evaluate the sensitivity and uncertainty of the parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm 2 material and study area 2 1 study area as the highest plateau in the world the tibetan plateau has a total area of more than 2 5 million km2 and an average altitude of more than 4000 m because the area is difficult to access the tibetan plateau is less affected by human activities than other areas so it provides a good opportunity to test aet algorithms in natural watersheds our study is carried out at three eddy covariance flux towers located in the northeastern and southwestern of the tibetan plateau fig 1 the three flux towers are the cn dan cn ha2 and cn ham respectively according to the modis igbp classification these towers represent the same land cover type i e grassland it is worth explaining that the land cover of tower cn ha2 from fluxnet is wetland but according to the data sources chinaflux https chinaflux org and collection 6 modis land cover product sulla menashe et al 2019 the land cover of tower cn ha2 is grassland therefore this tower is considered as grassland in this study the three towers have similar alpine grassland ecosystems so the subsequent study makes a reasonable assumption that the three towers have the same biome specific parameters following zhang et al 2010 more details about the coordinates and elevations of these towers are listed in table 1 2 2 eddy covariance flux towers we collected observations from three flux towers of the fluxnet network located on the tibetan plateau to test and improve the p lsh algorithm and quantify parameter uncertainty in the improved p lsh algorithm the observation available

meteorology inputs from flux towers this study also used reanalysis meteorology inputs to verify the accuracy of the improved p lsh algorithm driven by reanalysis data the daily incoming outgoing and

provided in appendix a the nasa gewex srb radiation and meteorological forcing data were interpolated to the locations of flux towers using bilinear interpolation in our study satellite based inputs include ndvi and soil moisture which were used to calculate canopy conductance the ndvi product used in this study is a merged product of the gimms ndvi university of arizona vegetation index and phenology lab vip ndvi and modis ndvi using the equidistant cumulative distribution function edcdf matching method by zhang et al 2015 the daily ndvi sequence for flux towers is interpolated from the merged gridded product using the bilinear interpolation method besides the tower measurements of soil moisture we also used satellite data to test the scalability of our improved algorithm in our study satellite soil moisture estimations were obtained from the soil moisture dataset of china based on microwave data assimilation 2002 2011 yang et al 2020 this dataset assimilated the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e brightness temperature data into a land surface model with 0 25 0 25 resolution and was verified in the arid and humid areas of the tibetan plateau yang et al 2016 we utilized surface soil moisture 0 5 cm and the bilinear interpolation method to interpolate the soil moisture data to the modelling spatial resolution monthly co2

methodology 3 1 the p lsh algorithm and its improvement in this study we improve an ndvi based aet algorithm named the p lsh algorithm proposed by zhang et al 2010 specifically we modify the response curve of biome specific potential canopy conductance g0 versus ndvi function by adding stress factors of incoming shortwave radiation and soil moisture using daily eddy covariance aet and associated meteorological measurements from flux towers on the tibetan plateau based on the penman monteith equation the p lsh algorithm quantifies vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation separately 1 λ e

same percentile n since three flux towers have similar ecosystem characteristics and n is a parameter obtained from calibration further details of the p lsh algorithm and its parameters are provided by zhang et al 2010 and zhang et al 2015 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis based on sobol sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity analysis is important for identifying the most sensitive model algorithm parameters and improving model algorithm performance freer et al 1996 wagener et al 2001 global sensitivity analysis can explore the sensitivity of models to parameters over the entire parameter space and is suitable for the testing of nonlinear models pappenberger et al 2008 yang 2011 zhang et al 2013 the sensitivity index of parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm is determined using an estimation proposed for nonlinear models by sobol 2001 based on the principle of variance decomposition sobol sensitivity analysis not only analyzes independent impacts of parameters on model outputs but also reflects the influence of interactions between parameters this method decomposes variances of model outputs into the sum of variances caused by different parameters and their synergies and presents sensitivities of parameters based on percentages of contribution to variance nonlinear and non monotonic models can be represented by the function y f x where x x 1 x 2 x d is a vector of d parameters while y is the selected univariate model output according to the principle of variance decomposition 13 v a r y i 1 d v i i j d v ij v 12 d where v i is the partial variance for the first order sensitivity of x i for the model output v ij is the partial variance for the second order sensitivity for the ith and jth parameter interaction and v 12 d is the partial variance for the dth order sensitivity for all parameter interactions further details of sobol sensitivity analysis are available in nossent et al 2011 and zhang et al 2013 3 3 bayesian optimization and uncertainty analysis of sensitive parameters with mature theory and improvements in computational efficiency bayesian theory has become more widely used in model parameter uncertainty analysis laloy et al 2010 liang et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 the prior distribution of parameters π x can be improved to the posterior distribution π x x through use of subjective prior information and or an observation sample x under the bayesian framework the posterior distribution of the parameter is proportional to the prior distribution and the likelihood function 14 π x x f x x π x where x is the sample x is the parameter set π x is the prior distribution which is assumed to be a uniform distribution in this study f x x is the likelihood function which can be expressed as follows zhu et al 2014 15 p o t x t 1 t 1 2 π σ 2 e x p o t s t 2 2 σ 2 where t is the total number of measurements o is measurements s is the simulated data σ is the standard deviation of the model error and is fixed during the observed period following braswell et al 2005 as a bayesian based method the de mc algorithm combines the differential evolution algorithm de and markov chain monte carlo mcmc and this combination aims to overcome the problem of proper search scale and orientation direction in the mcmc algorithm braak 2006 ter braak and vrugt 2008 meanwhile it also solves the problem of computational efficiency and makes the chain converge faster the de mc algorithm generates proposals based on two randomly selected chains then the two chains are subtracted and multiplied by the scaling factor and added to the current chain this algorithm chooses to accept or reject each proposal based on the metropolis ratio which is described as follows 16 x p x i γ x r 1 x r 2 ε where x p is the proposed parameter set x i is the current parameter set x r 1 and x r 2 are two sets of parameters randomly selected from the population that excludes x i γ is the scaling factor equal to 2 38 2 d where d is the number of parameters ε is designed to introduce probability acceptance rules for the de mc with ε n 0 b d for some tiny b the stable convergence of multiple sequences can be judged by the scale reduction score sr which depends on the variance of each markov chain gelman and rubin 1992 believe that the algorithm converges to a stable posterior distribution when the sr is lower than 1 2 3 4 evaluation of algorithm performance we first determined the sensitive parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm using all observations according to sobol sensitivity analysis two strategies are then applied to analyze the uncertainty of parameters using the de mc algorithm one strategy is that all observations are used for parameter optimization based on which the performance and parameter characteristics of the improved algorithm are discussed hereafter called calibration mode the other strategy is to evaluate the robustness of the improved algorithm by the leave one out cross validation following zhang et al 2019c hereafter called cross validation mode in the cross validation mode all observations of flux towers are randomly divided into ten groups nine of the ten groups are used for model optimization each time while the model results using the resultant optimized parameters are validated using the left one group this process is repeated to ensure that each of the ten groups is predicted then the predicted values and observations of aet are tested to explore the transferability of the improved algorithm in terms of the evaluation of the model performance we produced two sets of aet estimates driven by tower measured meteorology hereafter called tower driven aet estimates and reanalysis meteorology that is spatially interpolated to the locations of the towers hereafter called reanalysis driven aet estimates we utilized the root mean square error rmse between aet from measurements and estimates obtained from the improved p lsh algorithm as the objective function we chose the coefficient of determination r 2 the deviation bias and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse to quantify the deviation between model outputs and measurements more details about the above efficiency criteria are available in krause et al 2005 17 rmse 1 t i 1 t o i s i 2 18 r 2 i 1 t o i o s i s i 1 t o i o 2 i 1 t s i s 2 2 19 bias 1 t i 1 t o i s i 20 nse 1 i 1 t o i s i 2 i 1 t o i o 2 where t is the total number of measurements o is the measurement of aet s is the simulated aet o is the average of all measurements o i s is the average of all simulation s i we used root mean square deviation rmsd to quantify the difference between tower driven and reanalysis driven daily aet estimates as well as differences between tower measured meteorology and interpolated reanalysis meteorology the statistic rmsd is defined as 21 rmsd 1 t i 1 t x i y i 2 where t is the total number of estimates x i is the tower driven aet estimate or tower measured meteorology y i is reanalysis driven aet estimate or reanalysis meteorology the meteorological variables we evaluated include seven variables t max t min t avg vpd r n u m and sm we further analyzed the impacts of the uncertainty of these variables on the accuracy of reanalysis driven daily aet estimates 4 results 4 1 energy balance closure correction and seasonal variability of aet the energy balance closure test is a key means to check the quality of flux data it is judged by linear regression between daily available energy i e the difference of net radiation flux rn and soil heat flux g and the sum of latent heat flux le and sensible heat flux h for each tower the results across different towers indicate that the energy balance closure varied from 0 67 to 0 80 fig 2 a which is smaller than 0 76 to 0 93 from zhang et al 2019b the intercept values range from 0 29 w m 2 to 27 13 w m 2 and r2 values range from 0 86 to 0 90 the slopes of linear regression are all lower than 1 and the intercepts are all higher than 0 indicating that the eddy covariance system has some deviation at the three towers combined with the deviation the energy closure deviation defined as rn g le h of cn dan is 14 5 20 1 w m 2 while those of cn ha2 and cn ham are 3 6 22 7 w m 2 and 28 4 18 8 w m 2 respectively namely the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes at cn dan are largely overestimated while those at cn ham are largely underestimated hence we use the bowen ratio method to correct the measurements of towers which distributes the residual error of energy balance closure to the latent and sensible heat flux in proportion bowen 1926 after correction we analyzed the monthly average aet from three flux towers during their data available periods each flux tower shows obvious seasonality with high values in summer and low values in winter fig 2b and the solid and dash line represent the aet measurements and correction respectively compared with the original measurements aet corrections of each month have decreased at tower cn dan with an average decrease of 10 9 w m 2 per month at tower cn ham the aet corrections have increased each month with the largest increase of 24 2 w m 2 in july and an average increase of 8 87 w m 2 per month in contrast tower cn ha2 has the least corrections which has increased from june to september and decreased in the remaining months 4 2 parameter sensitivity of the improved p lsh algorithm the improved p lsh algorithm has 14 parameters which have been subjected to sensitivity analysis to quantify their impacts on model outputs the meanings and prior ranges of parameters are shown in table 2 based on prior distributions of 14 parameters we generated 10 000 sobol type random point sets and then calculated the first order and total order sensitivity index si values of each parameter in the improved p lsh algorithm fig 3 shows the first order and total order si values of all parameters and demonstrates that the empirical parameter b 3 has the highest first order si i e the impact of a single factor on the result reaching 39 t opt and r tot also have high first order si values both reaching 12 the first order si values of t c l o s e m i n t c l o s e m a x vpd open vpd close n and k 1 are all close to zero indicating that influences of these parameters on model outputs are negligible as in the first order si distribution the model is most sensitive to b 3 with the highest total order si reaching 51 t opt and r tot have the second and third highest sensitivities with values reaching 22 and 17 respectively the total order si values of t c l o s e m i n t c l o s e m a x vpd open vpd close n and k 1 are also close to zero indicating that they are insensitive parameters again sobol sensitivity analysis results show model outputs are sensitive to the following five parameters β t opt k r tot and b 3 based on a threshold value of 10 for the total order si zhang et al 2013 among them b 3 and t opt are the key parameters that have significant influences although n is an insensitive parameter we added it for the subsequent uncertainty analysis since the quantile method is used for soil moisture constraints for the first time in this study besides b 1 b 2 and b 3 jointly affect the canopy conductance and values of some of them cannot be given directly therefore we add parameters b 1 b 2 and n to the sobol sensitivity analysis results for uncertainty analysis of parameters and there are eight parameters in total 4 3 uncertainty and optimization of parameters of the improved p lsh algorithm in this study 10 markov chains were constructed for parallel crossover operations and each chain performed 30 000 iterations with 5000 iterations as a burn in period in the sampling process all observations were used for calibration that is called the calibration mode and a value of scale reduction score sr lower than 1 2 between multiple chains was used to indicate convergence the reasonable scale and orientation in the de mc algorithm make most of parameters converge quickly and stable convergence conditions are met within 2000 iterations fig 4 compared with others the convergence of r tot is relatively slow yet it is able to converge stably in 5000 times the histograms of posterior distributions of eight parameters are shown in fig 5 and median values and 95 credible intervals are summarized in table 3 these results clearly show that the de mc method was in most cases successful in reducing the assumed prior ranges of parameter values to a large extent compared with the original algorithm the parameters b 1 b 2 and b 3 in the improved algorithm have changed greatly resulting in considerable variation in the g0 ndvi curve the parameters β and t opt in the temperature stress factor decreased from 30 c and 20 c to current 11 9 c and 13 7 c respectively which strengthened inhibition of canopy transpiration in winter the parameter k is not very different from the original with its value changing from 500 pa to 359 1 pa while r tot dropped from 1000 s m 1 to 462 4 s m 1 with a substantial change all parameters show a great degree of updating and relatively large uncertainty reductions defined as 1 ci posterior ci prior where ci is the range of the 95 credible interval ranging from 0 605 to 0 990 via bayesian inference as a result we believe parameters of the improved p lsh algorithm were well optimized using the de mc algorithm 4 4 evaluation of the improved p lsh algorithm among the 14 parameters we chose 8 parameters to be optimized including the five most sensitive parameters and three empirical parameters without prior knowledge the median values of posterior distributions of above eight parameters were used as optimized values table 3 in addition there were six non sensitive parameters including t c l o s e m i n t c l o s e m a x vpd open vpd close r c and k 1 whose values were calculated based on biome specific constants for grassland following previous studies zhang et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 and were set as 8 c 40 c 650 pa 3800 pa 1000 s m 1 and 294 8 w m 2 for grassland respectively these values of parameters are considered as a set of optimized parameter values we evaluated the performance of the improved p lsh algorithm by comparing daily aet from the original and improved algorithms with measurements from flux towers and the improved algorithm using the improved gc model and optimized parameters the parameter set is optimized from all of tower samples which leads to the calibration mode the taylor diagram in fig 6 compares the performance of the algorithm with two axes representing the standard deviation of measurements the curve representing the pearson s correlation coefficient and the dotted line representing the root mean square error compared with the original algorithm the rmse for the improved algorithm in the calibration mode has been improved at each tower with the average value dropping from 15 11 w m 2 to 11 39 w m 2 although the improved algorithm slightly overestimates aet at tower cn ham and the deviation is slightly higher than the original algorithm the overall deviation drops from 1 55 w m 2 to 0 91 w m 2 at all towers similarly the improved algorithm has higher nse and r2 than the original algorithm table 4 suggesting the improved algorithm significantly improves the accuracy for estimating aet the performance of the improved p lsh algorithm in the cross validation mode is comparable to that in the calibration mode fig 6 with an rmse of 11 96 w m 2 and an r2 of 0 93 the cross validation results are only slightly degraded with rmse increased by 0 57 w m 2 and the nse or r2 values similar to those of the calibration mode table 4 the improved algorithm outperforms the original algorithm in both of the calibration and cross validation modes demonstrating that the improved algorithm and parameters in the calibration mode are stable and robust across three towers therefore we conducted the subsequent analyses based on the calibration mode results the g 0 n d v i response curve composed of parameters b 1 b 2 and b 3 is the key to the improved p lsh algorithm previous research zhang et al 2010 inverted the pm equation to derive g 0 and then established the response curve with the corresponding ndvi in this study posterior distributions of parameters b 1 b 2 and b 3 were obtained by de mc to determine the response curve fig 7 a shows the difference between the two curves the corrected curve rises sharply when ndvi is higher than 0 2 and approaches saturation after ndvi is higher than 0 45 there are two explanations for this change on the one hand the ndvi sequence for flux towers in this study is mainly with a low value and 68 of ndvi values are below 0 45 fig 7b on the other hand constraints of extra meteorological factors cause g0 to reduce reliance on ndvi since ndvi has a moderately positive correlation with soil moisture r 0 44 p 0 001 the constraint of ndvi on g0 is partly replaced by soil moisture compared with the original algorithm the stress factor m in the improved algorithm decreases to various degrees at most times for each tower fig 8 a this is because gc is always radiation limited except in summer and soil moisture limited in winter fig 8d which causes a lower composite stress factor the stress factor m r s ranges from 0 13 to 1 and shows the same temporal and spatial pattern as that of r s fig 8d leading to gc varying drastically between adjacent days the stress factor of soil moisture has a strong constraint in winter and a weak constraint in summer the parameter n has an optimized value of 80 4 suggesting that 80 4 of the samples at each tower are subject to moisture constraints while the other 19 6 of the samples are unconstrained the parameters β a n d t opt with optimized values determined by the bayesian method constrain gc for each tower fig 8b the average value of gc is reduced from 0 28 m m s 1 to 0 01 m m s 1 in winter fig 8c which shows that lower temperatures generally inhibit canopy transpiration in winter compared with the original the improved gc has increased from 4 60 m m s 1 to 6 40 m m s 1 in summer fig 8c which contributes to better performance of the simulated aet specifically in rmse reducing from 17 87 w m 2 to 14 37 w m 2 in summer 4 5 the impacts of reanalysis meteorology on the aet retrieval after parameterizing the improved p lsh algorithm we produced two sets of daily aet estimates at the tower level the first set was produced by tower measured meteorology while the second set was produced by reanalysis meteorology then we compared both outputs with corresponding aet measurements from flux towers a summary of the performance of the aet algorithm for each tower is shown in table 5 the bias values of tower driven aet estimates are all within 2 w m 2 while the rmse values are almost below 12 w m 2 the r 2 values between tower driven aet estimates and aet measurements are all higher than 0 9 with the lowest r 2 of 0 93 at tower cn ha2 the reanalysis driven aet estimates are similar to tower driven aet estimates however compared to the tower driven estimates the reanalysis driven aet estimates have larger bias and rmse and lower r 2 especially in tower cn dan which are attributed to differences between the coarse reanalysis meteorology 0 1 0 1 resolution and nasa gewex srb solar radiation 1 0 1 0 resolution and local micrometeorology from flux towers fig 9 shows tower driven and reanalysis driven aet estimates which are plotted with corresponding aet measurements of towers fig 9 suggests that both sets of aet estimates are roughly consistent with aet measurements and are able to capture their seasonal variability interannual variability and associated differences meanwhile reanalysis driven aet estimates do not cause excessive errors compared to tower driven aet estimates which provides a basis for further application of the improved p lsh algorithm to larger watershed scales in general reanalysis based temperature variables t day t max and t min show the highest correspondence with tower measurements and explain more than 90 of the variability while sm explains the least table 6 the correspondence r 2 between tower measurements and nasa gewex srb r n reanalysis vpd and u m are generally between the above results the error distributions of temperature variables are narrow and their average errors are within 3 c reanalysis based vpd and nasa gewex srb r n are generally overestimated relative to tower measurements and show considerable error distributions while reanalysis based u m and sm are slightly underestimated table 6 suggests that reanalysis based sm has the largest uncertainty followed by u m r n and vpd while the temperature variables have the lowest uncertainty the impacts of uncertainty of these seven meteorological variables on aet vary in different months for each flux tower we calculated rmsd for aet and seven meteorological variables between tower measurements and reanalysis meteorology or reanalysis driven aet estimates for each month results show that correlation coefficients of rmsd aet with rmsd t day rmsd t max rmsd t min rmsd vpd rmsd r n rmsd u m and rmsd sm are 0 23 p 0 1 0 19 p 0 1 0 25 p 0 1 0 20 p 0 1 0 42 p 0 001 0 20 p 0 1 and 0 04 p 0 1 for a total of 96 months respectively this indicates that uncertainty of reanalysis meteorology has various impacts on reanalysis driven aet estimates in different months for each flux tower overall rmsd aet has the strongest correlation with rmsd r n followed by rmsd t min rmsd t day rmsd vpd and rmsd u m but no obvious correlation with rmsd t max and rmsd sm in summary the uncertainty of r n vpd and u m are the major sources of the uncertainty of reanalysis driven aet estimates 4 6 comparison of the improved p lsh aet with the other remote sensing products we further compared the improved p lsh aet driven by reanalysis meteorology with other remote sensing products including the pmlv2 zhang et al 2019c and mod16a2 mu et al 2011 data the improved p lsh algorithm provides daily aet estimations while both pmlv2 and mod16a2 only provide the 8 day composites to make them comparable we aggregated the improved p lsh daily data into 8 day data it is clear that the results of the improved p lsh algorithm outperform the other products at all of the three towers fig 10 with an rmse of 3 36 mm and an r2 of 0 92 for all data series from the three towers the pmlv2 estimation has the second best performance but it has a relatively poor performance in simulating the seasonal variation at cn dan the mod16a2 has the lowest performance at all of the three sites and has large biases in summary the improved p lsh algorithm significantly improves the aet estimation of grassland over the tibetan plateau 5 discussion and conclusions generally speaking the sources of errors and uncertainty in the improved p lsh algorithm can be mainly divided into the following categories uncertainty of model structure uncertainty of model parameters uncertainty of inputs and uncertainty of the natural environment this study added incoming shortwave radiation and soil moisture as constraints in the estimation of canopy conductance which improved the model structure to a certain extent however the understanding of the physical process of aet is still incomplete specifically because the impact factors of canopy conductance have not been developed with a unified theory and interference between various factors increases the difficulty of accurately describing the physical process of aet zhang et al 2016 pointed out that the interactive effects between climatic variables in the jarvis stewart equation could not be well considered because of multiplying concomitant and the impacts of intercorrelation of different factors for the three tibetan plateau grasslands the correlation coefficient between the stress factors of temperature and soil moisture reaches 0 71 p 0 001 and multiple constraints of these factors may result in underestimation of the composite stress factor as a result the optimized g0 may be overestimated to offset this effect this suggests that although refinement of the model structure can improve simulation accuracy there is always a risk of introducing new uncertainty as the complexity of the model increases besides the roughness lengths and zero plane displacement height are simplified as linear functions of vegetation height in this study although such simplification has been widely used in aet estimation tang and li 2017 zhang et al 2019c the aerodynamic roughness lengths have some seasonal variability which can change as snow melts and vegetation grows li et al 2021 in recent years some studies have combined the wind profile equation with remote sensing inputs to estimate high resolution roughness lengths liu et al 2021 peng et al 2022 which can help improve the estimation of aet especially in the eastern and southern shrub and forest areas of the tibetan plateau the model structure improved in this study has been well applied in the grassland ecosystem of the tibetan plateau and the impacts of reanalysis meteorology on the aet have proved the feasibility of applying the algorithm on the pixel and watershed scales however due to the highly heterogenous climate topography and land cover of the tibetan plateau it is important to incorporate more observations and test the robustness of the algorithm in the other ecosystems such as shrublands and forests besides there are numerous bare soil and frozen soil on the tibetan plateau how to accurately quantify the soil moisture constraint on aet in these areas need be further studied in addition to structural errors of models unreasonable values of parameters also bring considerable uncertainty to model outputs hence scientists are committed to obtaining optimal parameter estimation that reflects the heterogeneity of land surface and vegetation for large scale aet assessment the most scientific and reasonable way is to calibrate parameters by measurements according to their physical meanings yet this is limited on a large scale the sobol and bayesian inference framework used in this study provides a valid approach to constrain model parameters by measurements we used sobol sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm results suggested that simulated aet was most sensitive to five parameters β t opt k r tot and b 3 which significantly influenced the accuracy of the simulation and three of above five parameters were related to conductance based on measurements from three flux towers the de mc method was applied to optimize the five sensitive parameters in the improved p lsh algorithm as well as three non sensitive parameters the posterior distributions of parameters were generally well constrained by measurements from flux towers based on the improved p lsh algorithm and optimized parameters this study more accurately simulated daily aet for three flux towers on the tibetan plateau compared with the original p lsh algorithm the improved algorithm optimized the daily simulation accuracy with r2 increasing from 0 90 to 0 93 and rmse dropping from 15 11 w m 2 to 11 39 w m 2 compared with two other remote sensing aet products the improved p lsh estimation has a better performance at all of the three towers indicating that the improved model structure and optimized parameters are the correct strategies for aet estimation we have discussed the improved stress factor m and the g0 ndvi response curve the optimized parameters β and t opt constrained gc for each tower and strengthened the inhibitory of lower temperature on canopy transpiration in winter the constraint of incoming shortwave radiation caused gc to deviate away from the previous smooth and continuous state while soil moisture restricted gc for all three towers except sometime in summer by considering the constraints of incoming shortwave radiation and soil moisture gc no longer highly relied on ndvi the corrected curve rose sharply when ndvi was higher than 0 2 and approached saturation after ndvi was higher than 0 45 one explanation was the limitation of measurements for calibration while another was that the constraint of ndvi on gc was replaced by soil moisture to a certain extent uncertainties in inputs lie mainly in errors of aet measurements and uncertainty of forcing data the existing flux towers are based on eddy covariance and there is an associated lack of energy balance closure due to complexity in wind patterns footprint representation and sampling variability wilson et al 2002 although we have corrected the errors in the energy balance closure via the bowen ratio method there is a certain uncertainty in estimating soil heat flux by an empirical formula for lack of measurements at towers cn dan and cn ha2 meanwhile eddy covariance flux towers provide aet measurements rather than its components i e canopy transpiration and soil evaporation which may result in errors offset in our calibration process thus sap flow or stable isotope technologies williams et al 2004 xu et al 2018 are needed to directly measure canopy transpiration and segment aet components and these approaches would help to further refine the model structure and parameters in terms of forcing data we compared tower driven and reanalysis driven aet estimates and found that they had similar performance compared with tower driven aet estimates the reanalysis driven aet estimates have slightly higher bias rmse and lower r2 mainly attributed to the difference between coarse resolution and local micrometeorology then we analyzed the uncertainty of coarse resolution reanalysis meteorological inputs and their impacts on model outputs and results showed that considerable uncertainty of rn vpd and um are major sources of uncertainty of reanalysis driven aet estimates nevertheless reanalysis driven aet estimates did not cause excessive errors the comprehensive r2 was reduced from 0 93 to 0 87 and annual and interannual variations of different towers could be captured two sets of aet estimates at the tower level showed generally favorable agreement with tower measurements at the daily scale which provided a basis for further application of the improved p lsh algorithm to larger watersheds although this study tested the impact of soil moisture constraint from a specific dataset on aet it may not be suitable for long term aet estimation because of the limited duration of 10 years in recent years more and more satellite microwave sensors have been widely used to estimate regional and global surface soil moisture and some representatives include smap entekhabi et al 2010 smos kerr et al 2012 amse2 parinussa et al 2015 and fengyun series parinussa et al 2014 when they are used to estimate aet in a large watershed or even on a global scale the availability of their daily soil moisture should be paid attention to because the revisit rates of various satellites are usually two days or even more in addition their coarse resolution and limited period may hinder the development of long term soil moisture driven aet estimates encouragingly more and more machine learning methods chen et al 2021 o and orth 2021 multi satellite joint retrieval zhang et al 2019a and downscaling method peng et al 2017 song et al 2022 of soil moisture have been developed in recent years which will promote the satellite retrieval of the soil moisture and aet communities finally the aet process is comprehensively affected by initial conditions boundary conditions complex physical factors noise and many other random and uncertain factors uncertainty of the natural environment mainly refers to the inherent randomness in the aet process spatially and temporally which results in the randomness of outputs this being the most uncontrollable factor in all situations in response to this it is possible to introduce stochastic processes into deterministic models in the future credit authorship contribution statement jin feng conceptualization methodology writing original draft visualization ke zhang

2932,dam construction and reservoir operation altered the landscape and hydrological process of reservoir bays affecting reservoir water quality however many landscape and hydrological connectivity metrics are highly correlated and may introduce redundancies and misleading results when use conventional multivariate regression techniques knowledge concerning the pure effects of landscape and hydrological connectivity metrics are crucial for understanding nonpoint pollution processes and guiding water quality protection strategies in reservoirs based on water quality monitoring data for six years 2015 2020 from 66 reservoir bays of the danjiangkou reservoir in china during both flood discharge periods fdps and water storage periods wsps machine learning approaches boosted regression trees and random forest were conducted to decipher the effects of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on water quality the results showed that landscape composition landscape configuration and topography had the combined importance of 46 69 31 48 and 10 14 on the overall water quality changes during the fdps respectively however landscape configuration was the largest importance factor controlling overall water quality for the wsps with the combined importance of 38 57 for the fdps the top two importance variables of overall water quality variation were the proportions of shrub and agricultural land in the reservoir bay for the wsps the top two importance variables were flow length and index of connectivity for specific water quality parameters the highest importance factor controlling the variation in total nitrogen total phosphorus ammonia nitrogen nitrate and chlorophyll a were landscape configuration while the landscape composition had the highest importance on the variation in permanganate index suggesting landscape characteristics affected water quality with specific responses to distinct water quality parameters these findings emphasize the distinct roles of landscape and hydrological characteristics on water quality and provide important information for the efficient formulation of water quality protection strategies in reservoirs keywords hydrological connectivity landscape characteristics machine learning reservoir bay water quality index data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction adequate and high quality water is crucial for achieving the united nations sustainable development goals the sixth of which is to ensure access to clean drinking water united nations 2016 the deterioration of water quality is a global environmental issue associated with rapid economic development and population growth threatening global water security dean and mitchell 2022 16 million reservoirs have been built to meet the dramatic surges in freshwater demands throughout the world by impounding dams and the global accumulation of water storage exceeds one sixth of the total annual flow of rivers into the ocean lehner et al 2011 however dam construction and reservoir operation altered landscape characteristics and hydrological process of reservoir bays rutledge and chow fraser 2019 hao et al 2021 these factors create significant challenges to quantify the causes of water quality fluctuations in reservoir bays xu et al 2019 quantification of the factors influencing reservoir water quality is crucial for understanding nonpoint pollution mechanism and implement efficient water pollution control strategies non point source pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus are lost from fields or landscape units and enter the reservoir bays with runoff including two key links one is the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus nonpoint source pollution sourcing which is controlled by the landscape composition and configurations ai et al 2015 wu and lu 2021 second is the migration process of nitrogen and phosphorus with runoff to the receiving water which is controlled by the hydrological connectivity haygarth and rufino 2021 landscape composition and configuration focus on the sources and transport paths of pollution while hydrological connectivity emphasizes the difficulty of promoting or hindering the transport of pollutants with runoff landscape characteristics including landscape composition landscape configuration and topography metrics affect the interception filtration and absorption of pollutants thereby changing the types and quantity of pollutants entering the waterbody shehab et al 2021 effects of landscape characteristics on water quality have been extensively established li et al 2020 shehab et al 2021 lei et al 2022 for example wu and lu 2021 explored the spatial scale and seasonal effects of landscape characteristics on stream water quality in eastern china lei et al 2022 investigated the influences of land use changes on the dynamic of water quality in a catchment of the germany however there is no consensus on the impact of landscape characteristics on water quality mainali and chang 2018 wu and lu 2021 these contradictory results may be ascribed to the heterogeneous landscape of each watershed and to the overlook of the influence of hydrological connectivity zhou et al 2017 li et al 2019 hydrological connectivity refers to the spatial contact of hillslopes high conductivity zones or landscape elements which influence material transfer rinderer et al 2018 saco et al 2020 which has received extensive attention in terms of water related issues such as sediment connectivity associated with soil erosion moreno de las heras et al 2020 liu et al 2022a eco environmental assessments for large floodplain systems li et al 2021b the variation in hydrological connectivity affects the flow path or pollutant transport across multiple spatial and temporal scales li et al 2019 saco et al 2020 influencing the water quality however the impact of hydrological connectivity on water quality still lacks sufficient data to verify especially coupled with landscape characteristics liu et al 2020 the pure effect of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on water quality is still unclear choosing appropriate methods is critical to distinguish the effect of landscape characteristics and hydrological connectivity on water quality conventional statistical approaches such as generalized additive models multiple linear regression can explore this effect by assuming a suitable data model and estimated model parameters from the data dunn and smyth 2018 however landscape characteristics and hydrological connectivity metrics are highly correlated and not independent variables which introduces redundancies and yields potentially misleading or biased results when used conventional multivariate regression techniques zhou et al 2012 therefore great caution must be exercised when dealing with multi collinear and noisy data to identify relationships carrascal et al 2009 the advantages of machine learnings are to avoid starting with a data model and apply various algorithms to learn the relationship between the response and its predictors huang et al 2021 and does not need to consider the interaction correlation between independent variables knoll et al 2019 vamathevan et al 2019 machine learning has regularization and does not need to consider the problem of collinearity when using large samples furthermore this approach has been applied to solve water related issues huang et al 2021 liu et al 2022b such as estimation of sediment load karami et al 2022 monitoring water quality through remote sensing sagan et al 2020 modelling coastal water and freshwater eutrophication shamshirband et al 2019 hadjisolomou et al 2021 although with great potential applying machine learning to distinguish the pure effect of landscape characteristics and hydrological connectivity on water quality is relatively lacking danjiangkou reservoir provides water sources for the middle route south to north water diversion project of china snwdp which is the longest trans basin water diversion project in the world and benefits over 58 million people in northern china the issues on water quality in reservoir are crucial for the long term and efficient operation of the snwdp in the same region the dynamics of dissolved heavy metals total nitrogen and total phosphorus in reservoir bays under different hydrological regulations have been examined li et al 2020 hao et al 2021 in addition we explored the effect of watershed landscape characteristics on stream water contamination in the reservoir tributary ai et al 2015 and the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of reservoir bays using partial least squares regression li et al 2020 however these previous studies ignore the impact of hydrological connectivity on water quality to fill these knowledge gaps we collected water samples from 66 reservoir bays in danjiangkou reservoir under different hydrological regulations from 2015 to 2020 specifically the main objectives of this study were i to unravel the effects of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on reservoir water quality ii to identify this effect varies with different hydrological regulation iii to determine the relative importance of these metrics on reservoir water quality variation we are testing two hypotheses 1 the impacts of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics were distinct under different hydrological regulations and 2 the relative importance of these metrics is distinct for different water quality parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the danjiangkou reservoir 32 36 33 48 n 110 59 111 49 e is located in the upper reaches of the han river fig 1 this reservoir provides water sources for the snwdp with a drainage area of 95 000 km2 and a storage capacity of 2 90 1010 m3 at the normal water level conditions i e 170 m xu et al 2019 the elevation ranges from 86 to 2084 m and the topography dominated by mountains and steep slopes fig 1 we selected 66 reservoir bays with different landscape backgrounds each of which has diverse human and natural conditions the major land use types are forestland followed by cultivated land orange trees and tea trees are primarily planted on mountains and hills around the reservoir bays some crops such as wheat corn rape are planted in the low elevation areas or terraces in the reservoir bays approximately 80 of people in the reservoir area live in rural areas this area has a subtropical monsoon climatic region with mean annual air temperature and precipitation of 15 8 c and 900 mm respectively over 80 of the precipitation falls from june to october more requirements are set to discharge water to control floods in rainy seasons therefore we defined june to october as flood discharge period fdps less precipitation occurred in november to may of the next year and water was stored in the reservoir to satisfy the water supply demands hence november to may of the following year was divided into water storage period wsps li et al 2020 2 2 sample collection and laboratory analysis we conducted a total of 9 sampling campaigns in the 66 reservoir bays from 2015 to 2020 fig 1 the average water level during the wsps and fdps was 158 2 and 165 3 m respectively three samples were collected in each reservoir bay using 500 ml polyethylene bottles from 0 5 m below the water surface for each sampling event all the samples were immediately acidified with sulfuric acid to ph 2 and stored at 4 c until analysis was conducted a total of 1728 samples were obtained for laboratory analysis a total of 11 water physio chemical parameters were analysed in situ and in the laboratory the

the dem the basin area of reservoir bays ranged from 2 55 to 38 59 km2 the land use types of each reservoir bay basin were determined by interpreting the aerial ortho images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle trimble ux5 according to previous studies giri and qiu 2016 wu and lu 2021 shehab et al 2021 a total of 19 landscape metrics was chosen including three categories of topography metrics landscape configuration metrics and landscape compositions metrics table 1 landscape composition refers to the proportion of each land use type in the landscape such as the proportions of agricultural land shrubland forest land in the catchment landscape configuration refers to the physical distribution and spatial characteristics of landscape patches and their relationships to one another mcgarigal et al 2012 landscape composition and configuration were well documented to have crucial impacts on water quality giri and qiu 2016 wu and lu 2021 shehab et al 2021 topography metrics have important influence on erosion process and runoff formation of the watershed and indirectly affects the water quality stephens et al 2021 the landscape characteristics were calculated using the software fragstat 4 2 mcgarigal et al 2012 considering both data availability and the advantages of each metric three metrics were applied to reflect the hydrological connectivity of the reservoir bays namely the index of connectivity ic flow length fl and topographic wetness index twi table 1 they are easily characterized by gis and are the primarily used hydrological connectivity indexes according to the previous studies heckmann et al 2018 najafi et al 2021 the average of ic fl and twi from all the cells was calculated to reflect overall the hydrological connectivity of each reservoir bay the fl was determined by the spatial analyst module in arcgis 10 2 based on the dem of the watershed in each reservoir bay fl reflects the distance from any point in the watershed to the outlet fl highlights the importance of topographic features in surface runoff connectivity and have been widely used to describe the connectivity of surface runoff source areas mayor et al 2008 heckmann et al 2018 the average fl was calculated as the potential runoff pathway lengths from all the cells of catchment in each reservoir bay twi reflects the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture and the potential to form surface runoff and describes the changes of topographic and their impact on surface runoff which reflects the hydrological connectivity of the watershed jancewicz et al 2019 previous study has proved that a static descriptor of surface hydrological connectivity based on twi is reasonable lane et al 2009 twi can reveal contrasting structural connectivity patterns in contrasting types of tableland sandstone jancewicz et al 2019 inter connected high twi cells are usually flow paths of surface runoff with high connectivity twi was calculated as follows 1 twi l n t a n β where α is the local upslope area per unit contour length m the β is the local slope angle anderson et al 2015 the larger the twi index the larger the slope confluence area in the reservoir bay ic reflects the connectivity between different parts of the landscape and spatial configuration of system components borselli et al 2008 for each cell of the watershed ic was determined by the upslope module dup and the downslope module ddown borselli et al 2008 crema and cavalli 2018 the ic was calculated using the following approach 2 ic k log 10 d up k d down k log 10 w k s k a k i k n k d i w i s i where the subscript k represents that each cell i in the watershed has its own ic value a is the upslope contributing area m2 and w k is the average weighting coefficient of a dimensionless s k is the average slope gradient of a m m di represents the distance to the main water sink or channel of the ith cell m si and wi represent the slope gradient and weighting coefficient of the ith cell respectively w represent the impedance to runoff and sediment fluxes due to the properties of the local land use and soil surface the c factor the crop vegetation and management factor of usle rusle models as the weighting factor more details can be seen in the borselli et al 2008 the average ic values of the reservoir bay were applied in this study the value range of the ic is with larger ic values for higher connectivity 2 4 water quality index to facilitate subsequent analysis and compare the relative importance of each hydrological connectivity and landscape metric on overall water quality we calculated water quality index wqi the wqi has the advantages of fully utilizing water quality parameter information and efficiently reflect the overall water quality status by the clear normative value nong et al 2020 wqi was calculated by the method which was proposed by pesce and wunderlin 2000 in the wqi calculation the determination of the key parameters and their weights considered the china s water environmental quality standards and previous studies koçer and sevgili 2014 wu et al 2018 nong et al 2020 each water quality parameter was given a weighting factor to reflect its importance in the overall water quality the calculation of wqi was expressed as follows 3 wqi i 1 n c i p i i 1 n p i where n is the total number of water quality parameters ci represents the normalized values of water quality parameter i which is calculated according to the previous study nong et al 2020 pi is the weight of water quality parameter i and ranged from 1 to 4 table 2 where 1 to 4 represented the increasing degree of impact on water quality according to the wqi values the water quality status in this study was divided into five grades i e very poor 0 20 poor 21 40 moderate 41 60 good 61 80 and excellent 81 100 2 5 machine learning approaches it is a common step to choose more than one modelling method in the statistical modelling of environmental applications because each method has specific strengths and weaknesses niittynen et al 2020 boosted regression trees brt and random forest rf were applied to determine the relative importance of hydrological connectivity and landscape metrics on water quality the higher the relative importance of a variable the stronger the effect of the variable on the prediction cheng et al 2022 although there is a certain overlap between landscape configuration or landscape composition and hydrological connectivity machine learning approaches has a strong learning ability and flexibility in dealing with different data formats and complex data and does not need to consider the interaction and correlation between independent variables breiman 2001 hu et al 2020 the brt method is an ensemble method with the strengths of regression trees and boosting algorithms elith et al 2008 the key features of brt include dealing with complex nonlinear relations between exploratory variables and insensitivity to data distribution the iteration of randomly selected subset data is conducted using a forward and stepwise procedure to minimize the loss function elith et al 2008 a stochastic gradient boosting procedure is used in brt to reduce the risk of overfitting and to improve model performance the learning rate and tree complexity need to be set in the brt the learning rate represents the involvement of each tree in the final fitted model the tree complexity determines whether interactions between variables are fitted and the size of trees the optimal parameter combination was chosen according to the minimum predictive deviance provided by these parameters yang et al 2016 a series of parameter combinations in the learning rate tree complexity and bag fraction were tested the final optimal values of the learning rate tree complexity and bag fraction were set to 0 001 6 and 0 75 respectively the number of trees is controlled by combination of the learning rate and tree complexity this combination generated at least 1000 trees the rf creates various decision trees without pruning and each tree is an independent set generated based on a random subset of data a boost strap aggregation bagging technique is used in the rf breiman 2001 the final ensemble model predictions in rf were determined by the average of all prediction trees the number of variables applied to grow each tree mtry and the number of trees in the forest ntree are chosen to optimize the rf model the mtry parameters determine the strength of each individual tree and the correlations between trees yang et al 2016 the number of ntree at least 500 proves to be reasonable to yield stable results grimm et al 2008 we conducted the rf model with ntree 750 mtry 2 for the fdps and ntree 500 mtry 2 for the wsps the rf algorithm improves the predictive performance of the models by reducing the variance of the model rf can quantify what variables are important in the predictions and detect the effect of the predictors in the ensemble the relative importance of variables is measured in the mean increase in prediction performance knoll et al 2019 in order to facilitate subsequent analysis and comparison the average value in the relative importance of each metric derived by brt and rf models was used in this study the workflow of the data along with the methods mentioned in this study was shown in fig 2 2 6 statistical analysis two way anovas were conducted to test the differences in individual water quality parameters among reservoir bays and sampling years the 66 reservoir bays and sampling years 2015 2020 were two factors we calculated the differences of 11 water quality parameters and wqi among reservoir bays and sampling years between fdps and wsps respectively post hoc comparisons were based on tukey s hsd the critical value of p 0 05 was applied to detect statistical significance the brt and rf were applied using a brt script provided by elith et al 2008 and the r randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 respectively all statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms were conducted using the software r v 3 4 4 r core team 2018 in this study 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal variations in reservoir water quality the water quality parameters in reservoir bays varied with reservoir bays and sampling years table 3 two way anovas showed that all the water quality parameters except do were significantly different p 0 05 among reservoir bays and sampling years during the fdps however no significant spatial variations were observed for the wt ph and do during the wsps all the water quality parameters except do exhibited significant p 0 05 variation over time table 3 the variation of the 11 water quality parameters concentration was displayed in figs 3 and 4 chl a presented the highest degree of variation with coefficients of variation cv of 110 63 and 135 70 in the fdps and wsps respectively the least variable water quality indicator was ph and the cv was 3 25 during the study periods the tur tp and nh4 n displayed a higher degree of variation compared to ph the nh4 n displayed the highest variation during the wsps the concentrations of all the water quality indicators were generally higher during the wsps the overall water quality status of reservoir bays in the danjiangkou reservoir varied with hydrological regulations and sampling years fig 4 the wqi value in the wsps was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the fdps the average wqi value was 72 06 6 38 mean 1sd in the fdps and 74 33 7 77 mean 1sd in the wsps indicating that overall water quality of danjiangkou reservoir bays was good level the wqi values ranged from 63 74 to 78 29 and changed significantly with sampling year p 0 001 during the fdps a similar pattern was also observed during the wsps in addition there were significant differences p 0 001 in the wqi values among reservoir bays for both the fdps and wsps the overall reservoir water quality exhibited obvious temporal spatial variation pattern 3 2 variations in hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics the landscape characteristics and hydrological connectivity of the local watershed differed among reservoir bays table 4 the slope ranged from 2 89 to 23 39 with an average value of 12 79 for the topography metrics pc mn and hd had a higher degree of variation than slope and hi the landscape compositions showed a large degree of variation with the average cv of 97 02 table 4 the average proportions of agricultural land residential land forestland shrubland and grassland were 30 44 5 15 28 30 23 57 and 4 88 respectively the agri had the highest degree of change the average cv of resident and grass was 107 64 and 143 91 respectively indicating the strong variation agricultural land accounted for the highest proportion of landscape composition but showed the lowest degree of variation table 4 the average ic and fl values was were 3 09 and 527 56 respectively the average twi value of the local watershed was 7 77 ranging from 5 26 to 13 86 the cv of area mn was 53 69 classified as the moderate variation and the remaining landscape configuration metrics exhibited slight variation with cv 50 table 4 3 3 effects of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on reservoir water quality the brt and rf approaches revealed that the effect of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on individual water quality parameters tn tp nh4 n no3 n chl a codmn varied with hydrological regulations fig 5 for the fdps landscape configuration was the most important factor controlling the variation of tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a with the combined importance of 65 30 46 88 52 75 55 26 and 38 35 in each indicator respectively however the highest important metric controlling the codmn was landscape composition with the combined importance of 41 07 fig 5 moreover topography metrics had minimal impact on tn tp nh4 n no3 n chl a and codmn changes with the combined importance of 6 61 10 26 8 42 11 78 12 97 and 9 21 in each indicator respectively fig 5 the combined importance of each category metrics for tn no3 n and chl a were in the following order landscape configuration 38 35 65 30 landscape composition 14 65 35 68 hydrological connectivity 12 30 14 70 topography metrics 6 60 12 97 landscape configuration and hydrological connectivity had a high importance controlling the variation in tp and nh4 n moreover the discrepancy in the combined importance of hydrological connectivity landscape composition topography metrics and landscape configuration from the fdps to the wsps was 87 24 0 76 25 42 and 11 39 for nh4 n respectively 37 20 14 37 15 21 and 12 96 for codmn 61 12 56 94 60 87 and 7 20 for chl a the combined importance of hydrological connectivity to the variation in tn tp nh4 n and codmn increased by 37 68 26 18 87 24 37 20 respectively from the wsps to fdps however the combined importance of hydrological connectivity for no3 n and chl a decreased by 26 47 and 61 11 respectively the effect of each hydrological connectivity and landscape metric on overall water quality was different between fdps and wsps fig 6 machine learning analysis revealed that the combined importance of landscape composition landscape configuration hydrological connectivity and topography metrics on overall water quality was 46 69 31 48 11 70 and 10 14 during the fdps respectively however landscape configuration was the most important factor controlling overall water quality during the wsps with the combined importance of 38 57 hydrological connectivity landscape composition and topography metrics had the combined importance of 27 88 21 46 and 12 09 on water quality during the wsps respectively for the fdps the top two importance variables controlling water quality were shrub and agri with the relative importance of 23 56 and 9 33 respectively fig 6 however the top two importance variables were fl mn ic mn in the wsps fig 6 with the relative importance of 13 97 11 10 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of different categories of landscape characteristics on reservoir water quality the effects of different categories of landscape characteristics metrics on reservoir water quality were disentangled using brt and rf approaches and the relative importance of each landscape metrics was identified in this study most of the previous studies mainly focused on using multivariate models to explore the relationships between individual landscape indicators and water quality giri and qiu 2016 li et al 2021a our results showed that landscape characteristics affected water quality with specific impacts to individual water quality parameters this result was consistent with the previous study shi et al 2017 in which the divergent impact of landscape pattern on water quality parameters was observed in the upper dan river basin the combined importance of landscape configuration for tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a were higher than those of landscape compositions while the landscape composition was the most important factor controlling the variation in codmn with the combined importance of 44 52 during the study periods fig 5 moreover the combined importance of landscape composition and landscape configuration on overall water quality were 7 40 43 85 and 20 08 26 67 higher than topography metrics respectively fig 6 the impact of landscape characteristics on overall water quality varied with hydrological regulations landscape composition had the greatest impact 46 69 on overall water quality during the fdps however landscape configuration had the greatest impact 38 57 on overall water quality during the wsps landscape compositions mainly reflect the characteristics of human activities determine the input source of pollutants and directly affect water quality shehab et al 2021 the results showed that shrub and agri had the highest importance of 23 56 and 9 33 on overall water quality during the fdps respectively fig 6 this impact ascribed the different effects of land use on pollution shrubland and forestland reduced the impact of pollutants on water quality through the absorption and utilization of plants and intercept pollution via hydrological paths zhou et al 2017 a large proportion of agriculture and shrub land are widely distributed in some reservoir bays no 14 31 60 bay in which fertilizers pesticides may enter the reservoir bays with runoff during the rainy season forestland and residential land accounted for a relatively small proportion in the reservoir bays li et al 2020 and contributed little impact of water quality variations with the relative importance of 5 29 and 3 61 respectively fig 6 topography strengthened the impact of land use on water quality by controlling the transport and flow paths of pollutants with surface runoff li et al 2020 in addition topography constrains the spatial distribution and quantity of pollution sources and affects the water quality of reservoir bays wu and lu 2021 topography had the relative importance of 10 14 12 09 controlling the water quality variations during the study period fig 6 our results showed that slope was the most significant topographic parameter affecting the variation in water quality with the combined importance of 3 46 fig 6 areas with higher slope variability may serve as sinks and steep slopes may accelerate runoff with particulates into reservoir bays pratt and chang 2012 landscape configuration affects the interception and absorption of pollutants during rainy seasons and describes the amount and distribution of patches belonging to a particular land use class li et al 2021a previous studies have shown that landscape configuration of watersheds has a significant influence on lake water quality and stream water quality liu et al 2012 wu and lu 2021 however general knowledge of reservoir bays is still limited our results showed that the combined importance of landscape configuration controlling the water quality variations was approximately 30 fig 6 this result was consistent with a previous study wu and lu 2021 in which the relative variation fractions of the overall water quality impacted by landscape configuration were 23 30 at the sub watershed scale moreover our result showed that iji and lsi was the most important landscape configuration factor controlling overall water quality fig 6 wu and lu 2021 also found lsi were the most essential landscape metrics at the sub watershed and the buffer scales 4 2 the variation of reservoir water quality related to hydrological connectivity hydrological connectivity represents the degree of sediment and nutrients transport by water flow in a system and determine the degree of transport spreading redistribution of pollutants bracken et al 2013 heckmann et al 2018 previous study showed that hydrological connectivity was an important factor affecting no3 n and tp transport and the flux in a wet year was approximately twice that recorded in a dry year outram et al 2016 our results showed that the impact of hydrological connectivity on water quality changed with hydrological regulations fdps and wsps the relative importance of hydrological connectivity metrics in the wsps 27 88 was even higher than that in the fdps 11 70 fig 6 some reasons could explain this phenomenon first runoff generation and water routing through a watershed profoundly affect the source and transport of pollutants zhou et al 2017 there was less runoff and pollutants migrate as dissolved forms through subsurface flows and groundwater during the wsps lintern et al 2018 moreover pollutants are difficult to diffuse degrade and transform in reservoir bays due to the encroachment and jacking influence of the mainstream beckmann et al 2005 pesticides and fertilizers are applied to wheat corn and rice farmland and citrus orchards mainly during the wsps hao et al 2021 however there is a higher dilution effect due to the higher water level which may trigger a reduction in the effect of hydrological connectivity on water quality in reservoir bays during the fdps therefore hydrological connectivity has a greater impact on water quality in the wsps than in the fdps the relative importance of different hydrological connectivity metrics fl mn ic mn and twi to the overall water quality variation were quantified under the fdps and wsps to the best of our knowledge no research identified of the effects of different hydrological connectivity metrics on reservoir water quality our results showed that fl mn ic mn and twi had the relative importance of 13 97 11 10 and 2 81 controlling water quality variation during the wsps respectively flow paths and structural connectivity of the watershed indicate how easily pollutants enter the water body from slope hills and affect the water quality of reservoir bays bracken et al 2013 an infrequent connectivity between source areas and active pathways is prone to causing larger concentration peaks of pollutants and makes a greater contribution to changes in water quality outram et al 2016 4 3 implications reservoir bays are the initial and most sensitive areas in the dynamic variation in reservoir water quality because of the interaction of natural and intense anthropogenic activities li et al 2020 these reservoir bays were mainly influenced by anthropogenic activities such as urban domestic sewage and industrial wastewater fig 7 therefore effective measures need to be taken in the future to solve the problem of water pollution in individual reservoir bay on the one hand landscape scale regulation should be implemented in the reservoir bays our results showed that landscape configuration had the highest effects on tn with the combined importance of 60 02 during the study period followed by landscape composition 14 71 fig 5 monitoring data showed that the average value of tn was 1 35 mg l during the study periods which exceeded the class iii standard threshold 1 0 mg l of the environmental quality standards for surface water china 2002 this provides key information of land use and landscape pattern planning for reducing tn concentration for example decreasing landscape fragmentation and enhancing the patch boundary complexity of local watersheds would improve water quality shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 moreover shrub and agri were the top explanatory variables of overall water quality variations with the combined importance of 23 56 and 9 33 respectively during the fdps fig 6 some ecological restoration measures such as terrace construction and vegetation restoration wei et al 2016 as well as precision fertilizers and pesticides in farmland can effectively reduce nutrient loss from land shi et al 2017 on the other hand our result showed that fl mn and ic mn had high relative importance to the water quality variations with the combined importance of 13 97 and 11 10 respectively during the wsps fig 6 the construction of ponds dams and sedimentation basins can reduce hydrological connectivity which prevents the rapid transfer of pollutants with runoff into reservoir bays sun et al 2021 furthermore hydrodynamic characteristics caused by reservoir operation should be considered in management planning many previous studies have confirmed that more robust results can be obtained using multiple machine learning methods knoll et al 2019 tan et al 2020 niittynen et al 2020 although the combined importance of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics to water quality were different during the fdps and wsps the similar trends and patterns were detected using brt and rf fig 5 for instance both brt and rf approach showed that landscape configuration had the greatest impact on tn tp nh4 n during the fdps but the degree of combined importance was different this difference may be attributed to the partitioning in model structure sampling training algorithm output method breiman 2001 elith et al 2008 kouadri et al 2021 applied eight artificial intelligence algorithms to generate wqi prediction and found that different machine learning has divergent prediction performance under different situations and parameter input situations we recommend the combination of brt and rf to determine the relationship between environmental variables and water quality however quantifying the relative importance of explanatory variables should consider the general model performances and not only the ranking within each model knoll et al 2019 in the future the impact of hydrological connectivity and landscape on water quality should be identified at different spatial scale then the landscape and hydrological structures are adjusted to meet the water quality requirements moreover different deep learning techniques such as support vector machine neural networks can be applied to predict water quality and status of eutrophication in various aquatic ecosystem and the region with a lack or unavailability of data alizadeh et al 2018 deng et al 2021 kouadri et al 2021 furthermore the machine learning approaches can be combined with tracer technology hydrodynamic models and remote sensing to identify the sources of pollution 5 conclusion the water quality in reservoir bays of danjiangkou reservoir which is the water sources of the snwdp were investigated from 2015 to 2020 building upon these data we applied machine learning approaches to decipher the impacts of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on reservoir water quality under different hydrological regulations the main conclusions are as follows 1 landscape characteristics had different impact on individual water quality parameters landscape configuration had higher importance for tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a than those of landscape compositions while the landscape composition was the highest importance controlling the variation in codmn topography metrics had minimal impact on water quality changes 2 the hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics had different effects on overall water quality and this effect varied with hydrological regulations landscape composition had the greatest impact on water quality with the combined importance of 46 69 during the fdps however landscape configuration metrics had the largest impact with the combined importance of 38 57 on water quality during the wsps 3 the effect of each hydrological connectivity and landscape metrics on overall reservoir water quality was distinct under different hydrological regulations the top two importance variables controlling overall water quality was shrub and agri with the relative importance of 23 56 and 9 33 during the fdps however fl mn and ic mn had the relative importance of 13 97 and 11 10 on overall water quality variation during the wsps respectively this study greatly improved our understanding of the key landscape and hydrological characteristics impacting water quality under different hydrological regulations the application of machine learning algorithms provides a useful approach for elucidating landscape and hydrological drivers of water quality changes the research results have significant implications for more efficient protection of reservoir water quality in similar water diversion project for example water quality can be protected by adjusting the landscape composition such as changing the composition ratio of shrub land and agricultural land in the reservoir bays at the same time the landscape pattern can be optimized such as adjusting the density of farmland patches or the degree of dispersion of residential areas in the reservoir this study only investigated part of the water quality parameters and more water quality parameters should be explored to more comprehensively reflect the water quality status in the future such as dissolved heavy metals fecal coliform five day biochemical oxygen demand etc moreover we could not provide enough information to validate the relative importance of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on water quality and scenario simulation or model can be used to verify this effect at multi spatial scales in the future research furthermore the thresholds for critical landscape characteristics metrics affecting water quality need to be explored for more effectively water quality protection credit authorship contribution statement j wang conceptualization methodology formal

2932,dam construction and reservoir operation altered the landscape and hydrological process of reservoir bays affecting reservoir water quality however many landscape and hydrological connectivity metrics are highly correlated and may introduce redundancies and misleading results when use conventional multivariate regression techniques knowledge concerning the pure effects of landscape and hydrological connectivity metrics are crucial for understanding nonpoint pollution processes and guiding water quality protection strategies in reservoirs based on water quality monitoring data for six years 2015 2020 from 66 reservoir bays of the danjiangkou reservoir in china during both flood discharge periods fdps and water storage periods wsps machine learning approaches boosted regression trees and random forest were conducted to decipher the effects of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on water quality the results showed that landscape composition landscape configuration and topography had the combined importance of 46 69 31 48 and 10 14 on the overall water quality changes during the fdps respectively however landscape configuration was the largest importance factor controlling overall water quality for the wsps with the combined importance of 38 57 for the fdps the top two importance variables of overall water quality variation were the proportions of shrub and agricultural land in the reservoir bay for the wsps the top two importance variables were flow length and index of connectivity for specific water quality parameters the highest importance factor controlling the variation in total nitrogen total phosphorus ammonia nitrogen nitrate and chlorophyll a were landscape configuration while the landscape composition had the highest importance on the variation in permanganate index suggesting landscape characteristics affected water quality with specific responses to distinct water quality parameters these findings emphasize the distinct roles of landscape and hydrological characteristics on water quality and provide important information for the efficient formulation of water quality protection strategies in reservoirs keywords hydrological connectivity landscape characteristics machine learning reservoir bay water quality index data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction adequate and high quality water is crucial for achieving the united nations sustainable development goals the sixth of which is to ensure access to clean drinking water united nations 2016 the deterioration of water quality is a global environmental issue associated with rapid economic development and population growth threatening global water security dean and mitchell 2022 16 million reservoirs have been built to meet the dramatic surges in freshwater demands throughout the world by impounding dams and the global accumulation of water storage exceeds one sixth of the total annual flow of rivers into the ocean lehner et al 2011 however dam construction and reservoir operation altered landscape characteristics and hydrological process of reservoir bays rutledge and chow fraser 2019 hao et al 2021 these factors create significant challenges to quantify the causes of water quality fluctuations in reservoir bays xu et al 2019 quantification of the factors influencing reservoir water quality is crucial for understanding nonpoint pollution mechanism and implement efficient water pollution control strategies non point source pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus are lost from fields or landscape units and enter the reservoir bays with runoff including two key links one is the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus nonpoint source pollution sourcing which is controlled by the landscape composition and configurations ai et al 2015 wu and lu 2021 second is the migration process of nitrogen and phosphorus with runoff to the receiving water which is controlled by the hydrological connectivity haygarth and rufino 2021 landscape composition and configuration focus on the sources and transport paths of pollution while hydrological connectivity emphasizes the difficulty of promoting or hindering the transport of pollutants with runoff landscape characteristics including landscape composition landscape configuration and topography metrics affect the interception filtration and absorption of pollutants thereby changing the types and quantity of pollutants entering the waterbody shehab et al 2021 effects of landscape characteristics on water quality have been extensively established li et al 2020 shehab et al 2021 lei et al 2022 for example wu and lu 2021 explored the spatial scale and seasonal effects of landscape characteristics on stream water quality in eastern china lei et al 2022 investigated the influences of land use changes on the dynamic of water quality in a catchment of the germany however there is no consensus on the impact of landscape characteristics on water quality mainali and chang 2018 wu and lu 2021 these contradictory results may be ascribed to the heterogeneous landscape of each watershed and to the overlook of the influence of hydrological connectivity zhou et al 2017 li et al 2019 hydrological connectivity refers to the spatial contact of hillslopes high conductivity zones or landscape elements which influence material transfer rinderer et al 2018 saco et al 2020 which has received extensive attention in terms of water related issues such as sediment connectivity associated with soil erosion moreno de las heras et al 2020 liu et al 2022a eco environmental assessments for large floodplain systems li et al 2021b the variation in hydrological connectivity affects the flow path or pollutant transport across multiple spatial and temporal scales li et al 2019 saco et al 2020 influencing the water quality however the impact of hydrological connectivity on water quality still lacks sufficient data to verify especially coupled with landscape characteristics liu et al 2020 the pure effect of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on water quality is still unclear choosing appropriate methods is critical to distinguish the effect of landscape characteristics and hydrological connectivity on water quality conventional statistical approaches such as generalized additive models multiple linear regression can explore this effect by assuming a suitable data model and estimated model parameters from the data dunn and smyth 2018 however landscape characteristics and hydrological connectivity metrics are highly correlated and not independent variables which introduces redundancies and yields potentially misleading or biased results when used conventional multivariate regression techniques zhou et al 2012 therefore great caution must be exercised when dealing with multi collinear and noisy data to identify relationships carrascal et al 2009 the advantages of machine learnings are to avoid starting with a data model and apply various algorithms to learn the relationship between the response and its predictors huang et al 2021 and does not need to consider the interaction correlation between independent variables knoll et al 2019 vamathevan et al 2019 machine learning has regularization and does not need to consider the problem of collinearity when using large samples furthermore this approach has been applied to solve water related issues huang et al 2021 liu et al 2022b such as estimation of sediment load karami et al 2022 monitoring water quality through remote sensing sagan et al 2020 modelling coastal water and freshwater eutrophication shamshirband et al 2019 hadjisolomou et al 2021 although with great potential applying machine learning to distinguish the pure effect of landscape characteristics and hydrological connectivity on water quality is relatively lacking danjiangkou reservoir provides water sources for the middle route south to north water diversion project of china snwdp which is the longest trans basin water diversion project in the world and benefits over 58 million people in northern china the issues on water quality in reservoir are crucial for the long term and efficient operation of the snwdp in the same region the dynamics of dissolved heavy metals total nitrogen and total phosphorus in reservoir bays under different hydrological regulations have been examined li et al 2020 hao et al 2021 in addition we explored the effect of watershed landscape characteristics on stream water contamination in the reservoir tributary ai et al 2015 and the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of reservoir bays using partial least squares regression li et al 2020 however these previous studies ignore the impact of hydrological connectivity on water quality to fill these knowledge gaps we collected water samples from 66 reservoir bays in danjiangkou reservoir under different hydrological regulations from 2015 to 2020 specifically the main objectives of this study were i to unravel the effects of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on reservoir water quality ii to identify this effect varies with different hydrological regulation iii to determine the relative importance of these metrics on reservoir water quality variation we are testing two hypotheses 1 the impacts of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics were distinct under different hydrological regulations and 2 the relative importance of these metrics is distinct for different water quality parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the danjiangkou reservoir 32 36 33 48 n 110 59 111 49 e is located in the upper reaches of the han river fig 1 this reservoir provides water sources for the snwdp with a drainage area of 95 000 km2 and a storage capacity of 2 90 1010 m3 at the normal water level conditions i e 170 m xu et al 2019 the elevation ranges from 86 to 2084 m and the topography dominated by mountains and steep slopes fig 1 we selected 66 reservoir bays with different landscape backgrounds each of which has diverse human and natural conditions the major land use types are forestland followed by cultivated land orange trees and tea trees are primarily planted on mountains and hills around the reservoir bays some crops such as wheat corn rape are planted in the low elevation areas or terraces in the reservoir bays approximately 80 of people in the reservoir area live in rural areas this area has a subtropical monsoon climatic region with mean annual air temperature and precipitation of 15 8 c and 900 mm respectively over 80 of the precipitation falls from june to october more requirements are set to discharge water to control floods in rainy seasons therefore we defined june to october as flood discharge period fdps less precipitation occurred in november to may of the next year and water was stored in the reservoir to satisfy the water supply demands hence november to may of the following year was divided into water storage period wsps li et al 2020 2 2 sample collection and laboratory analysis we conducted a total of 9 sampling campaigns in the 66 reservoir bays from 2015 to 2020 fig 1 the average water level during the wsps and fdps was 158 2 and 165 3 m respectively three samples were collected in each reservoir bay using 500 ml polyethylene bottles from 0 5 m below the water surface for each sampling event all the samples were immediately acidified with sulfuric acid to ph 2 and stored at 4 c until analysis was conducted a total of 1728 samples were obtained for laboratory analysis a total of 11 water physio chemical parameters were analysed in situ and in the laboratory the surface water temperature wt ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do turbidity tur and chlorophyll a chl a were measured in situ using water quality multiparameter analyser ysi exo2 ysi inc ohio usa total nitrogen tn was analysed using the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method total phosphorus tp was determined by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and nitrate no3 n was measured with an aa3 continuous flow chemical analyser flastar 5000 bran luebbe germany permanganate index codmn was analysed using the acidic potassium permanganate method 2 3 hydrological connectivity and landscape metrics a digital elevation model dem 25 m 25 m of the danjiangkou reservoir area with a scale of 1 50 000 was supplied by the state bureau of surveying and cartography of china li et al 2020 the basin areas and boundaries of each reservoir bay were determined by the hydrological analysis module in arcgis 10 2 according to the dem the basin area of reservoir bays ranged from 2 55 to 38 59 km2 the land use types of each reservoir bay basin were determined by interpreting the aerial ortho images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle trimble ux5 according to previous studies giri and qiu 2016 wu and lu 2021 shehab et al 2021 a total of 19 landscape metrics was chosen including three categories of topography metrics landscape configuration metrics and landscape compositions metrics table 1 landscape composition refers to the proportion of each land use type in the landscape such as the proportions of agricultural land shrubland forest land in the catchment landscape configuration refers to the physical distribution and spatial characteristics of landscape patches and their relationships to one another mcgarigal et al 2012 landscape composition and configuration were well documented to have crucial impacts on water quality giri and qiu 2016 wu and lu 2021 shehab et al 2021 topography metrics have important influence on erosion process and runoff formation of the watershed and indirectly affects the water quality stephens et al 2021 the landscape characteristics were calculated using the software fragstat 4 2 mcgarigal et al 2012 considering both data availability and the advantages of each metric three metrics were applied to reflect the hydrological connectivity of the reservoir bays namely the index of connectivity ic flow length fl and topographic wetness index twi table 1 they are easily characterized by gis and are the primarily used hydrological connectivity indexes according to the previous studies heckmann et al 2018 najafi et al 2021 the average of ic fl and twi from all the cells was calculated to reflect overall the hydrological connectivity of each reservoir bay the fl was determined by the spatial analyst module in arcgis 10 2 based on the dem of the watershed in each reservoir bay fl reflects the distance from any point in the watershed to the outlet fl highlights the importance of topographic features in surface runoff connectivity and have been widely used to describe the connectivity of surface runoff source areas mayor et al 2008 heckmann et al 2018 the average fl was calculated as the potential runoff pathway lengths from all the cells of catchment in each reservoir bay twi reflects the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture and the potential to form surface runoff and describes the changes of topographic and their impact on surface runoff which reflects the hydrological connectivity of the watershed jancewicz et al 2019 previous study has proved that a static descriptor of surface hydrological connectivity based on twi is reasonable lane et al 2009 twi can reveal contrasting structural connectivity patterns in contrasting types of tableland sandstone jancewicz et al 2019 inter connected high twi cells are usually flow paths of surface runoff with high connectivity twi was calculated as follows 1 twi l n t a n β where α is the local upslope area per unit contour length m the β is the local slope angle anderson et al 2015 the larger the twi index the larger the slope confluence area in the reservoir bay ic reflects the connectivity between different parts of the landscape and spatial configuration of system components borselli et al 2008 for each cell of the watershed ic was determined by the upslope module dup and the downslope module ddown borselli et al 2008 crema and cavalli 2018 the ic was calculated using the following approach 2 ic k log 10 d up k d down k log 10 w k s k a k i k n k d i w i s i where the subscript k represents that each cell i in the watershed has its own ic value a is the upslope contributing area m2 and w k is the average weighting coefficient of a dimensionless s k is the average slope gradient of a m m di represents the distance to the main water sink or channel of the ith cell m si and wi represent the slope gradient and weighting coefficient of the ith cell respectively w represent the impedance to runoff and sediment fluxes due to the properties of the local land use and soil surface the c factor the crop vegetation and management factor of usle rusle models as the weighting factor more details can be seen in the borselli et al 2008 the average ic values of the reservoir bay were applied in this study the value range of the ic is with larger ic values for higher connectivity 2 4 water quality index to facilitate subsequent analysis and compare the relative importance of each hydrological connectivity and landscape metric on overall water quality we calculated water quality index wqi the wqi has the advantages of fully utilizing water quality parameter information and efficiently reflect the overall water quality status by the clear normative value nong et al 2020 wqi was calculated by the method which was proposed by pesce and wunderlin 2000 in the wqi calculation the determination of the key parameters and their weights considered the china s water environmental quality standards and previous studies koçer and sevgili 2014 wu et al 2018 nong et al 2020 each water quality parameter was given a weighting factor to reflect its importance in the overall water quality the calculation of wqi was expressed as follows 3 wqi i 1 n c i p i i 1 n p i where n is the total number of water quality parameters ci represents the normalized values of water quality parameter i which is calculated according to the previous study nong et al 2020 pi is the weight of water quality parameter i and ranged from 1 to 4 table 2 where 1 to 4 represented the increasing degree of impact on water quality according to the wqi values the water quality status in this study was divided into five grades i e very poor 0 20 poor 21 40 moderate 41 60 good 61 80 and excellent 81 100 2 5 machine learning approaches it is a common step to choose more than one modelling method in the statistical modelling of environmental applications because each method has specific strengths and weaknesses niittynen et al 2020 boosted regression trees brt and random forest rf were applied to determine the relative importance of hydrological connectivity and landscape metrics on water quality the higher the relative importance of a variable the stronger the effect of the variable on the prediction cheng et al 2022 although there is a certain overlap between landscape configuration or landscape composition and hydrological connectivity machine learning approaches has a strong learning ability and flexibility in dealing with different data formats and complex data and does not need to consider the interaction and correlation between independent variables breiman 2001 hu et al 2020 the brt method is an ensemble method with the strengths of regression trees and boosting algorithms elith et al 2008 the key features of brt include dealing with complex nonlinear relations between exploratory variables and insensitivity to data distribution the iteration of randomly selected subset data is conducted using a forward and stepwise procedure to minimize the loss function elith et al 2008 a stochastic gradient boosting procedure is used in brt to reduce the risk of overfitting and to improve model performance the learning rate and tree complexity need to be set in the brt the learning rate represents the involvement of each tree in the final fitted model the tree complexity determines whether interactions between variables are fitted and the size of trees the optimal parameter combination was chosen according to the minimum predictive deviance provided by these parameters yang et al 2016 a series of parameter combinations in the learning rate tree complexity and bag fraction were tested the final optimal values of the learning rate tree complexity and bag fraction were set to 0 001 6 and 0 75 respectively the number of trees is controlled by combination of the learning rate and tree complexity this combination generated at least 1000 trees the rf creates various decision trees without pruning and each tree is an independent set generated based on a random subset of data a boost strap aggregation bagging technique is used in the rf breiman 2001 the final ensemble model predictions in rf were determined by the average of all prediction trees the number of variables applied to grow each tree mtry and the number of trees in the forest ntree are chosen to optimize the rf model the mtry parameters determine the strength of each individual tree and the correlations between trees yang et al 2016 the number of ntree at least 500 proves to be reasonable to yield stable results grimm et al 2008 we conducted the rf model with ntree 750 mtry 2 for the fdps and ntree 500 mtry 2 for the wsps the rf algorithm improves the predictive performance of the models by reducing the variance of the model rf can quantify what variables are important in the predictions and detect the effect of the predictors in the ensemble the relative importance of variables is measured in the mean increase in prediction performance knoll et al 2019 in order to facilitate subsequent analysis and comparison the average value in the relative importance of each metric derived by brt and rf models was used in this study the workflow of the data along with the methods mentioned in this study was shown in fig 2 2 6 statistical analysis two way anovas were conducted to test the differences in individual water quality parameters among reservoir bays and sampling years the 66 reservoir bays and sampling years 2015 2020 were two factors we calculated the differences of 11 water quality parameters and wqi among reservoir bays and sampling years between fdps and wsps respectively post hoc comparisons were based on tukey s hsd the critical value of p 0 05 was applied to detect statistical significance the brt and rf were applied using a brt script provided by elith et al 2008 and the r randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 respectively all statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms were conducted using the software r v 3 4 4 r core team 2018 in this study 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal variations in reservoir water quality the water quality parameters in reservoir bays varied with reservoir bays and sampling years table 3 two way anovas showed that all the water quality parameters except do were significantly different p 0 05 among reservoir bays and sampling years during the fdps however no significant spatial variations were observed for the wt ph and do during the wsps all the water quality parameters except do exhibited significant p 0 05 variation over time table 3 the variation of the 11 water quality parameters concentration was displayed in figs 3 and 4 chl a presented the highest degree of variation with coefficients of variation cv of 110 63 and 135 70 in the fdps and wsps respectively the least variable water quality indicator was ph and the cv was 3 25 during the study periods the tur tp and nh4 n displayed a higher degree of variation compared to ph the nh4 n displayed the highest variation during the wsps the concentrations of all the water quality indicators were generally higher during the wsps the overall water quality status of reservoir bays in the danjiangkou reservoir varied with hydrological regulations and sampling years fig 4 the wqi value in the wsps was significantly p 0 05 higher than that in the fdps the average wqi value was 72 06 6 38 mean 1sd in the fdps and 74 33 7 77 mean 1sd in the wsps indicating that overall water quality of danjiangkou reservoir bays was good level the wqi values ranged from 63 74 to 78 29 and changed significantly with sampling year p 0 001 during the fdps a similar pattern was also observed during the wsps in addition there were significant differences p 0 001 in the wqi values among reservoir bays for both the fdps and wsps the overall reservoir water quality exhibited obvious temporal spatial variation pattern 3 2 variations in hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics the landscape characteristics and hydrological connectivity of the local watershed differed among reservoir bays table 4 the slope ranged from 2 89 to 23 39 with an average value of 12 79 for the topography metrics pc mn and hd had a higher degree of variation than slope and hi the landscape compositions showed a large degree of variation with the average cv of 97 02 table 4 the average proportions of agricultural land residential land forestland shrubland and grassland were 30 44 5 15 28 30 23 57 and 4 88 respectively the agri had the highest degree of change the average cv of resident and grass was 107 64 and 143 91 respectively indicating the strong variation agricultural land accounted for the highest proportion of landscape composition but showed the lowest degree of variation table 4 the average ic and fl values was were 3 09 and 527 56 respectively the average twi value of the local watershed was 7 77 ranging from 5 26 to 13 86 the cv of area mn was 53 69 classified as the moderate variation and the remaining landscape configuration metrics exhibited slight variation with cv 50 table 4 3 3 effects of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on reservoir water quality the brt and rf approaches revealed that the effect of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on individual water quality parameters tn tp nh4 n no3 n chl a codmn varied with hydrological regulations fig 5 for the fdps landscape configuration was the most important factor controlling the variation of tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a with the combined importance of 65 30 46 88 52 75 55 26 and 38 35 in each indicator respectively however the highest important metric controlling the codmn was landscape composition with the combined importance of 41 07 fig 5 moreover topography metrics had minimal impact on tn tp nh4 n no3 n chl a and codmn changes with the combined importance of 6 61 10 26 8 42 11 78 12 97 and 9 21 in each indicator respectively fig 5 the combined importance of each category metrics for tn no3 n and chl a were in the following order landscape configuration 38 35 65 30 landscape composition 14 65 35 68 hydrological connectivity 12 30 14 70 topography metrics 6 60 12 97 landscape configuration and hydrological connectivity had a high importance controlling the variation in tp and nh4 n moreover the discrepancy in the combined importance of hydrological connectivity landscape composition topography metrics and landscape configuration from the fdps to the wsps was 87 24 0 76 25 42 and 11 39 for nh4 n respectively 37 20 14 37 15 21 and 12 96 for codmn 61 12 56 94 60 87 and 7 20 for chl a the combined importance of hydrological connectivity to the variation in tn tp nh4 n and codmn increased by 37 68 26 18 87 24 37 20 respectively from the wsps to fdps however the combined importance of hydrological connectivity for no3 n and chl a decreased by 26 47 and 61 11 respectively the effect of each hydrological connectivity and landscape metric on overall water quality was different between fdps and wsps fig 6 machine learning analysis revealed that the combined importance of landscape composition landscape configuration hydrological connectivity and topography metrics on overall water quality was 46 69 31 48 11 70 and 10 14 during the fdps respectively however landscape configuration was the most important factor controlling overall water quality during the wsps with the combined importance of 38 57 hydrological connectivity landscape composition and topography metrics had the combined importance of 27 88 21 46 and 12 09 on water quality during the wsps respectively for the fdps the top two importance variables controlling water quality were shrub and agri with the relative importance of 23 56 and 9 33 respectively fig 6 however the top two importance variables were fl mn ic mn in the wsps fig 6 with the relative importance of 13 97 11 10 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of different categories of landscape characteristics on reservoir water quality the effects of different categories of landscape characteristics metrics on reservoir water quality were disentangled using brt and rf approaches and the relative importance of each landscape metrics was identified in this study most of the previous studies mainly focused on using multivariate models to explore the relationships between individual landscape indicators and water quality giri and qiu 2016 li et al 2021a our results showed that landscape characteristics affected water quality with specific impacts to individual water quality parameters this result was consistent with the previous study shi et al 2017 in which the divergent impact of landscape pattern on water quality parameters was observed in the upper dan river basin the combined importance of landscape configuration for tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a were higher than those of landscape compositions while the landscape composition was the most important factor controlling the variation in codmn with the combined importance of 44 52 during the study periods fig 5 moreover the combined importance of landscape composition and landscape configuration on overall water quality were 7 40 43 85 and 20 08 26 67 higher than topography metrics respectively fig 6 the impact of landscape characteristics on overall water quality varied with hydrological regulations landscape composition had the greatest impact 46 69 on overall water quality during the fdps however landscape configuration had the greatest impact 38 57 on overall water quality during the wsps landscape compositions mainly reflect the characteristics of human activities determine the input source of pollutants and directly affect water quality shehab et al 2021 the results showed that shrub and agri had the highest importance of 23 56 and 9 33 on overall water quality during the fdps respectively fig 6 this impact ascribed the different effects of land use on pollution shrubland and forestland reduced the impact of pollutants on water quality through the absorption and utilization of plants and intercept pollution via hydrological paths zhou et al 2017 a large proportion of agriculture and shrub land are widely distributed in some reservoir bays no 14 31 60 bay in which fertilizers pesticides may enter the reservoir bays with runoff during the rainy season forestland and residential land accounted for a relatively small proportion in the reservoir bays li et al 2020 and contributed little impact of water quality variations with the relative importance of 5 29 and 3 61 respectively fig 6 topography strengthened the impact of land use on water quality by controlling the transport and flow paths of pollutants with surface runoff li et al 2020 in addition topography constrains the spatial distribution and quantity of pollution sources and affects the water quality of reservoir bays wu and lu 2021 topography had the relative importance of 10 14 12 09 controlling the water quality variations during the study period fig 6 our results showed that slope was the most significant topographic parameter affecting the variation in water quality with the combined importance of 3 46 fig 6 areas with higher slope variability may serve as sinks and steep slopes may accelerate runoff with particulates into reservoir bays pratt and chang 2012 landscape configuration affects the interception and absorption of pollutants during rainy seasons and describes the amount and distribution of patches belonging to a particular land use class li et al 2021a previous studies have shown that landscape configuration of watersheds has a significant influence on lake water quality and stream water quality liu et al 2012 wu and lu 2021 however general knowledge of reservoir bays is still limited our results showed that the combined importance of landscape configuration controlling the water quality variations was approximately 30 fig 6 this result was consistent with a previous study wu and lu 2021 in which the relative variation fractions of the overall water quality impacted by landscape configuration were 23 30 at the sub watershed scale moreover our result showed that iji and lsi was the most important landscape configuration factor controlling overall water quality fig 6 wu and lu 2021 also found lsi were the most essential landscape metrics at the sub watershed and the buffer scales 4 2 the variation of reservoir water quality related to hydrological connectivity hydrological connectivity represents the degree of sediment and nutrients transport by water flow in a system and determine the degree of transport spreading redistribution of pollutants bracken et al 2013 heckmann et al 2018 previous study showed that hydrological connectivity was an important factor affecting no3 n and tp transport and the flux in a wet year was approximately twice that recorded in a dry year outram et al 2016 our results showed that the impact of hydrological connectivity on water quality changed with hydrological regulations fdps and wsps the relative importance of hydrological connectivity metrics in the wsps 27 88 was even higher than that in the fdps 11 70 fig 6 some reasons could explain this phenomenon first runoff generation and water routing through a watershed profoundly affect the source and transport of pollutants zhou et al 2017 there was less runoff and pollutants migrate as dissolved forms through subsurface flows and groundwater during the wsps lintern et al 2018 moreover pollutants are difficult to diffuse degrade and transform in reservoir bays due to the encroachment and jacking influence of the mainstream beckmann et al 2005 pesticides and fertilizers are applied to wheat corn and rice farmland and citrus orchards mainly during the wsps hao et al 2021 however there is a higher dilution effect due to the higher water level which may trigger a reduction in the effect of hydrological connectivity on water quality in reservoir bays during the fdps therefore hydrological connectivity has a greater impact on water quality in the wsps than in the fdps the relative importance of different hydrological connectivity metrics fl mn ic mn and twi to the overall water quality variation were quantified under the fdps and wsps to the best of our knowledge no research identified of the effects of different hydrological connectivity metrics on reservoir water quality our results showed that fl mn ic mn and twi had the relative importance of 13 97 11 10 and 2 81 controlling water quality variation during the wsps respectively flow paths and structural connectivity of the watershed indicate how easily pollutants enter the water body from slope hills and affect the water quality of reservoir bays bracken et al 2013 an infrequent connectivity between source areas and active pathways is prone to causing larger concentration peaks of pollutants and makes a greater contribution to changes in water quality outram et al 2016 4 3 implications reservoir bays are the initial and most sensitive areas in the dynamic variation in reservoir water quality because of the interaction of natural and intense anthropogenic activities li et al 2020 these reservoir bays were mainly influenced by anthropogenic activities such as urban domestic sewage and industrial wastewater fig 7 therefore effective measures need to be taken in the future to solve the problem of water pollution in individual reservoir bay on the one hand landscape scale regulation should be implemented in the reservoir bays our results showed that landscape configuration had the highest effects on tn with the combined importance of 60 02 during the study period followed by landscape composition 14 71 fig 5 monitoring data showed that the average value of tn was 1 35 mg l during the study periods which exceeded the class iii standard threshold 1 0 mg l of the environmental quality standards for surface water china 2002 this provides key information of land use and landscape pattern planning for reducing tn concentration for example decreasing landscape fragmentation and enhancing the patch boundary complexity of local watersheds would improve water quality shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 moreover shrub and agri were the top explanatory variables of overall water quality variations with the combined importance of 23 56 and 9 33 respectively during the fdps fig 6 some ecological restoration measures such as terrace construction and vegetation restoration wei et al 2016 as well as precision fertilizers and pesticides in farmland can effectively reduce nutrient loss from land shi et al 2017 on the other hand our result showed that fl mn and ic mn had high relative importance to the water quality variations with the combined importance of 13 97 and 11 10 respectively during the wsps fig 6 the construction of ponds dams and sedimentation basins can reduce hydrological connectivity which prevents the rapid transfer of pollutants with runoff into reservoir bays sun et al 2021 furthermore hydrodynamic characteristics caused by reservoir operation should be considered in management planning many previous studies have confirmed that more robust results can be obtained using multiple machine learning methods knoll et al 2019 tan et al 2020 niittynen et al 2020 although the combined importance of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics to water quality were different during the fdps and wsps the similar trends and patterns were detected using brt and rf fig 5 for instance both brt and rf approach showed that landscape configuration had the greatest impact on tn tp nh4 n during the fdps but the degree of combined importance was different this difference may be attributed to the partitioning in model structure sampling training algorithm output method breiman 2001 elith et al 2008 kouadri et al 2021 applied eight artificial intelligence algorithms to generate wqi prediction and found that different machine learning has divergent prediction performance under different situations and parameter input situations we recommend the combination of brt and rf to determine the relationship between environmental variables and water quality however quantifying the relative importance of explanatory variables should consider the general model performances and not only the ranking within each model knoll et al 2019 in the future the impact of hydrological connectivity and landscape on water quality should be identified at different spatial scale then the landscape and hydrological structures are adjusted to meet the water quality requirements moreover different deep learning techniques such as support vector machine neural networks can be applied to predict water quality and status of eutrophication in various aquatic ecosystem and the region with a lack or unavailability of data alizadeh et al 2018 deng et al 2021 kouadri et al 2021 furthermore the machine learning approaches can be combined with tracer technology hydrodynamic models and remote sensing to identify the sources of pollution 5 conclusion the water quality in reservoir bays of danjiangkou reservoir which is the water sources of the snwdp were investigated from 2015 to 2020 building upon these data we applied machine learning approaches to decipher the impacts of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on reservoir water quality under different hydrological regulations the main conclusions are as follows 1 landscape characteristics had different impact on individual water quality parameters landscape configuration had higher importance for tn tp nh4 n no3 n and chl a than those of landscape compositions while the landscape composition was the highest importance controlling the variation in codmn topography metrics had minimal impact on water quality changes 2 the hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics had different effects on overall water quality and this effect varied with hydrological regulations landscape composition had the greatest impact on water quality with the combined importance of 46 69 during the fdps however landscape configuration metrics had the largest impact with the combined importance of 38 57 on water quality during the wsps 3 the effect of each hydrological connectivity and landscape metrics on overall reservoir water quality was distinct under different hydrological regulations the top two importance variables controlling overall water quality was shrub and agri with the relative importance of 23 56 and 9 33 during the fdps however fl mn and ic mn had the relative importance of 13 97 and 11 10 on overall water quality variation during the wsps respectively this study greatly improved our understanding of the key landscape and hydrological characteristics impacting water quality under different hydrological regulations the application of machine learning algorithms provides a useful approach for elucidating landscape and hydrological drivers of water quality changes the research results have significant implications for more efficient protection of reservoir water quality in similar water diversion project for example water quality can be protected by adjusting the landscape composition such as changing the composition ratio of shrub land and agricultural land in the reservoir bays at the same time the landscape pattern can be optimized such as adjusting the density of farmland patches or the degree of dispersion of residential areas in the reservoir this study only investigated part of the water quality parameters and more water quality parameters should be explored to more comprehensively reflect the water quality status in the future such as dissolved heavy metals fecal coliform five day biochemical oxygen demand etc moreover we could not provide enough information to validate the relative importance of hydrological connectivity and landscape characteristics on water quality and scenario simulation or model can be used to verify this effect at multi spatial scales in the future research furthermore the thresholds for critical landscape characteristics metrics affecting water quality need to be explored for more effectively water quality protection credit authorship contribution statement j wang conceptualization methodology formal

2933,knowledge of irrigation location and extent is essential for irrigation water use estimation and water resource management however it remains a great challenge to map irrigated areas at large spatial scales due to the great variation in climate geography and agricultural practices as well as the lack of sufficient ground truth data this study proposed a novel approach to develop the first 250 m irrigated cropland map in mainland china cirrmap250 by integrating remote sensing irrigation suitability and irrigated area statistics we assessed the performance of cirrmap250 and compared it with three irrigation maps i e evi map ndvi map gi map generated using the threshold based classification method and four other existing maps including gmia2005 siebert et al 2005 giam2000 thenkabail et al 2009 zhu map zhu et al 2014 and meier map meier et al 2018 results indicate that cirrmap250 and all other maps capture well the intensively irrigated areas such as the north china plain and northwest china as well as many large scale irrigation districts however all maps except cirrmap250 tend to underestimate irrigated cropland in river valleys while overestimating irrigated cropland in the mountainous areas as illustrated by the field surveyed irrigation districts due to the neglect of the mixed grid effects compared to other irrigation maps cirrmap250 exhibits a better agreement with the reference points achieving improvements in kappa coefficient and overall accuracy by 8 up to about 2 times the irrigated area estimates of cirrmap250 are very close to the statistical data due to their usage in generating the training pool further analysis indicates cirrmap250 has a greater proportion of irrigated cropland at lower elevations on smaller slopes and near water bodies than the other maps there is large uncertainty in irrigation ratio estimates due to the varying cropland area from multiple sources this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the new irrigation mapping method and highlights the great potential of combining irrigation suitability with remote sensing and statistical data to improve the accuracy of large scale irrigated cropland mapping keywords

security wang et al 2021 irrigated agriculture contributes to 40 of global food production in just 20 of cropland but accounts for 70 global freshwater withdrawals and 90 of consumptive water use siebert and döll 2010 wada et al 2013 irrigation is expected to expand in the future due to climate change growing food demand and agricultural intensification deines et al 2017 extensive irrigation has caused dramatic changes in water cycles putting unprecedented pressure on sustainable freshwater use mcdermid et al 2021 reconciling irrigation benefits with water stress and environmental impacts remains a grand challenge for managers and policy makers in the twenty first century salmon et al 2015 rosa et al 2020 irrigation water withdrawal is mostly driven by irrigated area puy et al 2021 knowledge of irrigation distribution is a first step towards irrigation water estimation and water resource management portmann et al 2010 xie and lark 2021 however irrigation location and extent are poorly understood especially at national to global scales due to the hidden nature of irrigation signals and the limited ground truth data available for training classification algorithms ozdogan and gutman 2008 liu et al 2018 xie et al 2021 insufficient information on irrigation distribution is unfavorable for sustainable water use and management nagaraj et al 2021 and will introduce large uncertainties and biases in the modeling of surface and hydrologic processes land atmosphere interactions and crop growth satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented opportunities to detect and map irrigated areas at multiple spatial scales various methods have been proposed to identify irrigated areas using remote sensing data which can be classified into two categories namely optical and near infrared methods and microwave based methods massari et al 2021 visual interpretation is perhaps the most primitive method that use optical and near infrared signatures to detect irrigated area but is a cost and time intensive procedure karthikeyan et al 2020 besides the spectral signatures many vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 and green index gi gitelson 2005 have been used to map irrigated areas the rationale behind which is that irrigation reduces crop water stresses and increase productivity resulting in higher greenness and water content of irrigated crops than rainfed crops nagaraj et al 2021 these vegetation indices are often used with classification algorithms trained with ground truth data such as decision trees ozdogan and gutman 2008 ambika et al 2016b support vector machine sharma et al 2021 and random forest peña arancibia et al 2014 deines et al 2017 to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed croplands in some exceptions the vegetation indices are compared to the target spectra of ground samples lu et al 2021 adjacent forest pixels xiang et al 2019 and time series precipitation to detect irrigation signals chen et al 2018 in recent years the microwave based irrigation mapping with satellite soil moisture products has also attracted attention dari et al 2021 the rationale behind the microwave based approach is that irrigation increases soil moisture and causes changes in soil moisture and radar backscatter signals thus microwave information is usually compared with simulations under natural conditions to detected irrigated areas kumar et al 2015 zaussinger et al 2019 zohaib et al 2019 or used with the classification algorithms trained with ground truth data gao et al 2018 pageot et al 2020 bazzi et al 2021 remote sensing based irrigated cropland extraction methods have shown high accuracy and reliability in small scale areas e g watersheds and irrigation districts nevertheless it is still a great challenge to map irrigated area at large spatial scales e g national and global scales due to the wide variation in climate geography and agricultural practices salmon et al 2015 as well as the lack of adequate ground truth data ozdogan et al 2010 xie and lark 2021 there have been several attempts to map the global irrigated area siebert et al 2005 generated the global map of irrigated areas gmia by combining national and subnational statistics with geospatial information on irrigation location and extent thenkabail et al 2009 derived the global irrigated area map giam from remote sensing using the spectral matching technique and decision tree algorithm later salmon et al 2015 fused remote sensing classification results with agricultural inventory data to generate a map of global rainfed irrigated and paddy croplands gripc meier et al 2018 merged the downscaled gmia map with the remote sensing derived irrigation map to generate a new global high resolution irrigation map in addition several national irrigation maps have been produced in recent years such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis irrigated agriculture dataset mirad us pervez and brown 2010 landsat based irrigation dataset across the conterminous united states lanid us xie et al 2019 xie and lark 2021 and remotely sensed high resolution irrigated area map in india ambika et al 2016b typically national irrigation maps are more accurate than global maps due to the availability of more ground data higher spatial resolution and reliable auxiliary information china is a large agricultural country with the largest irrigated area 65 87 million ha in the world followed by india 62 00 million ha and the united states 26 71 million ha idcd 2018 however to our knowledge few studies have mapped irrigated areas throughout china xiang et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and the spatial resolution of irrigation map is far below that of other countries e g the united states and india this limits the accuracy of irrigation water use estimates in china and significantly affects irrigation related ecological hydrological and climatic studies to address the above gaps this study proposes a novel approach to develop the first 250 m irrigated cropland map in mainland china cirrmap250 for the year 2000 by integrating remote sensing irrigation suitability and irrigated area statistics the major difference between our approach and other existing methods lies in the incorporation irrigation suitability into the mapping process our objectives of are threefold 1 to test the effectiveness of the new irrigation mapping method ii to compare the performance of cirrmap250 with three irrigation maps generated using the traditional threshold based method and four other existing maps siebert et al 2005 thenkabail et al 2009 zhu et al 2014 meier et al 2018 and iii to reveal the spatial distribution features of irrigated cropland in mainland china 2 study area china lies between 15 50 n and 65 135 e and covers an area of approximately 9 6 million square kilometers this study was carried out in mainland china fig 1 which is characterized by a wide range of elevations from 176 m below sea level at ayding lake in the turpan depression of xinjiang to 8 794 m above sea level on the qinghai tibetan plateau according to the köppen geiger climate classification biggs et al 2006 southeastern china has a warm temperate climate northwestern china has an arid climate northeastern and parts of central china have a cold climate and the high altitude qinghai tibetan plateau has a polar and cold climate cropland is extensively distributed across mainland china with a greater concentration in the eastern northeastern and central regions than in the arid northwestern region particularly the north china plain northeast china plain guanzhong plain sichuan basin and middle and lower yangtze river plain as shown in fig 1 b the study area is divided into 3 652 mapping units there are 686 reference points covering mainland china which are used to evaluate the accuracy of the irrigation maps 3 materials and methods the workflow of the study is summarized in fig 2 we first collected and processed three types of data including satellite data irrigated area statistics and auxiliary data then we combined the satellite derived vegetation indices ndvi evi and gi with irrigated area statistics from 3 625 administrative units to drive three irrigation maps i e ndvi map evi map and gi map using the threshold based classification method pervez and brown 2010 afterward we produced another irrigated cropland map i e cirrmap250 using the newly proposed semiautomatic classification approach the new approach consists of three major steps including irrigation suitability analysis training pool generation based on suitability adjusted vegetation indices and irrigated area statistics and machine learning based classification of irrigated and rainfed cropland lastly we evaluated the accuracy of cirrmap250 ndvi map evi map gi map and four other existing maps i e gmia2005 giam2000 zhu map and meier map from three different perspectives including the distribution of irrigated croplands agreement with reference points and consistency with irrigated area statistics 3 1 datasets and processing 3 1 1 satellite data the modis vegetation indices mod13q1 version 6 data including two vegetation layers i e ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 1997 were used in the study as shown in table 1 ndvi and evi are 16 day composite products with a spatial resolution of 250 m meanwhile the 500 m and 8 day surface spectral reflectance of band 04 provided by mod09a1 was resampled to 250 m through nearest neighbor interpolation debeurs and townsend 2008 it was used to derive another vegetation index i e gi along with the 250 m and 8 day surface reflectance of band 01 provided by mod09q1 all modis data were quality filtered using quality and usefulness indicators and only those cloud and snow ice free pixels with decreasing to highest quality were considered to be reliable hilker et al 2012 unreliable pixels were reconstructed using a simple nearest neighbor interpolation method we calculated the maximum minimum range median values of vegetation indices for each crop grid note that the maximum and minimum values were calculated at the 95th and 10th percentile respectively to exclude the unidentified cloudy and poor quality values xie and lark 2021 to better account for crop and climate gradients we further derived a set of neighborhood normalized vegetation indices nndvi nevi ngi deines et al 2019 by dividing the annual peak vegetation index of a target pixel to the median value of its neighborhood pixels within a 25 km radius circular kernel 3 1 2 irrigated area statistics the irrigated area statistics were compiled through a top down and bottom up approach the county level and city level irrigated area were first collected from the provincial statistical yearbook the rural statistical yearbook and the china statistical yearbook for regional economy national bureau of statistics of china 2001b in china municipal administration city consists of districts and counties and here we referred to them all as counties counties without any irrigated area were merged into their nearest neighbors we aggregated the irrigated areas at the county level to the city level and compared them with the city level statistics for consistency checks where inconsistencies existed we further collected irrigation water use data from the provincial water resource bulletin and irrigation areas with a high correlation to irrigation water use were considered reliable for subsequent analysis the city level irrigated areas were finally aggregated to the provincial level and compared them with the values reported by the china water statistical yearbook cwsy china ministry of water resources 2001 we put higher confidence in the cwsy data because it is published by the chinese ministry of water resources and edited by water practitioners and researchers throughout china as shown in supplementary fig s1 the city aggregated irrigated areas are very close to the cwsy statistics with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 99 for provinces where inconsistencies exist we adjusted the county level irrigated area using eq 1 1 irrarea i j irrarea cwsy j irrarea agg j irrorgin i j where irrarea i j and irrorgin i j are the adjusted irrigated area and the original irrigated area in county i of province j respectively irrarea cwsy j and irrarea agg j are the cwsy reported irrigated area and the city aggregated irrigated area of province j respectively county level irrigated area statistics are available for 80 of provinces in mainland china supplementary fig s2 and we totally have 3 652 mapping units with irrigated area statistics fig 1 b note that xinjiang heilongjiang and fujian provinces have some irrigated croplands managed by the production and construction corps which we merged into the cities where they are located by population size following the method of zhu et al 2014 3 1 3 auxiliary data various auxiliary data were used in this study including climatic and environmental variables land use and land cover and administrative boundaries climate data including precipitation temperature pressure wind speed and downward solar radiation were extracted from the china meteorological forcing dataset he and yang 2016 he et al 2020 these data were used in conjunction with the mcd43a3 albedo product to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet using the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 as well as the aridity index defined as the ratio of precipitation to pet environmental data include elevation slope soil type and distance to water bodies the elevation data was taken from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model i e srtm dem and the slope map was generated from the srtm dem data using the slope function in arcgis software distance to water bodies was calculated from the spatial distribution data of water bodies including rivers lakes reservoirs canals and ponds using the euclidean distance tool in arcgis software the 2000 land use cover lulc map with a spatial resolution of 30 m was sourced from the land use status remote sensing monitoring database of china xu et al 2018 the map includes six major lulc types namely cropland forest grassland water body urban land and unused land the spatial distribution and proportion of each land use cover type at 250 m resolution was estimated from the original 30 m lulc map all data used in this study were obtained partly from the national tibetan plateau https data tpdc ac cn zh hans and partly from the resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn default aspx 3 2 threshold based classification method threshold based classification is a simple yet robust easy to implement approach for creating irrigation maps that assumes the existence of thresholds for certain indices that can differentiate between irrigated and rainfed cropland these indices can be the annual peak vegetation index pervez and brown 2010 the irrigation potential index zhu et al 2014 or the lswi difference index xiang et al 2020 and the thresholds can be calibrated based on irrigated area statistics ground truth data or experience from previous studies pervez and brown 2010 shahriar pervez et al 2014 meier et al 2018 here following pervez and brown 2010 we classified irrigated and rainfed cropland using the thresholds of annual peak vegetation indices ndvi evi and gi specifically for each mapping unit of mainland china we first sorted the annual peak vegetation indices of all croplands in descending order and estimated the cumulative irrigated area sequentially the accumulated area was then compared with the statistical irrigated area and the value of vegetation index for the grid where the cumulative irrigated area was close to the statistical data was determined as the threshold we lastly classify the cropland into irrigated and rainfed by comparing annual peak vegetation index with the determined threshold as in eq 2 2 cropland i j irrigated i j p v i t h r e s h o l d rainfed i j p v i t h r e s h o l d where pvi are the annual peak vegetation index of the crop grid i in the mapping unit j over mainland china classification results using ndvi evi and gi were referred to as ndvi map evi map and gi map respectively hereafter the annual minimum median and range of ndvi evi and gvi were also tested but showed obviously lower performance than the annual peak values in mapping irrigated cropland 3 3 semiautomatic classification approach 3 3 1 irrigation suitability analysis irrigation suitability analysis has been widely used to assess potential land suitable for irrigation chen et al 2010 worqlul et al 2015 worqlul et al 2017 li and chen 2020 but has not received much attention in the irrigation mapping in this study we used the multi indicator evaluation mce technique to assess the irrigation suitability of croplands in mainland china our study considered elevation slope distance to water bodies disttowater and drought index as these natural and geographic conditions have proven to be important factors controlling the spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in china liu et al 2022 based on our experience and field work as well as the findings of previous studies we hypothesize that croplands with smaller disttowater lower elevation and slope and higher aridity index have greater irrigation suitability and potential it is easy to understand that the closer to water bodies the greater the possibility of irrigation since closer proximity to water bodies means easier access to irrigation water some previous studies have even selected the irrigation reference points by choosing croplands close to water bodies dong et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 the higher the elevation the more difficult it is to access water resources leading to a lower likelihood of irrigation cuo et al 2013 for example in our field work we found that in the high elevation areas of the loess plateau residents have access to domestic water only through deep wells while crop growth is completely dependent on rainfall meanwhile agricultural productivity is low at high altitudes in china due to lack of irrigation and higher transportation and labor costs li et al 2015 in addition it was found that paddy fields which are usually equipped for irrigation tend to be clustered in the lowlands of china compared to drylands liu et al 2005 areas with greater slopes have poor water holding capacity and are unfavorable for irrigation facilities akıncı et al 2013 worqlul et al 2017 mandal et al 2018 generally areas with slopes exceeding 8 are considered infeasible for any surface irrigation system shahriar pervez et al 2014 ambika et al 2016a therefore it is widely believed that the gentler the slope the more likely is the existence of irrigated cropland yin et al 2020 ishikawa and yamazaki 2021 croplands with higher aridity indices i e less precipitation but higher pet are also more likely to be irrigated due to the greater demand for irrigation water xu et al 2018 yin et al 2020 elevation slope disttowater and aridity index were first reclassified into different suitability types as shown in supplementary table s1 the elevations of the crop grids were reclassified into four types using the dividing points of 100 300 500 m above the lowest elevation of the mapping unit there are also four suitability types for both slope and disttowater the dividing points for slopes are 2 4 and 8 while dividing points for disttowater are 1 000 10 000 and 20 000 m using the dividing points aridity indices were reclassified into ten suitability types afterwards the above reclassified factors were assigned with different suitability values with higher values given to areas with lower elevation smaller slope and disttowater and higher aridity index lastly we estimated the overall irrigation suitability of the croplands by combining the suitability values of elevation slope disttowater and aridity index as in eq 3 3 s i j k 1 4 w 1 k s e l e v i j 1 4 w 2 k s s l o p e i j 1 4 w 3 k s d w i j 1 10 w 4 k s a r i d i j where si j k is the irrigation suitability for cropland i in mapping unit j of province k w is the weight of the influencing factors selev sslope sdw and sarid are the suitability values of elevation slope disttowater and aridity index respectively the weight setting is critical for irrigation suability analysis in this study weights were set in each province using the trial and error method based on the irrigated cropland distribution in the intermediate maps see next section according to our field work and experience appropriate weights should be given so that distribution of irrigated cropland have the following key characteristics i irrigated croplands are mostly distributed near water bodies at lower elevations and on smaller slopes ii irrigated croplands in plain areas are relatively evenly distributed iii irrigated croplands are generally continuously distributed due to the influence of water facilities and iv irrigated croplands in non plain regions are mainly distributed in river valleys 3 3 2 generating training pool inspired by the work of xie et al 2019 we designed a threshold calibrated method to automatically generate the training pool i e potential training data for each mapping unit of mainland china we first proposed a new irrigation suitability adjusted vegetation index svi with the assumption that irrigated cropland is not only greener but also more suitable for irrigation than rainfed cropland the svi is defined in eq 4 4 svi s p v i where s is the irrigation suability and pvi is the annual peak vegetation index the suitability adjusted ndvi evi and gi were named as sndvi sevi and sgi three intermediate irrigation maps were then generated based on sndvi sevi and sgi using the threshold based classification method section 3 2 note that the annual peak nndvi nevi and ngi were used in north china plain considering that crop gradient is not negligible but the gradients in elevation slope and aridity index are small and groundwater is widely used for irrigation furthermore cropland is discontinuously distributed in many parts of mainland china and many croplands are mixed with other land use cover types within the 250 m grids the pvi of the cropland urban water mixed grids would be underestimated compared to the pure cropland pixels while the cropland forest grassland mixed grids would be overestimated we recalculated the pvi for the mixed pixels with the cropland proportion less than 90 from the nearest pure cropland pixel in the case of few pure cropland pixels over mountainous areas the pvi values of mixed pixels were adjusted by the proportion of croplands considering that irrigation is more likely to occur on continuously distributed croplands lastly the intermediate irrigation maps were overlaid and pixels that were simultaneously identified as irrigated or rainfed cropland by these maps were used as the training pool for further classification 3 3 3 classification using random forest we used the random forest rf breiman 2001 to classify irrigated and rain fed cropland using the random samples from the training pool for each mapping unit of mainland china we randomly sample 200 rainfed cropland grids and 200 irrigated cropland grids following xie et al 2019 to balance the need for adequate samples and computational efficiency the sample size was increased to 4 000 i e 2 000 each for irrigated and rainfed cropland for the mapping units only with city level irrigated area statistics sensitive analyses indicated the use of different sets of training samples has minimal effect on the classification accuracy supplementary fig s3 we implemented the rf algorithm using the matlab treebagger function and the hyperparameters table 2 were determined through a trial and error procedure zhang et al 2021 the selected predictors include vegetation indices i e sevi nevi sndvi nndvi sgi and ngi climatic variables i e precipitation temperature wind speed solar radiation and aridity index and environmental variables i e latitude longitude crop intensity elevation disttowater slope and soil type the rf based classification of irrigated and rainfed cropland was carried out separately in each mapping unit after classification we applied a spatial filter i e 7 7 window to remove isolated pixels less than5 of the window area and detect the missed irrigated croplands 95 of the window area resulting in the final irrigated cropland map in mainland china with a spatial resolution of 250 m i e cirrmap250 we also tested two additional commonly used machine learning algorithms i e artificial neural network gardner and dorling 1998 and extreme learning machine huang et al 2012 for classification of irrigated and rainfed croplands but they showed lower accuracy than rf supplementary fig s4 3 4 accuracy assessment the accuracy of cirrmap250 were assessed from three different aspects first the spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in cirrmap250 was compared with evi map ndvi map and gi map and four other existing maps including gmia 2005 siebert et al 2005 giam2000 thenkabail et al 2009 zhu map zhu et al 2014 and meier map meier et al 2018 the performance of these maps was evaluated by analyzing their ability in detecting intensively irrigated areas and large scale irrigation districts of mainland china as well as two field surveyed irrigation districts second we further conducted a point scale evaluation of cirrmap250 and other irrigation maps using 686 reference points fig 1 most of the reference points 90 were sourced from zhu et al 2014 which were partly collected from the crop growth and soil moisture dataset provided by the china meteorological data sharing service system https data cma cn and partly obtained using google earth and irrigation information on large irrigated districts provided by the china irrigation and drainage development center https www jsgg com cn ciddc index asp the remaining 10 of reference points were derived through our field work and visual interpretation of google satellite maps as listed in table 3 the performance metrics including kappa coefficient overall accuracy and producer s accuracy were used for quantitative assessments finally we compared the irrigated area statistics with the estimates from cirrmap250 zhu map gmia2005 and meier map at different spatial scales 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in cirrmap250 fig 3 depicts the spatial distribution of irrigated and rainfed cropland in cirrmap250 we can see that irrigated croplands are mainly distributed in the north china plain and northwest china meanwhile many large scale irrigation districts such as hetao qingtongxia fenhe baojixia dujiangyan zhanghe and pishihang also have intensively irrigated croplands at the provincial level shandong holds the largest irrigated area 4 940 kha followed by henan 4 834 kha hebei 4 566 kha jiangsu 3 999 kha anhui 3 236 kha and xinjiang 3 172 kha the provinces including tibet qinghai tianjin beijing shanghai and hainan have relatively smaller areas of irrigated croplands than other provinces in mainland china at the basin scale the yangtze river basin has the largest irrigated area 14 939 kha followed by the huai river basin 10 622 kha hai river basin 7 400 kha the southwest river basin has the lowest irrigated cropland area among the nine river basins in mainland china 4 2 comparison of irrigated cropland distribution fig 4 compares the distribution of irrigated croplands in different irrigation maps intensively irrigated areas such as the north china plain northwest china and large scale irrigation districts are overall well captured by all the maps the spatial pattern of irrigated croplands in evi map ndvi map gi map is similar to cirrmap250 due to the consistent constraints of irrigated area statistics on the mapping results however a closer look reveals that the distribution of irrigated cropland in the evi ndvi gi map is more uniform and extensive in the southern and central regions of mainland china than in cirrmap250 there are notable differences between cirrmap250 and the four existing maps at both regional and local scales compared with other irrigation maps irrigated cropland in zhu map is less distributed in central and southeastern chongqing northeastern heilongjiang and the baojixia irrigation district but more distributed in northern hebei province giam2000 has more irrigated areas in the north china plain northeast china plain and sichuan and guangxi provinces but obviously less irrigated area in provinces such as tibet qinghai gansu and guangdong gaim2005 does not provide much details on the distribution of irrigated cropland due to the coarse spatial resolution irrigated cropland in gaim2005 appears to be more distributed in northeastern china southern sichuan province and northern shaanxi than the other irrigation maps but less distributed in jiangxi jiangsu sichuan and hubei the two panels inserted in each subplot of fig 4 show the distribution of irrigated cropland in two field surveyed irrigation districts i e the jinghe irrigation district upper panel and the xuhuiqu irrigation district lower panel both jinghe and xuhuiqu irrigation districts are located in river valleys where irrigated cropland is concentrated cirrmap250 captures well the concentration of irrigated cropland in these two irrigation districts however all other maps tend to underestimate irrigated cropland in the jinghe and xuhuiqu irrigation districts while overestimating irrigated cropland in the surrounding mountainous areas the similar results can be extensively observed if we enlarge evi map ndvi map gi map zhu map giam2000 gmia2005 and meier map 4 3 point scale accuracy evaluation fig 5 summarizes the point scale accuracy of the different irrigation maps gaim2005 is not evaluated here because of its coarse spatial resolution we can see that cirrmap250 attains a kappa coefficient of 0 58 in mainland china obviously higher than evi map 0 47 ndvi map 0 44 and gi map 0 46 as well as the other three existing maps 0 20 0 28 the improvement in kappa coefficient ranges from 23 to about 2 times for cirrmap250 compared to other irrigation maps the overall accuracy of cirrmap250 is 0 79 while it ranges from 0 60 to 0 73 for the other maps the overall accuracy of cirrmap250 improves from 8 to 32 compared to other maps the producer s accuracy of irrigated samples is 0 75 in cirrmap250 apparently higher than the other maps ranging from 0 40 to 0 64 the producer s accuracy of non irrigated samples in cirrmap250 is higher than higher than that of zhu map and meier map but lower than evi map ndvi map gi map and giam2000 the overall accuracy of all maps tends to be lower in arid and semi arid areas than in humid and semi humid areas this is because non irrigated cropland is more difficult to identify in arid and semi arid areas as indicated by the lower producer s accuracy of non irrigation although the contrary is the case for irrigated cropland regardless the results indicate that cirrmap250 has a higher accuracy than the other irrigation maps 4 4 comparison of irrigated area estimates with statistics fig 6 compares the irrigated area estimates of cirrmap250 zhu map gmia2005 and meier map with the statistical data for the 3 652 mapping units of mainland china giam2000 is not analyzed here due to the lack of pixel level irrigation percentages the irrigated area of cirrmap250 shows a good agreement with the statistics with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 99 mainly due to the usage of irrigated area statistics in the generation of the training pool the irrigated area of zhu map matches well with the provincial statistics but the agreement is relatively low at the mapping unit level this is because less than 50 of the provinces in zhu map includes county level irrigated area statistics zhu et al 2014 for example as shown in fig 8 b the irrigated areas in two mapping units of heilongjiang province are clearly overestimated because only the total irrigated area statistics in that province were used in the mapping process the estimated irrigated area from gmia2005 is generally consistent with the statistics as the statistics were also used to generate gmia2005 although not in as much detail as the data in our study among the four irrigation maps meier map has the lowest agreement between the irrigated area estimates and the statistics because it combined statistical irrigated area with other remote sensing detected irrigated area during the mapping process meier et al 2018 5 discussion 5 1 irrigated cropland in different geographical feature ranges we further calculated the proportion of irrigated cropland for seven irrigation maps at different elevations slopes and distances from water bodies the north china plain was excluded from the analysis due to its small elevation and slope gradients and the relatively consistent pattern of irrigated cropland in these maps as shown in fig 7 cirrmap250 has 70 of irrigated cropland that is distributed in areas with elevation less than 500 m slope less than 4 and distance less than 3 000 m from water bodies in comparison to other maps more irrigated cropland in cirrmap250 is located at lower elevations on smaller slopes and closer to water bodies this is easy to understand because we incorporated irrigation suitability estimates based on elevation slope distance to water bodies and aridity index into the irrigation mapping framework as described in section 3 3 1 areas with low elevation gentle slope small distance to water bodies are more favorable for irrigation from this perspective the spatial distribution seems to be more reasonable in cirrmap250 than in other maps nevertheless china has quite specific agriculture e g terraces and smallholder cropping systems that requires reliable reference irrigation maps to robustly assess the above results especially at the regional scale the fact that the other maps have more irrigated cropland at higher elevations larger slopes and farther away from water bodies than cirrmap250 can be explained by their neglect of the mixed grid effects china has many scattered small scale croplands that are mixed with forests grasslands in mountainous areas vegetation in mixed cropland forest grassland areas may be greener than croplands located in river valleys and they can easily be detected as irrigated cropland if the vegetation index is mainly considered for extracting irrigated area as illustrated by the two field surveyed irrigated districts 5 2 large uncertainty in irrigation ratio estimates the sources of cropland area in china can be divided into four categories including remote sensing the national bureau of statistics of china nbsc the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china mnrprc and the national land survey the national land survey of china was conducted three times in 1984 1987 2007 2009 and 2017 2019 while no data was available around 2000 we estimated irrigation ratio i e the ratio of irrigated cropland area to total cropland area for difference provinces in mainland china based on the cropland area from remote sensing xu et al 2018 nbsc national bureau of statistics of china 2001a and mnrprc ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china 2001 as shown in fig 8 irrigation ratio varies significantly among the 31 provinces with higher values in beijing shanghai jiangsu and xinjiang while lower values in heilongjiang yunnan and guizhou irrigation ratio also exhibits a large difference for the same region for instance it ranges from 0 54 to 0 93 in xinjiang using cropland area from different sources irrigation ratio estimates based on the remote sensing estimated cropland area are lower than the estimates based on the nbsc reported cropland area and mnrprc reported cropland area this is because as shown in fig 8 the cropland acreages reported by nbsc and mnrprc are obviously smaller than those estimated by remote sensing although they exhibit a higher correlation r2 0 85 in this study it is challenging to assess which sources of cropland area are reliable nevertheless previous study indicates that remote sensing tends to overestimate cropland area due to the widespread presence of non cropland within the map grid and the classification accuracy problems guo 2006 on the other hand nbsc tends to underestimate the cropland area due to administrative and technical reasons xu et al 2014 overall irrigation ratio estimates have large uncertainties due to the varying cropland area from multiple sources 5 3 limitations and prospects we admit that this study has some limitations and uncertainties that deserve further investigations in the future to begin with the proposed irrigation mapping method depends heavily on irrigated area statistics although the statistical irrigated areas were collected and reconstructed with an unprecedented level of detail in our study they inevitably have some uncertainties and inconsistences ajaz et al 2019 furthermore the statistics represent the effective irrigated area i e the area equipped for irrigation rather than the actual irrigated area which may lead to biased results in fact the china water statistical yearbook cwsy china ministry of water resources 2001 have also reported the actual irrigated area at the provincial level which is closely matched to the effective irrigated area with a coefficient of determination of 0 99 supplementary fig s5 however actual irrigated area at the city county level is not available which limits its use to constrain the irrigated cropland distribution in spatial detail we further conducted an experiment to assign the actual provincial irrigated area to the county level based on the statistical effective irrigated area and recreated the irrigated cropland map using the method proposed in this study we found that the spatial pattern of irrigated croplands in the new map was very similar to cirrmap250 supplementary fig s6 but showed no improvement in accuracy second this study incorporates irrigation suitability into the irrigated cropland mapping framework which greatly improves the performance of irrigation map however the irrigation suitability analysis is somewhat subjective due to the requirement of weight setting if sufficient ground truth data are available in the future they can be divided into two parts one for automatic weight calibration and one for performance evaluation meanwhile due to the large number of mapping units 3500 the irrigation suitability analysis was performed only at the provincial level which may affect the accuracy of the irrigation map especially in provinces with high topographic and climatic gradients such as gansu and heilongjiang provinces in addition terraces are widely distributed in china accounting for 26 of the country s cropland area cao et al 2021 and about 30 of them are located in areas with slopes higher than 8 supplementary fig s7 there may be many irrigable terraces in high slope areas thus our assumption that gentle slope cropland is more likely to be irrigated than steep slope cropland may not hold true adding some uncertainties to our results nevertheless irrigation suitability is determined not only by slope but also by three other factors i e elevation disttowater and drought index and meanwhile for provinces with concentrated distribution of terraces the weight of slope less than0 16 was significantly lower than other factors in the irrigation suitability analysis suggesting that our results may not be significantly influenced lastly this study only mapped irrigated cropland in mainland china for a specific year i e 2000 to verify the reliability of the newly proposed mapping method as done in many other studies ozdogan and gutman 2008 xiang et al 2019 xie et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the number of reference points is relatively small and some of them may not be representative of the actual situation in 2000 which may bring uncertainty to our results the lack of sufficient ground truth data would be addressed in the future by conducting more field work and by collaborating with more researchers in the field of irrigated cropland mapping and with the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china https www mnr gov cn which has much reliable survey data in the next step we will apply our new method to generate time continuous maps of irrigated cropland from 2000 to the present and collect more reference points and survey data spanning multiple years to robustly evaluate the performance of our new mapping method and the accuracy of irrigation maps 6 conclusions this study proposed a novel approach to develop the first 250 m irrigated cropland map in mainland china cirrmap250 for the year 2000 by integrating remote sensing irrigation suitability and irrigated area statistics the novelty of the new approach lies in the incorporation of irrigation suitability into the irrigation mapping process the new method consists of three major steps including irrigation suitability analysis training pool generation based on suitability adjusted vegetation indices and irrigated area statistics and machine learning based classification of irrigated and rainfed cropland we evaluated the performance of cirrmap250 and compared it with three irrigation maps i e evi map ndvi map and gi map generated using the threshold based classification method as well as four other existing maps including gmia2005 siebert et al 2005 giam2000 thenkabail et al 2009 zhu map zhu et al 2014 and meier map meier et al 2018 the accuracy of the irrigation maps was assessed from three different aspects including the distribution of irrigated croplands agreement with reference points and consistency with irrigated area statistics results indicate that the irrigated croplands are mainly distributed in the north china plain northwest china and some large scale irrigation districts shandong province holds the largest irrigated area followed by henan hebei jiangsu anhui and xinjiang while at the basin scale the yangtze river basin has the largest irrigated area followed by the huai river basin hai river basin and yellow river basin intensively irrigated areas are overall well captured by cirrmap250 and all the other maps cirrmap250 has a similar irrigation distribution pattern to evi map ndvi map due to the consistent constraints of irrigated area statistics on the mapping results however there are notable differences between cirrmap250 and the four existing maps at both regional and local scales all maps except cirrmap250 tend to underestimate irrigated cropland in river valleys and overestimate irrigated cropland in the mountainous areas as evidenced by the field surveyed irrigation districts mainly because of their neglect of the mixed grid effects cirrmap250 has a higher point scale accuracy than the other maps cirrmap250 achieves an improvement in kappa coefficient by 23 to about 2 times and an improvement in overall accuracy by 8 to 32 in comparison to other irrigation maps additionally the irrigated area of cirrmap250 shows a good agreement with the statistics mainly due to the utilization of irrigated area statistics in the generation of the training pool the irrigation mapping method can be easily applied to other regions of the world and the new irrigated cropland map has great potential to support agriculture climate and environment research as well as water resource management in mainland china nevertheless we admit that this study has some limitations and uncertainties such as the heavy dependence on irrigated area statistics and the subjectivity of irrigation suitability analysis which deserve further investigations in the future in the next step we will attempt to generate time continuous maps of irrigated cropland from 2000 to the present and collect more reference points and survey data to robustly evaluate the performance of our new mapping method and the accuracy of irrigation maps 7 data and code availability cirrmap250 can be

2933,knowledge of irrigation location and extent is essential for irrigation water use estimation and water resource management however it remains a great challenge to map irrigated areas at large spatial scales due to the great variation in climate geography and agricultural practices as well as the lack of sufficient ground truth data this study proposed a novel approach to develop the first 250 m irrigated cropland map in mainland china cirrmap250 by integrating remote sensing irrigation suitability and irrigated area statistics we assessed the performance of cirrmap250 and compared it with three irrigation maps i e evi map ndvi map gi map generated using the threshold based classification method and four other existing maps including gmia2005 siebert et al 2005 giam2000 thenkabail et al 2009 zhu map zhu et al 2014 and meier map meier et al 2018 results indicate that cirrmap250 and all other maps capture well the intensively irrigated areas such as the north china plain and northwest china as well as many large scale irrigation districts however all maps except cirrmap250 tend to underestimate irrigated cropland in river valleys while overestimating irrigated cropland in the mountainous areas as illustrated by the field surveyed irrigation districts due to the neglect of the mixed grid effects compared to other irrigation maps cirrmap250 exhibits a better agreement with the reference points achieving improvements in kappa coefficient and overall accuracy by 8 up to about 2 times the irrigated area estimates of cirrmap250 are very close to the statistical data due to their usage in generating the training pool further analysis indicates cirrmap250 has a greater proportion of irrigated cropland at lower elevations on smaller slopes and near water bodies than the other maps there is large uncertainty in irrigation ratio estimates due to the varying cropland area from multiple sources this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the new irrigation mapping method and highlights the great potential of combining irrigation suitability with remote sensing and statistical data to improve the accuracy of large scale irrigated cropland mapping keywords irrigation irrigated cropland remote sensing irrigation suitability machine learning china 1 introduction irrigation greatly enhances agricultural yields and plays a critical role in safeguarding food security wang et al 2021 irrigated agriculture contributes to 40 of global food production in just 20 of cropland but accounts for 70 global freshwater withdrawals and 90 of consumptive water use siebert and döll 2010 wada et al 2013 irrigation is expected to expand in the future due to climate change growing food demand and agricultural intensification deines et al 2017 extensive irrigation has caused dramatic changes in water cycles putting unprecedented pressure on sustainable freshwater use mcdermid et al 2021 reconciling irrigation benefits with water stress and environmental impacts remains a grand challenge for managers and policy makers in the twenty first century salmon et al 2015 rosa et al 2020 irrigation water withdrawal is mostly driven by irrigated area puy et al 2021 knowledge of irrigation distribution is a first step towards irrigation water estimation and water resource management portmann et al 2010 xie and lark 2021 however irrigation location and extent are poorly understood especially at national to global scales due to the hidden nature of irrigation signals and the limited ground truth data available for training classification algorithms ozdogan and gutman 2008 liu et al 2018 xie et al 2021 insufficient information on irrigation distribution is unfavorable for sustainable water use and management nagaraj et al 2021 and will introduce large uncertainties and biases in the modeling of surface and hydrologic processes land atmosphere interactions and crop growth satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented opportunities to detect and map irrigated areas at multiple spatial scales various methods have been proposed to identify irrigated areas using remote sensing data which can be classified into two categories namely optical and near infrared methods and microwave based methods massari et al 2021 visual interpretation is perhaps the most primitive method that use optical and near infrared signatures to detect irrigated area but is a cost and time intensive procedure karthikeyan et al 2020 besides the spectral signatures many vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1974 normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 and green index gi gitelson 2005 have been used to map irrigated areas the rationale behind which is that irrigation reduces crop water stresses and increase productivity resulting in higher greenness and water content of irrigated crops than rainfed crops nagaraj et al 2021 these vegetation indices are often used with classification algorithms trained with ground truth data such as decision trees ozdogan and gutman 2008 ambika et al 2016b support vector machine sharma et al 2021 and random forest peña arancibia et al 2014 deines et al 2017 to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed croplands in some exceptions the vegetation indices are compared to the target spectra of ground samples lu et al 2021 adjacent forest pixels xiang et al 2019 and time series precipitation to detect irrigation signals chen et al 2018 in recent years the microwave based irrigation mapping with satellite soil moisture products has also attracted attention dari et al 2021 the rationale behind the microwave based approach is that irrigation increases soil moisture and causes changes in soil moisture and radar backscatter signals thus microwave information is usually compared with simulations under natural conditions to detected irrigated areas kumar et al 2015 zaussinger et al 2019 zohaib et al 2019 or used with the classification algorithms trained with ground truth data gao et al 2018 pageot et al 2020 bazzi et al 2021 remote sensing based irrigated cropland extraction methods have shown high accuracy and reliability in small scale areas e g watersheds and irrigation districts nevertheless it is still a great challenge to map irrigated area at large spatial scales e g national and global scales due to the wide variation in climate geography and agricultural practices salmon et al 2015 as well as the lack of adequate ground truth data ozdogan et al 2010 xie and lark 2021 there have been several attempts to map the global irrigated area siebert et al 2005 generated the global map of irrigated areas gmia by combining national and subnational statistics with geospatial information on irrigation location and extent thenkabail et al 2009 derived the global irrigated area map giam from remote sensing using the spectral matching technique and decision tree algorithm later salmon et al 2015 fused remote sensing classification results with agricultural inventory data to generate a map of global rainfed irrigated and paddy croplands gripc meier et al 2018 merged the downscaled gmia map with the remote sensing derived irrigation map to generate a new global high resolution irrigation map in addition several national irrigation maps have been produced in recent years such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis irrigated agriculture dataset mirad us pervez and brown 2010 landsat based irrigation dataset across the conterminous united states lanid us xie et al 2019 xie and lark 2021 and remotely sensed high resolution irrigated area map in india ambika et al 2016b typically national irrigation maps are more accurate than global maps due to the availability of more ground data higher spatial resolution and reliable auxiliary information china is a large agricultural country with the largest irrigated area 65 87 million ha in the world followed by india 62 00 million ha and the united states 26 71 million ha idcd 2018 however to our knowledge few studies have mapped irrigated areas throughout china xiang et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and the spatial resolution of irrigation map is far below that of other countries e g the united states and india this limits the accuracy of irrigation water use estimates in china and significantly affects irrigation related ecological hydrological and climatic studies to address the above gaps this study proposes a novel approach to develop the first 250 m irrigated cropland map in mainland china cirrmap250 for the year 2000 by integrating remote sensing irrigation suitability and irrigated area statistics the major difference between our approach and other existing methods lies in the incorporation irrigation suitability into the mapping process our objectives of are threefold 1 to test the effectiveness of the new irrigation mapping method ii to compare the performance of cirrmap250 with three irrigation maps generated using the traditional threshold based method and four other existing maps siebert et al 2005 thenkabail et al 2009 zhu et al 2014 meier et al 2018 and iii to reveal the spatial distribution features of irrigated cropland in mainland china 2 study area china lies between 15 50 n and 65 135 e and covers an area of approximately 9 6 million square kilometers this study was carried out in mainland china fig 1 which is characterized by a wide range of elevations from 176 m below sea level at ayding lake in the turpan depression of xinjiang to 8 794 m above sea level on the qinghai tibetan plateau according to the köppen geiger climate classification biggs et al 2006 southeastern china has a warm temperate climate northwestern china has an arid climate northeastern and parts of central china have a cold climate and the high altitude qinghai tibetan plateau has a polar and cold climate cropland is extensively distributed across mainland china with a greater concentration in the eastern northeastern and central regions than in the arid northwestern region particularly the north china plain northeast china plain guanzhong plain sichuan basin and middle and lower yangtze river plain as shown in fig 1 b the study area is divided into 3 652 mapping units there are 686 reference points covering mainland china which are used to evaluate the accuracy of the irrigation maps 3 materials and methods the workflow of the study is summarized in fig 2 we first collected and processed three types of data including satellite data irrigated area statistics and auxiliary data then we combined the satellite derived vegetation indices ndvi evi and gi with irrigated area statistics from 3 625 administrative units to drive three irrigation maps i e ndvi map evi map and gi map using the threshold based classification method pervez and brown 2010 afterward we produced another irrigated cropland map i e cirrmap250 using the newly proposed semiautomatic classification approach the new approach consists of three major steps including irrigation suitability analysis training pool generation based on suitability adjusted vegetation indices and irrigated area statistics and machine learning based classification of irrigated and rainfed cropland lastly we evaluated the accuracy of cirrmap250 ndvi map evi map gi map and four other existing maps i e gmia2005 giam2000 zhu map and meier map from three different perspectives including the distribution of irrigated croplands agreement with reference points and consistency with irrigated area statistics 3 1 datasets and processing 3 1 1 satellite data the modis vegetation indices mod13q1 version 6 data including two vegetation layers i e ndvi and enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 1997 were used in the study as shown in table 1 ndvi and evi are 16 day composite products with a spatial resolution of 250 m meanwhile the 500 m and 8 day surface spectral reflectance of band 04 provided by mod09a1 was resampled to 250 m through nearest neighbor interpolation debeurs and townsend 2008 it was used to derive another vegetation index i e gi along with the 250 m and 8 day surface reflectance of band 01 provided by mod09q1 all modis data were quality filtered using quality and usefulness indicators and only those cloud and snow ice free pixels with decreasing to highest quality were considered to be reliable hilker et al 2012 unreliable pixels were reconstructed using a simple nearest neighbor interpolation method we calculated the maximum minimum range median values of vegetation indices for each crop grid note that the maximum and minimum values were calculated at the 95th and 10th percentile respectively to exclude the unidentified cloudy and poor quality values xie and lark 2021 to better account for crop and climate gradients we further derived a set of neighborhood normalized vegetation indices nndvi nevi ngi deines et al 2019 by dividing the annual peak vegetation index of a target pixel to the median value of its neighborhood pixels within a 25 km radius circular kernel 3 1 2 irrigated area statistics the irrigated area statistics were compiled through a top down and bottom up approach the county level and city level irrigated area were first collected from the provincial statistical yearbook the rural statistical yearbook and the china statistical yearbook for regional economy national bureau of statistics of china 2001b in china municipal administration city consists of districts and counties and here we referred to them all as counties counties without any irrigated area were merged into their nearest neighbors we aggregated the irrigated areas at the county level to the city level and compared them with the city level statistics for consistency checks where inconsistencies existed we further collected irrigation water use data from the provincial water resource bulletin and irrigation areas with a high correlation to irrigation water use were considered reliable for subsequent analysis the city level irrigated areas were finally aggregated to the provincial level and compared them with the values reported by the china water statistical yearbook cwsy china ministry of water resources 2001 we put higher confidence in the cwsy data because it is published by the chinese ministry of water resources and edited by water practitioners and researchers throughout china as shown in supplementary fig s1 the city aggregated irrigated areas are very close to the cwsy statistics with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 99 for provinces where inconsistencies exist we adjusted the county level irrigated area using eq 1 1 irrarea i j irrarea cwsy j irrarea agg j irrorgin i j where irrarea i j and irrorgin i j are the adjusted irrigated area and the original irrigated area in county i of province j respectively irrarea cwsy j and irrarea agg j are the cwsy reported irrigated area and the city aggregated irrigated area of province j respectively county level irrigated area statistics are available for 80 of provinces in mainland china supplementary fig s2 and we totally have 3 652 mapping units with irrigated area statistics fig 1 b note that xinjiang heilongjiang and fujian provinces have some irrigated croplands managed by the production and construction corps which we merged into the cities where they are located by population size following the method of zhu et al 2014 3 1 3 auxiliary data various auxiliary data were used in this study including climatic and environmental variables land use and land cover and administrative boundaries climate data including precipitation temperature pressure wind speed and downward solar radiation were extracted from the china meteorological forcing dataset he and yang 2016 he et al 2020 these data were used in conjunction with the mcd43a3 albedo product to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet using the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 as well as the aridity index defined as the ratio of precipitation to pet environmental data include elevation slope soil type and distance to water bodies the elevation data was taken from the shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model i e srtm dem and the slope map was generated from the srtm dem data using the slope function in arcgis software distance to water bodies was calculated from the spatial distribution data of water bodies including rivers lakes reservoirs canals and ponds using the euclidean distance tool in arcgis software the 2000 land use cover lulc map with a spatial resolution of 30 m was sourced from the land use status remote sensing monitoring database of china xu et al 2018 the map includes six major lulc types namely cropland forest grassland water body urban land and unused land the spatial distribution and proportion of each land use cover type at 250 m resolution was estimated from the original 30 m lulc map all data used in this study were obtained partly from the national tibetan plateau https data tpdc ac cn zh hans and partly from the resource and environment science and data center https www resdc cn default aspx 3 2 threshold based classification method threshold based classification is a simple yet robust easy to implement approach for creating irrigation maps that assumes the existence of thresholds for certain indices that can differentiate between irrigated and rainfed cropland these indices can be the annual peak vegetation index pervez and brown 2010 the irrigation potential index zhu et al 2014 or the lswi difference index xiang et al 2020 and the thresholds can be calibrated based on irrigated area statistics ground truth data or experience from previous studies pervez and brown 2010 shahriar pervez et al 2014 meier et al 2018 here following pervez and brown 2010 we classified irrigated and rainfed cropland using the thresholds of annual peak vegetation indices ndvi evi and gi specifically for each mapping unit of mainland china we first sorted the annual peak vegetation indices of all croplands in descending order and estimated the cumulative irrigated area sequentially the accumulated area was then compared with the statistical irrigated area and the value of vegetation index for the grid where the cumulative irrigated area was close to the statistical data was determined as the threshold we lastly classify the cropland into irrigated and rainfed by comparing annual peak vegetation index with the determined threshold as in eq 2 2 cropland i j irrigated i j p v i t h r e s h o l d rainfed i j p v i t h r e s h o l d where pvi are the annual peak vegetation index of the crop grid i in the mapping unit j over mainland china classification results using ndvi evi and gi were referred to as ndvi map evi map and gi map respectively hereafter the annual minimum median and range of ndvi evi and gvi were also tested but showed obviously lower performance than the annual peak values in mapping irrigated cropland 3 3 semiautomatic classification approach 3 3 1 irrigation suitability analysis irrigation suitability analysis has been widely used to assess potential land suitable for irrigation chen et al 2010 worqlul et al 2015 worqlul et al 2017 li and chen 2020 but has not received much attention in the irrigation mapping in this study we used the multi indicator evaluation mce technique to assess the irrigation suitability of croplands in mainland china our study considered elevation slope distance to water bodies disttowater and drought index as these natural and geographic conditions have proven to be important factors controlling the spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in china liu et al 2022 based on our experience and field work as well as the findings of previous studies we hypothesize that croplands with smaller disttowater lower elevation and slope and higher aridity index have greater irrigation suitability and potential it is easy to understand that the closer to water bodies the greater the possibility of irrigation since closer proximity to water bodies means easier access to irrigation water some previous studies have even selected the irrigation reference points by choosing croplands close to water bodies dong et al 2009 zhang et al 2022 the higher the elevation the more difficult it is to access water resources leading to a lower likelihood of irrigation cuo et al 2013 for example in our field work we found that in the high elevation areas of the loess plateau residents have access to domestic water only through deep wells while crop growth is completely dependent on rainfall meanwhile agricultural productivity is low at high altitudes in china due to lack of irrigation and higher transportation and labor costs li et al 2015 in addition it was found that paddy fields which are usually equipped for irrigation tend to be clustered in the lowlands of china compared to drylands liu et al 2005 areas with greater slopes have poor water holding capacity and are unfavorable for irrigation facilities akıncı et al 2013 worqlul et al 2017 mandal et al 2018 generally areas with slopes exceeding 8 are considered infeasible for any surface irrigation system shahriar pervez et al 2014 ambika et al 2016a therefore it is widely believed that the gentler the slope the more likely is the existence of irrigated cropland yin et al 2020 ishikawa and yamazaki 2021 croplands with higher aridity indices i e less precipitation but higher pet are also more likely to be irrigated due to the greater demand for irrigation water xu et al 2018 yin et al 2020 elevation slope disttowater and aridity index were first reclassified into different suitability types as shown in supplementary table s1 the elevations of the crop grids were reclassified into four types using the dividing points of 100 300 500 m above the lowest elevation of the mapping unit there are also four suitability types for both slope and disttowater the dividing points for slopes are 2 4 and 8 while dividing points for disttowater are 1 000 10 000 and 20 000 m using the dividing points aridity indices were reclassified into ten suitability types afterwards the above reclassified factors were assigned with different suitability values with higher values given to areas with lower elevation smaller slope and disttowater and higher aridity index lastly we estimated the overall irrigation suitability of the croplands by combining the suitability values of elevation slope disttowater and aridity index as in eq 3 3 s i j k 1 4 w 1 k s e l e v i j 1 4 w 2 k s s l o p e i j 1 4 w 3 k s d w i j 1 10 w 4 k s a r i d i j where si j k is the irrigation suitability for cropland i in mapping unit j of province k w is the weight of the influencing factors selev sslope sdw and sarid are the suitability values of elevation slope disttowater and aridity index respectively the weight setting is critical for irrigation suability analysis in this study weights were set in each province using the trial and error method based on the irrigated cropland distribution in the intermediate maps see next section according to our field work and experience appropriate weights should be given so that distribution of irrigated cropland have the following key characteristics i irrigated croplands are mostly distributed near water bodies at lower elevations and on smaller slopes ii irrigated croplands in plain areas are relatively evenly distributed iii irrigated croplands are generally continuously distributed due to the influence of water facilities and iv irrigated croplands in non plain regions are mainly distributed in river valleys 3 3 2 generating training pool inspired by the work of xie et al 2019 we designed a threshold calibrated method to automatically generate the training pool i e potential training data for each mapping unit of mainland china we first proposed a new irrigation suitability adjusted vegetation index svi with the assumption that irrigated cropland is not only greener but also more suitable for irrigation than rainfed cropland the svi is defined in eq 4 4 svi s p v i where s is the irrigation suability and pvi is the annual peak vegetation index the suitability adjusted ndvi evi and gi were named as sndvi sevi and sgi three intermediate irrigation maps were then generated based on sndvi sevi and sgi using the threshold based classification method section 3 2 note that the annual peak nndvi nevi and ngi were used in north china plain considering that crop gradient is not negligible but the gradients in elevation slope and aridity index are small and groundwater is widely used for irrigation furthermore cropland is discontinuously distributed in many parts of mainland china and many croplands are mixed with other land use cover types within the 250 m grids the pvi of the cropland urban water mixed grids would be underestimated compared to the pure cropland pixels while the cropland forest grassland mixed grids would be overestimated we recalculated the pvi for the mixed pixels with the cropland proportion less than 90 from the nearest pure cropland pixel in the case of few pure cropland pixels over mountainous areas the pvi values of mixed pixels were adjusted by the proportion of croplands considering that irrigation is more likely to occur on continuously distributed croplands lastly the intermediate irrigation maps were overlaid and pixels that were simultaneously identified as irrigated or rainfed cropland by these maps were used as the training pool for further classification 3 3 3 classification using random forest we used the random forest rf breiman 2001 to classify irrigated and rain fed cropland using the random samples from the training pool for each mapping unit of mainland china we randomly sample 200 rainfed cropland grids and 200 irrigated cropland grids following xie et al 2019 to balance the need for adequate samples and computational efficiency the sample size was increased to 4 000 i e 2 000 each for irrigated and rainfed cropland for the mapping units only with city level irrigated area statistics sensitive analyses indicated the use of different sets of training samples has minimal effect on the classification accuracy supplementary fig s3 we implemented the rf algorithm using the matlab treebagger function and the hyperparameters table 2 were determined through a trial and error procedure zhang et al 2021 the selected predictors include vegetation indices i e sevi nevi sndvi nndvi sgi and ngi climatic variables i e precipitation temperature wind speed solar radiation and aridity index and environmental variables i e latitude longitude crop intensity elevation disttowater slope and soil type the rf based classification of irrigated and rainfed cropland was carried out separately in each mapping unit after classification we applied a spatial filter i e 7 7 window to remove isolated pixels less than5 of the window area and detect the missed irrigated croplands 95 of the window area resulting in the final irrigated cropland map in mainland china with a spatial resolution of 250 m i e cirrmap250 we also tested two additional commonly used machine learning algorithms i e artificial neural network gardner and dorling 1998 and extreme learning machine huang et al 2012 for classification of irrigated and rainfed croplands but they showed lower accuracy than rf supplementary fig s4 3 4 accuracy assessment the accuracy of cirrmap250 were assessed from three different aspects first the spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in cirrmap250 was compared with evi map ndvi map and gi map and four other existing maps including gmia 2005 siebert et al 2005 giam2000 thenkabail et al 2009 zhu map zhu et al 2014 and meier map meier et al 2018 the performance of these maps was evaluated by analyzing their ability in detecting intensively irrigated areas and large scale irrigation districts of mainland china as well as two field surveyed irrigation districts second we further conducted a point scale evaluation of cirrmap250 and other irrigation maps using 686 reference points fig 1 most of the reference points 90 were sourced from zhu et al 2014 which were partly collected from the crop growth and soil moisture dataset provided by the china meteorological data sharing service system https data cma cn and partly obtained using google earth and irrigation information on large irrigated districts provided by the china irrigation and drainage development center https www jsgg com cn ciddc index asp the remaining 10 of reference points were derived through our field work and visual interpretation of google satellite maps as listed in table 3 the performance metrics including kappa coefficient overall accuracy and producer s accuracy were used for quantitative assessments finally we compared the irrigated area statistics with the estimates from cirrmap250 zhu map gmia2005 and meier map at different spatial scales 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of irrigated cropland in cirrmap250 fig 3 depicts the spatial distribution of irrigated and rainfed cropland in cirrmap250 we can see that irrigated croplands are mainly distributed in the north china plain and northwest china meanwhile many large scale irrigation districts such as hetao qingtongxia fenhe baojixia dujiangyan zhanghe and pishihang also have intensively irrigated croplands at the provincial level shandong holds the largest irrigated area 4 940 kha followed by henan 4 834 kha hebei 4 566 kha jiangsu 3 999 kha anhui 3 236 kha and xinjiang 3 172 kha the provinces including tibet qinghai tianjin beijing shanghai and hainan have relatively smaller areas of irrigated croplands than other provinces in mainland china at the basin scale the yangtze river basin has the largest irrigated area 14 939 kha followed by the huai river basin 10 622 kha hai river basin 7 400 kha the southwest river basin has the lowest irrigated cropland area among the nine river basins in mainland china 4 2 comparison of irrigated cropland distribution fig 4 compares the distribution of irrigated croplands in different irrigation maps intensively irrigated areas such as the north china plain northwest china and large scale irrigation districts are overall well captured by all the maps the spatial pattern of irrigated croplands in evi map ndvi map gi map is similar to cirrmap250 due to the consistent constraints of irrigated area statistics on the mapping results however a closer look reveals that the distribution of irrigated cropland in the evi ndvi gi map is more uniform and extensive in the southern and central regions of mainland china than in cirrmap250 there are notable differences between cirrmap250 and the four existing maps at both regional and local scales compared with other irrigation maps irrigated cropland in zhu map is less distributed in central and southeastern chongqing northeastern heilongjiang and the baojixia irrigation district but more distributed in northern hebei province giam2000 has more irrigated areas in the north china plain northeast china plain and sichuan and guangxi provinces but obviously less irrigated area in provinces such as tibet qinghai gansu and guangdong gaim2005 does not provide much details on the distribution of irrigated cropland due to the coarse spatial resolution irrigated cropland in gaim2005 appears to be more distributed in northeastern china southern sichuan province and northern shaanxi than the other irrigation maps but less distributed in jiangxi jiangsu sichuan and hubei the two panels inserted in each subplot of fig 4 show the distribution of irrigated cropland in two field surveyed irrigation districts i e the jinghe irrigation district upper panel and the xuhuiqu irrigation district lower panel both jinghe and xuhuiqu irrigation districts are located in river valleys where irrigated cropland is concentrated cirrmap250 captures well the concentration of irrigated cropland in these two irrigation districts however all other maps tend to underestimate irrigated cropland in the jinghe and xuhuiqu irrigation districts while overestimating irrigated cropland in the surrounding mountainous areas the similar results can be extensively observed if we enlarge evi map ndvi map gi map zhu map giam2000 gmia2005 and meier map 4 3 point scale accuracy evaluation fig 5 summarizes the point scale accuracy of the different irrigation maps gaim2005 is not evaluated here because of its coarse spatial resolution we can see that cirrmap250 attains a kappa coefficient of 0 58 in mainland china obviously higher than evi map 0 47 ndvi map 0 44 and gi map 0 46 as well as the other three existing maps 0 20 0 28 the improvement in kappa coefficient ranges from 23 to about 2 times for cirrmap250 compared to other irrigation maps the overall accuracy of cirrmap250 is 0 79 while it ranges from 0 60 to 0 73 for the other maps the overall accuracy of cirrmap250 improves from 8 to 32 compared to other maps the producer s accuracy of irrigated samples is 0 75 in cirrmap250 apparently higher than the other maps ranging from 0 40 to 0 64 the producer s accuracy of non irrigated samples in cirrmap250 is higher than higher than that of zhu map and meier map but lower than evi map ndvi map gi map and giam2000 the overall accuracy of all maps tends to be lower in arid and semi arid areas than in humid and semi humid areas this is because non irrigated cropland is more difficult to identify in arid and semi arid areas as indicated by the lower producer s accuracy of non irrigation although the contrary is the case for irrigated cropland regardless the results indicate that cirrmap250 has a higher accuracy than the other irrigation maps 4 4 comparison of irrigated area estimates with statistics fig 6 compares the irrigated area estimates of cirrmap250 zhu map gmia2005 and meier map with the statistical data for the 3 652 mapping units of mainland china giam2000 is not analyzed here due to the lack of pixel level irrigation percentages the irrigated area of cirrmap250 shows a good agreement with the statistics with the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 99 mainly due to the usage of irrigated area statistics in the generation of the training pool the irrigated area of zhu map matches well with the provincial statistics but the agreement is relatively low at the mapping unit level this is because less than 50 of the provinces in zhu map includes county level irrigated area statistics zhu et al 2014 for example as shown in fig 8 b the irrigated areas in two mapping units of heilongjiang province are clearly overestimated because only the total irrigated area statistics in that province were used in the mapping process the estimated irrigated area from gmia2005 is generally consistent with the statistics as the statistics were also used to generate gmia2005 although not in as much detail as the data in our study among the four irrigation maps meier map has the lowest agreement between the irrigated area estimates and the statistics because it combined statistical irrigated area with other remote sensing detected irrigated area during the mapping process meier et al 2018 5 discussion 5 1 irrigated cropland in different geographical feature ranges we further calculated the proportion of irrigated cropland for seven irrigation maps at different elevations slopes and distances from water bodies the north china plain was excluded from the analysis due to its small elevation and slope gradients and the relatively consistent pattern of irrigated cropland in these maps as shown in fig 7 cirrmap250 has 70 of irrigated cropland that is distributed in areas with elevation less than 500 m slope less than 4 and distance less than 3 000 m from water bodies in comparison to other maps more irrigated cropland in cirrmap250 is located at lower elevations on smaller slopes and closer to water bodies this is easy to understand because we incorporated irrigation suitability estimates based on elevation slope distance to water bodies and aridity index into the irrigation mapping framework as described in section 3 3 1 areas with low elevation gentle slope small distance to water bodies are more favorable for irrigation from this perspective the spatial distribution seems to be more reasonable in cirrmap250 than in other maps nevertheless china has quite specific agriculture e g terraces and smallholder cropping systems that requires reliable reference irrigation maps to robustly assess the above results especially at the regional scale the fact that the other maps have more irrigated cropland at higher elevations larger slopes and farther away from water bodies than cirrmap250 can be explained by their neglect of the mixed grid effects china has many scattered small scale croplands that are mixed with forests grasslands in mountainous areas vegetation in mixed cropland forest grassland areas may be greener than croplands located in river valleys and they can easily be detected as irrigated cropland if the vegetation index is mainly considered for extracting irrigated area as illustrated by the two field surveyed irrigated districts 5 2 large uncertainty in irrigation ratio estimates the sources of cropland area in china can be divided into four categories including remote sensing the national bureau of statistics of china nbsc the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china mnrprc and the national land survey the national land survey of china was conducted three times in 1984 1987 2007 2009 and 2017 2019 while no data was available around 2000 we estimated irrigation ratio i e the ratio of irrigated cropland area to total cropland area for difference provinces in mainland china based on the cropland area from remote sensing xu et al 2018 nbsc national bureau of statistics of china 2001a and mnrprc ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china 2001 as shown in fig 8 irrigation ratio varies significantly among the 31 provinces with higher values in beijing shanghai jiangsu and xinjiang while lower values in heilongjiang yunnan and guizhou irrigation ratio also exhibits a large difference for the same region for instance it ranges from 0 54 to 0 93 in xinjiang using cropland area from different sources irrigation ratio estimates based on the remote sensing estimated cropland area are lower than the estimates based on the nbsc reported cropland area and mnrprc reported cropland area this is because as shown in fig 8 the cropland acreages reported by nbsc and mnrprc are obviously smaller than those estimated by remote sensing although they exhibit a higher correlation r2 0 85 in this study it is challenging to assess which sources of cropland area are reliable nevertheless previous study indicates that remote sensing tends to overestimate cropland area due to the widespread presence of non cropland within the map grid and the classification accuracy problems guo 2006 on the other hand nbsc tends to underestimate the cropland area due to administrative and technical reasons xu et al 2014 overall irrigation ratio estimates have large uncertainties due to the varying cropland area from multiple sources 5 3 limitations and prospects we admit that this study has some limitations and uncertainties that deserve further investigations in the future to begin with the proposed irrigation mapping method depends heavily on irrigated area statistics although the statistical irrigated areas were collected and reconstructed with an unprecedented level of detail in our study they inevitably have some uncertainties and inconsistences ajaz et al 2019 furthermore the statistics represent the effective irrigated area i e the area equipped for irrigation rather than the actual irrigated area which may lead to biased results in fact the china water statistical yearbook cwsy china ministry of water resources 2001 have also reported the actual irrigated area at the provincial level which is closely matched to the effective irrigated area with a coefficient of determination of 0 99 supplementary fig s5 however actual irrigated area at the city county level is not available which limits its use to constrain the irrigated cropland distribution in spatial detail we further conducted an experiment to assign the actual provincial irrigated area to the county level based on the statistical effective irrigated area and recreated the irrigated cropland map using the method proposed in this study we found that the spatial pattern of irrigated croplands in the new map was very similar to cirrmap250 supplementary fig s6 but showed no improvement in accuracy second this study incorporates irrigation suitability into the irrigated cropland mapping framework which greatly improves the performance of irrigation map however the irrigation suitability analysis is somewhat subjective due to the requirement of weight setting if sufficient ground truth data are available in the future they can be divided into two parts one for automatic weight calibration and one for performance evaluation meanwhile due to the large number of mapping units 3500 the irrigation suitability analysis was performed only at the provincial level which may affect the accuracy of the irrigation map especially in provinces with high topographic and climatic gradients such as gansu and heilongjiang provinces in addition terraces are widely distributed in china accounting for 26 of the country s cropland area cao et al 2021 and about 30 of them are located in areas with slopes higher than 8 supplementary fig s7 there may be many irrigable terraces in high slope areas thus our assumption that gentle slope cropland is more likely to be irrigated than steep slope cropland may not hold true adding some uncertainties to our results nevertheless irrigation suitability is determined not only by slope but also by three other factors i e elevation disttowater and drought index and meanwhile for provinces with concentrated distribution of terraces the weight of slope less than0 16 was significantly lower than other factors in the irrigation suitability analysis suggesting that our results may not be significantly influenced lastly this study only mapped irrigated cropland in mainland china for a specific year i e 2000 to verify the reliability of the newly proposed mapping method as done in many other studies ozdogan and gutman 2008 xiang et al 2019 xie et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the number of reference points is relatively small and some of them may not be representative of the actual situation in 2000 which may bring uncertainty to our results the lack of sufficient ground truth data would be addressed in the future by conducting more field work and by collaborating with more researchers in the field of irrigated cropland mapping and with the ministry of natural resources of the people s republic of china https www mnr gov cn which has much reliable survey data in the next step we will apply our new method to generate time continuous maps of irrigated cropland from 2000 to the present and collect more reference points and survey data spanning multiple years to robustly evaluate the performance of our new mapping method and the accuracy of irrigation maps 6 conclusions this study proposed a novel approach to develop the first 250 m irrigated cropland map in mainland china cirrmap250 for the year 2000 by integrating remote sensing irrigation suitability and irrigated area statistics the novelty of the new approach lies in the incorporation of irrigation suitability into the irrigation mapping process the new method consists of three major steps including irrigation suitability analysis training pool generation based on suitability adjusted vegetation indices and irrigated area statistics and machine learning based classification of irrigated and rainfed cropland we evaluated the performance of cirrmap250 and compared it with three irrigation maps i e evi map ndvi map and gi map generated using the threshold based classification method as well as four other existing maps including gmia2005 siebert et al 2005 giam2000 thenkabail et al 2009 zhu map zhu et al 2014 and meier map meier et al 2018 the accuracy of the irrigation maps was assessed from three different aspects including the distribution of irrigated croplands agreement with reference points and consistency with irrigated area statistics results indicate that the irrigated croplands are mainly distributed in the north china plain northwest china and some large scale irrigation districts shandong province holds the largest irrigated area followed by henan hebei jiangsu anhui and xinjiang while at the basin scale the yangtze river basin has the largest irrigated area followed by the huai river basin hai river basin and yellow river basin intensively irrigated areas are overall well captured by cirrmap250 and all the other maps cirrmap250 has a similar irrigation distribution pattern to evi map ndvi map due to the consistent constraints of irrigated area statistics on the mapping results however there are notable differences between cirrmap250 and the four existing maps at both regional and local scales all maps except cirrmap250 tend to underestimate irrigated cropland in river valleys and overestimate irrigated cropland in the mountainous areas as evidenced by the field surveyed irrigation districts mainly because of their neglect of the mixed grid effects cirrmap250 has a higher point scale accuracy than the other maps cirrmap250 achieves an improvement in kappa coefficient by 23 to about 2 times and an improvement in overall accuracy by 8 to 32 in comparison to other irrigation maps additionally the irrigated area of cirrmap250 shows a good agreement with the statistics mainly due to the utilization of irrigated area statistics in the generation of the training pool the irrigation mapping method can be easily applied to other regions of the world and the new irrigated cropland map has great potential to support agriculture climate and environment research as well as water resource management in mainland china nevertheless we admit that this study has some limitations and uncertainties such as the heavy dependence on irrigated area statistics and the subjectivity of irrigation suitability analysis which deserve further investigations in the future in the next step we will attempt to generate time continuous maps of irrigated cropland from 2000 to the present and collect more reference points and survey data to robustly evaluate the performance of our new mapping method and the accuracy of irrigation maps 7 data and code availability cirrmap250 can be

2934,stream flow and concentration dynamics are usually supposed to integrate the diverse hydrological and biogeochemical processes occurring within catchments and their variability in space and time proxies like transit times and young water fractions are often used to understand this variability however this procedure might not be suitable in catchments with ephemeral streams the objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that in catchments where groundwater flow is the main source of water output solute travel times can be inferred from the monitored groundwater levels and solute concentration time series of piezometer networks we used data from a well studied small agricultural catchment in brittany belonging to the french network of critical zone observatories the data set includes long term nitrate concentration time series measured both at the stream outlet and the network of piezometers we applied a parsimonious conceptual dual permeability mixing modelto calibrate our dataset and found that the nitrate travel times estimated in mid to upslope piezometers were consistently higher than the one at the stream outlet we further observed an asynchronicity in seasonal concentration discharge dynamics between the piezometers and the stream we hypothesized that either due to riparian denitrification and uptake by vegetation a pronounced seasonality is being generated which is making our model underestimate the nitrate travel times at the stream or the piezometers are acting as proxies to the slower conceptual store of our mixing model and shallow subsurface flow or some hydrologically significant heterogeneities are contributing to the faster route which is not tapped into by the piezometer network latter hypothesis is further supported by the fact that nitrate travel velocity along two different transects are in agreement with the slower conceptual store of our model nevertheless we established that to specifically estimate the groundwater travel time of a catchment a piezometer free from riparian influence alongside a stream is very beneficial keywords piezometers groundwater transit times conceptual models diffuse pollution global uncertainty analysis riparian denitrification data availability all data is available at http agrhys fr bve vidae 1 introduction estimation of nitrate travel times in catchments is critical for designing adequate policies cec 1998a b and several modelling approaches have been developed based on stream nitrate concentration time series hrachowitz et al 2015 however being calibrated using streamflow data alone becker et al 2019 yassin et al 2017 they are not always adequate due to uncertainty in model parameterization and scarcity of data when the streams are ephemeral it is thus necessary to constrain such travel time models with multiple measurements taken outside the stream environment to adequately capture the spatiotemporal variability and to understand the dynamics of individual processes which aggregate at the stream dembele et al 2020 li et al 2020 intensification of agriculture and consequent anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen in agricultural watersheds howden et al 2011 dunn et al 2012 has increased significantly the ground water concentration of nitrates both globally galloway et al 2004 and in certain european provinces sutton et al 2011 ehrhardt et al 2019 over the last few decades legacy effects of nitrate contamination arising from cumulated load for several decades molenat et al 2008 owens et al 2008 hrachowitz et al 2015 van meter et al 2017 aided by compartmentalization effects martinec 1975 due to the presence of deeper and interactive groundwater chambers mcdonnel 2017 jasechko et al 2017 primarily manifest themselves in the form of such an attenuated response this exerts control on rivers aquilina et al 2012 meals et al 2010 by delaying the flushing time of nitrates wriedt and rode 2006 melland et al 2012 due to this stationarity of the legacy stores and the temporal invariance of the flow weighted concentration basu et al 2010 basu et al 2022 the applied policy measures may take several years to show any impact on stream concentration in headwater catchments a deeper understanding of the processes occuring within these catchments are thus explored using conceptual fit for purpose models beven and lane 2019 which can accurately estimate the groundwater and solute flushing times for small catchments ruiz et al 2002b fenicia et al 2011 birkel et al 2014 fovet et al 2015 soulsby et al 2015 hrachowitz et al 2016 with variations in conceptually based parameters and in turn envision the detention mobility and fate of nutrients and pollutants at a catchment scale examples can be groundwater dominated catchments where river water is assumed to be a mixture of old and young groundwater benettin et al 2017 and are thus modelled as a combination of mixing reservoirs despite the effectiveness of these models applying them to integrated stream signals makes it difficult to retrieve information of individual processes like tributary and point discharge mixing groundwater transport and complex physical and biological processes in the riparian environment burns et al 2019 loss and transport of n species governed by complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions in the hyporheic transition zone can also affect stream nitrate concentration krause et al 2013 lansdown et al 2015 multilevel piezometer networks are helping us better understand those hyporheic processes kunz et al 2017 similarly spatiotemporal analysis done by application of generic conceptual frameworks to smaller scales i e at interior monitoring locations like wells and piezometers might allow us to not only constrain parameters suitably but to also segregate individual processes which were integrated to produce the stream signature indeed compared to connectivity of observable surface properties in landscapes like self organization of fractal river networks rinaldo et al 2014 our understanding of groundwater connectivity in catchments still suffers despite a battery of synthetic studies on spatial connectivity of highly heterogeneous aquifers bianchi et al 2011 and site specific analysis on fractured rock systems taucare et al 2020 collins et al 2020 this primarily occurs due to lack of data or unreliability of inferred or processed subsurface data of very few and widely spaced boreholes li et al 2020 or very shallow monitoring just narrowly brushing the surface of the critical zone richter and billings 2015 past investigations have established that in order to better understand dominant processes and reduce the number of potential hypotheses that may explain nitrate dynamics in catchments analysis of multiple sensor signals from a single site can be particularly helpful burns et al 2019 heffernan and cohen 2010 jarvie et al 2018 bieroza et al 2018 lloyd et al 2016 outram et al 2014 furthermore in order to distinguish the non conservative in stream processes measurements outside the channel environment in places like piezometers or subsurface drains are very helpful consequently in recent times high frequency nitrate sensors are being deployed at higher spatial resolution away from the influence of riparian in stream processes burns et al 2019 which are providing valuable insights on the role of groundwater in surface water nitrate dynamics duncan et al 2015 outram et al 2016 rozemeijer et al 2010 these are also helping in the identification of dynamic biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone kunz et al 2017 and allowing explanation of the behaviour of nitrate concentration time series hereby referred to as breakthroughs in the stream through aquifer characteristics aided by groundwater age data obtained from cfc in springs and boreholes guillaumot et al 2021 etc along the same lines we hypothesise that piezometers free from riparian influence can be a good substitute of stream in groundwater solute travel time determination and can also provideadditional insight on the governing dynamics of the catchment at smaller scales this might be particularly useful in catchments where the river is intermittent or ephemeral fovet et al 2021 compare et al 2021 srinivasan et al 2015 but extensively monitored well network is available buvaneswari et al 2017 in this study we use the data of a small agricultural catchment of french brittany which has been extensively monitored both at the stream outlet and intermediate piezometers for more than a decade and whose transport dynamics has been modelled by several authors our overarching objective is to check whether long term solute concentration time series of piezometers can give us proper solute travel times of groundwater at intermediate locations just like streams do at the catchment outlet using conceptual mixing models our specific goals are i to check our hypothesis that piezometers especially the ones located downslope but free from riparian influence called downslope piezometers hereafter can be used for solute travel time determination as a substitute to streams using conceptual mixing models ii to check whether the travel times are scalable i e whether they increase in proportion with the distance of the sampling point from the catchment boundary iii to gain more insight on how in stream processes impact the stream breakthrough behaviour and how sensitive these in stream processes are in travel time determination and iv to check if the combined usage of time series of piezometers and catchment outlet together in modelling gives us any insight on the physical meaning of the different stores of conceptual mixing models 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description kerrien fig 1 vertès et al 1996 a 10 5 ha agriculture dominated headwater catchment located in the kerbernez site of south western french brittany 47 35 n 117 52 e belongs to the agrhys critical zone observatory fovet et al 2018 https www6 inra fr ore agrhys eng the site has a elevation of 14 to 35 m a s l with below 8 5 slope the climate is oceanic with average temperature ranging from 18 in summer to 6 in winter it is underlain by a deep fractured granitic bedrock béchennec and hallégouët 1999 overlain by weathered granite of depth 1 m to 20 m ruiz et al 2002a the soil is mainly sandy loam rich in organic matter 4 5 6 the catchment is well drained except the bottomlands which consists of about 5 of the total area of the catchment dairy farming is the main agricultural activity in kerrien thus intensively grazed grasslands occupy more than two third of the area fovet et al 2015 2 2 data monitoring and surveys detailed agricultural and environmental long term time series are available in kerrien monitoring points indicated in fig 1 an hourly record of meteorological data is available since 1992 from an automatic weather station cimel and evapotranspiration was estimated using penman pet stream discharge was measured using v notch weirs since 1997 base flow index of kerrien being 80 90 majority of the stream flow and nitrate export can be considered as a contribution of the hillslope aquifer baseflow used in the model was estimated by linear interpolation after discarding all individual storm events the piezometers fig 1 were drilled in 2000 martin et al 2004 all piezometers have pvc tubes screened along the bottom 1 m the annular space around the tube was filled with sand in the screened zone with bentonite from screened zone to ground surface and concrete afterwards for a precise geochemical depth sampling the water table was monitored in each piezometer using automatic pressure transducer sensors ott every 15 min groundwater was sampled daily in each piezometer in the screened zone with an open bailer with a ball valve at the bottom rouxel et al 2011 samples both stream and groundwater were filtered in the field with a gnwp 0 45 µm filter and nitrate concentrations were determined with ionic chromatography dionex in the laboratory of umr sas rennes 2 3 calculation of soil nitrogen balances an extensive agricultural survey was carried out since 1992 to determine the amount of n available for leaching annually ruiz et al 2002a fovet et al 2015 and data was fed to nitrogen budget models given by comifer 1996 to figure out the amount of leachable nitrogen ruiz et al 2002a and was later revised using territ eau gascuel odoux et al 2009 for grazed grasslands and mineralization ensuing grassland destruction fovet et al 2015 this n available for leaching along with the meteorological data pet and precipitation and soil properties depth and water holding capacity was fed to burns model burns 1975 at a daily time step in order to determine the drainage and nitrogen leaching through the soils fovet et al 2015 supplementary s3 water holding capacity was set at 20 mm per 10 cm for the first 30 cm and 15 mm per 10 cm further down 2 4 modelled piezometers and stream outlets we applied the etna model sec 2 6 to four 15 m deep piezometers three of them located along a transect h15 j15 and l15 and another downslope piezometer k15 adjacent to l15 and in the same meadow in order to check the dependence of transit time on the flowpath length from catchment boundaries as well as to also check the efficiency of downslope piezometers free from riparian influence in determining transit times we also applied etna to the outlet of kerrien e3 additionally nitrate concentration time series of two piezometers f5b and f4 from an adjacent transect were used to determine nitrate travel velocities from centroid movement of concentration time series after heavy leaching the positioning of all the relevant observation locations is shown in the kerrien map of fig 1 2 5 loading time series and past trends nitrate concentration in the brittany streams showed very small values in the order of 10mgno3 l before 1975 aquilina et al 2012 thus the catchment was considered nitrate free before 1965 although no survey was done before 1992 based on farmer interviews it was determined that kerrien was subjected to dairy farming since the sixties and the animal production and thus the n fertilizer input increased gradually till 1992 so a gradually increasing trend of n available for leaching was assumed starting from zero at 1965 and the slope was so adjusted to match the amount of n available for leaching estimated from farm survey in 1992 since the agricultural practices on different meadows of kerrien is nearly similar the per hectare loading for each piezometer is considered to be the same as the per hectare loading of entire kerrien the n available for leaching from 1965 onwards is shown in fig 2 in intensively managed grasslands large n mineralization rates with large losses to environment are often observed after heavy ploughing events in order to grow arable crops besnard et al 2007 cameron and wild 1984 smit and velthof 2010 this happened in the meadow upslope of f5b in 2005 and as a footprint a mound was visible fig 10 in the nitrate concentration time series in f5b and f4 downslope piezometer along the same transect the loading in the parcel upslope of f5b can be estimated in kgn ha but being situated almost at the ridge of the catchment we have large uncertainty in terms of the surface contributing to the considered hillslope however we used these breakthrough mounds to estimate the approximate nitrate centroid movement along this transect 2 6 model adaptation we used dual porosity conceptual mixing model etna ruiz et al 2002a originally being built for determining stream baseflow the flow part of the model was slightly adapted for the conversion of groundwater storage into piezometer levels the water fluxes were calculated using 2 reservoirs having different recession times a in day 1 and different active storages sa in mm respectively one faster than the other the physical meaning of such fast and slow reservoirs is discussed later in sections 3 4 3 5 both obeying the generic linear reservoir equation 1 d s a t dt r t q t q t a s a t where q in mm day and r in mm day are the baseflow and recharge respectively the two parallel reservoirs is a model structure which is more flexible as compared to single reservoir with single master recession curve having varying recession coefficients fenicia et al 2010 the groundwater levels zsim t were then calculated using the formula 2 z sim t 1 s y z f s a f a s t t 1 f s a s l o w t where z is the maximum volume of mobile groundwater mm suffixes fast and slow creates distinction between the two reservoirs based on their recessions afast and aslow and f is the fraction contribution of the faster reservoir sy is the mean aquifer specific yield it is important to mention here that the fast and the slow reservoirs both represent groundwater stores working together to reproduce the baseflow or groundwater levels of piezometers and the corresponding nitrate concentrations it has nothing to do with surface water since in most groundwater catchments the tracer signals are much more damped as compared to inputs kirchner 2003 introducing additional storages that aid the diffusion of solutes but does not affect flow behaviour is quite common and incorporated in almost all semi distributed catchment transit time modelling frameworks in recent times hrachowitz et al 2014 molin et al 2020 we therefore use a passive storage fully mixed at a daily scale with the active storage for each individual reservoir represented by the ode 3 d c t dt l t c t q t d s a t dt s a s d where c t is the concentration of the slow or fast store in mgno3 l sd is the passive storage in mm l t is the burns n leach in mg l mm day since all volume calculations are done in depth units mm l m 2 a conversion factor of 443 was used to convert the l t in kg ha day obtained from burns model burns 1965 the weighted relative contribution of each compartment is then used to calculate the concentration at individual piezometers as follows 4 c net t f c fast q fast 1 f c slow q slow q net q net f q fast 1 f q slow a schematic outline of the model is shown in fig 1 2 7 denitrification since groundwater in the region is high in dissolved oxygen content bidois 1999 no denitrification was assumed in the groundwater or unsaturated zone the average dissolved o2 concentration is about 5 mg l in the study site fovet et al 2015 a regional investigation of groundwater ages and nitrate concentration showed limited evidences of denitrification aquilina et al 2012 especially in very distinct environments like pyrite rich schists pauwels et al 2000 or in pumping sites tarits et al 2006 although potential denitrification was assumed in the unsaturated zone in kerrien legout et al 2005 no evidence was found through isotope analysis martin et al 2004 pierson wickmann et al 2009 therefore no biological transformation was considered in reproducing the nitrate concentration time series of the piezometers in the stream a constant daily nitrogen removal was considered since the chief influencers of biological activities namely the nitrate availability soil moisture temperature and light oehler et al 2009 were assumed to compensate each other through their seasonal variations fovet et al 2015 therefore the stream concentration was calculated as follows 5 c final t max c net t q net t r c 0 q net t with rc the constant nitrate removal parameter 2 8 parameter calibration calibration of hydrological parameters to match the groundwater level time series for the piezometers we took same recession coefficient a fast a slow and same fraction entering the fast compartment f for all 3 piezometers h15 j15 and l15 for calibration as they are located along the same topographic transect within a small average distance of 50 m we allowed the specific yields s y h s y j s y l and the maximum volume of mobile groundwater z h z j z l to vary amongst them to account for the minor differences in the mean and standard deviation of groundwater level time series at individual piezometer locations having almost the exact same groundwater level time series the hydrological parameters settled for piezometer l15 was also used for adjacent piezometer k15 situated along the same contour line calibration of transport parameters to match the long term nitrate concentration time series at each piezometer we calibrated fast and slow passive compartments for all 4 piezometers s d fast h s d slow h s d fast j s d slow j s d fast l s d slow l s d f a s t k s d s l o w k whilst fixing the calibrated recessions a fast a slow and faster fraction f at their mean values latin hypercube sampling lhs with uniform probability distribution was used to generate parameters as no prior knowledge was available on the parameter distributions lhs stratifies the input probability distributions into equal intervals on the cumulative probability scale and then takes a random value from each interval as opposed to traditional random sampling which loses its reliability to some extent when the distance between sample mean and distribution mean increases thus even with a moderate number of iterations lhs makes all sample means lie within a smaller interval of error thereby making simulations converge faster lee et al 2006 aistleitner et al 2012 with negligible increment in computational cost we therefore performed 5000 runs for each cost function described below and selected the top 0 1 parameters corresponding to least error as behavioural parameter sets and the relative standard deviation amongst those was quantified as the parameter uncertainty sum of the normalized mean absolute errors of simulated groundwater levels at every time step was minimized to obtain the best set of hydrological parameters then fixing the values of the hydrological parameters which are relevant for nitrate transport a fast a slow f at the mean values of their corresponding behavioral sets the nitrate concentration time series of each piezometer was calibrated separately via minimizing the normalized mean absolute errors between observed and simulated signals to obtain the volume of the passive storages minimization of cost functions ofh and ofti was performed based on the following equations 6 o f h i 1 n n 1 z t sim i z t obs i o f h i o f h i o f t i 1 n n 1 t c t sim i c t obs i where o f h i is the cost function for groundwater levels z and o f t i is the cost function for nitrate concentration i of the ith piezometer respectively n is the number of data points and suffixes sim and obs refer to simulated and observed values respectively piezometers h15 j15 and l15 were calibrated for the entire period of 2004 2016 but k15 was calibrated only up to 2012 as the measurements stopped afterwards all simulations were done using matlab 2021b 2 9 travel time calculation transit times depend on both the intrinsic catchment properties as well as the prevailing climatic conditions thus using the climatic time series available since 1965 average time taken for a unit pulse of nitrate to exit the catchment was determined pulses were sent on 1st august of years 1968 representative of dry climatic sequence 1974 representative of medium climatic sequence and 1980 representative of wet climatic sequence so that the volume of rainfall between consecutive pulses increase steadily taking into account the variations with alteration of wetness conditions mean travel time calculations or breakthrough centroid calculations require closure of the breakthroughs and thus extrapolation of existing climate time series reducing transparency dunn et al 2007 it s thus more sensible to settle for a parameter which determines the time taken to recover 50 of mass of the applied n at the measuring location therefore half nitrate recovery time hnrt was calculated values of hnrt are slightly lesser than mean travel times for transit time distributions having longer tails fovet et al 2015 but nevertheless a relevant metric for cross comparison 2 10 c q or c z response comparison this c q or c z response can be mathematically summarized by a simple semiquantitative descriptor butturini et al 2008 7 δ c c s c b c s w h e n c s c b c s c b c b w h e n c s c b where δc indicates the relative change of solute concentration in the response cb and cs are the solute concentrations in the lowest baseflow and peak of the hydrograph respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration recalibration of e3 using the new sampling and optimization technique didn t change the values of the parameters much supplementary s1 as compared to fovet et al 2015 thus we used the same set of parameters as documented there simultaneous calibration of the aforementioned 17 parameters using latin hypercube sampling yielded reasonably satisfactory results for all 4 piezometers rsr the ratio of the rmse of observations and their standard deviations singh et al 2005 and percentage bias values were within satisfactory range moriasi et al 2007 in reproducing groundwater depths as summarized in table 2 with the results illustrated in fig 3 nitrate breakthroughs had proper trend prediction in terms of rmse and percentage bias table 2 provided the input uncertainty howden et al 2011 both long term breakthrough behaviors along with contributions of different stores in calibrating those concentrations are presented in fig 4 the behavioral parameters had their mean uncertainties in the range of 1 15 table 1 and calibration can be considered as satisfactory fig 5 one can note that the calibrated specific yield values came out to be close to field observations sy calibration sy field 1 martin et al 2006 the seasonalities in breakthroughs were not always optimally reproduced especially in upslope piezometers but we assumed these seasonal cycles to have negligible impact the calculations of the transit times that are of the order of several years in these groundwater fed catchments ayraud et al 2008 fovet et al 2015 kolbe et al 2016 guillaumot et al 2021 the reproduction of the seasonal variation at the downslope piezometers are better than upslope ones which is perhaps a result of the increase in hysteresis indices thickness of hysteresis loops of the concentration vs groundwater level relationship as we move towards upslope rouxel et al 2011 3 2 hnrt calculations the hnrt of h15 j15 and l15 table 2 were consistently higher than the hnrt of e3 4 years h15 j15 l15 e3 which is surprising since distance of e3 from the catchment divide is almost thrice to that of the downslope piezometer l15 however the hnrt of downslope piezometers is in agreement with the past synthetic studies martin et al 2006 which showed an equilibration of nitrate concentration in shallow and deep stores of the aquifer in 6 8 years adjacent transects having slightly different nitrate travel times indicates a contrast in dispersivity along different flow paths or an influence of lateral flushing affecting the optimization of buffer storage volumes as displayed by l15 and k15 the relationship between the mean hnrt of the piezometers and the mean hnrt of the slow store contributing to the outlet with the flow path length from the ridge fig 6 seems to be almost linear this indicates that the piezometers along the hjl transect might be a good proxy for the slower store optimized to reproduce the nitrate concentration time series at e3 it further suggests that the travelling velocity of nitrate obtained from the slope of this regression line is 21 m year it is relevant to state here that to get the exact centroid movement we should use the mean transit time mtt instead of hnrt but as mentioned in section 2 9 hnrt is a good and less ambiguous proxy of mtt especially in long tailed distributions and thus the 50 pulse recovery time can be considered a reasonable representation of the centroid attainment time as well 3 3 unexpected sharp seasonality with phase asynchronicity in stream nitrate breakthroughs and possible explanations of inconsistent hnrt values to understand why the model led to estimate much longer nitrate recovery times in the piezometers compared to the stream outlet in kerrien we analysed the piezometer and stream breakthroughs focusing at a period in which the water was sampled at a high temporal resolution fig 7 for 2006 2013 the nitrate concentration time series in downslope piezometers l15 and k15 followed a seasonality consistent with hydrological time series however the difference in the phases of these piezometer nitrate breakthroughs and the breakthroughs at stream outlet e3 kerrien in relation to their groundwater levels or discharges is clearly noticeable fig 7 it was observed that in response to a recharge event the discharges at stream outlets and the groundwater levels in piezometers went up almost instantaneously this instantaneous hydrological response might be in accordance to the theory of faster propagation of pressure waves celerity as compared to the transfer of actual water molecules with flow velocity kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell and beven 2014 however this caused dilution in the nitrate concentrations in all piezometers but increased the concentration of nitrates in the stream outlet e3 this dilution in piezometer nitrate concentration indicates that preferential flow towards the piezometers via macropores is a higher possibility however nitrate being highly mobile the concentration between macro and micro pores gets equilibrated quickly and we get an uniform sample regardless this phase lag between primarily groundwater fed stream outlets and the piezometers for the same solute is apparently a bit surprising we tried to analyze the cause below soils usually have higher hydraulic conductivity as compared to deeper bedrock welch and allen 2014 there are exceptions like karst systems stevanovic 2015 where flow through bedrock may be faster than within soils but in most systems the fracture density of bedrock significantly decreases with depth and a high proportion of recharged water thus flows through soils and shallower bedrock and reaches the stream early as young water jasechko et al 2016 it is sometimes also aided by the activation of shallower flow paths with the rise of water table whose travel time is a few months as opposed to the large turnover times of deeper stores identified by legacy nitrate contamination from past agricultural inputs this is assumed to have an aggregating effect at the stream which can represent mixtures of multiple end members with different concentration discharge patterns armfield et al 2019 radke et al 2019 showing flushing behaviour dilution patterns or chemostatic behaviour musolff et al 2015 the aggregation effect has been well documented in recent studies on brittany catchments guillaumot et al 2021 now apparently there are near chemostatic dilution patterns lower concentration with increasing groundwater level in kerrien piezometers along with higher transit times and an opposite sharp flushing behaviour in e3 higher concentrations with increasing baseflow with lower transit times as shown in fig 7 the hydrographs of kerrien showed a complete cycle from 1st nov of a year to 31st oct of next year we summarized the δc values equation 7 for this period for 3 consecutive years 2009 2010 and 2011 in table 3 a difference can be sen in both magnitude and direction of the descriptor this dramatically opposite behavior cannot be explained by mere integration of process signals along different flowpaths so our first hypothesis to explain these behaviours is the absence of proper aggregation at the stream since the water budget in kerrien shows a 54 7 deep loss fovet et al 2015 one can wonder if the water reaching the outlet e3 would come mostly from the wetlands associated with a very short transit time resulting in an inverted seasonality compared to piezometers and underestimation of groundwater nitrate transit times however kerrien having a very small volume 10 5 ha area and a mean weathered granite layer thickness of 20 m and piezometers sampling nitrate concentrations vertically midway it is quite unlikely that majority of the groundwater nitrate signature being captured by the piezometers is escaping the stream another hypothesis would be the contribution of some faster flowpath from a different hillslope to the stream being mostly homogeneous and agriculturally uniform the signature of some alternate patch being dramatically different is also not very likely an alternate hypothesis can be that the nitrate seasonality in the stream is not controlled by the nitrate seasonality in the groundwater in particular stream seasonality might be due to the riparian in stream in bed biological removal transformation or uptake of nitrate the sharp decrease of nitrate concentration at outlet e3 in summer along with decreased baseflow as observed in kerrien was explained by martin et al 2006 considering zones with electrical conductivity less than 3 ms m 1 as denitrifying zones they observed that the very large extent of denitrifying zone present in kerrien about 5 of catchment area with depth of 10 m beneath the soil surface into the weathered granite layer showed a significant decrease in stream nitrate concentration in summer months primarily due to reduction in shallow groundwater contribution however such a mechanism will have a significant impact on nitrate concentration and total load only when either the water flow or the nitrate concentration is very low in fact although a nitrate removal parameter rc kg ha d was incorporated in etna when applied to stream breakthroughs the value optimized came out to be very low with negligible influence on the exported nitrate loads in the etna model the concentration seasonality is also reproduced by increasing the nitrate concentration differences between the two stores and thus is also sensitive to the relative contribution of the two stores parameter f we investigated the sensitivity of hnrt on parameter f by applying a n pulse on the year with average climatic conditions 1st august 1972 and using the corresponding simulated breakthrough curves to compute hnrt for different values of f fig 8 at 1 increments at e3 both parameters f and r contribute to the seasonality of simulated breakthrough so the equifinality between the two parameters can lead to an overestimation of f value that is causing an underestimate of the groundwater nitrate transit time when applied to the e3 outlet on the other hand when applied to the piezometers etna cannot reproduce the seasonality in nitrate concentration except at downslope locations and f calibration is rather driven by the long term nitrate concentration dynamics therefore downslope piezometers free from riparian influence are likely to be the best location for estimating hnrt using the conceptual model 3 4 are the piezometers proxies of an individual store we also tried to reproduce the groundwater levels and nitrate concentration time series of each piezometer along hjl transect using a single conceptual store the physical model and the calibration techniques were the same parameter f was withdrawn the hydrological dynamics were very well reproduced using a single store whereas in nitrate breakthroughs the trend was satisfactorily captured especially in downslope piezometer l15 but not the seasonality fig 9 however the hnrt values table 4 were within 2 5 error of the hnrts calculated using the dual store setup the uncertainty analysis results dotty plots are shown in supplementary s2 in the etna model structure the hnrt is primarily influenced by the volume of the 2 passive storages vim fast vim slow and their relative contribution f intuitively a single store setup will give an hnrt very close to the dual store setup when either i f approaches 0 or 1 or ii when vim fast vim slow in piezometers what happens is close to the latter thus despite an unsatisfactory reproduction of the seasonality we got single store hnrts very close to the dual store hnrts also we observed earlier that in the hnrt vs distance from ridge graph fig 6 the extrapolation of hnrts of piezometers h15 j15 l15 to the slow store of e3 using a linear regression is possible it can thus be logically stated that the piezometers might be a good proxy for the slow store which strengthens our hypothesis proposed in section 3 2 3 5 independent estimation of nitrate velocity the grassland destruction event on the adjacent meadow caused a large increase in the nitrate concentration time series of f5b from 2005 to 2010 fig 10 in the downslope piezometer f4 a similar but more smeared increase was observed from 2007 to 2015 the temporal difference of the centroids of these 2 mounds is 4 2 years fig 10 and the distance between piezometers f5b and f4 fig 6 is 103 m the travel velocity of nitrate along the f5b f4 transect is thus 24 52 m year fig 10 despite being unable to determine the loading at the location of the f transect with acceptable uncertainty the ploughing and consequent nitrate mineralization allowed us to determine the order of magnitude of the advective velocity of nitrate which is close to the solute velocity along the h15 j15 l15 e3 flowpath estimated with the model 21 m year this supports the hypothesis that piezometers behave like the proxy to a single store and using etna with one store allows to reasonably estimate the residence times this also suggests that the slow store hnrt at the outlet e3 is accurately representing the transit time in the two monitored hillslopes 3 6 insights into the anatomy of the catchment and proposal of future work the question of the effect of the calibration of the fast store on the average hnrt estimated at the outlet can lead us to 2 contradicting hypotheses in essentially every groundwater system that has received a detailed investigation there exist hydrologically significant heterogeneities within the soil matrix salamon et al 2007 zhang and benson 2008 bianchi et al 2011 fractures with high degree of connectivity markovich et al 2019 walter et al 2019 taucare et al 2020 macro pores remaining from decaying roots etc that result in very fast transport of water and solutes it is not hard to imagine that similar heterogeneities exist in this system and the data and model results support the idea that they do in essence the model is conceptually a dual permeability model but where to put he frac ure or macropore permeability and how to accurately parameterize it is a complex problem that likely requires more data and modelling another possibility is that the calibration of the fast store at the outlet is majorly impacted by instream processes see section 3 3 in which case hnrt at outlet is largely underestimated further experiments and analyses are thus needed to arrive to a definite conclusion 4 conclusion in this study we compared the nitrate transit time estimated using conceptual modelling applied to piezometers and the stream outlet our conceptual model was able to reproduce the long term nitrate breakthrough behaviors of all piezometers chosen for our analysis reasonably capturing their interannual variations the transit times estimated from the piezometers were larger than the stream outlet which is counterintuitive we hypothesized that one possible reason might be the misleading sharp seasonality of the stream nitrate concentration time series due to biological activities which are largely overestimating the contribution of the faster store of etna and in turn underestimating the transit times however we also found that the slow store hnrt at the outlet e3 is accurately representing the nitrate travel velocities and transit times in the two monitored hillslopes indicating that piezometers are a good proxy of one of the stores of etna thus the transit time estimated from the stream nitrate concentration is not erroneous but is perhaps getting affected by nitrate signals coming from some faster travel route in some other hillslope or the lowland not captured by our measurements more experiments are needed to verify this nevertheless parsimonious modelling exercises using the long term time series of a downslope piezometer free from riparian influence thus might be a good candidate to constrain nitrate travel time problem in semi arid catchments especially when the streams are ephemeral or dry credit authorship contribution statement baibaswata bhaduri

2934,stream flow and concentration dynamics are usually supposed to integrate the diverse hydrological and biogeochemical processes occurring within catchments and their variability in space and time proxies like transit times and young water fractions are often used to understand this variability however this procedure might not be suitable in catchments with ephemeral streams the objective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that in catchments where groundwater flow is the main source of water output solute travel times can be inferred from the monitored groundwater levels and solute concentration time series of piezometer networks we used data from a well studied small agricultural catchment in brittany belonging to the french network of critical zone observatories the data set includes long term nitrate concentration time series measured both at the stream outlet and the network of piezometers we applied a parsimonious conceptual dual permeability mixing modelto calibrate our dataset and found that the nitrate travel times estimated in mid to upslope piezometers were consistently higher than the one at the stream outlet we further observed an asynchronicity in seasonal concentration discharge dynamics between the piezometers and the stream we hypothesized that either due to riparian denitrification and uptake by vegetation a pronounced seasonality is being generated which is making our model underestimate the nitrate travel times at the stream or the piezometers are acting as proxies to the slower conceptual store of our mixing model and shallow subsurface flow or some hydrologically significant heterogeneities are contributing to the faster route which is not tapped into by the piezometer network latter hypothesis is further supported by the fact that nitrate travel velocity along two different transects are in agreement with the slower conceptual store of our model nevertheless we established that to specifically estimate the groundwater travel time of a catchment a piezometer free from riparian influence alongside a stream is very beneficial keywords piezometers groundwater transit times conceptual models diffuse pollution global uncertainty analysis riparian denitrification data availability all data is available at http agrhys fr bve vidae 1 introduction estimation of nitrate travel times in catchments is critical for designing adequate policies cec 1998a b and several modelling approaches have been developed based on stream nitrate concentration time series hrachowitz et al 2015 however being calibrated using streamflow data alone becker et al 2019 yassin et al 2017 they are not always adequate due to uncertainty in model parameterization and scarcity of data when the streams are ephemeral it is thus necessary to constrain such travel time models with multiple measurements taken outside the stream environment to adequately capture the spatiotemporal variability and to understand the dynamics of individual processes which aggregate at the stream dembele et al 2020 li et al 2020 intensification of agriculture and consequent anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen in agricultural watersheds howden et al 2011 dunn et al 2012 has increased significantly the ground water concentration of nitrates both globally galloway et al 2004 and in certain european provinces sutton et al 2011 ehrhardt et al 2019 over the last few decades legacy effects of nitrate contamination arising from cumulated load for several decades molenat et al 2008 owens et al 2008 hrachowitz et al 2015 van meter et al 2017 aided by compartmentalization effects martinec 1975 due to the presence of deeper and interactive groundwater chambers mcdonnel 2017 jasechko et al 2017 primarily manifest themselves in the form of such an attenuated response this exerts control on rivers aquilina et al 2012 meals et al 2010 by delaying the flushing time of nitrates wriedt and rode 2006 melland et al 2012 due to this stationarity of the legacy stores and the temporal invariance of the flow weighted concentration basu et al 2010 basu et al 2022 the applied policy measures may take several years to show any impact on stream concentration in headwater catchments a deeper understanding of the processes occuring within these catchments are thus explored using conceptual fit for purpose models beven and lane 2019 which can accurately estimate the groundwater and solute flushing times for small catchments ruiz et al 2002b fenicia et al 2011 birkel et al 2014 fovet et al 2015 soulsby et al 2015 hrachowitz et al 2016 with variations in conceptually based parameters and in turn envision the detention mobility and fate of nutrients and pollutants at a catchment scale examples can be groundwater dominated catchments where river water is assumed to be a mixture of old and young groundwater benettin et al 2017 and are thus modelled as a combination of mixing reservoirs despite the effectiveness of these models applying them to integrated stream signals makes it difficult to retrieve information of individual processes like tributary and point discharge mixing groundwater transport and complex physical and biological processes in the riparian environment burns et al 2019 loss and transport of n species governed by complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions in the hyporheic transition zone can also affect stream nitrate concentration krause et al 2013 lansdown et al 2015 multilevel piezometer networks are helping us better understand those hyporheic processes kunz et al 2017 similarly spatiotemporal analysis done by application of generic conceptual frameworks to smaller scales i e at interior monitoring locations like wells and piezometers might allow us to not only constrain parameters suitably but to also segregate individual processes which were integrated to produce the stream signature indeed compared to connectivity of observable surface properties in landscapes like self organization of fractal river networks rinaldo et al 2014 our understanding of groundwater connectivity in catchments still suffers despite a battery of synthetic studies on spatial connectivity of highly heterogeneous aquifers bianchi et al 2011 and site specific analysis on fractured rock systems taucare et al 2020 collins et al 2020 this primarily occurs due to lack of data or unreliability of inferred or processed subsurface data of very few and widely spaced boreholes li et al 2020 or very shallow monitoring just narrowly brushing the surface of the critical zone richter and billings 2015 past investigations have established that in order to better understand dominant processes and reduce the number of potential hypotheses that may explain nitrate dynamics in catchments analysis of multiple sensor signals from a single site can be particularly helpful burns et al 2019 heffernan and cohen 2010 jarvie et al 2018 bieroza et al 2018 lloyd et al 2016 outram et al 2014 furthermore in order to distinguish the non conservative in stream processes measurements outside the channel environment in places like piezometers or subsurface drains are very helpful consequently in recent times high frequency nitrate sensors are being deployed at higher spatial resolution away from the influence of riparian in stream processes burns et al 2019 which are providing valuable insights on the role of groundwater in surface water nitrate dynamics duncan et al 2015 outram et al 2016 rozemeijer et al 2010 these are also helping in the identification of dynamic biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone kunz et al 2017 and allowing explanation of the behaviour of nitrate concentration time series hereby referred to as breakthroughs in the stream through aquifer characteristics aided by groundwater age data obtained from cfc in springs and boreholes guillaumot et al 2021 etc along the same lines we hypothesise that piezometers free from riparian influence can be a good substitute of stream in groundwater solute travel time determination and can also provideadditional insight on the governing dynamics of the catchment at smaller scales this might be particularly useful in catchments where the river is intermittent or ephemeral fovet et al 2021 compare et al 2021 srinivasan et al 2015 but extensively monitored well network is available buvaneswari et al 2017 in this study we use the data of a small agricultural catchment of french brittany which has been extensively monitored both at the stream outlet and intermediate piezometers for more than a decade and whose transport dynamics has been modelled by several authors our overarching objective is to check whether long term solute concentration time series of piezometers can give us proper solute travel times of groundwater at intermediate locations just like streams do at the catchment outlet using conceptual mixing models our specific goals are i to check our hypothesis that piezometers especially the ones located downslope but free from riparian influence called downslope piezometers hereafter can be used for solute travel time determination as a substitute to streams using conceptual mixing models ii to check whether the travel times are scalable i e whether they increase in proportion with the distance of the sampling point from the catchment boundary iii to gain more insight on how in stream processes impact the stream breakthrough behaviour and how sensitive these in stream processes are in travel time determination and iv to check if the combined usage of time series of piezometers and catchment outlet together in modelling gives us any insight on the physical meaning of the different stores of conceptual mixing models 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description kerrien fig 1 vertès et al 1996 a 10 5 ha agriculture dominated headwater catchment located in the kerbernez site of south western french brittany 47 35 n 117 52 e belongs to the agrhys critical zone observatory fovet et al 2018 https www6 inra fr ore agrhys eng the site has a elevation of 14 to 35 m a s l with below 8 5 slope the climate is oceanic with average temperature ranging from 18 in summer to 6 in winter it is underlain by a deep fractured granitic bedrock béchennec and hallégouët 1999 overlain by weathered granite of depth 1 m to 20 m ruiz et al 2002a the soil is mainly sandy loam rich in organic matter 4 5 6 the catchment is well drained except the bottomlands which consists of about 5 of the total area of the catchment dairy farming is the main agricultural activity in kerrien thus intensively grazed grasslands occupy more than two third of the area fovet et al 2015 2 2 data monitoring and surveys detailed agricultural and environmental long term time series are available in kerrien monitoring points indicated in fig 1 an hourly record of meteorological data is available since 1992 from an automatic weather station cimel and evapotranspiration was estimated using penman pet stream discharge was measured using v notch weirs since 1997 base flow index of kerrien being 80 90 majority of the stream flow and nitrate export can be considered as a contribution of the hillslope aquifer baseflow used in the model was estimated by linear interpolation after discarding all individual storm events the piezometers fig 1 were drilled in 2000 martin et al 2004 all piezometers have pvc tubes screened along the bottom 1 m the annular space around the tube was filled with sand in the screened zone with bentonite from screened zone to ground surface and concrete afterwards for a precise geochemical depth sampling the water table was monitored in each piezometer using automatic pressure transducer sensors ott every 15 min groundwater was sampled daily in each piezometer in the screened zone with an open bailer with a ball valve at the bottom rouxel et al 2011 samples both stream and groundwater were filtered in the field with a gnwp 0 45 µm filter and nitrate concentrations were determined with ionic chromatography dionex in the laboratory of umr sas rennes 2 3 calculation of soil nitrogen balances an extensive agricultural survey was carried out since 1992 to determine the amount of n available for leaching annually ruiz et al 2002a fovet et al 2015 and data was fed to nitrogen budget models given by comifer 1996 to figure out the amount of leachable nitrogen ruiz et al 2002a and was later revised using territ eau gascuel odoux et al 2009 for grazed grasslands and mineralization ensuing grassland destruction fovet et al 2015 this n available for leaching along with the meteorological data pet and precipitation and soil properties depth and water holding capacity was fed to burns model burns 1975 at a daily time step in order to determine the drainage and nitrogen leaching through the soils fovet et al 2015 supplementary s3 water holding capacity was set at 20 mm per 10 cm for the first 30 cm and 15 mm per 10 cm further down 2 4 modelled piezometers and stream outlets we applied the etna model sec 2 6 to four 15 m deep piezometers three of them located along a transect h15 j15 and l15 and another downslope piezometer k15 adjacent to l15 and in the same meadow in order to check the dependence of transit time on the flowpath length from catchment boundaries as well as to also check the efficiency of downslope piezometers free from riparian influence in determining transit times we also applied etna to the outlet of kerrien e3 additionally nitrate concentration time series of two piezometers f5b and f4 from an adjacent transect were used to determine nitrate travel velocities from centroid movement of concentration time series after heavy leaching the positioning of all the relevant observation locations is shown in the kerrien map of fig 1 2 5 loading time series and past trends nitrate concentration in the brittany streams showed very small values in the order of 10mgno3 l before 1975 aquilina et al 2012 thus the catchment was considered nitrate free before 1965 although no survey was done before 1992 based on farmer interviews it was determined that kerrien was subjected to dairy farming since the sixties and the animal production and thus the n fertilizer input increased gradually till 1992 so a gradually increasing trend of n available for leaching was assumed starting from zero at 1965 and the slope was so adjusted to match the amount of n available for leaching estimated from farm survey in 1992 since the agricultural practices on different meadows of kerrien is nearly similar the per hectare loading for each piezometer is considered to be the same as the per hectare loading of entire kerrien the n available for leaching from 1965 onwards is shown in fig 2 in intensively managed grasslands large n mineralization rates with large losses to environment are often observed after heavy ploughing events in order to grow arable crops besnard et al 2007 cameron and wild 1984 smit and velthof 2010 this happened in the meadow upslope of f5b in 2005 and as a footprint a mound was visible fig 10 in the nitrate concentration time series in f5b and f4 downslope piezometer along the same transect the loading in the parcel upslope of f5b can be estimated in kgn ha but being situated almost at the ridge of the catchment we have large uncertainty in terms of the surface contributing to the considered hillslope however we used these breakthrough mounds to estimate the approximate nitrate centroid movement along this transect 2 6 model adaptation we used dual porosity conceptual mixing model etna ruiz et al 2002a originally being built for determining stream baseflow the flow part of the model was slightly adapted for the conversion of groundwater storage into piezometer levels the water fluxes were calculated using 2 reservoirs having different recession times a in day 1 and different active storages sa in mm respectively one faster than the other the physical meaning of such fast and slow reservoirs is discussed later in sections 3 4 3 5 both obeying the generic linear reservoir equation 1 d s a t dt r t q t q t a s a t where q in mm day and r in mm day are the baseflow and recharge respectively the two parallel reservoirs is a model structure which is more flexible as compared to single reservoir with single master recession curve having varying recession coefficients fenicia et al 2010 the groundwater levels zsim t were then calculated using the formula 2 z sim t 1 s y z f s a f a s t t 1 f s a s l o w t where z is the maximum volume of mobile groundwater mm suffixes fast and slow creates distinction between the two reservoirs based on their recessions afast and aslow and f is the fraction contribution of the faster reservoir sy is the mean aquifer specific yield it is important to mention here that the fast and the slow reservoirs both represent groundwater stores working together to reproduce the baseflow or groundwater levels of piezometers and the corresponding nitrate concentrations it has nothing to do with surface water since in most groundwater catchments the tracer signals are much more damped as compared to inputs kirchner 2003 introducing additional storages that aid the diffusion of solutes but does not affect flow behaviour is quite common and incorporated in almost all semi distributed catchment transit time modelling frameworks in recent times hrachowitz et al 2014 molin et al 2020 we therefore use a passive storage fully mixed at a daily scale with the active storage for each individual reservoir represented by the ode 3 d c t dt l t c t q t d s a t dt s a s d where c t is the concentration of the slow or fast store in mgno3 l sd is the passive storage in mm l t is the burns n leach in mg l mm day since all volume calculations are done in depth units mm l m 2 a conversion factor of 443 was used to convert the l t in kg ha day obtained from burns model burns 1965 the weighted relative contribution of each compartment is then used to calculate the concentration at individual piezometers as follows 4 c net t f c fast q fast 1 f c slow q slow q net q net f q fast 1 f q slow a schematic outline of the model is shown in fig 1 2 7 denitrification since groundwater in the region is high in dissolved oxygen content bidois 1999 no denitrification was assumed in the groundwater or unsaturated zone the average dissolved o2 concentration is about 5 mg l in the study site fovet et al 2015 a regional investigation of groundwater ages and nitrate concentration showed limited evidences of denitrification aquilina et al 2012 especially in very distinct environments like pyrite rich schists pauwels et al 2000 or in pumping sites tarits et al 2006 although potential denitrification was assumed in the unsaturated zone in kerrien legout et al 2005 no evidence was found through isotope analysis martin et al 2004 pierson wickmann et al 2009 therefore no biological transformation was considered in reproducing the nitrate concentration time series of the piezometers in the stream a constant daily nitrogen removal was considered since the chief influencers of biological activities namely the nitrate availability soil moisture temperature and light oehler et al 2009 were assumed to compensate each other through their seasonal variations fovet et al 2015 therefore the stream concentration was calculated as follows 5 c final t max c net t q net t r c 0 q net t with rc the constant nitrate removal parameter 2 8 parameter calibration calibration of hydrological parameters to match the groundwater level time series for the piezometers we took same recession coefficient a fast a slow and same fraction entering the fast compartment f for all 3 piezometers h15 j15 and l15 for calibration as they are located along the same topographic transect within a small average distance of 50 m we allowed the specific yields s y h s y j s y l and the maximum volume of mobile groundwater z h z j z l to vary amongst them to account for the minor differences in the mean and standard deviation of groundwater level time series at individual piezometer locations having almost the exact same groundwater level time series the hydrological parameters settled for piezometer l15 was also used for adjacent piezometer k15 situated along the same contour line calibration of transport parameters to match the long term nitrate concentration time series at each piezometer we calibrated fast and slow passive compartments for all 4 piezometers s d fast h s d slow h s d fast j s d slow j s d fast l s d slow l s d f a s t k s d s l o w k whilst fixing the calibrated recessions a fast a slow and faster fraction f at their mean values latin hypercube sampling lhs with uniform probability distribution was used to generate parameters as no prior knowledge was available on the parameter distributions lhs stratifies the input probability distributions into equal intervals on the cumulative probability scale and then takes a random value from each interval as opposed to traditional random sampling which loses its reliability to some extent when the distance between sample mean and distribution mean increases thus even with a moderate number of iterations lhs makes all sample means lie within a smaller interval of error thereby making simulations converge faster lee et al 2006 aistleitner et al 2012 with negligible increment in computational cost we therefore performed 5000 runs for each cost function described below and selected the top 0 1 parameters corresponding to least error as behavioural parameter sets and the relative standard deviation amongst those was quantified as the parameter uncertainty sum of the normalized mean absolute errors of simulated groundwater levels at every time step was minimized to obtain the best set of hydrological parameters then fixing the values of the hydrological parameters which are relevant for nitrate transport a fast a slow f at the mean values of their corresponding behavioral sets the nitrate concentration time series of each piezometer was calibrated separately via minimizing the normalized mean absolute errors between observed and simulated signals to obtain the volume of the passive storages minimization of cost functions ofh and ofti was performed based on the following equations 6 o f h i 1 n n 1 z t sim i z t obs i o f h i o f h i o f t i 1 n n 1 t c t sim i c t obs i where o f h i is the cost function for groundwater levels z and o f t i is the cost function for nitrate concentration i of the ith piezometer respectively n is the number of data points and suffixes sim and obs refer to simulated and observed values respectively piezometers h15 j15 and l15 were calibrated for the entire period of 2004 2016 but k15 was calibrated only up to 2012 as the measurements stopped afterwards all simulations were done using matlab 2021b 2 9 travel time calculation transit times depend on both the intrinsic catchment properties as well as the prevailing climatic conditions thus using the climatic time series available since 1965 average time taken for a unit pulse of nitrate to exit the catchment was determined pulses were sent on 1st august of years 1968 representative of dry climatic sequence 1974 representative of medium climatic sequence and 1980 representative of wet climatic sequence so that the volume of rainfall between consecutive pulses increase steadily taking into account the variations with alteration of wetness conditions mean travel time calculations or breakthrough centroid calculations require closure of the breakthroughs and thus extrapolation of existing climate time series reducing transparency dunn et al 2007 it s thus more sensible to settle for a parameter which determines the time taken to recover 50 of mass of the applied n at the measuring location therefore half nitrate recovery time hnrt was calculated values of hnrt are slightly lesser than mean travel times for transit time distributions having longer tails fovet et al 2015 but nevertheless a relevant metric for cross comparison 2 10 c q or c z response comparison this c q or c z response can be mathematically summarized by a simple semiquantitative descriptor butturini et al 2008 7 δ c c s c b c s w h e n c s c b c s c b c b w h e n c s c b where δc indicates the relative change of solute concentration in the response cb and cs are the solute concentrations in the lowest baseflow and peak of the hydrograph respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration recalibration of e3 using the new sampling and optimization technique didn t change the values of the parameters much supplementary s1 as compared to fovet et al 2015 thus we used the same set of parameters as documented there simultaneous calibration of the aforementioned 17 parameters using latin hypercube sampling yielded reasonably satisfactory results for all 4 piezometers rsr the ratio of the rmse of observations and their standard deviations singh et al 2005 and percentage bias values were within satisfactory range moriasi et al 2007 in reproducing groundwater depths as summarized in table 2 with the results illustrated in fig 3 nitrate breakthroughs had proper trend prediction in terms of rmse and percentage bias table 2 provided the input uncertainty howden et al 2011 both long term breakthrough behaviors along with contributions of different stores in calibrating those concentrations are presented in fig 4 the behavioral parameters had their mean uncertainties in the range of 1 15 table 1 and calibration can be considered as satisfactory fig 5 one can note that the calibrated specific yield values came out to be close to field observations sy calibration sy field 1 martin et al 2006 the seasonalities in breakthroughs were not always optimally reproduced especially in upslope piezometers but we assumed these seasonal cycles to have negligible impact the calculations of the transit times that are of the order of several years in these groundwater fed catchments ayraud et al 2008 fovet et al 2015 kolbe et al 2016 guillaumot et al 2021 the reproduction of the seasonal variation at the downslope piezometers are better than upslope ones which is perhaps a result of the increase in hysteresis indices thickness of hysteresis loops of the concentration vs groundwater level relationship as we move towards upslope rouxel et al 2011 3 2 hnrt calculations the hnrt of h15 j15 and l15 table 2 were consistently higher than the hnrt of e3 4 years h15 j15 l15 e3 which is surprising since distance of e3 from the catchment divide is almost thrice to that of the downslope piezometer l15 however the hnrt of downslope piezometers is in agreement with the past synthetic studies martin et al 2006 which showed an equilibration of nitrate concentration in shallow and deep stores of the aquifer in 6 8 years adjacent transects having slightly different nitrate travel times indicates a contrast in dispersivity along different flow paths or an influence of lateral flushing affecting the optimization of buffer storage volumes as displayed by l15 and k15 the relationship between the mean hnrt of the piezometers and the mean hnrt of the slow store contributing to the outlet with the flow path length from the ridge fig 6 seems to be almost linear this indicates that the piezometers along the hjl transect might be a good proxy for the slower store optimized to reproduce the nitrate concentration time series at e3 it further suggests that the travelling velocity of nitrate obtained from the slope of this regression line is 21 m year it is relevant to state here that to get the exact centroid movement we should use the mean transit time mtt instead of hnrt but as mentioned in section 2 9 hnrt is a good and less ambiguous proxy of mtt especially in long tailed distributions and thus the 50 pulse recovery time can be considered a reasonable representation of the centroid attainment time as well 3 3 unexpected sharp seasonality with phase asynchronicity in stream nitrate breakthroughs and possible explanations of inconsistent hnrt values to understand why the model led to estimate much longer nitrate recovery times in the piezometers compared to the stream outlet in kerrien we analysed the piezometer and stream breakthroughs focusing at a period in which the water was sampled at a high temporal resolution fig 7 for 2006 2013 the nitrate concentration time series in downslope piezometers l15 and k15 followed a seasonality consistent with hydrological time series however the difference in the phases of these piezometer nitrate breakthroughs and the breakthroughs at stream outlet e3 kerrien in relation to their groundwater levels or discharges is clearly noticeable fig 7 it was observed that in response to a recharge event the discharges at stream outlets and the groundwater levels in piezometers went up almost instantaneously this instantaneous hydrological response might be in accordance to the theory of faster propagation of pressure waves celerity as compared to the transfer of actual water molecules with flow velocity kirchner et al 2000 mcdonnell and beven 2014 however this caused dilution in the nitrate concentrations in all piezometers but increased the concentration of nitrates in the stream outlet e3 this dilution in piezometer nitrate concentration indicates that preferential flow towards the piezometers via macropores is a higher possibility however nitrate being highly mobile the concentration between macro and micro pores gets equilibrated quickly and we get an uniform sample regardless this phase lag between primarily groundwater fed stream outlets and the piezometers for the same solute is apparently a bit surprising we tried to analyze the cause below soils usually have higher hydraulic conductivity as compared to deeper bedrock welch and allen 2014 there are exceptions like karst systems stevanovic 2015 where flow through bedrock may be faster than within soils but in most systems the fracture density of bedrock significantly decreases with depth and a high proportion of recharged water thus flows through soils and shallower bedrock and reaches the stream early as young water jasechko et al 2016 it is sometimes also aided by the activation of shallower flow paths with the rise of water table whose travel time is a few months as opposed to the large turnover times of deeper stores identified by legacy nitrate contamination from past agricultural inputs this is assumed to have an aggregating effect at the stream which can represent mixtures of multiple end members with different concentration discharge patterns armfield et al 2019 radke et al 2019 showing flushing behaviour dilution patterns or chemostatic behaviour musolff et al 2015 the aggregation effect has been well documented in recent studies on brittany catchments guillaumot et al 2021 now apparently there are near chemostatic dilution patterns lower concentration with increasing groundwater level in kerrien piezometers along with higher transit times and an opposite sharp flushing behaviour in e3 higher concentrations with increasing baseflow with lower transit times as shown in fig 7 the hydrographs of kerrien showed a complete cycle from 1st nov of a year to 31st oct of next year we summarized the δc values equation 7 for this period for 3 consecutive years 2009 2010 and 2011 in table 3 a difference can be sen in both magnitude and direction of the descriptor this dramatically opposite behavior cannot be explained by mere integration of process signals along different flowpaths so our first hypothesis to explain these behaviours is the absence of proper aggregation at the stream since the water budget in kerrien shows a 54 7 deep loss fovet et al 2015 one can wonder if the water reaching the outlet e3 would come mostly from the wetlands associated with a very short transit time resulting in an inverted seasonality compared to piezometers and underestimation of groundwater nitrate transit times however kerrien having a very small volume 10 5 ha area and a mean weathered granite layer thickness of 20 m and piezometers sampling nitrate concentrations vertically midway it is quite unlikely that majority of the groundwater nitrate signature being captured by the piezometers is escaping the stream another hypothesis would be the contribution of some faster flowpath from a different hillslope to the stream being mostly homogeneous and agriculturally uniform the signature of some alternate patch being dramatically different is also not very likely an alternate hypothesis can be that the nitrate seasonality in the stream is not controlled by the nitrate seasonality in the groundwater in particular stream seasonality might be due to the riparian in stream in bed biological removal transformation or uptake of nitrate the sharp decrease of nitrate concentration at outlet e3 in summer along with decreased baseflow as observed in kerrien was explained by martin et al 2006 considering zones with electrical conductivity less than 3 ms m 1 as denitrifying zones they observed that the very large extent of denitrifying zone present in kerrien about 5 of catchment area with depth of 10 m beneath the soil surface into the weathered granite layer showed a significant decrease in stream nitrate concentration in summer months primarily due to reduction in shallow groundwater contribution however such a mechanism will have a significant impact on nitrate concentration and total load only when either the water flow or the nitrate concentration is very low in fact although a nitrate removal parameter rc kg ha d was incorporated in etna when applied to stream breakthroughs the value optimized came out to be very low with negligible influence on the exported nitrate loads in the etna model the concentration seasonality is also reproduced by increasing the nitrate concentration differences between the two stores and thus is also sensitive to the relative contribution of the two stores parameter f we investigated the sensitivity of hnrt on parameter f by applying a n pulse on the year with average climatic conditions 1st august 1972 and using the corresponding simulated breakthrough curves to compute hnrt for different values of f fig 8 at 1 increments at e3 both parameters f and r contribute to the seasonality of simulated breakthrough so the equifinality between the two parameters can lead to an overestimation of f value that is causing an underestimate of the groundwater nitrate transit time when applied to the e3 outlet on the other hand when applied to the piezometers etna cannot reproduce the seasonality in nitrate concentration except at downslope locations and f calibration is rather driven by the long term nitrate concentration dynamics therefore downslope piezometers free from riparian influence are likely to be the best location for estimating hnrt using the conceptual model 3 4 are the piezometers proxies of an individual store we also tried to reproduce the groundwater levels and nitrate concentration time series of each piezometer along hjl transect using a single conceptual store the physical model and the calibration techniques were the same parameter f was withdrawn the hydrological dynamics were very well reproduced using a single store whereas in nitrate breakthroughs the trend was satisfactorily captured especially in downslope piezometer l15 but not the seasonality fig 9 however the hnrt values table 4 were within 2 5 error of the hnrts calculated using the dual store setup the uncertainty analysis results dotty plots are shown in supplementary s2 in the etna model structure the hnrt is primarily influenced by the volume of the 2 passive storages vim fast vim slow and their relative contribution f intuitively a single store setup will give an hnrt very close to the dual store setup when either i f approaches 0 or 1 or ii when vim fast vim slow in piezometers what happens is close to the latter thus despite an unsatisfactory reproduction of the seasonality we got single store hnrts very close to the dual store hnrts also we observed earlier that in the hnrt vs distance from ridge graph fig 6 the extrapolation of hnrts of piezometers h15 j15 l15 to the slow store of e3 using a linear regression is possible it can thus be logically stated that the piezometers might be a good proxy for the slow store which strengthens our hypothesis proposed in section 3 2 3 5 independent estimation of nitrate velocity the grassland destruction event on the adjacent meadow caused a large increase in the nitrate concentration time series of f5b from 2005 to 2010 fig 10 in the downslope piezometer f4 a similar but more smeared increase was observed from 2007 to 2015 the temporal difference of the centroids of these 2 mounds is 4 2 years fig 10 and the distance between piezometers f5b and f4 fig 6 is 103 m the travel velocity of nitrate along the f5b f4 transect is thus 24 52 m year fig 10 despite being unable to determine the loading at the location of the f transect with acceptable uncertainty the ploughing and consequent nitrate mineralization allowed us to determine the order of magnitude of the advective velocity of nitrate which is close to the solute velocity along the h15 j15 l15 e3 flowpath estimated with the model 21 m year this supports the hypothesis that piezometers behave like the proxy to a single store and using etna with one store allows to reasonably estimate the residence times this also suggests that the slow store hnrt at the outlet e3 is accurately representing the transit time in the two monitored hillslopes 3 6 insights into the anatomy of the catchment and proposal of future work the question of the effect of the calibration of the fast store on the average hnrt estimated at the outlet can lead us to 2 contradicting hypotheses in essentially every groundwater system that has received a detailed investigation there exist hydrologically significant heterogeneities within the soil matrix salamon et al 2007 zhang and benson 2008 bianchi et al 2011 fractures with high degree of connectivity markovich et al 2019 walter et al 2019 taucare et al 2020 macro pores remaining from decaying roots etc that result in very fast transport of water and solutes it is not hard to imagine that similar heterogeneities exist in this system and the data and model results support the idea that they do in essence the model is conceptually a dual permeability model but where to put he frac ure or macropore permeability and how to accurately parameterize it is a complex problem that likely requires more data and modelling another possibility is that the calibration of the fast store at the outlet is majorly impacted by instream processes see section 3 3 in which case hnrt at outlet is largely underestimated further experiments and analyses are thus needed to arrive to a definite conclusion 4 conclusion in this study we compared the nitrate transit time estimated using conceptual modelling applied to piezometers and the stream outlet our conceptual model was able to reproduce the long term nitrate breakthrough behaviors of all piezometers chosen for our analysis reasonably capturing their interannual variations the transit times estimated from the piezometers were larger than the stream outlet which is counterintuitive we hypothesized that one possible reason might be the misleading sharp seasonality of the stream nitrate concentration time series due to biological activities which are largely overestimating the contribution of the faster store of etna and in turn underestimating the transit times however we also found that the slow store hnrt at the outlet e3 is accurately representing the nitrate travel velocities and transit times in the two monitored hillslopes indicating that piezometers are a good proxy of one of the stores of etna thus the transit time estimated from the stream nitrate concentration is not erroneous but is perhaps getting affected by nitrate signals coming from some faster travel route in some other hillslope or the lowland not captured by our measurements more experiments are needed to verify this nevertheless parsimonious modelling exercises using the long term time series of a downslope piezometer free from riparian influence thus might be a good candidate to constrain nitrate travel time problem in semi arid catchments especially when the streams are ephemeral or dry credit authorship contribution statement baibaswata bhaduri
