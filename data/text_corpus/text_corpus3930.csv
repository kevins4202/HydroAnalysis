19650,increasing attention has been paid to the anammox community for its significant function in high efficiency wastewater treatment however bacterial interaction in terms of bacterial communication is still elusive this study firstly explored the intra and interspecific communication of bacteria in the anammox community using metagenomic sequence data obtained during bioreactor operation we verified the existence of multiple bacterial communication gene bcg subtypes by alignment with the constructed bcg database containing 11 identified gene subtypes bacterial communication was more active at the initial start up than in the high loading rate phase and was correlated with the gradually decreasing bacterial diversity hdts one of the key genes that produced the intraspecific signaling molecule ahl and rpff the key gene that produced the intra and interspecific signaling molecule dsf were the primary communication engines in the anammox community because of their high abundance anammox bacteria mainly used hdts genes to communicate with others while rpff gene played a core role characterized by their multiple correlations with other bcg subtypes interestingly bacteria with abundant bcgs were more inclined to interact with the bacteria with the same functional traits indicating the potential communication related interaction among these bacteria in addition to the frequently reported substrate co utilization this highlights the primary importance of ahl and dsf for the anammox community and thereby hints at a potential strategy for the target regulation of the signals to improve anammox viability and competitive capacity in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox bacterial communication metagenomics quorum sensing nitrogen removal 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidization anammox with nitrite to nitrogen gas has resulted in a great deal of attention as a promising process for wastewater treatment because of its high efficiency low cost and environmentally friendly advantages compared with the traditional nitrification and denitrification process strous et al 1997 lackner et al 2014 the responsible anammox bacteria belonging to the phylum planctomycetes have many characteristics for instance they are difficult to isolate using traditional cultivation methods and cannot be active until the cell density is higher than 1010 1011 cells ml 1 strous et al 1997 kartal et al 2012 therefore researchers have focused on the community structure bacterial shifts and core community members of the anammox consortia rather than individual anammox bacteria gilbert et al 2014 guo et al 2016 in particular during the long term start up period there are clear community shifts from diverse to stable variations in anammox bacteria and spatial heterogeneity in the functional bacteria regardless of the type of seed sludge paddy soil denitrification sludge and nitrification sludge and the operational conditions low temperature high salt chen et al 2016 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 furthermore the cooperation of bacteria in the anammox community has also been reported relative to substrate co utilization and micro environment paragenesis gong et al 2007 liu et al 2015 for example ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were considered to protect anammox bacteria from possible oxygen leakage liu et al 2008 guo et al 2016 alcohols and short chain volatile fatty acids vfas could be produced by fermentative bacteria from bacterial debris and eps in the community and then metabolized by heterotrophic denitrifiers tang et al 2013 hou et al 2017 even so further information is needed regarding the coexistence and potential interaction among these bacteria in the anammox community among these bacterial interactions bacterial communication is one of the most interesting phenomena hartmann et al 2014 papenfort and bassler 2016 the bacteria use bacterial communication signal molecules to regulate various behaviors of the entire community and the regulations are generally beneficial to the whole community and improve microbial survival under some conditions waters and bassler 2005 goo et al 2015 more interestingly the signal molecules for bacterial communication are various and specifically recognized by different bacteria dang and lovell 2016 generally the signal molecules can be divided into intra and interspecific signals such as the intraspecific signal acyl homoserine lactone ahl interspecific signal autoinducer 2 ai 2 and intra and interspecific signal diffusible signal factor dsf feng et al 2014 contrary to bacterial communication communication interference is also found which could occur because of degradation of the signal molecules uroz et al 2009 recently the focus of studies gradually has transferred from single signal to multiple signals in bacteria the existence of four intraspecific signal molecules in the bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed lee and zhang 2015 the identification of six kinds of intraspecific signal molecules in aerobic granules also indicated complex bacterial communication in the multi species communities tan et al 2014 furthermore different roles and correlations among multiple signal molecules have also been observed the signal molecule comx was the most important participant in multiple bacterial communication systems and the key factor controlling competence in streptococcus pneumoniae kaspar et al 2015 the signals ahl and ai 2 in vibrio harveyi coupled to regulate biofilm formation and their complex feedback loops papenfort and bassler 2016 however most of the studies on the identification of bacterial communication are explored in single bacterial strains and rarely in the multi species community in the anammox community containing multi species there might be various bacterial communication systems the identification and positive effects of the ahl and bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp signal molecules in the anammox community have been affirmed tang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 therefore the question is how the bacteria communicate via these signals in the anammox community especially during the reactor start up process exploring this question may provide new ideas for the better understanding of bacterial interactions in the anammox community herein we started up an anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr to reveal variations in bacterial communication during the start up period five samples were taken in time series for metagenomic analysis the alignment of metagenomic data with the bacterial communication gene bcg database taxonomic origin analysis of bcgs and correlation analysis of bcgs were performed to investigate the diversity and variation in bcgs in the anammox community the results offer deeper insights into multiple bacterial communication in the anammox community during the reactor start up process and hint at potential strategies to strengthen bacterial communication to achieve a quick anammox reactor start up by applying exogenous signals 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor operation an sbr seeded with anammox culture in the form of flocs hou et al 2015 at a biomass concentration of 0 94 gvss l 1 was operated at 37 c for 280 days the bioreactor had a final working volume of 3 l with a magnetic stirrer at a stirring speed of 150 rpm the anammox culture was fed with synthetic wastewater van de graaf et al 1996 the feeding was purged with n2 co2 95 5 to remove dissolved oxygen and the ph was maintained at 6 8 7 0 the bioreactor operational cycle involved 35 min for settling 5 min for discharging and 20 min for feeding when the effluent nitrite was below 10 mg l 1 the concentration of nh4 n and no2 n in the influent were gradually increased from 50 to 300 mg l 1 and the hydraulic retention time hrt was progressively shortened from 4 days to 0 75 days to obtain the maximal nitrogen removal rate bioreactor performance was monitored every two days by measuring the concentration of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and total nitrogen in the influent and effluent which were determined according to the american public health association apha 1998 standard method biomass samples were collected at days 0 106 166 218 and 280 and were named as r1 r2 r3 r4 and r5 respectively the biomass was centrifugated 5 min 9000 g 4 c and stored at 20 c the dna extraction and metagenome sequencing were conducted as described in the supplemental materials and methods metaphlan was used to conduct the taxonomic classification and quantification of the relative abundance of bacterial genera in the anammox community by mapping metagenomic reads against a catalog of clade specific marker sequences li et al 2015 the most abundant genera of bacteria relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples were selected to visualize using a heatmap 2 2 database construction the procedure for construction of the bcg database is summarized in fig s1 to explore the bacterial communication in anammox culture 11 identified proteins related to intra and interspecific bacterial communication were selected gonzalez and keshavan 2006 degradation enzymes of the signal molecules cholera autoinducer 1 cai 1 and dsf are absent from the database because of the lack of related studies additionally the universal bacterial secondary messenger c di gmp was selected because it related to bacterial communication the details of the database are described in text s1 to achieve a maximal phylogenetic coverage for each subtype database we retrieved all available bacterial sequences from non redundant nr 9 june 2016 database using the ncbi search tool each subtype database was examined to obtain a clean version of the bcg database by discarding redundant and partial sequences fang et al 2014 sequences clustered at a 97 similarity were defined as non redundant sequences yang et al 2016 each redundant group was manually inspected 2 3 screening for bcgs in anammox culture the detection of bcgs from the metagenomic sequencing data of five samples was conducted by sequence homology alignments using the blastx algorithm with an e value 1 10 5 if the best hit of a bcg read had 50 sequence identity and the alignment length was 25 amino acids the read was annotated as a bcg like read doberva et al 2015 romero et al 2012 to avoid bias the abundance of a specific bcg subtype was calculated by normalizing the bcg reference sequence length therefore the abundance of the bcg subtype was calculated using the following equation abundance rpkm 1 n n m a p p e d r e a d s 150 l b c g r e f e r e n c e s e q u e n c e n m e t a 10 ˆ 6 where nmapped reads is the number of the reads in the metagenomic data that mapped to the bcg like sequence lbcg reference sequences is the sequence length of the corresponding specific bcg reference sequence n is the number of bcg like reads belonging to the same bcg subtype 150 is the sequence length of the illumina reads and nmeta is the number of the metagenomic sequence data 10 million 2 4 taxonomic annotation to identify the bacterial hosts of the bcgs like reads all of the aligned reads were searched against the ncbi nr database using blastx version 2 4 0 the top 10 hits with e values 1 10 5 were imported to megan metagenome analyzer version 6 megan was used to explore the taxonomical origin of the dataset employing ncbi taxonomy nov 2016 to summarize the results the lowest common ancestor lca parameters were set at a min score of 50 top percent of 10 0 and min support of 0 01 huson and weber 2013 potentially missed assignments were manually corrected reads were only classified at the genus level to ensure accuracy the taxonomic genera for each bcg subtype are shown in table s1 the abundance of each bcg subtype carried by different genera of bacteria was then calculated the most abundant taxonomic groups in each bcg subtype relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples were selected and further visualized using a heatmap 2 5 statistical analysis and network analysis to analyze the association between each bcg subtype spearman s correlation coefficients were calculated and visualized by heatmap a p value 0 01 was considered significant to visualize the significant correlations between the bcg subtypes the network was conducted by the interactive platform gephi bastian et al 2009 another network involving the interaction of bcg subtypes and the selected genera of bacteria in section 2 4 the most abundant taxonomic groups in each bcg subtype was also illustrated by the method in the supplemental information other parameters including average node connectivity diameter and average path length were also calculated statistical analysis was performed using the software r www r project org with the hmisc packages for the visualization of the correlations of microbial taxa all pairwise spearman s rank correlations between the most abundant genera relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples were calculated spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ for all pairs among these genera focused on strong correlations with ρ 0 9 and the p value 0 05 the robust pairwise correlations of these genera formed their co occurrence networks network construction was similarly performed in gephi bastian et al 2009 to examine the relationship between bacterial communication nrr or microbial diversity spearman s correlation coefficients were calculated a p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results 3 1 varied nitrogen removal performance and microbiota during the reactor operation during the 280 days operation the total nitrogen removal rate increased from 3 to 517 mgn l 1 day 1 fig 1 a the period of reactor operation was divided into two phases according to the nitrogen removal performance the initial start up phase phase i days 0 108 and the high loading rate phase phase ii days 108 280 during phase i the reactor performance showed a low nitrogen removal rate with an average value of only 24 mgn l 1 d 1 figs 1a and s2 during phase ii the nitrogen loading rate was increased by shortening hrt and increasing influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations fig s2 thereby the rapidly increased nitrogen removal rate from 116 to 517 mgn l 1 day 1 during phase ii was realized fig 1a in general there was an obvious discrepancy in the nitrogen removal performance during the two operational phases to get a snapshot of the overall microbial community in the anammox reactor taxonomic assignments of the five samples were conducted forty one genera of bacteria with high abundance relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples are illustrated in fig 1b the anammox bacteria candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia continued to increase during the reactor operation 1 9 25 4 and 0 4 5 respectively which was consistent with the improved nitrogen removal rate furthermore the change trends in the abundance of other bacteria varied some bacteria showed decreasing trends during phase i and remained at a low but stable abundance during phase ii such as rhodanobacter streptomyces bradyrhizobium mesorhizobium and bacillus meanwhile nitrosomonas and nitrospira increased during phase i and then decreased during phase ii from the perspective of the whole community composition the diversity index shannon index slightly decreased from 7 8 r1 to 7 5 r2 during phase i the diversity index of the anammox community during phase ii was obviously lower than that during phase i and remained stable at approximately 6 3 6 5 table s2 3 2 profile and change trends of bcgs in the anammox community to study the role of bacterial communication in the start up of the anammox reactor the bcg database comprising 11 bcg subtypes and 6628 non redundant amino acid sequences was built table 1 by sequence homology alignments the multiple and varied bacterial communications in the anammox culture during the reactor start up period were then confirmed fig 2 almost all the bcg subtypes were found in the anammox culture in addition to luxm genes the abundance of the different bcg subtypes in the five samples varied greatly from 6 3 10 3 rpkm cqsa genes in r3 to 3 4 rpkm dgc genes in r5 the average abundances of intra and interspecific signal synthesis genes in the five samples were cqsa 7 3 10 3 rpkm luxs 2 4 10 2 rpkm luxi 3 2 10 2 rpkm rpff 4 1 10 2 rpkm and hdts 7 0 10 2 rpkm respectively implying hdts and rpff genes were mainly responsible for bacterial communication in the anammox community because of their high abundance interestingly the abundances of the signal molecule degradation genes were higher than the synthesis genes the lactonase and acylase genes had the highest average abundances with values of 2 9 10 1 and 1 4 10 2 rpkm respectively the lsrg genes followed closely with an average abundance of 1 6 10 1 rpkm in addition the synthesis and degradation genes of the second messenger c di gmp dgc and pde genes for the intracellular signal conduction were the most abundant among all the bcg subtypes with average abundances of 2 9 and 1 6 rpkm respectively because of their because of their wide existence in the bacterial genera from the perspective of reactor operation the gene abundances for intra and interspecific signal molecule synthesis and degradation during phase i decreased sharply and then remained stable during phase ii except for cqsa and hdts genes for example the abundance of luxi genes decreased from 7 1 10 2 to 4 1 10 2 rpkm r1 to r2 during phase i and then remained stable at approximately 1 5 10 2 rpkm during phase ii r3 r5 unlike these bcg subtypes the abundance of cqsa and hdts genes decreased during phase i hdts 8 0 10 2 to 6 1 10 2 rpkm cqsa 8 5 10 3 to 6 8 10 3 rpkm and obviously increased during phase ii hdts 5 7 10 2 to 9 0 10 2 rpkm cqsa 6 3 10 2 to 8 6 10 2 rpkm in addition the synthesizing and degrading genes of the second messenger c di gmp dgc and pde genes exhibited an obvious increasing trend during reactor operation fig 1a when taking the relationship between bcg subtypes and reactor performance or microbial diversity into consideration there was no significant correlation between most bcg subtypes in the whole community and the nrr p value 0 05 whereas most bcg subtypes of the whole community were positively correlated with the microbial diversity ρ 0 8 p value 0 05 table s3 all the pairwise correlations between bcg subtypes were determined using spearman s correlation coefficients fig 3 the significant correlations between bcg subtypes could be visualized by the network that distinctly exhibited the complex correlations rpff genes had positive correlations with lactonase lsrg luxi and luxs genes and were located in the center of the network interestingly the abundances of signal molecule synthesis genes were strongly and positively correlated with those of the degradation genes such as the dgc and pde genes ρ 0 98 luxi and lactonase genes ρ 0 99 as well as luxs and lsrg genes ρ 0 98 in other words whether they were inter or intraspecific signal molecules or secondary messengers there were balances between the synthesis and degradation of signal molecules in the anammox community 3 3 taxonomic origins analysis of the bcg subtypes the taxonomic origins of the bcg subtypes in the five samples were studied to determine the changes in the abundance of each bcg subtype nearly all the bacteria acted as hosts of bcg subtypes table s1 the taxonomic groups with relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples in each bcg subtype are illustrated in fig 4 the 15 genera of bacteria obtained with high abundance of bcgs were mainly responsible for nitrogen removals such as anammox bacteria candidatus jettenia candidatus kuenenia aob nitrosomonas and nob nitrospira and autotrophic denitrifiers such as rhodanobacter and especially heterotrophic denitrifiers in addition some other bacteria such as fimbriimonas were also found to have highly abundant bcgs although the function of these bacteria in the anammox community is still unclear for the synthesis genes luxi genes were mainly found in the aob and heterotrophic denitrifiers nearly all 15 genera of bacteria carried hdts gene for ahl synthesis besides some bacteria like nitrospira and rhodanobacter it was noteworthy that candidatus jettenia was the main carrier for hdts genes the abundance of hdts genes carried by candidatus jettenia increased from 1 2 10 4 to 1 0 10 3 rpkm which was positively correlated with the nrr ρ 0 9 p value 0 05 but negatively correlated with microbial diversity ρ 0 9 p value 0 05 table s3 however there were few bacteria carrying luxs for interspecific signal ai 2 synthesis and cqsa genes for intraspecific signal cai 1 production in the anammox community another abundant signal synthesis gene rpff for dsf production extensively existed in the 15 genera of bacteria and was mainly found in the heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers for the degradation genes acylase genes were found in most bacteria including anammox bacteria and a few heterotrophic denitrifiers lactonase genes also widely existed except in fimbriimonas it was notable that lactonase instead of acylase genes for ahl degradation were carried by anammox bacteria furthermore lsrg genes were mainly found in aob and some heterotrophic denitrifiers the degradation and synthesis genes of c di gmp could be carried by all the selected genera the co occurrence patterns of the bcg subtypes and the 15 genera of bacteria with highly abundant bcgs were used for network analysis to explore the main bacteria that contributed to the variation in the abundance of the bcg subtypes fig s3 there were two tight connections i the connection of dgc pde candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia ii the highly connected structure of most bcg subtypes and heterotrophic denitrifiers the abundance of the bcg subtype was more likely to be influenced by the bacterial abundance within the connection the abundance of hdts cqsa dgc and pde genes were mainly affected by the abundance of anammox bacteria because of their close relationship in the network similarly the abundance of most other bcg subtypes changed with heterotrophic denitrifiers 3 4 bacterial communication in the anammox community for interactions the potential interaction between the two genera of bacteria was defined when forming a co occurrence pattern faust et al 2012 the co occurrence patterns among the 41 genera of bacteria with high abundance in the anammox community using network inference were based on strong ρ 0 9 and significant p value 0 01 correlations overall the more edges that a node had the more the potential bacterial interactions that the bacteria the node owned specifically all 15 genera of bacteria carrying highly abundant bcgs genera selected in section 3 3 were included in these 41 genera of bacteria and marked as red nodes in the network fig 5 a furthermore the 41 genera of bacteria were classified into seven groups according to their ecological function anammox bacteria aob or nob autotrophic denitrifiers heterotrophic denitrifiers photoheterotrophic bacteria fermentative bacteria and unclassified bacteria table s4 the potential interactions between bacteria within each group thick curving lines and between the groups thin straight lines are shown in fig 5b there were many bacterial interactions between the bacteria with abundant bcgs large nodes with bold font however bacteria without abundant bcgs small nodes with normal font had fewer interactions within the same ecological functional group for example in the heterotrophic denitrifiers group the bacteria with abundant bcgs mesorhizobium bradyrhizobium hyphomicrobium mycobacterium rhodococcus and streptomyces had many interactions with each other whereas the interactions between the bacteria without abundant bcgs burkholderia pseudomonas and rudaea were few the bacterial interactions within the fermentation group bacteria without abundant bcgs basically did not exist when the bacteria had abundant bcgs large nodes with bold font the differences in the potential interactions between the bacteria in the same functional group and different functional groups were also considered there were many bacterial interactions between the bacteria with highly abundant bcgs within the same groups thick curving lines fig 5b whereas fewer bacterial interactions occurred between bacteria from different groups thin straight line fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 co occurrence of multiple bacterial communication in the anammox community overall the bacterial communication in the anammox reactor during the start up period was various and complex this is the first study to comprehensively investigate the existence of multiple key synthesis and degradation genes for bacterial communication signals based on a constructed bcg database the taxonomic origins of these genes and their correlations the signal molecule synthesis genes hdts and rpff had the highest abundance and might be the most important potential engines for bacterial communication in the anammox community the importance of hdts gene was also demonstrated by its taxonomic origins anammox bacteria based on previous studies the function of a bacterium with a bacterial communication system is mainly to regulate different bacterial behaviors in different environments for their own survival waters and bassler 2005 goo et al 2015 for example ai 2 influenced the abundance of the major phyla of the gut microbiota and helped the microbial community rebalance from the impact of antibiotics thompson et al 2015 c di gmp was involved in the regulation of extracellular polymeric substance eps for the formation of biofilms or bacterial aggregation hengge 2009 ahl influenced bacterial activity tang et al 2015 and is currently known to take part in numerous critical metabolism for adaptation to alkaline toxicity goo et al 2015 when multiple bacterial communication coexisted there were also interactions between these bacterial communications such as parallel bacterial communications competitive bacterial communications and bacterial communications arranged in series waters and bassler 2005 these interactions were used to amplify the signal input of changes in the environment or to identify specific changes in the environment allowing bacteria to more accurately regulate their own behavior or characteristics papenfort and bassler 2016 overall multiple bacterial communications enrich the way bacteria regulate the behavior of the community for an anammox community consisting of many species although our current findings did not explain how bacterial communication affected the community we could deduce that the function of multiple bacterial communication was to regulate various biochemical behaviors of the bacteria under various environmental conditions making the entire community more adaptable to environmental changes 4 2 correlation between bacterial communication and nrr bcg subtypes in the anammox community were involved in the communication of multiple bacterial species and not only in that of anammox bacteria although the nrr was likely regulated by the bacterial communication of anammox bacteria based on previous study where nrr was shown to be influenced by bacterial communication signals tang et al 2015 other bacteria in the anammox community could use the bacterial communication to regulate the other biochemical behavior rather than nitrogen removal for example in pseudomonas aeruginosa formation of biofilms which provides the organism with a good stable living environment is regulated by bacterial communication freitas et al 2011 biofilm formation might provide a stable anaerobic environment to anammox bacteria in our study heterotrophic denitrifiers had the most abundant bcgs and could use multiple bcgs but were not the main contributor to nrr therefore it was not surprising that most bcg subtypes of the whole community were not necessarily related to the nrr most bcg subtypes of the whole community were positively correlated with microbial diversity high diversity of the community generally means that there are abundant microbial members and thus there may be high levels of communication among them and vice versa therefore the diversity of the community contributed to the variation in these bcg subtypes we also found that bcg subtypes of candidatus jettenia hdts lact dgc and pde were positively correlated r 0 9 p value 0 05 with the nrr but negatively correlated with microbial diversity r 0 9 p value 0 05 for the anammox process anammox bacteria are functional bacteria that affect the nrr although bacterial communication of the whole community was not related to the nrr the nrr was likely regulated by anammox bacteria as mentioned above from the point of view of reactor operation the shortening of hrt and improvement of nitrogen concentration in the influent might have a positive effect on the bacterial communication of anammox bacteria the operation was beneficial in that it provided more substrates for anammox bacteria which was also supported by a previous study wherein bacteria produced more bacterial communication signals in the presence of a nutrient rich substrate bassler and miller 2006 many studies have shown that the microbial community shifts from complex to stable during the reactor start up period while the abundance of anammox bacteria gradually increases chen et al 2016 cao et al 2016 from a genetic point of view the variation in bcg subtypes of anammox bacteria was caused by the variation in their carrier anammox bacteria the increase in bcg subtypes of anammox bacteria is beneficial to enhance the bacterial communication the synthesis genes of bacterial communication signals in anammox bacteria were hdts and dgc genes previous studies have confirmed that ahl the products of hdts influenced the abundance of anammox bacteria tang et al 2015 and c di gmp the products of dgc regulated the formation of eps resulting in increased bacterial aggregation guo et al 2017 these studies suggested that bacterial communications were beneficial to anammox bacteria therefore the opposite correlation between microbial diversity and the bcg subtypes of anammox bacteria was reasonable 4 3 balance of bacterial communication and its interference regarding the tendency of the bcg subtype abundance one of the most interesting phenomena was the positive correlation between the abundance of signal molecule synthesis genes and degradation genes fig 3a this raised an important issue of whether bacterial communication always maintains a delicate balance in the community through the synthesis and degradation of signal molecules even though the abundance of degradation genes was higher than that of synthesis genes this may be explained by the discrepancy in the activity of the different enzymes another reason for this phenomenon may be the biological functions of the signal degradation genes the signal degradation genes not only played roles in signal degradation but also participated in other metabolic activities uroz et al 2009 studies have shown that bacteria use bacterial communication to regulate the formation of biofilms to resist environmental stress while bacterial communication interference could be a strategy to disperse an excessively thick biofilm that was not conducive to the survival of the community goo et al 2015 another example describing the role of bacterial communication and interference is the regulation of toxic factors the formation of toxic factors in some bacteria was regulated by bacterial communication dockery and keener 2001 while bacteria could survive the attack from other bacteria by communication interference li et al 2011 this showed that bacteria could use the balance of bacterial communication and interference as a strategy to survive in the community and adapt to environmental fluctuations 4 4 complex correlations between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes specially the correlations between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes were explored using the network analysis fig 4 the abundance of rpff genes was only less than that of hdts genes indicating that rpff genes were a common method of bacterial communication in the anammox community the wide existence of dsf the products of rpff genes has been reported in previous studies ryan and dow 2011 more importantly the complex correlations between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes suggested mutual influence among them although the previous studies rarely explored the correlations between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes in microbial communities some enlightenment can be obtained by studying the cultivable bacteria with multiple bacteria communication systems in the cultivable bacteria each bacterial communication system is not completely independent they may form complex interactions or act on downstream genes together for example vibrio harveyi used parallel bacterial communication circuits the signal molecules of these circuits were ahl cai 1 and ai 2 to control biofilm formation and bioluminescence waters and bassler 2005 pseudomonas aeruginosa used bacterial communication circuits arranged in series the signal molecules of these circuits were two kinds of ahls to increase adhesion biofilm formation and virulence factor expression lee and zhang 2015 therefore there is the potential for mutual interactions between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes in the anammox community but the mechanism still needs to be explored further it is important to note that some bacterial communication systems are likely to have mutual influences the product of rpff genes dsf which is both an intra and interspecific signal molecule is different from other signal molecules therefore dsf acts as a universal signal among the complex correlations in the anammox community rpff genes were first found to have the most correlations with other bcg subtypes this suggested that rpff genes may play an important role in multiple bacterial communication and are key to deciphering the bacterial communication occurring in the whole community 4 5 bacterial interaction in the same ecological functional group mediated by bacterial communication bacteria with abundant bcgs had close interactions which indicated the possibility for bacterial communication to be involved in bacterial interactions fig 5a deduced from the classification of the most abundant 41 genera according to ecological function fig 5b bacteria having the same function with abundant bcgs interacted more than those without abundant bcgs this indicated that bacteria with abundant bcgs may have more bacterial interactions therefore the assumption that bacterial communication affected bacterial interactions among the same functional bacteria was reasonable additionally for bacteria with abundant bcgs the difference in interactions between bacteria within each group and between groups suggested that bacterial interactions most likely occurred with in the same functional bacteria fig 5b the use of bacterial communication systems for bacterial interaction may only occur between the same functional bacteria this also emphasized the potential influence of bacterial communication in bacterial interactions among the same functional bacteria bacterial communication which is one of the factors demonstrating that bacterial interactions occur kolenbrander et al 2002 is likely to mediate bacterial interaction among the same functional bacteria moreover there were also bacterial interactions among the different genera of bacteria with abundant bcgs except for rpff and luxs genes such as candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia this phenomenon may occur because signal molecules synthesized by candidatus jettenia could be identified by candidatus kuenenia the latter used this signal molecule to regulate a series of metabolic processes this was also supported by previous studies demonstrating that the addition of bacteria with the ability to synthesize ahl influenced the microbial community of granular activated sludge ding et al 2015 overall bacteria were likely to use bcgs to communicate with other bacteria within the same functional group leading to interactions and mutual influence among these bacteria anammox bacteria candidate jettenia used the hdts genes to communicate with intraspecific bacteria and used lactonase genes to interfere with communication because the activity of the anammox culture has been shown to be under the influence of bacterial communication tang et al 2015 anammox could use bacterial communication to regulate its activity during the reactor start up period to maintain its competitiveness and viability although previous studies only identified the ahl synthase in nitrosomonas this study confirmed that nitrosomonas used various bcgs for intra or interspecific communication nitrosomonas and nitrospira could communicate under the influence of luxs genes which was not reported previously and is very useful in the elucidation of the nitrifying process for wastewater treatment moreover heterotrophic denitrifiers had the most abundant bcgs and could use multiple bcgs mainly rpff genes to interact with the same functional bacteria which is beneficial for increased survival and competitiveness in wastewater treatment by coping with different harsh conditions because the ahl synthase of hdts type was carried by anammox bacteria and was important for nitrogen removal performance a new approach for quick start up of the anammox reactor and improvement of the competition of anammox bacteria could be offered that is genetically engineered bacteria carrying hdts type genes of anammox bacteria could be constructed for dosing the engineered bacteria in the reactor to enhance nitrogen removal performance rpff played a core role characterized by their multiple correlations with other bcg subtypes thus genetically engineered bacteria carrying rpff type genes could also be applied additionally the stability of the genetically engineered bacteria the way these bacteria dosing in the reactor and strategies of reactor operation should be explored further 5 conclusion in this study multiple bacterial communications and their interweaved correlations were studied in the anammox community during bioreactor start up bacterial communication was more active in the initial start up than the high loading rate phase correlated with the gradually decreasing bacterial diversity among the 11 selected gene subtypes hdts and rpff genes were verified to be important for communication signal production while rpff genes related to both intra and interspecies signaling molecules had the most correlations with other bcg subtypes the balance of bacteria communication and its interference was also confirmed in addition bacteria with highly abundant bcgs were more inclined to interact with other bacteria within the same

19650,increasing attention has been paid to the anammox community for its significant function in high efficiency wastewater treatment however bacterial interaction in terms of bacterial communication is still elusive this study firstly explored the intra and interspecific communication of bacteria in the anammox community using metagenomic sequence data obtained during bioreactor operation we verified the existence of multiple bacterial communication gene bcg subtypes by alignment with the constructed bcg database containing 11 identified gene subtypes bacterial communication was more active at the initial start up than in the high loading rate phase and was correlated with the gradually decreasing bacterial diversity hdts one of the key genes that produced the intraspecific signaling molecule ahl and rpff the key gene that produced the intra and interspecific signaling molecule dsf were the primary communication engines in the anammox community because of their high abundance anammox bacteria mainly used hdts genes to communicate with others while rpff gene played a core role characterized by their multiple correlations with other bcg subtypes interestingly bacteria with abundant bcgs were more inclined to interact with the bacteria with the same functional traits indicating the potential communication related interaction among these bacteria in addition to the frequently reported substrate co utilization this highlights the primary importance of ahl and dsf for the anammox community and thereby hints at a potential strategy for the target regulation of the signals to improve anammox viability and competitive capacity in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox bacterial communication metagenomics quorum sensing nitrogen removal 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidization anammox with nitrite to nitrogen gas has resulted in a great deal of attention as a promising process for wastewater treatment because of its high efficiency low cost and environmentally friendly advantages compared with the traditional nitrification and denitrification process strous et al 1997 lackner et al 2014 the responsible anammox bacteria belonging to the phylum planctomycetes have many characteristics for instance they are difficult to isolate using traditional cultivation methods and cannot be active until the cell density is higher than 1010 1011 cells ml 1 strous et al 1997 kartal et al 2012 therefore researchers have focused on the community structure bacterial shifts and core community members of the anammox consortia rather than individual anammox bacteria gilbert et al 2014 guo et al 2016 in particular during the long term start up period there are clear community shifts from diverse to stable variations in anammox bacteria and spatial heterogeneity in the functional bacteria regardless of the type of seed sludge paddy soil denitrification sludge and nitrification sludge and the operational conditions low temperature high salt chen et al 2016 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 furthermore the cooperation of bacteria in the anammox community has also been reported relative to substrate co utilization and micro environment paragenesis gong et al 2007 liu et al 2015 for example ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were considered to protect anammox bacteria from possible oxygen leakage liu et al 2008 guo et al 2016 alcohols and short chain volatile fatty acids vfas could be produced by fermentative bacteria from bacterial debris and eps in the community and then metabolized by heterotrophic denitrifiers tang et al 2013 hou et al 2017 even so further information is needed regarding the coexistence and potential interaction among these bacteria in the anammox community among these bacterial interactions bacterial communication is one of the most interesting phenomena hartmann et al 2014 papenfort and bassler 2016 the bacteria use bacterial communication signal molecules to regulate various behaviors of the entire community and the regulations are generally beneficial to the whole community and improve microbial survival under some conditions waters and bassler 2005 goo et al 2015 more interestingly the signal molecules for bacterial communication are various and specifically recognized by different bacteria dang and lovell 2016 generally the signal molecules can be divided into intra and interspecific signals such as the intraspecific signal acyl homoserine lactone ahl interspecific signal autoinducer 2 ai 2 and intra and interspecific signal diffusible signal factor dsf feng et al 2014 contrary to bacterial communication communication interference is also found which could occur because of degradation of the signal molecules uroz et al 2009 recently the focus of studies gradually has transferred from single signal to multiple signals in bacteria the existence of four intraspecific signal molecules in the bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa was confirmed lee and zhang 2015 the identification of six kinds of intraspecific signal molecules in aerobic granules also indicated complex bacterial communication in the multi species communities tan et al 2014 furthermore different roles and correlations among multiple signal molecules have also been observed the signal molecule comx was the most important participant in multiple bacterial communication systems and the key factor controlling competence in streptococcus pneumoniae kaspar et al 2015 the signals ahl and ai 2 in vibrio harveyi coupled to regulate biofilm formation and their complex feedback loops papenfort and bassler 2016 however most of the studies on the identification of bacterial communication are explored in single bacterial strains and rarely in the multi species community in the anammox community containing multi species there might be various bacterial communication systems the identification and positive effects of the ahl and bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp signal molecules in the anammox community have been affirmed tang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 therefore the question is how the bacteria communicate via these signals in the anammox community especially during the reactor start up process exploring this question may provide new ideas for the better understanding of bacterial interactions in the anammox community herein we started up an anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr to reveal variations in bacterial communication during the start up period five samples were taken in time series for metagenomic analysis the alignment of metagenomic data with the bacterial communication gene bcg database taxonomic origin analysis of bcgs and correlation analysis of bcgs were performed to investigate the diversity and variation in bcgs in the anammox community the results offer deeper insights into multiple bacterial communication in the anammox community during the reactor start up process and hint at potential strategies to strengthen bacterial communication to achieve a quick anammox reactor start up by applying exogenous signals 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor operation an sbr seeded with anammox culture in the form of flocs hou et al 2015 at a biomass concentration of 0 94 gvss l 1 was operated at 37 c for 280 days the bioreactor had a final working volume of 3 l with a magnetic stirrer at a stirring speed of 150 rpm the anammox culture was fed with synthetic wastewater van de graaf et al 1996 the feeding was purged with n2 co2 95 5 to remove dissolved oxygen and the ph was maintained at 6 8 7 0 the bioreactor operational cycle involved 35 min for settling 5 min for discharging and 20 min for feeding when the effluent nitrite was below 10 mg l 1 the concentration of nh4 n and no2 n in the influent were gradually increased from 50 to 300 mg l 1 and the hydraulic retention time hrt was progressively shortened from 4 days to 0 75 days to obtain the maximal nitrogen removal rate bioreactor performance was monitored every two days by measuring the concentration of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and total nitrogen in the influent and effluent which were determined according to the american public health association apha 1998 standard method biomass samples were collected at days 0 106 166 218 and 280 and were named as r1 r2 r3 r4 and r5 respectively the biomass was centrifugated 5 min 9000 g 4 c and stored at 20 c the dna extraction and metagenome sequencing were conducted as described in the supplemental materials and methods metaphlan was used to conduct the taxonomic classification and quantification of the relative abundance of bacterial genera in the anammox community by mapping metagenomic reads against a catalog of clade specific marker sequences li et al 2015 the most abundant genera of bacteria relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples were selected to visualize using a heatmap 2 2 database construction the procedure for construction of the bcg database is summarized in fig s1 to explore the bacterial communication in anammox culture 11 identified proteins related to intra and interspecific bacterial communication were selected gonzalez and keshavan 2006 degradation enzymes of the signal molecules cholera autoinducer 1 cai 1 and dsf are absent from the database because of the lack of related studies additionally the universal bacterial secondary messenger c di gmp was selected because it related to bacterial communication the details of the database are described in text s1 to achieve a maximal phylogenetic coverage for each subtype database we retrieved all available bacterial sequences from non redundant nr 9 june 2016 database using the ncbi search tool each subtype database was examined to obtain a clean version of the bcg database by discarding redundant and partial sequences fang et al 2014 sequences clustered at a 97 similarity were defined as non redundant sequences yang et al 2016 each redundant group was manually inspected 2 3 screening for bcgs in anammox culture the detection of bcgs from the metagenomic sequencing data of five samples was conducted by sequence homology alignments using the blastx algorithm with an e value 1 10 5 if the best hit of a bcg read had 50 sequence identity and the alignment length was 25 amino acids the read was annotated as a bcg like read doberva et al 2015 romero et al 2012 to avoid bias the abundance of a specific bcg subtype was calculated by normalizing the bcg reference sequence length therefore the abundance of the bcg subtype was calculated using the following equation abundance rpkm 1 n n m a p p e d r e a d s 150 l b c g r e f e r e n c e s e q u e n c e n m e t a 10 ˆ 6 where nmapped reads is the number of the reads in the metagenomic data that mapped to the bcg like sequence lbcg reference sequences is the sequence length of the corresponding specific bcg reference sequence n is the number of bcg like reads belonging to the same bcg subtype 150 is the sequence length of the illumina reads and nmeta is the number of the metagenomic sequence data 10 million 2 4 taxonomic annotation to identify the bacterial hosts of the bcgs like reads all of the aligned reads were searched against the ncbi nr database using blastx version 2 4 0 the top 10 hits with e values 1 10 5 were imported to megan metagenome analyzer version 6 megan was used to explore the taxonomical origin of the dataset employing ncbi taxonomy nov 2016 to summarize the results the lowest common ancestor lca parameters were set at a min score of 50 top percent of 10 0 and min support of 0 01 huson and weber 2013 potentially missed assignments were manually corrected reads were only classified at the genus level to ensure accuracy the taxonomic genera for each bcg subtype are shown in table s1 the abundance of each bcg subtype carried by different genera of bacteria was then calculated the most abundant taxonomic groups in each bcg subtype relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples were selected and further visualized using a heatmap 2 5 statistical analysis and network analysis to analyze the association between each bcg subtype spearman s correlation coefficients were calculated and visualized by heatmap a p value 0 01 was considered significant to visualize the significant correlations between the bcg subtypes the network was conducted by the interactive platform gephi bastian et al 2009 another network involving the interaction of bcg subtypes and the selected genera of bacteria in section 2 4 the most abundant taxonomic groups in each bcg subtype was also illustrated by the method in the supplemental information other parameters including average node connectivity diameter and average path length were also calculated statistical analysis was performed using the software r www r project org with the hmisc packages for the visualization of the correlations of microbial taxa all pairwise spearman s rank correlations between the most abundant genera relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples were calculated spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ for all pairs among these genera focused on strong correlations with ρ 0 9 and the p value 0 05 the robust pairwise correlations of these genera formed their co occurrence networks network construction was similarly performed in gephi bastian et al 2009 to examine the relationship between bacterial communication nrr or microbial diversity spearman s correlation coefficients were calculated a p value 0 05 was considered significant 3 results 3 1 varied nitrogen removal performance and microbiota during the reactor operation during the 280 days operation the total nitrogen removal rate increased from 3 to 517 mgn l 1 day 1 fig 1 a the period of reactor operation was divided into two phases according to the nitrogen removal performance the initial start up phase phase i days 0 108 and the high loading rate phase phase ii days 108 280 during phase i the reactor performance showed a low nitrogen removal rate with an average value of only 24 mgn l 1 d 1 figs 1a and s2 during phase ii the nitrogen loading rate was increased by shortening hrt and increasing influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations fig s2 thereby the rapidly increased nitrogen removal rate from 116 to 517 mgn l 1 day 1 during phase ii was realized fig 1a in general there was an obvious discrepancy in the nitrogen removal performance during the two operational phases to get a snapshot of the overall microbial community in the anammox reactor taxonomic assignments of the five samples were conducted forty one genera of bacteria with high abundance relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples are illustrated in fig 1b the anammox bacteria candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia continued to increase during the reactor operation 1 9 25 4 and 0 4 5 respectively which was consistent with the improved nitrogen removal rate furthermore the change trends in the abundance of other bacteria varied some bacteria showed decreasing trends during phase i and remained at a low but stable abundance during phase ii such as rhodanobacter streptomyces bradyrhizobium mesorhizobium and bacillus meanwhile nitrosomonas and nitrospira increased during phase i and then decreased during phase ii from the perspective of the whole community composition the diversity index shannon index slightly decreased from 7 8 r1 to 7 5 r2 during phase i the diversity index of the anammox community during phase ii was obviously lower than that during phase i and remained stable at approximately 6 3 6 5 table s2 3 2 profile and change trends of bcgs in the anammox community to study the role of bacterial communication in the start up of the anammox reactor the bcg database comprising 11 bcg subtypes and 6628 non redundant amino acid sequences was built table 1 by sequence homology alignments the multiple and varied bacterial communications in the anammox culture during the reactor start up period were then confirmed fig 2 almost all the bcg subtypes were found in the anammox culture in addition to luxm genes the abundance of the different bcg subtypes in the five samples varied greatly from 6 3 10 3 rpkm cqsa genes in r3 to 3 4 rpkm dgc genes in r5 the average abundances of intra and interspecific signal synthesis genes in the five samples were cqsa 7 3 10 3 rpkm luxs 2 4 10 2 rpkm luxi 3 2 10 2 rpkm rpff 4 1 10 2 rpkm and hdts 7 0 10 2 rpkm respectively implying hdts and rpff genes were mainly responsible for bacterial communication in the anammox community because of their high abundance interestingly the abundances of the signal molecule degradation genes were higher than the synthesis genes the lactonase and acylase genes had the highest average abundances with values of 2 9 10 1 and 1 4 10 2 rpkm respectively the lsrg genes followed closely with an average abundance of 1 6 10 1 rpkm in addition the synthesis and degradation genes of the second messenger c di gmp dgc and pde genes for the intracellular signal conduction were the most abundant among all the bcg subtypes with average abundances of 2 9 and 1 6 rpkm respectively because of their because of their wide existence in the bacterial genera from the perspective of reactor operation the gene abundances for intra and interspecific signal molecule synthesis and degradation during phase i decreased sharply and then remained stable during phase ii except for cqsa and hdts genes for example the abundance of luxi genes decreased from 7 1 10 2 to 4 1 10 2 rpkm r1 to r2 during phase i and then remained stable at approximately 1 5 10 2 rpkm during phase ii r3 r5 unlike these bcg subtypes the abundance of cqsa and hdts genes decreased during phase i hdts 8 0 10 2 to 6 1 10 2 rpkm cqsa 8 5 10 3 to 6 8 10 3 rpkm and obviously increased during phase ii hdts 5 7 10 2 to 9 0 10 2 rpkm cqsa 6 3 10 2 to 8 6 10 2 rpkm in addition the synthesizing and degrading genes of the second messenger c di gmp dgc and pde genes exhibited an obvious increasing trend during reactor operation fig 1a when taking the relationship between bcg subtypes and reactor performance or microbial diversity into consideration there was no significant correlation between most bcg subtypes in the whole community and the nrr p value 0 05 whereas most bcg subtypes of the whole community were positively correlated with the microbial diversity ρ 0 8 p value 0 05 table s3 all the pairwise correlations between bcg subtypes were determined using spearman s correlation coefficients fig 3 the significant correlations between bcg subtypes could be visualized by the network that distinctly exhibited the complex correlations rpff genes had positive correlations with lactonase lsrg luxi and luxs genes and were located in the center of the network interestingly the abundances of signal molecule synthesis genes were strongly and positively correlated with those of the degradation genes such as the dgc and pde genes ρ 0 98 luxi and lactonase genes ρ 0 99 as well as luxs and lsrg genes ρ 0 98 in other words whether they were inter or intraspecific signal molecules or secondary messengers there were balances between the synthesis and degradation of signal molecules in the anammox community 3 3 taxonomic origins analysis of the bcg subtypes the taxonomic origins of the bcg subtypes in the five samples were studied to determine the changes in the abundance of each bcg subtype nearly all the bacteria acted as hosts of bcg subtypes table s1 the taxonomic groups with relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the five samples in each bcg subtype are illustrated in fig 4 the 15 genera of bacteria obtained with high abundance of bcgs were mainly responsible for nitrogen removals such as anammox bacteria candidatus jettenia candidatus kuenenia aob nitrosomonas and nob nitrospira and autotrophic denitrifiers such as rhodanobacter and especially heterotrophic denitrifiers in addition some other bacteria such as fimbriimonas were also found to have highly abundant bcgs although the function of these bacteria in the anammox community is still unclear for the synthesis genes luxi genes were mainly found in the aob and heterotrophic denitrifiers nearly all 15 genera of bacteria carried hdts gene for ahl synthesis besides some bacteria like nitrospira and rhodanobacter it was noteworthy that candidatus jettenia was the main carrier for hdts genes the abundance of hdts genes carried by candidatus jettenia increased from 1 2 10 4 to 1 0 10 3 rpkm which was positively correlated with the nrr ρ 0 9 p value 0 05 but negatively correlated with microbial diversity ρ 0 9 p value 0 05 table s3 however there were few bacteria carrying luxs for interspecific signal ai 2 synthesis and cqsa genes for intraspecific signal cai 1 production in the anammox community another abundant signal synthesis gene rpff for dsf production extensively existed in the 15 genera of bacteria and was mainly found in the heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers for the degradation genes acylase genes were found in most bacteria including anammox bacteria and a few heterotrophic denitrifiers lactonase genes also widely existed except in fimbriimonas it was notable that lactonase instead of acylase genes for ahl degradation were carried by anammox bacteria furthermore lsrg genes were mainly found in aob and some heterotrophic denitrifiers the degradation and synthesis genes of c di gmp could be carried by all the selected genera the co occurrence patterns of the bcg subtypes and the 15 genera of bacteria with highly abundant bcgs were used for network analysis to explore the main bacteria that contributed to the variation in the abundance of the bcg subtypes fig s3 there were two tight connections i the connection of dgc pde candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia ii the highly connected structure of most bcg subtypes and heterotrophic denitrifiers the abundance of the bcg subtype was more likely to be influenced by the bacterial abundance within the connection the abundance of hdts cqsa dgc and pde genes were mainly affected by the abundance of anammox bacteria because of their close relationship in the network similarly the abundance of most other bcg subtypes changed with heterotrophic denitrifiers 3 4 bacterial communication in the anammox community for interactions the potential interaction between the two genera of bacteria was defined when forming a co occurrence pattern faust et al 2012 the co occurrence patterns among the 41 genera of bacteria with high abundance in the anammox community using network inference were based on strong ρ 0 9 and significant p value 0 01 correlations overall the more edges that a node had the more the potential bacterial interactions that the bacteria the node owned specifically all 15 genera of bacteria carrying highly abundant bcgs genera selected in section 3 3 were included in these 41 genera of bacteria and marked as red nodes in the network fig 5 a furthermore the 41 genera of bacteria were classified into seven groups according to their ecological function anammox bacteria aob or nob autotrophic denitrifiers heterotrophic denitrifiers photoheterotrophic bacteria fermentative bacteria and unclassified bacteria table s4 the potential interactions between bacteria within each group thick curving lines and between the groups thin straight lines are shown in fig 5b there were many bacterial interactions between the bacteria with abundant bcgs large nodes with bold font however bacteria without abundant bcgs small nodes with normal font had fewer interactions within the same ecological functional group for example in the heterotrophic denitrifiers group the bacteria with abundant bcgs mesorhizobium bradyrhizobium hyphomicrobium mycobacterium rhodococcus and streptomyces had many interactions with each other whereas the interactions between the bacteria without abundant bcgs burkholderia pseudomonas and rudaea were few the bacterial interactions within the fermentation group bacteria without abundant bcgs basically did not exist when the bacteria had abundant bcgs large nodes with bold font the differences in the potential interactions between the bacteria in the same functional group and different functional groups were also considered there were many bacterial interactions between the bacteria with highly abundant bcgs within the same groups thick curving lines fig 5b whereas fewer bacterial interactions occurred between bacteria from different groups thin straight line fig 5b 4 discussion 4 1 co occurrence of multiple bacterial communication in the anammox community overall the bacterial communication in the anammox reactor during the start up period was various and complex this is the first study to comprehensively investigate the existence of multiple key synthesis and degradation genes for bacterial communication signals based on a constructed bcg database the taxonomic origins of these genes and their correlations the signal molecule synthesis genes hdts and rpff had the highest abundance and might be the most important potential engines for bacterial communication in the anammox community the importance of hdts gene was also demonstrated by its taxonomic origins anammox bacteria based on previous studies the function of a bacterium with a bacterial communication system is mainly to regulate different bacterial behaviors in different environments for their own survival waters and bassler 2005 goo et al 2015 for example ai 2 influenced the abundance of the major phyla of the gut microbiota and helped the microbial community rebalance from the impact of antibiotics thompson et al 2015 c di gmp was involved in the regulation of extracellular polymeric substance eps for the formation of biofilms or bacterial aggregation hengge 2009 ahl influenced bacterial activity tang et al 2015 and is currently known to take part in numerous critical metabolism for adaptation to alkaline toxicity goo et al 2015 when multiple bacterial communication coexisted there were also interactions between these bacterial communications such as parallel bacterial communications competitive bacterial communications and bacterial communications arranged in series waters and bassler 2005 these interactions were used to amplify the signal input of changes in the environment or to identify specific changes in the environment allowing bacteria to more accurately regulate their own behavior or characteristics papenfort and bassler 2016 overall multiple bacterial communications enrich the way bacteria regulate the behavior of the community for an anammox community consisting of many species although our current findings did not explain how bacterial communication affected the community we could deduce that the function of multiple bacterial communication was to regulate various biochemical behaviors of the bacteria under various environmental conditions making the entire community more adaptable to environmental changes 4 2 correlation between bacterial communication and nrr bcg subtypes in the anammox community were involved in the communication of multiple bacterial species and not only in that of anammox bacteria although the nrr was likely regulated by the bacterial communication of anammox bacteria based on previous study where nrr was shown to be influenced by bacterial communication signals tang et al 2015 other bacteria in the anammox community could use the bacterial communication to regulate the other biochemical behavior rather than nitrogen removal for example in pseudomonas aeruginosa formation of biofilms which provides the organism with a good stable living environment is regulated by bacterial communication freitas et al 2011 biofilm formation might provide a stable anaerobic environment to anammox bacteria in our study heterotrophic denitrifiers had the most abundant bcgs and could use multiple bcgs but were not the main contributor to nrr therefore it was not surprising that most bcg subtypes of the whole community were not necessarily related to the nrr most bcg subtypes of the whole community were positively correlated with microbial diversity high diversity of the community generally means that there are abundant microbial members and thus there may be high levels of communication among them and vice versa therefore the diversity of the community contributed to the variation in these bcg subtypes we also found that bcg subtypes of candidatus jettenia hdts lact dgc and pde were positively correlated r 0 9 p value 0 05 with the nrr but negatively correlated with microbial diversity r 0 9 p value 0 05 for the anammox process anammox bacteria are functional bacteria that affect the nrr although bacterial communication of the whole community was not related to the nrr the nrr was likely regulated by anammox bacteria as mentioned above from the point of view of reactor operation the shortening of hrt and improvement of nitrogen concentration in the influent might have a positive effect on the bacterial communication of anammox bacteria the operation was beneficial in that it provided more substrates for anammox bacteria which was also supported by a previous study wherein bacteria produced more bacterial communication signals in the presence of a nutrient rich substrate bassler and miller 2006 many studies have shown that the microbial community shifts from complex to stable during the reactor start up period while the abundance of anammox bacteria gradually increases chen et al 2016 cao et al 2016 from a genetic point of view the variation in bcg subtypes of anammox bacteria was caused by the variation in their carrier anammox bacteria the increase in bcg subtypes of anammox bacteria is beneficial to enhance the bacterial communication the synthesis genes of bacterial communication signals in anammox bacteria were hdts and dgc genes previous studies have confirmed that ahl the products of hdts influenced the abundance of anammox bacteria tang et al 2015 and c di gmp the products of dgc regulated the formation of eps resulting in increased bacterial aggregation guo et al 2017 these studies suggested that bacterial communications were beneficial to anammox bacteria therefore the opposite correlation between microbial diversity and the bcg subtypes of anammox bacteria was reasonable 4 3 balance of bacterial communication and its interference regarding the tendency of the bcg subtype abundance one of the most interesting phenomena was the positive correlation between the abundance of signal molecule synthesis genes and degradation genes fig 3a this raised an important issue of whether bacterial communication always maintains a delicate balance in the community through the synthesis and degradation of signal molecules even though the abundance of degradation genes was higher than that of synthesis genes this may be explained by the discrepancy in the activity of the different enzymes another reason for this phenomenon may be the biological functions of the signal degradation genes the signal degradation genes not only played roles in signal degradation but also participated in other metabolic activities uroz et al 2009 studies have shown that bacteria use bacterial communication to regulate the formation of biofilms to resist environmental stress while bacterial communication interference could be a strategy to disperse an excessively thick biofilm that was not conducive to the survival of the community goo et al 2015 another example describing the role of bacterial communication and interference is the regulation of toxic factors the formation of toxic factors in some bacteria was regulated by bacterial communication dockery and keener 2001 while bacteria could survive the attack from other bacteria by communication interference li et al 2011 this showed that bacteria could use the balance of bacterial communication and interference as a strategy to survive in the community and adapt to environmental fluctuations 4 4 complex correlations between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes specially the correlations between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes were explored using the network analysis fig 4 the abundance of rpff genes was only less than that of hdts genes indicating that rpff genes were a common method of bacterial communication in the anammox community the wide existence of dsf the products of rpff genes has been reported in previous studies ryan and dow 2011 more importantly the complex correlations between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes suggested mutual influence among them although the previous studies rarely explored the correlations between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes in microbial communities some enlightenment can be obtained by studying the cultivable bacteria with multiple bacteria communication systems in the cultivable bacteria each bacterial communication system is not completely independent they may form complex interactions or act on downstream genes together for example vibrio harveyi used parallel bacterial communication circuits the signal molecules of these circuits were ahl cai 1 and ai 2 to control biofilm formation and bioluminescence waters and bassler 2005 pseudomonas aeruginosa used bacterial communication circuits arranged in series the signal molecules of these circuits were two kinds of ahls to increase adhesion biofilm formation and virulence factor expression lee and zhang 2015 therefore there is the potential for mutual interactions between rpff genes and other bcg subtypes in the anammox community but the mechanism still needs to be explored further it is important to note that some bacterial communication systems are likely to have mutual influences the product of rpff genes dsf which is both an intra and interspecific signal molecule is different from other signal molecules therefore dsf acts as a universal signal among the complex correlations in the anammox community rpff genes were first found to have the most correlations with other bcg subtypes this suggested that rpff genes may play an important role in multiple bacterial communication and are key to deciphering the bacterial communication occurring in the whole community 4 5 bacterial interaction in the same ecological functional group mediated by bacterial communication bacteria with abundant bcgs had close interactions which indicated the possibility for bacterial communication to be involved in bacterial interactions fig 5a deduced from the classification of the most abundant 41 genera according to ecological function fig 5b bacteria having the same function with abundant bcgs interacted more than those without abundant bcgs this indicated that bacteria with abundant bcgs may have more bacterial interactions therefore the assumption that bacterial communication affected bacterial interactions among the same functional bacteria was reasonable additionally for bacteria with abundant bcgs the difference in interactions between bacteria within each group and between groups suggested that bacterial interactions most likely occurred with in the same functional bacteria fig 5b the use of bacterial communication systems for bacterial interaction may only occur between the same functional bacteria this also emphasized the potential influence of bacterial communication in bacterial interactions among the same functional bacteria bacterial communication which is one of the factors demonstrating that bacterial interactions occur kolenbrander et al 2002 is likely to mediate bacterial interaction among the same functional bacteria moreover there were also bacterial interactions among the different genera of bacteria with abundant bcgs except for rpff and luxs genes such as candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia this phenomenon may occur because signal molecules synthesized by candidatus jettenia could be identified by candidatus kuenenia the latter used this signal molecule to regulate a series of metabolic processes this was also supported by previous studies demonstrating that the addition of bacteria with the ability to synthesize ahl influenced the microbial community of granular activated sludge ding et al 2015 overall bacteria were likely to use bcgs to communicate with other bacteria within the same functional group leading to interactions and mutual influence among these bacteria anammox bacteria candidate jettenia used the hdts genes to communicate with intraspecific bacteria and used lactonase genes to interfere with communication because the activity of the anammox culture has been shown to be under the influence of bacterial communication tang et al 2015 anammox could use bacterial communication to regulate its activity during the reactor start up period to maintain its competitiveness and viability although previous studies only identified the ahl synthase in nitrosomonas this study confirmed that nitrosomonas used various bcgs for intra or interspecific communication nitrosomonas and nitrospira could communicate under the influence of luxs genes which was not reported previously and is very useful in the elucidation of the nitrifying process for wastewater treatment moreover heterotrophic denitrifiers had the most abundant bcgs and could use multiple bcgs mainly rpff genes to interact with the same functional bacteria which is beneficial for increased survival and competitiveness in wastewater treatment by coping with different harsh conditions because the ahl synthase of hdts type was carried by anammox bacteria and was important for nitrogen removal performance a new approach for quick start up of the anammox reactor and improvement of the competition of anammox bacteria could be offered that is genetically engineered bacteria carrying hdts type genes of anammox bacteria could be constructed for dosing the engineered bacteria in the reactor to enhance nitrogen removal performance rpff played a core role characterized by their multiple correlations with other bcg subtypes thus genetically engineered bacteria carrying rpff type genes could also be applied additionally the stability of the genetically engineered bacteria the way these bacteria dosing in the reactor and strategies of reactor operation should be explored further 5 conclusion in this study multiple bacterial communications and their interweaved correlations were studied in the anammox community during bioreactor start up bacterial communication was more active in the initial start up than the high loading rate phase correlated with the gradually decreasing bacterial diversity among the 11 selected gene subtypes hdts and rpff genes were verified to be important for communication signal production while rpff genes related to both intra and interspecies signaling molecules had the most correlations with other bcg subtypes the balance of bacteria communication and its interference was also confirmed in addition bacteria with highly abundant bcgs were more inclined to interact with other bacteria within the same functional group indicating the potential communication related interaction among these bacteria besides the frequently reported substrate co utilization the discovery of important engines hdts and rpff genes for bacterial communication in the anammox community hints at a possibility for selective and targeted regulation of bacterial communication to control the biochemical behavior of the community and the rapid start up of the anammox reactor such as the exogenous addition of specific signaling molecules or bacteria releasing specific signaling molecules acknowledgements the authors

19651,abstract this study examined the electrochemical ec reduction of iodinated contrast media icm exemplified by iopamidol and diatrizoate the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde was used to elucidate rates and mechanisms of the ec reactions of the selected icms experiments were carried at varying hydrodynamic conditions concentrations of iopamidol diatrizoate natural organic matter nom

diatrizoate were ec reduced at potentials 0 45 v vs s c e in the range of potentials 0 65 to 0 85 v their reduction was mass transfer controlled the presence of nom and model compounds did not affect the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate but active iodine species formed as a result of the ec induced transformations of these icms reacted readily with nom and model compounds these data

introduction iodinated contrast media icm including iopromide iopamidol diatrizoate and others are widely used in medical imaging arslan alaton et al 2017 kalsch 1999 kormos et al 2011 chemical structures of these compounds are shown in fig 1 because of their extensive use icm are frequently encountered in municipal wastewater at concentrations up to 100 μg l 1 polo et al 2016 radjenovic et al 2013 ternes and hirsch 2000 conventional wastewater treatment processes do not remove icms because they are highly hydrophilic and resistant to biological degradation as a result icms enter receiving waters and have been found in drinking water as well duirk et al 2011 ternes and hirsch 2000 tian et al 2014 ye et al 2014 zwiener et al 2009 in response to concerns about icms in water and wastewater researchers have examined several treatment options advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv photolysis sonolysis fenton photo fenton h2o2 uv c tio2 uv a and o3 h2o2 have been reported to remove icms but these processes also generate iodinated organic intermediate products chan et al 2010 chu et al 2011 gong et al 2017 huber et al 2003 jeong et al 2010 kovalova et al 2013 that may be highly toxic matsushita et al 2015 polo et al 2016 reductive processes that induce dehalogenation induced by for instance zero valent metals and metal based catalysts have shown promise in the treatment of icms because these compounds are easily deiodinated arslan alaton et al 2017 radjenovic et al 2013 stieber et al 2011 deiodination has been recognized to play a prominent role in both oxidative and reductive processes involving icms jeong et al 2010 kormos et al 2010 yet the occurrence of icm deiodination eventually constitutes a complication and a challenge for water treatment this is because the iodide ions cleaved from the parent icm molecules cannot be easily removed from solution and are very easy to incorporate into organic matter again they even react with natural organic matter nom to form iodinated by products such as iodo haloacetic acids and iodo trihalomethanes as chlorine or chloramine used for disinfection jeong et al 2010 matsushita et al 2015 radjenovic et al 2013 xia et al 2017 these results show that the kinetics and mechanisms of icm degradation in reductive processes as well as the fate of iodine species and iodide generated as a result of icm deiodination need to be ascertained in more detail jeong et al 2010 kormos et al 2010 matsushita et al 2015 this can be done based on the electrochemical ec method of rotating ring disk electrode rrde which utilizes two coaxially positioned electrodes a disk and a ring with independently controlled ec potentials liao et al 1988 rotation of the electrodes causes the ec active products generated at the disc to be transferred to the ring whose current is measured as a function of the rotation rate ec potentials of the ring and the disc and other system conditions the utility of the rrde method to examining redox reactions of environmentally relevant iodine containing organic contaminants exemplified by monoiodoacetic acid miaa and iodoform chi3 was demonstrated in ma et al 2015 in this study the rrde method was used to investigate the reduction and mass transfer related behavior of two representative icms that include an ionic contrast agent diatrizoate and a non ionic icm iopamidol chemical structures of these compounds are shown in fig 1 effect of nom and model compounds that interact with iodine species potentially formed upon the reduction of icms were investigated as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals chemicals were ar grade unless otherwise mentioned all solutions were prepared using milli q water 18 2 mω cm 1 millipore corp sodium diatrizoate iopamidol resorcinol catechol quaiacol were obtained from sigma aldrich beijing china 1 0 g l 1 diatrizoate iopamidol catechol quaiacol stock solutions were prepared in di water stock solution of resorcinol was prepared in di water with a 356 mg l 1 concentration suwannee river natural organic matter srnom 1r101n was purchased from the international humic substances society srnom stock solution had a dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 100 mg l 1 doc concentrations of srnom solutions were measured with a toc analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan instrument all stock solutions were stored at ca 4 c in a refrigerator 2 2 electrochemical measurements ec experiments were carried as described in detail in ma et al 2015 they used a five port cell with a gold rrde electrode affixed to a pine afmsrx rotator and platinum counter electrode pine instrument co lawrence ks usa the diameter of the disk electrode was 5 mm the inner and outer diameters of the ring electrode were 6 5 mm and 7 5 mm respectively the ring disk gap was 0 75 mm for this rrde geometry the highest efficiency of collecting disk generated intermediates on the ring is 0 256 pleskov and filinovskii 1976 the counter electrode was separated from the working electrode by a glass frit ec potentials were controlled using a pine afcbp1 bipotentiostat pine instrument co lawrence ks usa and measured vs the ag agcl reference electrode the ec experiments were carried out in the presence of 0 1 mol l 1 na2so4 and 0 01 mol l 1 phosphate buffer at 25 2 c prior to each experiment the rrde surface was polished with 0 05 μm alumina slurry allied high tech products inc lot 030513 1 e14dd usa and rinsed with methanol and di water for 30 s respectively all solutions were purged with n2 for 10 min following which the n2 line was positioned above the air solution interface to prevent the ingress of oxygen to the solution the disk and ring electrodes were initially cycled in the background electrolyte ten times from 1000 mv to 1000 mv using a 100 mv s 1 scan rate following the cycling a cathodic scan in the background electrolyte was performed to check the reproducibility of the rrde performance these showed that increases of the rrde rotation rate caused no appreciable changes of the ring and disk currents in the deoxygenated background electrolyte ma et al 2015 the ec reduction of diatrizoate and iopamidol was measured in the range of disk potentials 200 mv to 1000 mv a 50 mv s 1 scan rate was used the disk potential was kept for 20 s at 200 mv before each scan the ring potential was kept at 800 mv as explained in more details in the section that follow this ring potential allows selective detection of the iodide ions formed upon the deiodination of iodine containing species ma et al 2015 3 results and discussion rrde measurements showed that the examined i containing contrast agents underwent electrochemical reduction at potentials 0 4 v this is illustrated by the data shown for iopamidol and diatrizoate in figs 2 and 3 respectively fig 2a demonstrates that the disk currents corresponding to the ec reduction of iopamidol increase monotonically in the range of potentials 0 35 to 0 65 v while in the range of potentials 0 65 to 0 85 v the ec disk current reaches a plateau at potentials 0 85 v the ec current at the disk increased this is likely to correspond to the onset of the non specific current of ec reduction of water similar features of the dependence of disk currents vs ec potential were observed for diatrizoate fig 3a increases of the rrde rotation rate from 0 to 3000 rpm were accompanied by gradual increases of the reduction currents of iopamidol and diatrizoate but the overall dependence of ec current vs disc potential remained the same this behavior is characteristic of ec reactions that are limited by the rate of diffusion of ec active species to the electrode surface galus 1976 ma et al 2015 pleskov and filinovskii 1976 this observation is confirmed by the dependence of the disk current measured at edisk 0 8 v vs the square root of the rrde rotation rate ω1 2 at varying concentrations of iopamidol and diatrizoate fig 4 the edisk value of 0 8 v is located in the mid range of disc potentials characterized by a nearly constant value of the disk currents fig 4 demonstrates that the disk currents were linearly correlated with ω1 2 values r2 from 0 96 to 1 00 the slope of the correlation between the disk currents and ω1 2 values increased with the concentration of the examined icms fig 5 the strong linearity of the correlations between the concentrations of these contrast agents and on the other hand slopes idisk vs ω1 2 correlations r2 0 99 and 1 00 for iopamidol and diatrizoate respectively reinforces the notion that at disk potentials below ca 0 65 v the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate is limited by the rate of diffusion of these species to the electrode surface the susceptibility of iopamidol and diatrizoate to the ec reduction is indicative of the ease of cleavage of the c i bonds in the 2 4 6 triiodo substituted aromatic rings this property appears to be salient for icms but not necessarily so for iodine substituted phenols in general as was demonstrated by rrde experiments that utilized 3 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol these measurements demonstrated that these iodo substituted phenols do not undergo ec reduction in the range of potential at which iopamidol and diatrizoate were reduced the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate was accompanied by the generation of ec active products which were detected on the ring electrode figs 2b and 3b similarly to the observations made in the case of the ec reduction of miaa and iodoform ma et al 2015 the product of the cathodic reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate was readily oxidized on the ring whose ec potential was kept at 0 8 v prior research demonstrates that the anodic ring current observed in the case of ec reduction of miaa corresponds to the oxidation of the iodide ion cleaved from the parent i containing molecule ma et al 2015 the ring currents that correspond to the oxidation of the iodide generated as a result of the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate exhibited a complex dependence vs the disk potential and rotation rate for the examined contrast agents the ring current increased from zero at the disk potential of ca 0 45 v to reach its maximum at ca 0 8 v following which it decreased most likely due to the suppression of the generation of iodide in the range of the disk potentials in which water undergoes ec reduction in the case of iopamidol increases of the rrde rotation rate from zero to 400 rpm caused only a small increase of the ring current fig 2b while further increase of the rotation rate caused the ring current to decrease slightly in the case of diatrizoate ring currents underwent a slight monotonic decrease as the rotation rate increased from 0 to 3000 rpm the behavior of the disk and ring currents observed for the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate figs 2 and 3 has similarities to that observed for the ec reduction of iodoform chi3 and miaa ma et al 2015 these studies showed that the ec reduction of these dbps is accompanied by the formation of active iodine i which then dimerizes to form i2 which disproportionates to i and hoi thus the presence of solutes that react with iodine species is expected to lead to the suppression of the formation of iodide ion and hence to the decrease of the ring current that corresponds to the ec oxidation of the iodide given the observed formation of iodide upon the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate and the absence of any step like changes of the ec disk currents that can be indicative of the occurrence of sequential one electron transfers it is reasonable to assume that the ec reduction of the icms proceeds through a concerted transfer of three electrons to form active iodine i reaction 1 written for iopamidol ipa and products of the ec degradation of the contrast agents whose nature has been examined in some detail in prior studies arslan alaton et al 2017 radjenovic et al 2013 stieber et al 2011 reaction 1 is followed as mentioned above by the formation of i2 reaction 3 and its disproportionation to hoi and i anion reaction 3 1 i p a 3 e 3 i p r o d u c t s 2 2 i i 2 3 i 2 h 2 o i h o i h the generation of the active iodine species and iodide and effects of nom and the model species on these processes can be examined based on the behavior of ring collection efficiency the latter parameter is denoted henceforth as n and defined as the ratio of the absolute values of the ring and disk currents n values showed complex changes vs the ec potential of the disk electrode figs 2c and 3c for both iopamidol and diatrizoate the ring collection efficiency tended to reach a maximum at the disk potential of 0 8 v located in the mid range of the plateau of the disk currents increases of the rrde rotation rates were accompanied by the gradual decrease of the ring collection efficiency although this was somewhat less consistent in the case of iopamidol the presence of organic species that react with active iodine did not affect the disk currents that correspond to the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate this is exemplified by the data obtained for the ec reactions of iopamidol in the presence of catechol fig 6 a and figiure s1a and diatrizoate in the presence of srnom fig 7 a and figure s2a in contrast with the stability of the disk currents the ring currents were suppressed in the presence of resorcinol catechol guaiacol and srnom this trend can be illustrated by the ring collection efficiency values determined for the iopamidol catechol fig 6b and figure s1b and diatrizoate srnom systems fig 6b and figure s1b in the presence of these species the ring currents decreased as the concentration of model compounds or nom increased calculations of the logarithms of the relative changes of the collection efficiency ln n0 n determined for any given concentration of the model compound or nom vs that the ring collection efficiency at the same any ω1 2 value in the absence of model compounds n0 as defined higher ln n0 n values are indicative of the suppression of the ring currents indicative of the generation of iodide via the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate figs 6c and 7c demonstrate that ln n0 n values do increase with the concentration of catechol and nom these trends were observed for iopamidol and diatrizoate undergoing the ec reduction in the presence of varying concentrations of resorcinol catechol guaiacol and srnom this behavior is also similar to that observed for the ec reduction of miaa and chi3 ma et al 2015 changes of the ring collection efficiency associated with the presence of srnom and the model compounds were examined based on the phenomenological model developed in prior research concerned with the ec reduction of i dbps ma et al 2015 this model interprets changes of the collection efficiency of the ring electrode as a function of the concentration of the organic substrate and mass transfer conditions eq 4 in agreement with the rrde theory galus 1976 pleskov and filinovskii 1976 equation 1 contains a ω1 2 term that accounts for effects of increased mass transfer rate at higher rotation rates 4 ln n 0 n k 1 k 2 c ω 1 2 in equation 4 k1 is the rate of the loss of the ec produced iodide due to limited rates of reactions 2 and 3 that affect the formation of i during the transit of the solution from the disk to the ring in principle the k1 term can also include the rate of the loss of i due to reactions of these species with the molecules of diatrizoate and iopamidol themselves the k2 term denotes the rate of reactions associated with the consumption of i in its reactions with nom and model organic species modeling of the data presented in figs 6c and 7c and similar ln n0 n datasets generated for the ec reduction of diatrizoate and iopamidol in the presence of srnom and model aromatic compounds showed that in all cases the data could be reasonably well fitted using equation 4 this point is illustrated in figure s3 figure s4 and figure s5 that compare the experimental and modeling data for the ec reduction of iopamidol in the presence of varying concentrations of resorcinol catechol and guaiacol respectively these results confirm the point that the reduction of the examined icms is accompanied by the formation of active iodine species that react readily with nom and the model aromatic compounds this pathway is prominent in the general scheme of reactions characteristic for the reductive transformations of icms fig 8 this scheme shows that the ec reductive deiodination of icms exemplified in fig 8 by diatrizoate leads to the formation of the species of active iodine and iodide ions and also of the deiodinated products of the reduction of icms the nature of these products remain to be ascertained yet the experimental data generated in this and prior relevant studies indicate that the products of the reduction of icms react with the active iodine species and chlorine based disinfectant to generate i dbps jeong et al 2010 matsushita et al 2015 radjenovic et al 2013 an additional pathway of interactions of the active iodine species with the molecules of diatrizoate and iopamidol can exist as well although its actual presence and significance for the generation of i dbps needs to be established in future studies these observations show that icms can be effectively removed by the ec reduction in adequately optimized mass transfer conditions the presence of scavengers e g nom and model compounds can significantly affect the fate of the iodine species released upon the deiodination of the parent icm molecules these findings lead to a better understanding of the degradation pathways of i containing organic pollutants and ultimately to the development of novel water treatment process that allow controlling and removing icms their degradation products and i dbps 4 conclusions this study employed the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde to explore the electrochemical reduction of iodine containing contrast agents exemplified by iopamidol and diatrizoate experiments were carried at varying hydrodynamic conditions concentrations of these pharmaceutical and as well as those of nom and model compounds resorcinol catechol guaiacol that were used to examine interactions between the products of the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate and species potentially present in treated water the rrde experiments demonstrated that iopamidol and diatrizoate can be reduced electrochemically at potentials below 0 45 v vs s c e in the range of potentials 0 65 to 0 85 v their reduction is mass transfer controlled and at potentials 0 85 v the reduction of these species proceed simultaneously with that of water these observations show that icms can be effectively removed by ec reduction in adequately optimized mass transfer conditions rrde data demonstrate that while per se the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate is not affected by the presence of nom and model aromatic compounds the ec reactions of these icms are accompanied by the formation of iodine species that readily react with nom model aromatic compounds and potentially with the molecules of iopamidol and diatrizoate themselves the chemical nature of iodine species formed upon the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate is similar to that formed in the case of the ec reduction of aliphatic i dbps such as miaa and chi3 these data confirm the importance of the pathway of deiodination of the 2 4 6 triiodo substituted aromatic group typical for i containing contrast agents these data can lead to a better understanding of the degradation pathways of icm and ultimately to the development of novel water treatment process that allow controlling and removing icm and their degradation products acknowledgements this study was supported by the national science foundation of

10 min following which the n2 line was positioned above the air solution interface to prevent the ingress of oxygen to the solution the disk and ring electrodes were initially cycled in the background electrolyte ten times from 1000 mv to 1000 mv using a 100 mv s 1 scan rate following the cycling a cathodic scan in the background electrolyte was performed to check the reproducibility of the rrde performance these showed that increases of the rrde rotation rate caused no appreciable changes of the ring and disk currents in the deoxygenated background electrolyte ma et al 2015 the ec reduction of diatrizoate and iopamidol was measured in the range of disk potentials 200 mv to 1000 mv a 50 mv s 1 scan rate was used the disk potential was kept for 20 s at 200 mv before each scan the ring potential was kept at 800 mv as explained in more details in the section that follow this ring potential allows selective detection of the iodide ions formed upon the deiodination of iodine containing species ma et al 2015 3 results and discussion rrde measurements showed that the examined i containing contrast agents underwent electrochemical reduction at potentials 0 4 v this is illustrated by the data shown for iopamidol and diatrizoate in figs 2 and 3 respectively fig 2a demonstrates that the disk currents corresponding to the ec reduction of iopamidol increase monotonically in the range of potentials 0 35 to 0 65 v while in the range of potentials 0 65 to 0 85 v the ec disk current reaches a plateau at potentials 0 85 v the ec current at the disk increased this is likely to correspond to the onset of the non specific current of ec reduction of water similar features of the dependence of disk currents vs ec potential were observed for diatrizoate fig 3a increases of the rrde rotation rate from 0 to 3000 rpm were accompanied by gradual increases of the reduction currents of iopamidol and diatrizoate but the overall dependence of ec current vs disc potential remained the same this behavior is characteristic of ec reactions that are limited by the rate of diffusion of ec active species to the electrode surface galus 1976 ma et al 2015 pleskov and filinovskii 1976 this observation is confirmed by the dependence of the disk current measured at edisk 0 8 v vs the square root of the rrde rotation rate ω1 2 at varying concentrations of iopamidol and diatrizoate fig 4 the edisk value of 0 8 v is located in the mid range of disc potentials characterized by a nearly constant value of the disk currents fig 4 demonstrates that the disk currents were linearly correlated with ω1 2 values r2 from 0 96 to 1 00 the slope of the correlation between the disk currents and ω1 2 values increased with the concentration of the examined icms fig 5 the strong linearity of the correlations between the concentrations of these contrast agents and on the other hand slopes idisk vs ω1 2 correlations r2 0 99 and 1 00 for iopamidol and diatrizoate respectively reinforces the notion that at disk potentials below ca 0 65 v the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate is limited by the rate of diffusion of these species to the electrode surface the susceptibility of iopamidol and diatrizoate to the ec reduction is indicative of the ease of cleavage of the c i bonds in the 2 4 6 triiodo substituted aromatic rings this property appears to be salient for icms but not necessarily so for iodine substituted phenols in general as was demonstrated by rrde experiments that utilized 3 iodophenol and 2 4 6 triiodophenol these measurements demonstrated that these iodo substituted phenols do not undergo ec reduction in the range of potential at which iopamidol and diatrizoate were reduced the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate was accompanied by the generation of ec active products which were detected on the ring electrode figs 2b and 3b similarly to the observations made in the case of the ec reduction of miaa and iodoform ma et al 2015 the product of the cathodic reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate was readily oxidized on the ring whose ec potential was kept at 0 8 v prior research demonstrates that the anodic ring current observed in the case of ec reduction of miaa corresponds to the oxidation of the iodide ion cleaved from the parent i containing molecule ma et al 2015 the ring currents that correspond to the oxidation of the iodide generated as a result of the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate exhibited a complex dependence vs the disk potential and rotation rate for the examined contrast agents the ring current increased from zero at the disk potential of ca 0 45 v to reach its maximum at ca 0 8 v following which it decreased most likely due to the suppression of the generation of iodide in the range of the disk potentials in which water undergoes ec reduction in the case of iopamidol increases of the rrde rotation rate from zero to 400 rpm caused only a small increase of the ring current fig 2b while further increase of the rotation rate caused the ring current to decrease slightly in the case of diatrizoate ring currents underwent a slight monotonic decrease as the rotation rate increased from 0 to 3000 rpm the behavior of the disk and ring currents observed for the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate figs 2 and 3 has similarities to that observed for the ec reduction of iodoform chi3 and miaa ma et al 2015 these studies showed that the ec reduction of these dbps is accompanied by the formation of active iodine i which then dimerizes to form i2 which disproportionates to i and hoi thus the presence of solutes that react with iodine species is expected to lead to the suppression of the formation of iodide ion and hence to the decrease of the ring current that corresponds to the ec oxidation of the iodide given the observed formation of iodide upon the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate and the absence of any step like changes of the ec disk currents that can be indicative of the occurrence of sequential one electron transfers it is reasonable to assume that the ec reduction of the icms proceeds through a concerted transfer of three electrons to form active iodine i reaction 1 written for iopamidol ipa and products of the ec degradation of the contrast agents whose nature has been examined in some detail in prior studies arslan alaton et al 2017 radjenovic et al 2013 stieber et al 2011 reaction 1 is followed as mentioned above by the formation of i2 reaction 3 and its disproportionation to hoi and i anion reaction 3 1 i p a 3 e 3 i p r o d u c t s 2 2 i i 2 3 i 2 h 2 o i h o i h the generation of the active iodine species and iodide and effects of nom and the model species on these processes can be examined based on the behavior of ring collection efficiency the latter parameter is denoted henceforth as n and defined as the ratio of the absolute values of the ring and disk currents n values showed complex changes vs the ec potential of the disk electrode figs 2c and 3c for both iopamidol and diatrizoate the ring collection efficiency tended to reach a maximum at the disk potential of 0 8 v located in the mid range of the plateau of the disk currents increases of the rrde rotation rates were accompanied by the gradual decrease of the ring collection efficiency although this was somewhat less consistent in the case of iopamidol the presence of organic species that react with active iodine did not affect the disk currents that correspond to the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate this is exemplified by the data obtained for the ec reactions of iopamidol in the presence of catechol fig 6 a and figiure s1a and diatrizoate in the presence of srnom fig 7 a and figure s2a in contrast with the stability of the disk currents the ring currents were suppressed in the presence of resorcinol catechol guaiacol and srnom this trend can be illustrated by the ring collection efficiency values determined for the iopamidol catechol fig 6b and figure s1b and diatrizoate srnom systems fig 6b and figure s1b in the presence of these species the ring currents decreased as the concentration of model compounds or nom increased calculations of the logarithms of the relative changes of the collection efficiency ln n0 n determined for any given concentration of the model compound or nom vs that the ring collection efficiency at the same any ω1 2 value in the absence of model compounds n0 as defined higher ln n0 n values are indicative of the suppression of the ring currents indicative of the generation of iodide via the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate figs 6c and 7c demonstrate that ln n0 n values do increase with the concentration of catechol and nom these trends were observed for iopamidol and diatrizoate undergoing the ec reduction in the presence of varying concentrations of resorcinol catechol guaiacol and srnom this behavior is also similar to that observed for the ec reduction of miaa and chi3 ma et al 2015 changes of the ring collection efficiency associated with the presence of srnom and the model compounds were examined based on the phenomenological model developed in prior research concerned with the ec reduction of i dbps ma et al 2015 this model interprets changes of the collection efficiency of the ring electrode as a function of the concentration of the organic substrate and mass transfer conditions eq 4 in agreement with the rrde theory galus 1976 pleskov and filinovskii 1976 equation 1 contains a ω1 2 term that accounts for effects of increased mass transfer rate at higher rotation rates 4 ln n 0 n k 1 k 2 c ω 1 2 in equation 4 k1 is the rate of the loss of the ec produced iodide due to limited rates of reactions 2 and 3 that affect the formation of i during the transit of the solution from the disk to the ring in principle the k1 term can also include the rate of the loss of i due to reactions of these species with the molecules of diatrizoate and iopamidol themselves the k2 term denotes the rate of reactions associated with the consumption of i in its reactions with nom and model organic species modeling of the data presented in figs 6c and 7c and similar ln n0 n datasets generated for the ec reduction of diatrizoate and iopamidol in the presence of srnom and model aromatic compounds showed that in all cases the data could be reasonably well fitted using equation 4 this point is illustrated in figure s3 figure s4 and figure s5 that compare the experimental and modeling data for the ec reduction of iopamidol in the presence of varying concentrations of resorcinol catechol and guaiacol respectively these results confirm the point that the reduction of the examined icms is accompanied by the formation of active iodine species that react readily with nom and the model aromatic compounds this pathway is prominent in the general scheme of reactions characteristic for the reductive transformations of icms fig 8 this scheme shows that the ec reductive deiodination of icms exemplified in fig 8 by diatrizoate leads to the formation of the species of active iodine and iodide ions and also of the deiodinated products of the reduction of icms the nature of these products remain to be ascertained yet the experimental data generated in this and prior relevant studies indicate that the products of the reduction of icms react with the active iodine species and chlorine based disinfectant to generate i dbps jeong et al 2010 matsushita et al 2015 radjenovic et al 2013 an additional pathway of interactions of the active iodine species with the molecules of diatrizoate and iopamidol can exist as well although its actual presence and significance for the generation of i dbps needs to be established in future studies these observations show that icms can be effectively removed by the ec reduction in adequately optimized mass transfer conditions the presence of scavengers e g nom and model compounds can significantly affect the fate of the iodine species released upon the deiodination of the parent icm molecules these findings lead to a better understanding of the degradation pathways of i containing organic pollutants and ultimately to the development of novel water treatment process that allow controlling and removing icms their degradation products and i dbps 4 conclusions this study employed the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde to explore the electrochemical reduction of iodine containing contrast agents exemplified by iopamidol and diatrizoate experiments were carried at varying hydrodynamic conditions concentrations of these pharmaceutical and as well as those of nom and model compounds resorcinol catechol guaiacol that were used to examine interactions between the products of the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate and species potentially present in treated water the rrde experiments demonstrated that iopamidol and diatrizoate can be reduced electrochemically at potentials below 0 45 v vs s c e in the range of potentials 0 65 to 0 85 v their reduction is mass transfer controlled and at potentials 0 85 v the reduction of these species proceed simultaneously with that of water these observations show that icms can be effectively removed by ec reduction in adequately optimized mass transfer conditions rrde data demonstrate that while per se the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate is not affected by the presence of nom and model aromatic compounds the ec reactions of these icms are accompanied by the formation of iodine species that readily react with nom model aromatic compounds and potentially with the molecules of iopamidol and diatrizoate themselves the chemical nature of iodine species formed upon the ec reduction of iopamidol and diatrizoate is similar to that formed in the case of the ec reduction of aliphatic i dbps such as miaa and chi3 these data confirm the importance of the pathway of deiodination of the 2 4 6 triiodo substituted aromatic group typical for i containing contrast agents these data can lead to a better understanding of the degradation pathways of icm and ultimately to the development of novel water treatment process that allow controlling and removing icm and their degradation products acknowledgements this study was supported by the national science foundation of

19652,the application of in situ electrochemical generation of ferrous fe ii ions for phosphorus p removal in wastewater treatment was investigated with attention to the efficacy kinetics and mechanism at concentrations typical of municipal wastewater p could be removed by in situ fe ii with removal efficiency higher than achieved on addition of feso4 and close to that of fecl3 under both anoxic and oxic conditions the generation of alkalinity due to water electrolysis at the cathode created much higher ph conditions compared to feso4 dosing thereby resulting in very different pathways of fe solid phase formation and associated p removal mechanisms the remarkably similar dependence of p removal on accumulated fe for all investigated currents initial p concentrations and do conditions indicated that kinetic aspects did not play a role in p removal during in situ fe ii dosing thermodynamic modelling was undertaken to investigate possible solid phase formation pathways under anoxic conditions and these insights were extended to oxic conditions the exclusive formation of ferrous hydroxide during anoxic in situ fe ii dosing implied that p removal occurred via coprecipitation and adsorption under oxic conditions the high ph conditions would have resulted in rapid fe ii oxidation and formation of ferric oxyhydroxides with associated coprecipitation and adsorption effecting p removal in a similar pattern to that observed under anoxic conditions in situ fe ii dosing represents a versatile option for chemical p removal with the precise control of fe dosage to optimize fep forms for possible p recovery graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus ferrous iron in situ kinetics efficiency mechanism 1 introduction the discharge of phosphorus p from human activity into water bodies results in environmental problems including eutrophication and occurrence of potentially harmful algal blooms medeiros and molot 2006 sun and liu 2016 in view of this there has been extensive research into phosphorus removal from wastewaters two categories of approach to p removal exist 1 biological and 2 physico chemical the biological approach takes advantage of the ability of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in the activated sludge to remove phosphorus from solution under alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions low cost and good performance have led to wide application in wastewater treatment yang et al 2017 however precise control of operational parameters such as temperature sludge retention time and carbon source are crucial for high p removal rate zuthi et al 2013 the physico chemical approach typically involves coagulation and flocculation and in practice is frequently applied in combination with biological processes or as a supplement to enhance phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment commonly used coagulants include salts and polyelectrolytes of iron and aluminum such as ferrous sulfate banu et al 2008 ferric chloride zhou et al 2008 and polyaluminum chloride wang et al 2005 however the associated anions such as cl and so4 2 may potentially cause problems like scale formation reduction to toxic forms particularly so4 2 to hydrogen sulfide h2s and corrosion and high possibility of excessive dosage would cause a waste of resources and influence the coagulation performance to avoid those problems in situ generation of iron or aluminum cations through the dissolution of the elemental form from the metal has been investigated kim et al 2010 wu et al 2013 and iron has been flagged as promising cost effective considering both its high phosphorus removal efficiency and low commercial price though methods should be taken to avoid or suppress the precipitation on electrode especially anode in the meanwhile particulate zero valent iron dissolves under acidic conditions with generation of fe2 ions was previously shown to facilitate phosphorus removal yoshino and kawase 2013 however in using this approach there are difficulties in controlling the generation rate of fe2 and resultant dosage to the wastewater stream particularly as a result of likely fluctuations in ph as an alternative direct current electric field mediated oxidative dissolution of elemental iron anodes may be used to produce fe2 ions at the anode with this approach shown to be effective in removing phosphorus zhang et al 2015 the electrochemical generation of fe2 ions would be expected to obey faraday s law zhang et al 2014 with the possibility of controlling both the total dosage and the dosing rate by control of the electric current there has been some attempt to delineate the key factors influencing phosphorus removal via in situ fe2 generation with studies of the effect of bulk solution ph initial phosphorus concentration and the electric field conditions irdemez et al 2006a 2006b li et al 2013 but the initial phosphorus concentrations were much higher than that of the typical municipal wastewaters besides phosphorus removal by in situ electrochemical fe2 generation has been proposed to be via adsorption on fe ii solid phase or following oxidation fe iii hydrolysis products el shazly and daous 2013 wan et al 2011 which was similar to the dominate mechanisms of ferric fe iii salt dosing smith et al 2008 however since the in situ fe2 is continuously generated in unhydrated forms and alkalinity is generated simultaneously much uncertainty remains regarding in depth analysis of the removal mechanisms especially the role of ph fe ii hydration and oxidation moreover it was reported that the phosphorus removal efficiency achieved by in situ fe2 generation was higher than that achieved by addition of iron salts with the possibility of formation of iron phosphate minerals lacasa et al 2011 in this study fe2 ions were generated in situ at a stainless steel anode and applied to the removal of phosphorus at concentrations representative of typical domestic wastewaters the effectiveness of p removal was investigated as a function of iron dosage with particular attention given to the kinetics of p removal thermodynamics of solid phase formation efficiency of iron usage and underlying mechanism of removal 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental operation solutions were prepared containing background electrolyte of 10 mm nacl and 2 mm nahco3 with soluble phosphorous kh2po4 concentrations ranging from 30 3 μm to 200 μm solutions were subsequently adjusted to ph 7 0 using hcl for oxic cases a stirring rate of 200 rpm resulted in dissolved oxygen do concentrations over 2 mg l for anoxic cases sparging with nitrogen gas at an intensity of 1 65 l min with stirring 70 rpm resulted in a do concentration less than 0 5 mg l experiments were conducted after a stable do condition was obtained in order to make it amenable to analysis of mechanisms and further extension to complex situation it should be noted that buffer was not used in this research to maintain ph an electric field was applied for in situ fe2 generation with direct current dc applied through two flat mesh electrodes submerged in the kh2po4 solution in a 2 l beaker fig 1 the anode was made of stainless steel and the cathode titanium each with dimension of 110 mm 160 mm with distance between the electrodes of 70 mm to keep the two electrodes stand well in parallel the perforated electrodes could avoid large space occupation and the precipitation on electrodes was minimized based on preliminary experiments studies were undertaken at currents of 0 07 0 12 0 21 and 0 42 a after calibration for designated hydraulic retention time less than or around 1 h no fluctuation of current was observed during the experiment in addition to studies of in situ fe2 comparative studies were undertaken using the widely used iron based coagulants feso4 and fecl3 stock solutions of 0 33 m feso4 and fecl3 were prepared fifty μl of the stock solution was dosed every 15 s into the bulk solution so that the average iron dosing rate in each case was similar to the release rate of the in situ fe2 at a current of 0 2 a 2 2 measurement and analysis two samples of the solution were taken at designated times during the experiment with one of these samples filtered immediately through a membrane with pore size of 0 22 μm analysis of the filtrate was conducted immediately the concentration of residual phosphorus was determined using a standard method apha et al 2005 the concentration of total residual iron ions was determined by icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo electron corporation usa and residual ferrous iron was determined using the ferrozine method stookey 1970 wang and waite 2010 the filter membrane containing retained solid was vacuum dried at room temperature to prevent the oxidation of fe ii species as much as possible and the dry solid substances present analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany but oxidation on the sample surface might occur before the drying machine completely vacuumed and during the transfer the second sample was immediately sealed in order to maintain the do conditions and was used to determine the mean particle size with either a mastersizer ls 13320 ulm2 beckman coulter usa or a zetasizer delsa nano c beckman coulter usa for particles larger and less than 10 μm respectively the ph and do content of the solution were determined by portable ph meter sevengo ph sg2 mettler toledo switzerland and portable do meter sevengo s40 mettler toledo switzerland respectively over the course of the experiment thermodynamic analysis of the solution phase was conducted by modelling using the geochemical simulation software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 p removal by in situ fe2 and iron salts 3 1 1 p removal efficiency the rate and extent of reduction in phosphorus concentration by in situ fe2 injection and dosing of fe ii and fe iii salts differed markedly in situ dosing under oxic and anoxic conditions yielded quite similar removal behavior to fecl3 dosing under oxic conditions with all of these configurations being substantially more effective than dosing of feso4 under either oxic or anoxic conditions fig 2 a with 30 min of dosing accumulated iron dosage of 990 μm an initial p concentration of 100 μm was reduced to a residual of 0 8 μm after in situ fe2 dosing under both anoxic and oxic conditions and of 2 5 μm after fecl3 dosing whereas the residual phosphorus concentrations after feso4 dosing were 29 2 μm and 50 9 μm under oxic and anoxic conditions respectively thus in situ fe2 dosing yielded a higher phosphorus removal efficiency 99 than feso4 49 under anoxic and 71 under oxic conditions and was similar to that achieved for fecl3 dosing 94 for in situ fe ii dosing similar p removal was achieved under both oxic and anoxic conditions whereas oxic conditions imparted a substantial improvement in p removal compared to anoxic conditions for feso4 dosing the presence of o2 and the resulting oxidation of fe ii to fe iii appears to have more impact when fe ii is dosed as feso4 rather than injected in situ as will be discussed later in section 3 2 2 this situation is likely related to the very different ph environments of the in situ and salt dosing cases the total amount of p removed per unit of fe accumulation in the system termed here as iron efficiency tended to initially increase in all cases fig 2b this was particularly marked for the in situ dosing cases where a peak value for fe efficiency was achieved after an fe accumulation of 160 μm in the anoxic case and after 320 μm in the oxic case dosing with fecl3 resulted in initially high fe efficiency compared to the fe ii dosing cases both in situ and salt likely due to the fast precipitation rates of fe iii oxides pham et al 2006 capacity for coprecipitation at the initially high p concentrations waychunas et al 1993 and fast particle growth bligh and waite 2010 at circumneutral ph the iron efficiency in the fe ii salt dosing cases remained at low levels after the initial period of increase reflecting the essentially linear relationship between p removal and fe accumulation over the course of dosing fig 2a 3 1 2 filterable iron iron in the aliquots after passing through the 0 22 μm filter was either dissolved or present as small colloids during the early stages of fe accumulation it was conceivable that a substantial proportion of the solid phase fe was filterable due to the likely kinetic limitations on particle growth at low fe concentrations the dissolved phase was expected to be almost 100 fe ii because of the extremely low solubility of hfo at circumneutral ph however substantial fe iii was also present in all samples with no discernible differences between oxic and anoxic cases this was likely due to the passage of colloidal fe iii which under anoxic conditions resulted from the almost unavoidable oxidation of a small portion of fe ii due to adventitious o2 ingress during the experiment and sample handling in the case of in situ fe ii dosing anoxic conditions resulted in a decline in filterable fe to concentrations below 1 μm fig 3 compared to oxic conditions where filterable fe concentrations were an order of magnitude greater this result seems somewhat counterintuitive since dissolved fe ii concentrations under anoxic conditions would be expected to be much higher fe ii oxidation under oxic conditions with ph ranging between 7 and 8 5 fig 4 a was expected to be rapid though with the rate limited by the relatively slow rate of o2 diffusion from the atmosphere as indicated by the continuous decrease in do fig 4b formation of retainable solid phase under anoxic conditions appeared to be at least as fast as the rate of fe ii injection with solubility of the solid phase maintaining low dissolved fe ii concentrations certainly the solid phase formed during in situ dosing was capable of forming large particles as fe accumulation increased fig 4c further consideration of the likely solid phases formed in the in situ cases is provided in section 3 2 dosing of fe iii or fe ii salts led to increases in filterable fe with increased fe accumulation especially in the case of fe ii salt dosing where almost all of the dosed fe ii passed through the filters at high fe accumulation levels fig 3 initially the amount of filterable fe during fe iii dosing was the lowest of all the cases likely due to the high polymerization and particle formation rates of hfo at circumneutral ph however substantial ph decrease fig 4a due to fe iii hydrolysis could reduce the size of stable aggregates therefore increase passage through the filter with reduction in measured particle size at high fe accumulation fig 4c dosing of fe ii salts also led to ph declines fig 4a though not to the same extent as fe iii dosing this ph range ph 7 to 6 5 was apparently accompanied by severe limitation to the formation of a retainable fe ii solid phase under anoxic conditions the situation was likely similar under oxic conditions since the fe ii oxidation rate in this ph range was relatively slow pham and waite 2008 and the measured do levels under oxic conditions remained just below saturation throughout the experiment fig 4b see section 3 2 2 for further discussion 3 1 3 effect of initial p concentration and current on p removal during in situ fe ii dosing investigation at three concentrations of initial p 30 100 200 μm using four levels of current 0 07 0 12 0 21 0 42 a under oxic and anoxic conditions fig s1 achieved excellent p removal in all cases table s1 as expected higher initial p required greater fe accumulation longer current loading times with greater removal achieved at lower initial p levels faster removal rate was observed by in situ fe ii under anoxic conditions compared with oxic conditions table s2 suggesting that the solid phase resulting from anoxic conditions had a greater capacity to sequester p and be retained by the filter and concomitantly generated lower levels of filterable fe fig 3 when p removal was plotted as a function of fe accumulation fig 5 there was a notable convergence of all the plots at different currents for each initial p concentration under oxic and anoxic conditions demonstrating that p removal for any condition was dependent solely on fe accumulation and was a function of time only through its relationship to fe accumulation at any current this result has potentially important implications for deductions regarding the mechanism controlling solid phase formation and p removal in this dynamic system where fe ii was being continually injected and subsequently involved in solid phase formation particle formation and p incorporation adsorption kinetic aspects of these reactions might well be expected to play an important role in the reaction outcomes and for there to be a time dependence of the concentrations of the reaction products taking the following reactions as examples 1 fe 2 o 2 fe 3 2 fe 3 oh feooh 3 feooh po 4 3 feooh po 4 therefore for any period of input of a given quantity of fe to the system further progression of reactions would be expected if the quantity of fe was supplied over a longer period for example at a lower current an obvious example was fe ii oxidation under oxic conditions where the extent of oxidation would be expected to be greater when fe ii was supplied at lower current since a greater proportion of the fe ii could oxidize and greater amounts of o2 could diffuse into the system p adsorption might also be expected to be time dependent since longer contact between the bulk solution and the adsorbing surfaces would result in greater adsorption however this was not the case fig 5 and kinetic limitations did not appear to influence the key reactions associated with p removal the following conclusions based on the pattern of dependence of p removal on fe accumulation fig 5 could be made with regard to the reactions expected to be occurring in the oxic and anoxic cases 1 the reactions involved in formation of the solid phase s responsible for p removal were sufficiently rapid such that even at the highest current 0 42 a the reactants were maintained at sufficiently low concentrations such that there was little difference to results obtained at lower currents 2 the mechanism of p uptake was more likely to involve coprecipitation and incorporation into the formation of solid phase rather than adsorption to the prior produced solid phase due to the independence on fe ii dosing rate directly depended on current the actual interaction of p with the solid phase could well be an adsorption phenomenon where p adsorbs to nano sized crystallites which then aggregate to form larger solid phase assemblages whose vastly reduced accessible surface area continues to adsorb only minimal p differences between coprecipitation and adsorption become difficult to discern and define for such reaction pathways smith et al 2008 voegelin et al 2013 oxidation of fe ii under oxic conditions was likely to be rapid as ph increased to 8 26 if the reaction of fe ii with o2 was rapid o2 diffusion would limit the rate of oxidation and a time dependence might be expected however this effect might be minimal if the rate of oxidation at the lowest do concentration was still rapid enough to keep up with fe2 supply there was a suggestion from the oxic plots of fig 5 of slightly improved removal at lower current 3 2 expected reactions and solid formation 3 2 1 changes to system conditions during experiments due to continuous dosing of either fe ii or fe iii and associated anions into the experimental system there were concomitant changes in a number of important parameters 1 the ratio between dissolved p and fe flux 2 ph fig 4a and 3 dissolved oxygen fig 4b 3 2 2 possible key fe transformations the initial reactions of fe upon addition to this aqueous system will depend primarily on the redox status of the inflowing fe and the ph and the do concentration in the system the last only being relevant to fe ii dosing over the ph range measured in the cases involving fe ii dosing ph 6 3 to 9 2 fe2 was the dominant hydrolysis species pk a 9 5 h2po4 along with hpo4 2 will dominate at the initial ph of 7 prior to any sparging given the pk a of the h2po4 hpo4 2 acid base pair of 7 2 in the in situ fe ii dosing cases where ph increased hpo4 2 would predominate whereas in the salt dosing systems where ph decreased h2po4 would predominate 3 2 2 1 anoxic in situ fe ii dosing in the absence of o2 in the system fe ii might possibly associate with hpo4 2 or oh to form the solid phases vivianite or ferrous hydroxide respectively siderite formation was precluded since co3 2 had been stripped by sparging formulas for the formation of these solid phases are shown in table 1 and expressed in terms of the species present in the ph range of interest it can be seen that formation becomes more favourable as ph increases for both of these phases also fe2 and oh were being injected into the system in the same stoichiometry as ferrous hydroxide suggesting that formation of ferrous hydroxide was likely regarding vivianite and ferrous hydroxide the relative formation of these phases depended on the degree of supersaturation and the kinetics of formation little is known regarding the kinetics of formation of fe ii solid phases especially the role that ph plays the condensation of hydroxylated ferrous ions is known to be highly sensitive to ph and is expected to occur via an olation mechanism jolivet et al 2004 in a similar manner to that for fe iii oxyhydroxides however the extent of hydroxylation of fe ii was limited within the experimental ph range of these studies and therefore solid hydroxide formation rates were expected to be much slower than for fe iii both slow and fast vivianite formation rates have been previously reported brady et al 2017 emerson and widmer 1978 3 2 2 2 oxic in situ fe ii dosing while receiving the same inputs of fe2 and oh ions from the electrodes as the anoxic case the oxic case differed due to the diffusion of o2 and co2 gas from the atmosphere into the system by continuous stirring the presence of o2 was expected to have a major impact via the oxidation of fe ii especially as the ph increase during the experiment fig s2 would have led to markedly increased rates of fe ii oxidation and has resulted in a continuous decline of do throughout dosing fig 4b at the final ph fe ii was expected to have a half life of 1 min under o2 saturation pham and waite 2008 therefore despite the decrease in do during the experiment to less than half saturation fig 4b fe2 was maintained at a low concentration due to oxidation fig 3 formation of the solid phases of vivianite ferrous hydroxide or siderite was unlikely to compete with fe ii oxidation under these oxic and alkaline conditions voegelin et al 2013 coprecipitation of fe iii resulting from oxidation with phosphate during the initial dosing period when the phosphate concentration was substantially greater than that of fe iii would have provided the greatest opportunity for any formation of ferric phosphate phases tokoro et al 2009 despite the profound effects of the presence of o2 on the formation of fe solid phases in the in situ fe ii dosing system it was remarkable that the pattern of p removal was very similar in the anoxic and oxic cases fig 2 3 2 2 3 anoxic fe ii salt dosing in contrast to in situ fe ii dosing fe ii salt dosing resulted in a ph decrease fig 4a in the anoxic case fe ii oxidation cannot occur although a small amount of oxidation due to adventitious oxygen ingress is likely to have occurred and therefore only fe ii solid phases would be expected to form under the initially high ph conditions ph 9 2 fe oh 2 formation would have been possible along with vivianite however as ph decreased finally to ph 6 4 only vivianite formation would have been thermodynamically feasible and therefore appeared to be the likely solid phase forming in the anoxic case of fe ii salt dosing 3 2 2 4 oxic fe ii salt dosing the ph decrease resulting from fe ii salt dosing resulted in much slower oxidation kinetics compared with the in situ fe ii dosing cases due to the dependence of oxidation rate on ph at the final ph of 6 3 the half life of fe ii undergoing homogeneous oxidation was 200 min compared with 1 min at ph 8 3 pham and waite 2008 at the end of in situ dosing assuming all dosed fe ii was available for reaction with o2 and the decrease in the first order rate constant as a function of ph was linear then 70 μm of fe iii will be formed by the end of the experiment 1000 μm of fe accumulation this level of fe iii formation is consistent with the additional p removal of 20 μm of p under oxic conditions compared to the anoxic case fig 2a and the resultant fe iii p ratio of 3 4 voegelin et al 2013 however the ph of the oxic case is only 0 2 units lower than the ph of the anoxic case suggesting limited fe iii hydrolysis also given that formation of an fe ii solid phase via the same reactions of the anoxic case is expected to be concomitant with oxidation a substantial proportion of the dosed fe ii was not expected to be available for homogeneous oxidation 3 2 2 5 fe iii salt dosing on dosing fe iii rapidly hydrolyses and releases protons leading to ph decrease as measured in the decline from the initial ph of 7 to a final ph of 3 5 along with a decreased rate of polymerization of the fe iii hydrolysis species however even at low ph the polymerization is fast with the second order rate constant decreasing from 106 m 1s 1 at ph 7 to 103 5 m 1s 1 at ph 3 5 pham et al 2006 as ph decreased the size of stable aggregate decreased substantially due to greater repulsive forces resulting from the increasing positive surface charge gilbert et al 2007 fe iii monomeric oligomeric and polymeric species were more likely to associate with phosphate at lower fe p ratios and at lower ph initially the fe p ratio was low at ph 7 and with further addition of fe iii it increased and ph decreased whether ferric phosphates similar to amorphous strengite would form under these conditions in preference to surface complexes on fe oxides is unclear in operations for p removal via fe iii salt dosing adsorption of p to fe oxides was recognized to be an important or the major mechanism smith et al 2008 3 2 3 solid phase fe and p resulting anoxic in situ fe ii dosing in light of the promising levels of p removal by in situ fe ii dosing the nature of the solid phases and the mechanisms of p removal are of interest in comparison to the anoxic case the oxic case is more complex due to the inclusion of fe ii oxidation reactions that may potentially involve both dissolved and solid phase fe ii and fe iii species and as such is less amenable to analysis therefore the anoxic case will be considered here along with any extension of insights to the oxic case solid phase identification using xrd was not possible due to the amorphous nature of the solids formed fig s3 nevertheless some deductions may be made regarding the nature of the solids formed in the anoxic case from the dissolved fe and p data fig 6 a the fe and p content of the solid phase retained by the filter 0 22 μm can be calculated assuming all the retained p was as vivianite excess fe must be associated with some other fe ii solid phase most likely ferrous hydroxide based on these calculations the formation rates of the two solid phases expressed as the unit of solid fe formed per unit of fe accumulated have been plotted fig 6b it is clear that vivianite formation cannot account for all the solid fe even during the period of maximum p removal note that the total solid formation rate exceeded one during the period between 65 and 163 μm due to a decrease in dissolved fe adding to the solid formation ferrous hydroxide is the most likely solid phase accounting for the fe in excess of maximal vivianite formation in the case that vivianite did not form p must be associated with the ferrous hydroxide either in adsorbed or coprecipitated form thermodynamic analysis in the next section will provide further insight into likely reactions 3 3 thermodynamic modelling 3 3 1 saturation indices of final anoxic solutions thermodynamic analysis of the solution phase at the termination of dosing provides insight into possible solid phase formation the effective saturation index si provides a normalization of solid phase sis by accounting for the dependency of sis on the mole formula where si was calculated as log iap k sp where iap is the ion activity product the product of the activities of the ions that constitute the mineral and k sp is the solubility product for that mineral derived from prior studies the effective si is calculated by dividing the si by the number of ions that react to form the solid expressed by the mole formula lothenbach et al 2008 in this case sis for vivianite and ferrous hydroxide were divided by 5 and 3 respectively following anoxic in situ fe ii dosing vivianite was undersaturated while ferrous hydroxide was very close to zero table 2 strongly suggesting that ferrous hydroxide solubility was controlling the dissolved fe ii concentration and ph ferrous hydroxide formation was expected given the continuous input of fe2 and oh ions from the electrodes the final ph in the absence of fe oh 2 formation would be expected to be 10 6 therefore the measured ph of 9 2 indicated that consumption of oh had occurred most likely as a result of fe oh 2 formation conversely following anoxic fe ii salt dosing vivianite was oversaturated and ferrous hydroxide undersaturated table 2 formation of ferrous hydroxide was not expected below ph 7 5 vivianite oversaturation indicated that its formation was thermodynamically favorable however there appeared to be kinetic limitations to formation of this solid more investigations for instance an extension of the experimental time could be conducted aiming at insights of the kinetics 3 3 2 thermodynamic modelling of anoxic in situ fe ii dosing case thermodynamic modelling of the anoxic in situ fe ii case during dosing enables investigation of possible solid formation pathways under various scenarios expected to provide further insight into the likely solid formation reactions and therefore the likely p removal mechanism s as has previously been noted section 3 1 3 kinetic factors appear to play an insignificant role in solid formation outcomes modelling was undertaken using the davies equation to account for non ideal effects of ionic interactions the solution composition prior to ph adjustment section 2 1 was used as the starting point in the reaction series the degree to which co2 equilibration with the atmosphere has occurred is an important aspect in calculation of the solution composition in the anoxic case continuous n2 sparging would have stripped co2 from the system therefore the solution was equilibrated to very low co2 10 10 atm which resulted in a ph 9 2 prior to the commencement of dosing fig 4a it should be noted that in the oxic cases atmospheric equilibration during dosing will have occurred to some extent as is evident from the measured do concentration fig 4b as identified previously in section 3 2 3 vivianite and ferrous hydroxide were the only fe ii solid phases likely to form in the anoxic in situ fe ii dosing case only solid phase formation reactions were modelled such that p removal occurred only through vivianite formation other p removal mechanisms such as coprecipitation and adsorption were not included since they are inherently variable processes and little is known with regards to ferrous hydroxide interactions with phosphate four scenarios were considered 1 only ferrous hydroxide forms 2 vivianite forms preferentially 3 vivianite and ferrous hydroxide form and equilibrate with each other 4 ferrous hydroxide forms preferentially where a solid phase forms preferentially the solution was first equilibrated to this solid phase and then to the second phase the modelled outcomes of these scenarios are shown in fig 7 formation of ferrous hydroxide alone fig 7a results in nearly 100 of dosed fe contributing to solid formation as such this is also the case for all scenarios since any fe that does not precipitate as vivianite will go on to form ferrous hydroxide an equilibrium fe ii concentration of 0 5 μm and ph of 9 20 determined by the solubility of ferrous hydroxide is immediately established being identical to final measured values table 2 no p removal has occurred since vivianite was not formed however the experimental p removal pattern could have resulted from coprecipitation or adsorption reactions preferential formation of vivianite fig 7b results in substantial vivianite formation and associated p removal during the initial 100 μm of fe accumulation while vivianite and ferrous hydroxide formation together fig 7c resulted in substantially less vivianite formation vivianite formation had the effect of raising ph and lowering fe ii concentration while the formation reaction involving hpo4 2 results in h production table 1 the consumption of fe2 shifts the stoichiometry of the ferrous hydroxide solubility product such that there is an increased oh concentration at the solubility limit and therefore an increased ph with preferential vivianite formation the ph increased to 10 3 much higher than the measured ph of 9 2 even the small amount of vivianite formed together with ferrous hydroxide increased the ph to 9 5 considering the modeled outcomes together with the previous effective si calculations in relation to the experimental results the following points can be made 1 ferrous hydroxide could possibly be the only solid formed with p removal occurring via coprecipitation and or adsorption though little is known regarding the interactions of ferrous hydroxide and phosphate 2 ph during in situ dosing is sensitive to the effect of vivianite formation and the close proximity of the final measured ph of 9 2 to that expected at the solubility limit for ferrous hydroxide with 1 2 stoichiometry of fe2 and oh ions suggests that the extent of any vivianite formation is minimal 3 3 3 thermodynamic modelling of anoxic fe ii salt dosing case modelling of the anoxic fe ii salt dosing case showed that initially the solution was oversaturated with respect to both vivianite and ferrous hydroxide and therefore a small amount of ferrous hydroxide formation may have occurred however following an initial fe accumulation of 65 μm the potential for ferrous hydroxide formation was negligible the effect of vivianite formation on ph is clear when the modelled outcome is compared to the case where only ferrous hydroxide is allowed to form fig 8 the final modelled ph of 5 5 is substantially lower than the measured ph of 6 5 suggesting that vivianite did not form to the extent of achieving thermodynamic equilibrium and therefore that vivianite formation was kinetically limited the measured vivianite oversaturation table 2 supports this interpretation which is also consistent with the higher measured residual p 51 μm fig 2 compared to the modelled outcome 41 μm fig 8 3 4 implications for operational implementation comparable p removal of in situ fe ii dosing under oxic and anoxic conditions despite the apparently different pathways of solid formation and p removal suggests useful versatility of the process in situ fe ii dosing could be used in conjunction with enhanced biological p removal ebpr to either supplement p removal during the aerobic phase or to immobilize p released by paos during an anaerobic phase the continuous generation of alkalinity is likely to be advantageous for maintaining nitrification and also helpful for maintaining high ph levels that favour paos over glycogen accumulating organisms gao that compete for carbon substrates oehmen et al 2005 besides versatility and precise control of in situ fe ii dosing can potentially play an important role in facilitating the development of robust p recovery processes further understanding of the mechanisms is required with regard to the impact of steady or buffered ph and organics including colloids in real wastewater treatment using in situ fe ii dosing the relatively steady ph of the mixed liquor which is much lower than it achieved in this research might lead to slower hydrolysis of fe ii and fe iii ions and oxidation rate of fe ii species and therefore fe solid formation pathways and mechanisms of p removal might be switched organic compounds have a myriad of impacts on fe transformations through processes of complexation adsorption and redox activity which might influence the oxidation rates of fe ii fe iii transformations and the characteristics and adsorption properties of any fe oxides formed recent work has shown that the reactivity of fe iii oxides is both enhanced and prolonged when formed in the presence of mixed liquor supernatant bligh et al 2017 besides colloids would influence the p removal through impacts on coagulation and flocculation clearly there needs adequate research on impacts of ph and organics on the p removal efficacy and the nature of the fep products with in situ fe ii dosing into synthetic and real wastewater before application moreover optimization of fe p ratio for higher removal efficiency and feasible p recovery would be conducted under real wastewater conditions ph organics and varied operational regimes agitation and sedimentation further investigation of operational parameters would be undertaken in terms of practical application such as current affecting the release rate of fe distance between electrodes affecting the applied voltage the scale of the experimental set ups and the designated removal efficiency of phosphorus besides the estimation of operational cost would also be conducted in further research with larger scale application pilot scale for instance 4 conclusions in situ fe ii dosing has been shown through this study to achieve highly efficient p removal under both anoxic and oxic conditions with p removal patterns in both cases being similar to that achieved by ferric salt dosing continuous injection of alkalinity from in situ fe ii dosing raised the system ph substantially without buffer under anoxic conditions this appears to have strongly promoted ferrous hydroxide formation under oxic conditions fe ii oxidation was rapid and limited by o2 diffusion from the atmosphere with fe iii oxyhydroxide formation expected in contrast fe ii salt dosing lowered the system ph resulting in slow oxidation and primarily vivianite formation p removal patterns for in situ fe ii dosing under both anoxic and oxic conditions were remarkably independent of current and were nearly identical for a given initial p concentration when plotted as a function of fe accumulation with this result showing that the extent of p removal depended only on the amount of fe accumulated in the system rather than the time in contact with that fe this result indicates that kinetic factors did not play a role in determining p removal outcomes and that the solid formation and p removal reactions must have been fast and limited only by fe input to the system these results suggest that the p removal mechanisms involved coprecipitation either with ferrous hydroxide under anoxic conditions or with ferric oxyhydroxide under oxic conditions formation of ferrous hydroxide with minimal vivianite formation during in situ fe ii dosing under anoxic conditions is supported by the following 1 the fe p ratio of the retained solid phase indicated that an fe ii solid phase other than vivianite must have been forming 2 the measured final ph was equal to that expected for ferrous hydroxide formation only 3 the dissolved species of the final sample were in equilibrium with ferrous hydroxide and undersaturated with respect to vivianite the fep product resulting from p removal was expected to have changed as the dissolved fe p ratio increased during dosing due to continuous fe accumulation and p removal the dominant p removal mechanisms in each of the fe ii dosing scenarios were concluded to be 1 coprecipitation and or adsorption with ferrous hydroxide for anoxic in situ fe ii dosing 2 coprecipitation and or adsorption with ferric oxyhydroxides with possible ferric phosphate formation during early dosing due to low fe p ratio for oxic in situ fe ii dosing 3 vivianite formation for anoxic fe ii salt dosing 4 vivianite formation and either coprecipitation with fe iii oxyhydroxides or ferric phosphate formation for oxic fe ii salt dosing in situ fe ii dosing represents a versatile option for chemical p removal with rapid removal efficiency precise control of fe dosing and absence of additional unwanted anions or consumption of alkalinity amenable situations without ph buffer and organics were applied to achieve the p removal mechanisms in this study and an extension of these mechanisms using synthetic and real wastewater is expected in further study before application acknowledgement

19652,the application of in situ electrochemical generation of ferrous fe ii ions for phosphorus p removal in wastewater treatment was investigated with attention to the efficacy kinetics and mechanism at concentrations typical of municipal wastewater p could be removed by in situ fe ii with removal efficiency higher than achieved on addition of feso4 and close to that of fecl3 under both anoxic and oxic conditions the generation of alkalinity due to water electrolysis at the cathode created much higher ph conditions compared to feso4 dosing thereby resulting in very different pathways of fe solid phase formation and associated p removal mechanisms the remarkably similar dependence of p removal on accumulated fe for all investigated currents initial p concentrations and do conditions indicated that kinetic aspects did not play a role in p removal during in situ fe ii dosing thermodynamic modelling was undertaken to investigate possible solid phase formation pathways under anoxic conditions and these insights were extended to oxic conditions the exclusive formation of ferrous hydroxide during anoxic in situ fe ii dosing implied that p removal occurred via coprecipitation and adsorption under oxic conditions the high ph conditions would have resulted in rapid fe ii oxidation and formation of ferric oxyhydroxides with associated coprecipitation and adsorption effecting p removal in a similar pattern to that observed under anoxic conditions in situ fe ii dosing represents a versatile option for chemical p removal with the precise control of fe dosage to optimize fep forms for possible p recovery graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus ferrous iron in situ kinetics efficiency mechanism 1 introduction the discharge of phosphorus p from human activity into water bodies results in environmental problems including eutrophication and occurrence of potentially harmful algal blooms medeiros and molot 2006 sun and liu 2016 in view of this there has been extensive research into phosphorus removal from wastewaters two categories of approach to p removal exist 1 biological and 2 physico chemical the biological approach takes advantage of the ability of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in the activated sludge to remove phosphorus from solution under alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions low cost and good performance have led to wide application in wastewater treatment yang et al 2017 however precise control of operational parameters such as temperature sludge retention time and carbon source are crucial for high p removal rate zuthi et al 2013 the physico chemical approach typically involves coagulation and flocculation and in practice is frequently applied in combination with biological processes or as a supplement to enhance phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment commonly used coagulants include salts and polyelectrolytes of iron and aluminum such as ferrous sulfate banu et al 2008 ferric chloride zhou et al 2008 and polyaluminum chloride wang et al 2005 however the associated anions such as cl and so4 2 may potentially cause problems like scale formation reduction to toxic forms particularly so4 2 to hydrogen sulfide h2s and corrosion and high possibility of excessive dosage would cause a waste of resources and influence the coagulation performance to avoid those problems in situ generation of iron or aluminum cations through the dissolution of the elemental form from the metal has been investigated kim et al 2010 wu et al 2013 and iron has been flagged as promising cost effective considering both its high phosphorus removal efficiency and low commercial price though methods should be taken to avoid or suppress the precipitation on electrode especially anode in the meanwhile particulate zero valent iron dissolves under acidic conditions with generation of fe2 ions was previously shown to facilitate phosphorus removal yoshino and kawase 2013 however in using this approach there are difficulties in controlling the generation rate of fe2 and resultant dosage to the wastewater stream particularly as a result of likely fluctuations in ph as an alternative direct current electric field mediated oxidative dissolution of elemental iron anodes may be used to produce fe2 ions at the anode with this approach shown to be effective in removing phosphorus zhang et al 2015 the electrochemical generation of fe2 ions would be expected to obey faraday s law zhang et al 2014 with the possibility of controlling both the total dosage and the dosing rate by control of the electric current there has been some attempt to delineate the key factors influencing phosphorus removal via in situ fe2 generation with studies of the effect of bulk solution ph initial phosphorus concentration and the electric field conditions irdemez et al 2006a 2006b li et al 2013 but the initial phosphorus concentrations were much higher than that of the typical municipal wastewaters besides phosphorus removal by in situ electrochemical fe2 generation has been proposed to be via adsorption on fe ii solid phase or following oxidation fe iii hydrolysis products el shazly and daous 2013 wan et al 2011 which was similar to the dominate mechanisms of ferric fe iii salt dosing smith et al 2008 however since the in situ fe2 is continuously generated in unhydrated forms and alkalinity is generated simultaneously much uncertainty remains regarding in depth analysis of the removal mechanisms especially the role of ph fe ii hydration and oxidation moreover it was reported that the phosphorus removal efficiency achieved by in situ fe2 generation was higher than that achieved by addition of iron salts with the possibility of formation of iron phosphate minerals lacasa et al 2011 in this study fe2 ions were generated in situ at a stainless steel anode and applied to the removal of phosphorus at concentrations representative of typical domestic wastewaters the effectiveness of p removal was investigated as a function of iron dosage with particular attention given to the kinetics of p removal thermodynamics of solid phase formation efficiency of iron usage and underlying mechanism of removal 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental operation solutions were prepared containing background electrolyte of 10 mm nacl and 2 mm nahco3 with soluble phosphorous kh2po4 concentrations ranging from 30 3 μm to 200 μm solutions were subsequently adjusted to ph 7 0 using hcl for oxic cases a stirring rate of 200 rpm resulted in dissolved oxygen do concentrations over 2 mg l for anoxic cases sparging with nitrogen gas at an intensity of 1 65 l min with stirring 70 rpm resulted in a do concentration less than 0 5 mg l experiments were conducted after a stable do condition was obtained in order to make it amenable to analysis of mechanisms and further extension to complex situation it should be noted that buffer was not used in this research to maintain ph an electric field was applied for in situ fe2 generation with direct current dc applied through two flat mesh electrodes submerged in the kh2po4 solution in a 2 l beaker fig 1 the anode was made of stainless steel and the cathode titanium each with dimension of 110 mm 160 mm with distance between the electrodes of 70 mm to keep the two electrodes stand well in parallel the perforated electrodes could avoid large space occupation and the precipitation on electrodes was minimized based on preliminary experiments studies were undertaken at currents of 0 07 0 12 0 21 and 0 42 a after calibration for designated hydraulic retention time less than or around 1 h no fluctuation of current was observed during the experiment in addition to studies of in situ fe2 comparative studies were undertaken using the widely used iron based coagulants feso4 and fecl3 stock solutions of 0 33 m feso4 and fecl3 were prepared fifty μl of the stock solution was dosed every 15 s into the bulk solution so that the average iron dosing rate in each case was similar to the release rate of the in situ fe2 at a current of 0 2 a 2 2 measurement and analysis two samples of the solution were taken at designated times during the experiment with one of these samples filtered immediately through a membrane with pore size of 0 22 μm analysis of the filtrate was conducted immediately the concentration of residual phosphorus was determined using a standard method apha et al 2005 the concentration of total residual iron ions was determined by icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo electron corporation usa and residual ferrous iron was determined using the ferrozine method stookey 1970 wang and waite 2010 the filter membrane containing retained solid was vacuum dried at room temperature to prevent the oxidation of fe ii species as much as possible and the dry solid substances present analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany but oxidation on the sample surface might occur before the drying machine completely vacuumed and during the transfer the second sample was immediately sealed in order to maintain the do conditions and was used to determine the mean particle size with either a mastersizer ls 13320 ulm2 beckman coulter usa or a zetasizer delsa nano c beckman coulter usa for particles larger and less than 10 μm respectively the ph and do content of the solution were determined by portable ph meter sevengo ph sg2 mettler toledo switzerland and portable do meter sevengo s40 mettler toledo switzerland respectively over the course of the experiment thermodynamic analysis of the solution phase was conducted by modelling using the geochemical simulation software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 3 results and discussion 3 1 p removal by in situ fe2 and iron salts 3 1 1 p removal efficiency the rate and extent of reduction in phosphorus concentration by in situ fe2 injection and dosing of fe ii and fe iii salts differed markedly in situ dosing under oxic and anoxic conditions yielded quite similar removal behavior to fecl3 dosing under oxic conditions with all of these configurations being substantially more effective than dosing of feso4 under either oxic or anoxic conditions fig 2 a with 30 min of dosing accumulated iron dosage of 990 μm an initial p concentration of 100 μm was reduced to a residual of 0 8 μm after in situ fe2 dosing under both anoxic and oxic conditions and of 2 5 μm after fecl3 dosing whereas the residual phosphorus concentrations after feso4 dosing were 29 2 μm and 50 9 μm under oxic and anoxic conditions respectively thus in situ fe2 dosing yielded a higher phosphorus removal efficiency 99 than feso4 49 under anoxic and 71 under oxic conditions and was similar to that achieved for fecl3 dosing 94 for in situ fe ii dosing similar p removal was achieved under both oxic and anoxic conditions whereas oxic conditions imparted a substantial improvement in p removal compared to anoxic conditions for feso4 dosing the presence of o2 and the resulting oxidation of fe ii to fe iii appears to have more impact when fe ii is dosed as feso4 rather than injected in situ as will be discussed later in section 3 2 2 this situation is likely related to the very different ph environments of the in situ and salt dosing cases the total amount of p removed per unit of fe accumulation in the system termed here as iron efficiency tended to initially increase in all cases fig 2b this was particularly marked for the in situ dosing cases where a peak value for fe efficiency was achieved after an fe accumulation of 160 μm in the anoxic case and after 320 μm in the oxic case dosing with fecl3 resulted in initially high fe efficiency compared to the fe ii dosing cases both in situ and salt likely due to the fast precipitation rates of fe iii oxides pham et al 2006 capacity for coprecipitation at the initially high p concentrations waychunas et al 1993 and fast particle growth bligh and waite 2010 at circumneutral ph the iron efficiency in the fe ii salt dosing cases remained at low levels after the initial period of increase reflecting the essentially linear relationship between p removal and fe accumulation over the course of dosing fig 2a 3 1 2 filterable iron iron in the aliquots after passing through the 0 22 μm filter was either dissolved or present as small colloids during the early stages of fe accumulation it was conceivable that a substantial proportion of the solid phase fe was filterable due to the likely kinetic limitations on particle growth at low fe concentrations the dissolved phase was expected to be almost 100 fe ii because of the extremely low solubility of hfo at circumneutral ph however substantial fe iii was also present in all samples with no discernible differences between oxic and anoxic cases this was likely due to the passage of colloidal fe iii which under anoxic conditions resulted from the almost unavoidable oxidation of a small portion of fe ii due to adventitious o2 ingress during the experiment and sample handling in the case of in situ fe ii dosing anoxic conditions resulted in a decline in filterable fe to concentrations below 1 μm fig 3 compared to oxic conditions where filterable fe concentrations were an order of magnitude greater this result seems somewhat counterintuitive since dissolved fe ii concentrations under anoxic conditions would be expected to be much higher fe ii oxidation under oxic conditions with ph ranging between 7 and 8 5 fig 4 a was expected to be rapid though with the rate limited by the relatively slow rate of o2 diffusion from the atmosphere as indicated by the continuous decrease in do fig 4b formation of retainable solid phase under anoxic conditions appeared to be at least as fast as the rate of fe ii injection with solubility of the solid phase maintaining low dissolved fe ii concentrations certainly the solid phase formed during in situ dosing was capable of forming large particles as fe accumulation increased fig 4c further consideration of the likely solid phases formed in the in situ cases is provided in section 3 2 dosing of fe iii or fe ii salts led to increases in filterable fe with increased fe accumulation especially in the case of fe ii salt dosing where almost all of the dosed fe ii passed through the filters at high fe accumulation levels fig 3 initially the amount of filterable fe during fe iii dosing was the lowest of all the cases likely due to the high polymerization and particle formation rates of hfo at circumneutral ph however substantial ph decrease fig 4a due to fe iii hydrolysis could reduce the size of stable aggregates therefore increase passage through the filter with reduction in measured particle size at high fe accumulation fig 4c dosing of fe ii salts also led to ph declines fig 4a though not to the same extent as fe iii dosing this ph range ph 7 to 6 5 was apparently accompanied by severe limitation to the formation of a retainable fe ii solid phase under anoxic conditions the situation was likely similar under oxic conditions since the fe ii oxidation rate in this ph range was relatively slow pham and waite 2008 and the measured do levels under oxic conditions remained just below saturation throughout the experiment fig 4b see section 3 2 2 for further discussion 3 1 3 effect of initial p concentration and current on p removal during in situ fe ii dosing investigation at three concentrations of initial p 30 100 200 μm using four levels of current 0 07 0 12 0 21 0 42 a under oxic and anoxic conditions fig s1 achieved excellent p removal in all cases table s1 as expected higher initial p required greater fe accumulation longer current loading times with greater removal achieved at lower initial p levels faster removal rate was observed by in situ fe ii under anoxic conditions compared with oxic conditions table s2 suggesting that the solid phase resulting from anoxic conditions had a greater capacity to sequester p and be retained by the filter and concomitantly generated lower levels of filterable fe fig 3 when p removal was plotted as a function of fe accumulation fig 5 there was a notable convergence of all the plots at different currents for each initial p concentration under oxic and anoxic conditions demonstrating that p removal for any condition was dependent solely on fe accumulation and was a function of time only through its relationship to fe accumulation at any current this result has potentially important implications for deductions regarding the mechanism controlling solid phase formation and p removal in this dynamic system where fe ii was being continually injected and subsequently involved in solid phase formation particle formation and p incorporation adsorption kinetic aspects of these reactions might well be expected to play an important role in the reaction outcomes and for there to be a time dependence of the concentrations of the reaction products taking the following reactions as examples 1 fe 2 o 2 fe 3 2 fe 3 oh feooh 3 feooh po 4 3 feooh po 4 therefore for any period of input of a given quantity of fe to the system further progression of reactions would be expected if the quantity of fe was supplied over a longer period for example at a lower current an obvious example was fe ii oxidation under oxic conditions where the extent of oxidation would be expected to be greater when fe ii was supplied at lower current since a greater proportion of the fe ii could oxidize and greater amounts of o2 could diffuse into the system p adsorption might also be expected to be time dependent since longer contact between the bulk solution and the adsorbing surfaces would result in greater adsorption however this was not the case fig 5 and kinetic limitations did not appear to influence the key reactions associated with p removal the following conclusions based on the pattern of dependence of p removal on fe accumulation fig 5 could be made with regard to the reactions expected to be occurring in the oxic and anoxic cases 1 the reactions involved in formation of the solid phase s responsible for p removal were sufficiently rapid such that even at the highest current 0 42 a the reactants were maintained at sufficiently low concentrations such that there was little difference to results obtained at lower currents 2 the mechanism of p uptake was more likely to involve coprecipitation and incorporation into the formation of solid phase rather than adsorption to the prior produced solid phase due to the independence on fe ii dosing rate directly depended on current the actual interaction of p with the solid phase could well be an adsorption phenomenon where p adsorbs to nano sized crystallites which then aggregate to form larger solid phase assemblages whose vastly reduced accessible surface area continues to adsorb only minimal p differences between coprecipitation and adsorption become difficult to discern and define for such reaction pathways smith et al 2008 voegelin et al 2013 oxidation of fe ii under oxic conditions was likely to be rapid as ph increased to 8 26 if the reaction of fe ii with o2 was rapid o2 diffusion would limit the rate of oxidation and a time dependence might be expected however this effect might be minimal if the rate of oxidation at the lowest do concentration was still rapid enough to keep up with fe2 supply there was a suggestion from the oxic plots of fig 5 of slightly improved removal at lower current 3 2 expected reactions and solid formation 3 2 1 changes to system conditions during experiments due to continuous dosing of either fe ii or fe iii and associated anions into the experimental system there were concomitant changes in a number of important parameters 1 the ratio between dissolved p and fe flux 2 ph fig 4a and 3 dissolved oxygen fig 4b 3 2 2 possible key fe transformations the initial reactions of fe upon addition to this aqueous system will depend primarily on the redox status of the inflowing fe and the ph and the do concentration in the system the last only being relevant to fe ii dosing over the ph range measured in the cases involving fe ii dosing ph 6 3 to 9 2 fe2 was the dominant hydrolysis species pk a 9 5 h2po4 along with hpo4 2 will dominate at the initial ph of 7 prior to any sparging given the pk a of the h2po4 hpo4 2 acid base pair of 7 2 in the in situ fe ii dosing cases where ph increased hpo4 2 would predominate whereas in the salt dosing systems where ph decreased h2po4 would predominate 3 2 2 1 anoxic in situ fe ii dosing in the absence of o2 in the system fe ii might possibly associate with hpo4 2 or oh to form the solid phases vivianite or ferrous hydroxide respectively siderite formation was precluded since co3 2 had been stripped by sparging formulas for the formation of these solid phases are shown in table 1 and expressed in terms of the species present in the ph range of interest it can be seen that formation becomes more favourable as ph increases for both of these phases also fe2 and oh were being injected into the system in the same stoichiometry as ferrous hydroxide suggesting that formation of ferrous hydroxide was likely regarding vivianite and ferrous hydroxide the relative formation of these phases depended on the degree of supersaturation and the kinetics of formation little is known regarding the kinetics of formation of fe ii solid phases especially the role that ph plays the condensation of hydroxylated ferrous ions is known to be highly sensitive to ph and is expected to occur via an olation mechanism jolivet et al 2004 in a similar manner to that for fe iii oxyhydroxides however the extent of hydroxylation of fe ii was limited within the experimental ph range of these studies and therefore solid hydroxide formation rates were expected to be much slower than for fe iii both slow and fast vivianite formation rates have been previously reported brady et al 2017 emerson and widmer 1978 3 2 2 2 oxic in situ fe ii dosing while receiving the same inputs of fe2 and oh ions from the electrodes as the anoxic case the oxic case differed due to the diffusion of o2 and co2 gas from the atmosphere into the system by continuous stirring the presence of o2 was expected to have a major impact via the oxidation of fe ii especially as the ph increase during the experiment fig s2 would have led to markedly increased rates of fe ii oxidation and has resulted in a continuous decline of do throughout dosing fig 4b at the final ph fe ii was expected to have a half life of 1 min under o2 saturation pham and waite 2008 therefore despite the decrease in do during the experiment to less than half saturation fig 4b fe2 was maintained at a low concentration due to oxidation fig 3 formation of the solid phases of vivianite ferrous hydroxide or siderite was unlikely to compete with fe ii oxidation under these oxic and alkaline conditions voegelin et al 2013 coprecipitation of fe iii resulting from oxidation with phosphate during the initial dosing period when the phosphate concentration was substantially greater than that of fe iii would have provided the greatest opportunity for any formation of ferric phosphate phases tokoro et al 2009 despite the profound effects of the presence of o2 on the formation of fe solid phases in the in situ fe ii dosing system it was remarkable that the pattern of p removal was very similar in the anoxic and oxic cases fig 2 3 2 2 3 anoxic fe ii salt dosing in contrast to in situ fe ii dosing fe ii salt dosing resulted in a ph decrease fig 4a in the anoxic case fe ii oxidation cannot occur although a small amount of oxidation due to adventitious oxygen ingress is likely to have occurred and therefore only fe ii solid phases would be expected to form under the initially high ph conditions ph 9 2 fe oh 2 formation would have been possible along with vivianite however as ph decreased finally to ph 6 4 only vivianite formation would have been thermodynamically feasible and therefore appeared to be the likely solid phase forming in the anoxic case of fe ii salt dosing 3 2 2 4 oxic fe ii salt dosing the ph decrease resulting from fe ii salt dosing resulted in much slower oxidation kinetics compared with the in situ fe ii dosing cases due to the dependence of oxidation rate on ph at the final ph of 6 3 the half life of fe ii undergoing homogeneous oxidation was 200 min compared with 1 min at ph 8 3 pham and waite 2008 at the end of in situ dosing assuming all dosed fe ii was available for reaction with o2 and the decrease in the first order rate constant as a function of ph was linear then 70 μm of fe iii will be formed by the end of the experiment 1000 μm of fe accumulation this level of fe iii formation is consistent with the additional p removal of 20 μm of p under oxic conditions compared to the anoxic case fig 2a and the resultant fe iii p ratio of 3 4 voegelin et al 2013 however the ph of the oxic case is only 0 2 units lower than the ph of the anoxic case suggesting limited fe iii hydrolysis also given that formation of an fe ii solid phase via the same reactions of the anoxic case is expected to be concomitant with oxidation a substantial proportion of the dosed fe ii was not expected to be available for homogeneous oxidation 3 2 2 5 fe iii salt dosing on dosing fe iii rapidly hydrolyses and releases protons leading to ph decrease as measured in the decline from the initial ph of 7 to a final ph of 3 5 along with a decreased rate of polymerization of the fe iii hydrolysis species however even at low ph the polymerization is fast with the second order rate constant decreasing from 106 m 1s 1 at ph 7 to 103 5 m 1s 1 at ph 3 5 pham et al 2006 as ph decreased the size of stable aggregate decreased substantially due to greater repulsive forces resulting from the increasing positive surface charge gilbert et al 2007 fe iii monomeric oligomeric and polymeric species were more likely to associate with phosphate at lower fe p ratios and at lower ph initially the fe p ratio was low at ph 7 and with further addition of fe iii it increased and ph decreased whether ferric phosphates similar to amorphous strengite would form under these conditions in preference to surface complexes on fe oxides is unclear in operations for p removal via fe iii salt dosing adsorption of p to fe oxides was recognized to be an important or the major mechanism smith et al 2008 3 2 3 solid phase fe and p resulting anoxic in situ fe ii dosing in light of the promising levels of p removal by in situ fe ii dosing the nature of the solid phases and the mechanisms of p removal are of interest in comparison to the anoxic case the oxic case is more complex due to the inclusion of fe ii oxidation reactions that may potentially involve both dissolved and solid phase fe ii and fe iii species and as such is less amenable to analysis therefore the anoxic case will be considered here along with any extension of insights to the oxic case solid phase identification using xrd was not possible due to the amorphous nature of the solids formed fig s3 nevertheless some deductions may be made regarding the nature of the solids formed in the anoxic case from the dissolved fe and p data fig 6 a the fe and p content of the solid phase retained by the filter 0 22 μm can be calculated assuming all the retained p was as vivianite excess fe must be associated with some other fe ii solid phase most likely ferrous hydroxide based on these calculations the formation rates of the two solid phases expressed as the unit of solid fe formed per unit of fe accumulated have been plotted fig 6b it is clear that vivianite formation cannot account for all the solid fe even during the period of maximum p removal note that the total solid formation rate exceeded one during the period between 65 and 163 μm due to a decrease in dissolved fe adding to the solid formation ferrous hydroxide is the most likely solid phase accounting for the fe in excess of maximal vivianite formation in the case that vivianite did not form p must be associated with the ferrous hydroxide either in adsorbed or coprecipitated form thermodynamic analysis in the next section will provide further insight into likely reactions 3 3 thermodynamic modelling 3 3 1 saturation indices of final anoxic solutions thermodynamic analysis of the solution phase at the termination of dosing provides insight into possible solid phase formation the effective saturation index si provides a normalization of solid phase sis by accounting for the dependency of sis on the mole formula where si was calculated as log iap k sp where iap is the ion activity product the product of the activities of the ions that constitute the mineral and k sp is the solubility product for that mineral derived from prior studies the effective si is calculated by dividing the si by the number of ions that react to form the solid expressed by the mole formula lothenbach et al 2008 in this case sis for vivianite and ferrous hydroxide were divided by 5 and 3 respectively following anoxic in situ fe ii dosing vivianite was undersaturated while ferrous hydroxide was very close to zero table 2 strongly suggesting that ferrous hydroxide solubility was controlling the dissolved fe ii concentration and ph ferrous hydroxide formation was expected given the continuous input of fe2 and oh ions from the electrodes the final ph in the absence of fe oh 2 formation would be expected to be 10 6 therefore the measured ph of 9 2 indicated that consumption of oh had occurred most likely as a result of fe oh 2 formation conversely following anoxic fe ii salt dosing vivianite was oversaturated and ferrous hydroxide undersaturated table 2 formation of ferrous hydroxide was not expected below ph 7 5 vivianite oversaturation indicated that its formation was thermodynamically favorable however there appeared to be kinetic limitations to formation of this solid more investigations for instance an extension of the experimental time could be conducted aiming at insights of the kinetics 3 3 2 thermodynamic modelling of anoxic in situ fe ii dosing case thermodynamic modelling of the anoxic in situ fe ii case during dosing enables investigation of possible solid formation pathways under various scenarios expected to provide further insight into the likely solid formation reactions and therefore the likely p removal mechanism s as has previously been noted section 3 1 3 kinetic factors appear to play an insignificant role in solid formation outcomes modelling was undertaken using the davies equation to account for non ideal effects of ionic interactions the solution composition prior to ph adjustment section 2 1 was used as the starting point in the reaction series the degree to which co2 equilibration with the atmosphere has occurred is an important aspect in calculation of the solution composition in the anoxic case continuous n2 sparging would have stripped co2 from the system therefore the solution was equilibrated to very low co2 10 10 atm which resulted in a ph 9 2 prior to the commencement of dosing fig 4a it should be noted that in the oxic cases atmospheric equilibration during dosing will have occurred to some extent as is evident from the measured do concentration fig 4b as identified previously in section 3 2 3 vivianite and ferrous hydroxide were the only fe ii solid phases likely to form in the anoxic in situ fe ii dosing case only solid phase formation reactions were modelled such that p removal occurred only through vivianite formation other p removal mechanisms such as coprecipitation and adsorption were not included since they are inherently variable processes and little is known with regards to ferrous hydroxide interactions with phosphate four scenarios were considered 1 only ferrous hydroxide forms 2 vivianite forms preferentially 3 vivianite and ferrous hydroxide form and equilibrate with each other 4 ferrous hydroxide forms preferentially where a solid phase forms preferentially the solution was first equilibrated to this solid phase and then to the second phase the modelled outcomes of these scenarios are shown in fig 7 formation of ferrous hydroxide alone fig 7a results in nearly 100 of dosed fe contributing to solid formation as such this is also the case for all scenarios since any fe that does not precipitate as vivianite will go on to form ferrous hydroxide an equilibrium fe ii concentration of 0 5 μm and ph of 9 20 determined by the solubility of ferrous hydroxide is immediately established being identical to final measured values table 2 no p removal has occurred since vivianite was not formed however the experimental p removal pattern could have resulted from coprecipitation or adsorption reactions preferential formation of vivianite fig 7b results in substantial vivianite formation and associated p removal during the initial 100 μm of fe accumulation while vivianite and ferrous hydroxide formation together fig 7c resulted in substantially less vivianite formation vivianite formation had the effect of raising ph and lowering fe ii concentration while the formation reaction involving hpo4 2 results in h production table 1 the consumption of fe2 shifts the stoichiometry of the ferrous hydroxide solubility product such that there is an increased oh concentration at the solubility limit and therefore an increased ph with preferential vivianite formation the ph increased to 10 3 much higher than the measured ph of 9 2 even the small amount of vivianite formed together with ferrous hydroxide increased the ph to 9 5 considering the modeled outcomes together with the previous effective si calculations in relation to the experimental results the following points can be made 1 ferrous hydroxide could possibly be the only solid formed with p removal occurring via coprecipitation and or adsorption though little is known regarding the interactions of ferrous hydroxide and phosphate 2 ph during in situ dosing is sensitive to the effect of vivianite formation and the close proximity of the final measured ph of 9 2 to that expected at the solubility limit for ferrous hydroxide with 1 2 stoichiometry of fe2 and oh ions suggests that the extent of any vivianite formation is minimal 3 3 3 thermodynamic modelling of anoxic fe ii salt dosing case modelling of the anoxic fe ii salt dosing case showed that initially the solution was oversaturated with respect to both vivianite and ferrous hydroxide and therefore a small amount of ferrous hydroxide formation may have occurred however following an initial fe accumulation of 65 μm the potential for ferrous hydroxide formation was negligible the effect of vivianite formation on ph is clear when the modelled outcome is compared to the case where only ferrous hydroxide is allowed to form fig 8 the final modelled ph of 5 5 is substantially lower than the measured ph of 6 5 suggesting that vivianite did not form to the extent of achieving thermodynamic equilibrium and therefore that vivianite formation was kinetically limited the measured vivianite oversaturation table 2 supports this interpretation which is also consistent with the higher measured residual p 51 μm fig 2 compared to the modelled outcome 41 μm fig 8 3 4 implications for operational implementation comparable p removal of in situ fe ii dosing under oxic and anoxic conditions despite the apparently different pathways of solid formation and p removal suggests useful versatility of the process in situ fe ii dosing could be used in conjunction with enhanced biological p removal ebpr to either supplement p removal during the aerobic phase or to immobilize p released by paos during an anaerobic phase the continuous generation of alkalinity is likely to be advantageous for maintaining nitrification and also helpful for maintaining high ph levels that favour paos over glycogen accumulating organisms gao that compete for carbon substrates oehmen et al 2005 besides versatility and precise control of in situ fe ii dosing can potentially play an important role in facilitating the development of robust p recovery processes further understanding of the mechanisms is required with regard to the impact of steady or buffered ph and organics including colloids in real wastewater treatment using in situ fe ii dosing the relatively steady ph of the mixed liquor which is much lower than it achieved in this research might lead to slower hydrolysis of fe ii and fe iii ions and oxidation rate of fe ii species and therefore fe solid formation pathways and mechanisms of p removal might be switched organic compounds have a myriad of impacts on fe transformations through processes of complexation adsorption and redox activity which might influence the oxidation rates of fe ii fe iii transformations and the characteristics and adsorption properties of any fe oxides formed recent work has shown that the reactivity of fe iii oxides is both enhanced and prolonged when formed in the presence of mixed liquor supernatant bligh et al 2017 besides colloids would influence the p removal through impacts on coagulation and flocculation clearly there needs adequate research on impacts of ph and organics on the p removal efficacy and the nature of the fep products with in situ fe ii dosing into synthetic and real wastewater before application moreover optimization of fe p ratio for higher removal efficiency and feasible p recovery would be conducted under real wastewater conditions ph organics and varied operational regimes agitation and sedimentation further investigation of operational parameters would be undertaken in terms of practical application such as current affecting the release rate of fe distance between electrodes affecting the applied voltage the scale of the experimental set ups and the designated removal efficiency of phosphorus besides the estimation of operational cost would also be conducted in further research with larger scale application pilot scale for instance 4 conclusions in situ fe ii dosing has been shown through this study to achieve highly efficient p removal under both anoxic and oxic conditions with p removal patterns in both cases being similar to that achieved by ferric salt dosing continuous injection of alkalinity from in situ fe ii dosing raised the system ph substantially without buffer under anoxic conditions this appears to have strongly promoted ferrous hydroxide formation under oxic conditions fe ii oxidation was rapid and limited by o2 diffusion from the atmosphere with fe iii oxyhydroxide formation expected in contrast fe ii salt dosing lowered the system ph resulting in slow oxidation and primarily vivianite formation p removal patterns for in situ fe ii dosing under both anoxic and oxic conditions were remarkably independent of current and were nearly identical for a given initial p concentration when plotted as a function of fe accumulation with this result showing that the extent of p removal depended only on the amount of fe accumulated in the system rather than the time in contact with that fe this result indicates that kinetic factors did not play a role in determining p removal outcomes and that the solid formation and p removal reactions must have been fast and limited only by fe input to the system these results suggest that the p removal mechanisms involved coprecipitation either with ferrous hydroxide under anoxic conditions or with ferric oxyhydroxide under oxic conditions formation of ferrous hydroxide with minimal vivianite formation during in situ fe ii dosing under anoxic conditions is supported by the following 1 the fe p ratio of the retained solid phase indicated that an fe ii solid phase other than vivianite must have been forming 2 the measured final ph was equal to that expected for ferrous hydroxide formation only 3 the dissolved species of the final sample were in equilibrium with ferrous hydroxide and undersaturated with respect to vivianite the fep product resulting from p removal was expected to have changed as the dissolved fe p ratio increased during dosing due to continuous fe accumulation and p removal the dominant p removal mechanisms in each of the fe ii dosing scenarios were concluded to be 1 coprecipitation and or adsorption with ferrous hydroxide for anoxic in situ fe ii dosing 2 coprecipitation and or adsorption with ferric oxyhydroxides with possible ferric phosphate formation during early dosing due to low fe p ratio for oxic in situ fe ii dosing 3 vivianite formation for anoxic fe ii salt dosing 4 vivianite formation and either coprecipitation with fe iii oxyhydroxides or ferric phosphate formation for oxic fe ii salt dosing in situ fe ii dosing represents a versatile option for chemical p removal with rapid removal efficiency precise control of fe dosing and absence of additional unwanted anions or consumption of alkalinity amenable situations without ph buffer and organics were applied to achieve the p removal mechanisms in this study and an extension of these mechanisms using synthetic and real wastewater is expected in further study before application acknowledgement

19653,the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance has posed a major threat to both human health and environmental ecosystem although the disinfection has been proved to be efficient to control the occurrence of pathogens little effort is dedicated to revealing potential impacts of disinfection on transmission of antibiotic resistance genes args particularly for free living args in final disinfected effluent of urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtp here we investigated the effects of chlorine disinfection on the occurrence and concentration of both extracellular args eargs and intracellular args iargs in a full scale uwwtp over a year we reported that the concentrations of both eargs and iargs would be increased by the disinfection with chlorine dioxide clo2 specifically chlorination preferentially increased the abundances of eargs against macrolide ermb tetracycline teta tetb and tetc sulfonamide sul1 sul2 and sul3 β lactam ampc aminoglycosides aph 2 id rifampicin katg and vancomycin vana up to 3 8 folds similarly the abundances of iargs were also increased up to 7 8 folds after chlorination in terms of correlation analyses the abundance of escherichia coli before chlorination showed a strong positive correlation with the total earg concentration while lower temperature and higher ammonium concentration were assumed to be associated with the concentration of iargs this study suggests the chlorine disinfection could increase the abundances of both iargs and eargs thereby posing risk of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria arb antibiotic resistance genes args extracellular args eargs intracellular args iargs chlorination disinfection 1 introduction antibiotic resistance has posed huge threats to public health globally each year more than 700 000 people die from antimicrobial resistant infections worldwide however the predicted casualty number could reach 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken now o neill 2015 although the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in clinic settings has attracted substantial concerns the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance bacteria arb or antibiotic resistance genes args in environmental settings has been overlooked so far urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtps are at the interface between human population and the aquatic soil environments may provide an ideal setting for the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance because a diverse mixture of antibiotics and other pollutants their metabolites and resistant bacteria reaches uwwtps through wastewater discharges from hospitals households industries and animal farms guo et al 2017 the prevalence of arb and args in uwwtps has attracted more and more attention recently chen and zhang 2013 naquin et al 2015 wang et al 2015 wen et al 2016 in particular biological reactors in activated sludge systems are thought as one of critical compartments in harboring both arb and args rizzo et al 2013 yang et al 2012 through selection under exposure of antibiotic or resistance transfer among bacteria via horizontal gene transfer hgt jutkina et al 2016 kim et al 2014 more importantly it has been reported that uwwtps exhibit limited capacity to remove or control args and arb munir et al 2011 pruden et al 2006 wang et al 2015 worrying not only does the effluent represent an important reservoir containing various args but also the abundances of some typical args are even higher in effluent than that in influent via the treatment processes e g blactx m blatem and qnrs rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 shi et al 2013 therefore uwwtps have been identified to play a vital role in the transmission of arb and args in the environment thus posing risks to public health in order to control the spread of pathogens various disinfection processes have been widely used in uwwtps previous studies have investigated the inactivation of args by disinfection methods e g chlorination ultraviolet uv irradiation lin et al 2016a mckinney and pruden 2012 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 however a few recent studies reported that chlorination as a widely used disinfection process may co select antibiotic resistance for example shi et al 2013 documented that the chlorination process enriched the abundances of ampc and teta according to metagenomic sequencing xu et al 2016 also reported that chlorination enhanced the relative abundance of args from 6 4 to 109 2 fold in tap water compared to the final water in contrast lin et al 2016b suggested args were more likely removed rather than co selected by chlorine where they monitored 225 args but only six were enriched after chlorination although contradictory conclusions were obtained about the impact of chlorination on args few studies have been dedicated to distinguishing between intracellular args iargs and extracellular arg eargs in fact disinfection processes e g chlorination they could kill arb but simultaneously dna will be released into the water where eargs could be still present in the free living dna the occurrence of iargs may promote arb dissemination via conjugation and transduction while eargs persistence in the aquatic environment for quite a time can be taken up by the competent non resistant bacteria in the biofilm and sedimentation thereby resulting in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via transformation li et al 2001 molin and tolker nielsen 2003 wang et al 2016 thus eargs in the effluent from uwwpts are also potential to promote args and arb transmission in environmental settings however the impact of chlorination on eargs remains unclear due to the lack of an efficient method to extract extracellular dna edna which is too low to harvest in treated water very recently we developed a method to harvest edna by using a new type of nucleic acid adsorption particle naap with high capacity which can achieve an earg recovery rate of above 95 from 10 l of water samples wang et al 2016 this developed method could enable us to study the impact of disinfection on eargs therefore the objective of this study is to clarify the potential effect of chlorination on both iargs and eargs we continuously collected samples from a full scale uwwtp with the chlorination as the tertiary treatment process the edna were collected from water samples before and after chlorination in a full scale uwwtp using the adsorption elution technique quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr was used to determine the abundances of both iargs and earg with targeting ten types of the most frequently detected args to the best knowledge it is the first time to explore the impact of disinfection on eargs pollution in real wastewater from a full scale uwwtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling uwwtp and sample collection the full scale uwwtp is located in tianjin china which treats domestic sewage approximately 200 000 m3 per day the contact time for chlorination of second effluent is 30 min under the action of 8 9 mg l chlorine oxidize clo2 monthly triplicate water samples of second effluent before chlorination and final effluent after chlorination were collected between january 2016 to december 2016 from the inlet and outlet of last treatment unit of uwwtp where clo2 was applied fig s1 all samples were stored on ice transported to the laboratory and maintained at 4 c until they were processed for analyses within 24 h of sample collection the indices of water quality including turbidity conductivity ammonium nh4 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp heterotrophic plates counts hpc total coliform tc and fecal coliform fc were measured according to the methods described in the supporting text 1 apha 1998 and the results are summarized in table s1 2 2 microorganism harvest and intracellular dna idna extraction water samples 10 l were vacuum

cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline pbs to eliminate chemical impurities finally the cells were resuspended in pbs and idna was extracted using bacterial dna kit omega usa according to the manufacture instruction all idna samples were stored at 80 c until the iarg analysis 2 3 edna collection the naaps were prepared and edna were collected according to our previously developed method with minor modifications wang et al 2016 briefly the autoclaved al oh 3 solution 47 8 v v was mixed well with 5 6 g ml silica gel with a 60 100 mesh size kunhai co shanghai china and dried at 60 c for 36 h the final drying silica gels coated with al oh 3 were then sealed in a cylindrical glass container 1 5 40 cm as naap column water sample of 30 l contained with 20 gc ml

recover the pellet the pellets were mixed with 70 ethanol by pipetting and centrifuged 10 000 g for 5 min at room temperature 20 c the precipitate was left to drain upside down for a few minutes and re suspended in 1 m l of sterilized te buffer to achieve the final concentrate each edna concentrate was stored at 80 c until the earg analysis 2 4 args analysis with real time qualitative pcr qpcr real time qpcr reactions were conducted to test the concentration of both iargs and eargs in collected samples by using an abi sequence detection system 7300 applied biosystems usa with a final volume

samples 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 spss inc chicago illinois paired t test analysis was used to analyze the effect of chlorination on args concentration analysis of variance on args concentration was also performed using the kruskale wallis test clustering analysis was performed using r software version3 2 3 r development core team spearman analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the change of args concentration after chlorination and water quality in the second effluent with confidence interval of 95 p values less than 0 05 were considered to indicate significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection of diverse eargs and iargs before and after chlorination the occurrences of 22 common args in the form of edna or idna were monitored from monthly samples in the full scale uwwtp the detection frequencies of both eargs and iargs before and after chlorination have been illustrated in fig 1 regarding the iargs all of the 22 genes could be detected in all water samples in despite of before or after chlorination more specifically 17 of 22 genes e g teta sul1 and ermb were continuously detected in all the collected samples from the second effluent and the final effluent with a detection frequency of 100 interestingly several eargs e g gyra tetx and cata1 might be removed occasionally by the chlorination process in terms of a decreased detection frequency in the final effluent compared to the second effluent in contrast eargs including erma 1 and vana showed a higher detection frequency in the final effluent after chlorination compared to that in the second effluent the results suggested that diverse args could still be detected even with the chlorination treatment 3 2 concentrations of eargs before and after chlorination by monitoring the concentration of each earg in both the second effluent and the final effluent it could be found their concentrations fluctuated significantly during the sampling period fig s2a after summing up all observed eargs concentrations in a monthly sample the average total concentration of observed eargs was 1 23 106 1 26 108 gene copies l gc l in the second effluent before chlorination while it was 1 13 106 2 90 108 gc l in the final effluent after chlorination fig 2 a the maximal value for the total eargs concentration during a year occurred in the samples on april in spite of the disinfection or not correspondingly the lowest total eargs concentration was observed in august for the second effluent while the final effluent in november contained the lowest eargs in addition we also compared the total concentration of a given earg by summing up its concentration in all monthly samples it was found that both extracellular tetm and sul1 were top two dominant eargs while extracellular erma 1 concentration remained the lowest among all 22 tested args according to the median concentrations n 33 fig 2b chlorination significantly affected individual earg concentrations p 0 05 n 3 among all 22 tested eargs fig s3 concentrations of teta tetb sul3 ampc aph 2 id and vana were increased significantly in all final effluent samples after chlorination p 0 05 n 33 compared with their concentrations in the second effluent samples in particular the vana concentration showed 621 2 folds higher than that in the untreated water sampled in november although the effects of chlorination on other eargs concentrations are varied the concentrations of tetc ermb katg sul1 and sul2 increased after chlorination with frequency above 80 with the maximal value of 371 3 fold for ermb tables s3 and s4 after further analyzing the ratio of earg concentration in final effluent to those in the second effluent the median concentrations of teta tetb tetq sul2 sul3 and aph 2 id increased 2 1 3 8 folds while only the medium concentrations of tetm gyra and dfra1 1 decreased after chlorination n 33 fig s4a the disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequent efflux of intracellular components results in the inactivation of the gram negative bacteria thereby dead bacteria suffering from the action of enough clo2 should release dna and form the non living eargs in treated water ofori et al 2017 the general understanding is that eargs released from the dead arb should be further broken down under the damage effect of strong oxidizing disinfectants however our results demonstrated that the clo2 treatment promoted the eargs pollution in the final effluent in terms of a significant increasing of the eargs against tetracycline sulfonamide β lactam aminoglycosides and vancomycin the enhancement of eargs concentration could be associated with the selective inactivation of args by disinfection due to different resistance to disinfectants mckinney and pruden 2012 zhang et al 2015 args with higher antioxidant capacity may survive from the chlorination therefore comparing with other args the concentrations of teta tetb sul3 ampc aph 2 id and vana were increased after chlorination indicating these genes might be more tolerant to clo2 3 3 concentrations of iargs before and after chlorination the changes of iarg concentrations before and after chlorination were also investigated by normalizing the abundance of each iarg to the total abundance of 16 s rrna gene n 3 fig s2b similar to eargs they also fluctuated greatly during the sampling period the average total concentration of observed iargs generally fluctuated from 0 03 february to 0 29 september in the second effluent before chlorination while it changed between 0 12 june to 3 20 november for the final effluent after chlorination fig 3 a in terms of the median concentration intracellular sul1 and sul2 were listed at top two iargs while the abundance of van a was lowest in water samples in despite of chlorination n 33 fig 3b compared to the second effluent the concentrations of iargs in the final effluent after disinfection were also distinctly increased in this full scale uwwtp fig s5 tables s4 and s5 in response to chlorination the relative abundance of qnra increased 1 5 25 5 folds in all monthly final effluent and other iargs except tetb tetq sul1 vana increased 1 0 173 3 folds with detection frequency above 80 paired samples t test p 0 05 n 3 indicating that chlorination could increase the relative abundance of the most iargs qnra prominently the median ratio of each iarg concentration between after chlorination and before chlorination was in the range of 1 5 7 8 n 33 fig s4b further suggesting that the chlorination played a positive role in increasing iargs concentrations previous studies also showed the chlorination process increased the abundances of several typical iargs such as ampc apha2 blatem 1 and teta in drinking water shi et al 2013 it is suspected that chlorination could play a co selection role in bacterial antibiotic resistance another reason may be associated with the possibility that inadequate chlorine dosage could promote conjugative transfer in which more pilus acting as pathways for args transfer were induced on the surface of conjugative cells guo et al 2015 3 4 environmental factors influencing args concentration to explore which environmental factors are favorable to increase args during the chlorination the potential correlations between args concentration and water quality parameters were studied by spearman analyses then total concentrations of observed args under different correlative conditions were analyzed to further observe the effect of environmental factors on the variation of arg concentration it showed escherichia coli as a faecal indicator in water jang et al 2017 was the only index to present a strong positive correlation with the change of total concentration of observed eargs table s6 after chlorination the median concentration of total eargs showed an ascending trend when the abundance of e coli in the second effluent increased fig 4a considering there was no any correlation between eargs and heterotrophic bacteria it is assumed that human or animal sourced fecal bacteria were the key resources of eargs after the chlorination in the sediment the e coli abundance also has been found to be strongly correlated with args abundance devarajan et al 2016 in addition the factors of conductivity ph heterotrophic plate counts hpc tn ammonium and codmn

coliform in the second effluent had no correlations with concentration variations of any observed eargs the abundance of hpc in the second effluent had a strong correlation with the changes of extracellular qnra and katg concentration after chlorination p 0 01 n 3 water temperature showed no correlations with concentration variations of total observed eargs p 0 05 n 3 but significant increased eargs abundance occurred when the water temperature ranged between 25 c and 27 c p 0 01 n 3 for iargs the results showed that the change of total concentration of observed iargs was strongly correlated with water temperature negatively and nh4 n concentration positively p 0 05 during the chlorination table s7 much more increase of median concentration of total iargs was observed when water temperature in the second effluent was declined fig 4b indicating low environmental temperature 10 20 c may be beneficial to elevate iargs concentration under the exposure of chlorine furthermore nh4 n concentration in the range from 1 8 to 2 5 mg l also exhibited a significant impact to the iargs concentration which caused the increasing of iargs concentration fig 4c similarly ali et al 2016 found nutrient induced antibiotic resistance in enterococcus faecalis in eutrophic environments higher nh4 n concentration was found to lead to lower removal of iargs at the same chlorine

disinfection enhanced both eargs and iargs pollution in a full scale uwwtp e coli concentration before chlorination showed strong positive correlation with the eargs abundance in the final effluents

19653,the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance has posed a major threat to both human health and environmental ecosystem although the disinfection has been proved to be efficient to control the occurrence of pathogens little effort is dedicated to revealing potential impacts of disinfection on transmission of antibiotic resistance genes args particularly for free living args in final disinfected effluent of urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtp here we investigated the effects of chlorine disinfection on the occurrence and concentration of both extracellular args eargs and intracellular args iargs in a full scale uwwtp over a year we reported that the concentrations of both eargs and iargs would be increased by the disinfection with chlorine dioxide clo2 specifically chlorination preferentially increased the abundances of eargs against macrolide ermb tetracycline teta tetb and tetc sulfonamide sul1 sul2 and sul3 β lactam ampc aminoglycosides aph 2 id rifampicin katg and vancomycin vana up to 3 8 folds similarly the abundances of iargs were also increased up to 7 8 folds after chlorination in terms of correlation analyses the abundance of escherichia coli before chlorination showed a strong positive correlation with the total earg concentration while lower temperature and higher ammonium concentration were assumed to be associated with the concentration of iargs this study suggests the chlorine disinfection could increase the abundances of both iargs and eargs thereby posing risk of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria arb antibiotic resistance genes args extracellular args eargs intracellular args iargs chlorination disinfection 1 introduction antibiotic resistance has posed huge threats to public health globally each year more than 700 000 people die from antimicrobial resistant infections worldwide however the predicted casualty number could reach 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken now o neill 2015 although the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in clinic settings has attracted substantial concerns the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance bacteria arb or antibiotic resistance genes args in environmental settings has been overlooked so far urban wastewater treatment plants uwwtps are at the interface between human population and the aquatic soil environments may provide an ideal setting for the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance because a diverse mixture of antibiotics and other pollutants their metabolites and resistant bacteria reaches uwwtps through wastewater discharges from hospitals households industries and animal farms guo et al 2017 the prevalence of arb and args in uwwtps has attracted more and more attention recently chen and zhang 2013 naquin et al 2015 wang et al 2015 wen et al 2016 in particular biological reactors in activated sludge systems are thought as one of critical compartments in harboring both arb and args rizzo et al 2013 yang et al 2012 through selection under exposure of antibiotic or resistance transfer among bacteria via horizontal gene transfer hgt jutkina et al 2016 kim et al 2014 more importantly it has been reported that uwwtps exhibit limited capacity to remove or control args and arb munir et al 2011 pruden et al 2006 wang et al 2015 worrying not only does the effluent represent an important reservoir containing various args but also the abundances of some typical args are even higher in effluent than that in influent via the treatment processes e g blactx m blatem and qnrs rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 shi et al 2013 therefore uwwtps have been identified to play a vital role in the transmission of arb and args in the environment thus posing risks to public health in order to control the spread of pathogens various disinfection processes have been widely used in uwwtps previous studies have investigated the inactivation of args by disinfection methods e g chlorination ultraviolet uv irradiation lin et al 2016a mckinney and pruden 2012 yoon et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 however a few recent studies reported that chlorination as a widely used disinfection process may co select antibiotic resistance for example shi et al 2013 documented that the chlorination process enriched the abundances of ampc and teta according to metagenomic sequencing xu et al 2016 also reported that chlorination enhanced the relative abundance of args from 6 4 to 109 2 fold in tap water compared to the final water in contrast lin et al 2016b suggested args were more likely removed rather than co selected by chlorine where they monitored 225 args but only six were enriched after chlorination although contradictory conclusions were obtained about the impact of chlorination on args few studies have been dedicated to distinguishing between intracellular args iargs and extracellular arg eargs in fact disinfection processes e g chlorination they could kill arb but simultaneously dna will be released into the water where eargs could be still present in the free living dna the occurrence of iargs may promote arb dissemination via conjugation and transduction while eargs persistence in the aquatic environment for quite a time can be taken up by the competent non resistant bacteria in the biofilm and sedimentation thereby resulting in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via transformation li et al 2001 molin and tolker nielsen 2003 wang et al 2016 thus eargs in the effluent from uwwpts are also potential to promote args and arb transmission in environmental settings however the impact of chlorination on eargs remains unclear due to the lack of an efficient method to extract extracellular dna edna which is too low to harvest in treated water very recently we developed a method to harvest edna by using a new type of nucleic acid adsorption particle naap with high capacity which can achieve an earg recovery rate of above 95 from 10 l of water samples wang et al 2016 this developed method could enable us to study the impact of disinfection on eargs therefore the objective of this study is to clarify the potential effect of chlorination on both iargs and eargs we continuously collected samples from a full scale uwwtp with the chlorination as the tertiary treatment process the edna were collected from water samples before and after chlorination in a full scale uwwtp using the adsorption elution technique quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr was used to determine the abundances of both iargs and earg with targeting ten types of the most frequently detected args to the best knowledge it is the first time to explore the impact of disinfection on eargs pollution in real wastewater from a full scale uwwtp 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling uwwtp and sample collection the full scale uwwtp is located in tianjin china which treats domestic sewage approximately 200 000 m3 per day the contact time for chlorination of second effluent is 30 min under the action of 8 9 mg l chlorine oxidize clo2 monthly triplicate water samples of second effluent before chlorination and final effluent after chlorination were collected between january 2016 to december 2016 from the inlet and outlet of last treatment unit of uwwtp where clo2 was applied fig s1 all samples were stored on ice transported to the laboratory and maintained at 4 c until they were processed for analyses within 24 h of sample collection the indices of water quality including turbidity conductivity ammonium nh4 n total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp heterotrophic plates counts hpc total coliform tc and fecal coliform fc were measured according to the methods described in the supporting text 1 apha 1998 and the results are summarized in table s1 2 2 microorganism harvest and intracellular dna idna extraction water samples 10 l were vacuum filtered to concentrate the microbial biomass with polytetra fluoroethylene membranes 0 45 μm millipore usa chen et al 2012 then the membranes with captured bacteria were immersed in 3 beef extract

cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline pbs to eliminate chemical impurities finally the cells were resuspended in pbs and idna was extracted using bacterial dna kit omega usa according to the manufacture instruction all idna samples were stored at 80 c until the iarg analysis 2 3 edna collection the naaps were prepared and edna were collected according to our previously developed method with minor modifications wang et al 2016 briefly the autoclaved al oh 3 solution 47 8 v v was mixed well with 5 6 g ml silica gel with a 60 100 mesh size kunhai co shanghai china and dried at 60 c for 36 h the final drying silica gels coated with al oh 3 were then sealed in a cylindrical glass container 1 5 40 cm as naap column water sample of 30 l contained with 20 gc ml indicative puc19 a plasmid containing beta tubulin was passed through the column at a constant speed 50 m l min using a peristaltic pump the naap column was washed with 100 ml of eluent 15 g l nacl 30 g l tryptone 15 g l beef extract 3 75 g l gly 0 28 g l na oh ph of 9 3 0 2 after the water sample was passed through it all the eluates were collected and filtered with a polyethersulfone filter 0 45 μm millipore usa the edna in the filtrate were then precipitated using an equal volume of isopropanol incubated at room temperature for 16 h and centrifuged 10 000 g for 10 min at room temperature to recover the pellet the pellets were mixed with 70 ethanol by pipetting and centrifuged 10 000 g for 5 min at room temperature 20 c the precipitate was left to drain upside down for a few minutes and re suspended in 1 m l of sterilized te buffer to achieve the final concentrate each edna concentrate was stored at 80 c until the earg analysis 2 4 args analysis with real time qualitative pcr qpcr real time qpcr reactions were conducted to test the concentration of both iargs and eargs in collected samples by using an abi sequence detection system 7300 applied biosystems usa with a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 μl 2 power sybr green pcr master mix roche switzerland 0 4 μl of each primer 20 μm and 2 μl template dna the thermo cycling steps for qpcr amplification were described as

that nonspecific amplification did not occur all qpcr analyses were performed in triplicates with positive controls for each target and negative controls using ultrapure water to ensure cycling efficiencies twenty two primers of args have been using in this study as listed in table s2 aminov et al 2002 gaze et al 2011 luo et al 2010 wu et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 2 5 calculation of the earg

samples 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using spss 19 spss inc chicago illinois paired t test analysis was used to analyze the effect of chlorination on args concentration analysis of variance on args concentration was also performed using the kruskale wallis test clustering analysis was performed using r software version3 2 3 r development core team spearman analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the change of args concentration after chlorination and water quality in the second effluent with confidence interval of 95 p values less than 0 05 were considered to indicate significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 detection of diverse eargs and iargs before and after chlorination the occurrences of 22 common args in the form of edna or idna were monitored from monthly samples in the full scale uwwtp the detection frequencies of both eargs and iargs before and after chlorination have been illustrated in fig 1 regarding the iargs all of the 22 genes could be detected in all water samples in despite of before or after chlorination more specifically 17 of 22 genes e g teta sul1 and ermb were continuously detected in all the collected samples from the second effluent and the final effluent with a detection frequency of 100 interestingly several eargs e g gyra tetx and cata1 might be removed occasionally by the chlorination process in terms of a decreased detection frequency in the final effluent compared to the second effluent in contrast eargs including erma 1 and vana showed a higher detection frequency in the final effluent after chlorination compared to that in the second effluent the results suggested that diverse args could still be detected even with the chlorination treatment 3 2 concentrations of eargs before and after chlorination by monitoring the concentration of each earg in both the second effluent and the final effluent it could be found their concentrations fluctuated significantly during the sampling period fig s2a after summing up all observed eargs concentrations in a monthly sample the average total concentration of observed eargs was 1 23 106 1 26 108 gene copies l gc l in the second effluent before chlorination while it was 1 13 106 2 90 108 gc l in the final effluent after chlorination fig 2 a the maximal value for the total eargs concentration during a year occurred in the samples on april in spite of the disinfection or not correspondingly the lowest total eargs concentration was observed in august for the second effluent while the final effluent in november contained the lowest eargs in addition we also compared the total concentration of a given earg by summing up its concentration in all monthly samples it was found that both extracellular tetm and sul1 were top two dominant eargs while extracellular erma 1 concentration remained the lowest among all 22 tested args according to the median concentrations n 33 fig 2b chlorination significantly affected individual earg concentrations p 0 05 n 3 among all 22 tested eargs fig s3 concentrations of teta tetb sul3 ampc aph 2 id and vana were increased significantly in all final effluent samples after chlorination p 0 05 n 33 compared with their concentrations in the second effluent samples in particular the vana concentration showed 621 2 folds higher than that in the untreated water sampled in november although the effects of chlorination on other eargs concentrations are varied the concentrations of tetc ermb katg sul1 and sul2 increased after chlorination with frequency above 80 with the maximal value of 371 3 fold for ermb tables s3 and s4 after further analyzing the ratio of earg concentration in final effluent to those in the second effluent the median concentrations of teta tetb tetq sul2 sul3 and aph 2 id increased 2 1 3 8 folds while only the medium concentrations of tetm gyra and dfra1 1 decreased after chlorination n 33 fig s4a the disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequent efflux of intracellular components results in the inactivation of the gram negative bacteria thereby dead bacteria suffering from the action of enough clo2 should release dna and form the non living eargs in treated water ofori et al 2017 the general understanding is that eargs released from the dead arb should be further broken down under the damage effect of strong oxidizing disinfectants however our results demonstrated that the clo2 treatment promoted the eargs pollution in the final effluent in terms of a significant increasing of the eargs against tetracycline sulfonamide β lactam aminoglycosides and vancomycin the enhancement of eargs concentration could be associated with the selective inactivation of args by disinfection due to different resistance to disinfectants mckinney and pruden 2012 zhang et al 2015 args with higher antioxidant capacity may survive from the chlorination therefore comparing with other args the concentrations of teta tetb sul3 ampc aph 2 id and vana were increased after chlorination indicating these genes might be more tolerant to clo2 3 3 concentrations of iargs before and after chlorination the changes of iarg concentrations before and after chlorination were also investigated by normalizing the abundance of each iarg to the total abundance of 16 s rrna gene n 3 fig s2b similar to eargs they also fluctuated greatly during the sampling period the average total concentration of observed iargs generally fluctuated from 0 03 february to 0 29 september in the second effluent before chlorination while it changed between 0 12 june to 3 20 november for the final effluent after chlorination fig 3 a in terms of the median concentration intracellular sul1 and sul2 were listed at top two iargs while the abundance of van a was lowest in water samples in despite of chlorination n 33 fig 3b compared to the second effluent the concentrations of iargs in the final effluent after disinfection were also distinctly increased in this full scale uwwtp fig s5 tables s4 and s5 in response to chlorination the relative abundance of qnra increased 1 5 25 5 folds in all monthly final effluent and other iargs except tetb tetq sul1 vana increased 1 0 173 3 folds with detection frequency above 80 paired samples t test p 0 05 n 3 indicating that chlorination could increase the relative abundance of the most iargs qnra prominently the median ratio of each iarg concentration between after chlorination and before chlorination was in the range of 1 5 7 8 n 33 fig s4b further suggesting that the chlorination played a positive role in increasing iargs concentrations previous studies also showed the chlorination process increased the abundances of several typical iargs such as ampc apha2 blatem 1 and teta in drinking water shi et al 2013 it is suspected that chlorination could play a co selection role in bacterial antibiotic resistance another reason may be associated with the possibility that inadequate chlorine dosage could promote conjugative transfer in which more pilus acting as pathways for args transfer were induced on the surface of conjugative cells guo et al 2015 3 4 environmental factors influencing args concentration to explore which environmental factors are favorable to increase args during the chlorination the potential correlations between args concentration and water quality parameters were studied by spearman analyses then total concentrations of observed args under different correlative conditions were analyzed to further observe the effect of environmental factors on the variation of arg concentration it showed escherichia coli as a faecal indicator in water jang et al 2017 was the only index to present a strong positive correlation with the change of total concentration of observed eargs table s6 after chlorination the median concentration of total eargs showed an ascending trend when the abundance of e coli in the second effluent increased fig 4a considering there was no any correlation between eargs and heterotrophic bacteria it is assumed that human or animal sourced fecal bacteria were the key resources of eargs after the chlorination in the sediment the e coli abundance also has been found to be strongly correlated with args abundance devarajan et al 2016 in addition the factors of conductivity ph heterotrophic plate counts hpc tn ammonium and codmn exhibited significant correlations with some typical eargs e g ampc cata1 katg during the process of disinfection table s6 in contrast temperature turbidity and total phosphorus total coliform fecal coliform in the second effluent had no correlations with concentration variations of any observed eargs the abundance of hpc in the second effluent had a strong correlation with the changes of extracellular qnra and katg concentration after chlorination p 0 01 n 3 water temperature showed no correlations with concentration variations of total observed eargs p 0 05 n 3 but significant increased eargs abundance occurred when the water temperature ranged between 25 c and 27 c p 0 01 n 3 for iargs the results showed that the change of total concentration of observed iargs was strongly correlated with water temperature negatively and nh4 n concentration positively p 0 05 during the chlorination table s7 much more increase of median concentration of total iargs was observed when water temperature in the second effluent was declined fig 4b indicating low environmental temperature 10 20 c may be beneficial to elevate iargs concentration under the exposure of chlorine furthermore nh4 n concentration in the range from 1 8 to 2 5 mg l also exhibited a significant impact to the iargs concentration which caused the increasing of iargs concentration fig 4c similarly ali et al 2016 found nutrient induced antibiotic resistance in enterococcus faecalis in eutrophic environments higher nh4 n concentration was found to lead to lower removal of iargs at the same chlorine dosage yuan et al 2016 reported that the purification of wastewater quality parameters cod nh4 n and turbidity exhibited a positive correlation with arb and args reductions during the treatment in uwwtp however tn tp and cod of influent temperature and conductivity of mixed liquor were significant p 0 05 correlated to multiple args distribution in mbrs sun et al 2016 4 conclusions chlorination disinfection enhanced both eargs and iargs pollution in a full scale uwwtp e coli concentration before chlorination showed strong positive correlation with the eargs abundance in the final effluents while lower temperature and higher ammonium concentration was supposed to link with iargs this study suggests the chlorine disinfection could enhance the abundance of args thereby posing risk of the

19654,enhanced pond systems eps consist of a series of ponds that have been designed to work in synergy to provide both cost effective enhanced wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the form of algal biomass for beneficial reuse due to the limited number of full scale eps systems worldwide our understanding of factors governing both enhanced wastewater treatment and resource recovery is limited this paper investigates the seasonal performance of a full scale municipal wastewater eps with respect to nutrient removal from the liquid fraction microalgal biomass production and subsequent removal through the system in the high rate algal pond both microalgal productivity determined as organic matter and chlorophyll a biomass and nh4 n removal varied seasonally with significantly higher biomass and removal rates in summer than in spring p 0 05 or winter p 0 01 microalgal biomass was not successfully harvested in the algal harvester pond ahp most likely due to poor flocc formation coupled with relatively short hydraulic residence time hrt high percentage removal rates from sedimentation and zooplankton grazing were achieved in the maturation pond mp series particularly in winter and spring however in summer decreased efficiency of biomass removal and the growth of new microalgal species suggests that summer time hrt in the mps could be shortened further modifications to the operation of the ahp seasonal changes in the hrt of the mps and potential harvesting of zooplankton grazers are all potential strategies for improving resource recovery and producing a higher quality final discharge effluent keywords wastewater treatment nutrient removal resource recovery enhanced pond systems 1 introduction enhanced pond systems eps are recognised as a cost effective and efficient upgrade to conventional wastewater ponds for the treatment of municipal agricultural and industrial wastewater craggs et al 2015 compared to conventional ponds eps offer improved nutrient removal and natural disinfection with the added benefit of resource recovery in the form of algal biomass for beneficial reuse as fertiliser feed or biofuel benemann 2008 rawat et al 2011 craggs et al 2012 eps consist of a series of ponds that have been designed to work in synergy to provide enhanced wastewater treatment coupled with high biomass yields and cost effective harvesting eps typically comprises of covered anaerobic ponds cap high rate algal ponds hrap algal harvest ponds ahp maturation ponds mp and rock filters rf wastewater treatment through an eps starts with the sedimentation of the solids fraction and subsequent anaerobic digestion within the cap the digested liquid fraction of the wastewater exists the cap and flows into the hrap where nutrient removal by assimilation into microalgal biomass occurs elevated daytime oxygen and ph also enhance disinfection by solar uv davies colley et al 2003 as well being beneficial for aerobic microorganisms that oxidise organic matter benemann 2008 as effluent from the hrap passes through the ahp algal biomass is settled and removed for subsequent resource recovery while further polishing of the treated effluent occurs in the mp and rf further details on the design and role of the individual ponds of eps are provided in craggs et al 2014 2015 wastewater treatment and resource recovery using microalgal bacterial based systems has been the focus of international research over the last couple of decades with the interest in algal based products such as biofuels whose production would otherwise be cost prohibitive at large scale driving much of this research benemann 2008 unc et al 2017 while treatment of wastewater and resource recovery has been successfully demonstrated at a range of scale there are still several challenges that need to be overcome with respect to optimised productivity resource recovery and the production of a final effluent that meets local authority discharge requirements to make full scale systems commercially viable these challenges include selection and maintenance of high biomass yielding microalgae increased nutrient removal particularly phosphorus removal optimising culture conditions including ph dissolved inorganic carbon available light and temperature rawat et al 2011 gonçalves et al 2017 liu et al 2017 salama et al 2017 there have been numerous mesocosm and pilot scale studies dedicated to understanding and improving culture conditions to enhance coupled nutrient removal and biomass production over the last decade sutherland et al 2015a identified that operational changes were likely to be the most cost effective way to enhance these processes however most studies investigating the effects of operational changes on pond performance have focused solely on hrap performance at mesocosm and or pilot scale while several have also investigated ahp performance e g gonzález et al 1997 park and craggs 2011 kothari et al 2012 park et al 2013 manheim and yarrow 2013 sutherland et al 2014 2015b studies investigating the performance of full scale eps with respect to nutrient removal biomass production harvesting and effluent polishing have been limited due to the limited number of full scale systems worldwide however microalgal biomass production in the full scale studies have been notably lower than that reported in pilot scale or mesocosm scale studies regardless of the season or the dominant microalgal species the disconnect between small scale and full scale productivity is unclear but needs to be resolved before coupled wastewater treatment and resource recovery can become a commercial reality as with studies that investigated enhancing biomass productivity at mesocosm and pilot scale the first step is understanding how a full scale eps system performs seasonally under constant operational conditions before we can start to manipulate the culture conditions to enhance performance similarly gravity harvesting and final polishing of effluent have not been investigated at full scale the aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal performance of a full scale municipal wastewater eps with respect to nutrient removal from the liquid fraction microalgal biomass production and subsequent removal through simple gravity harvesting and final polishing of the effluent 2 methods 2 1 study site and environmental variables the enhanced pond system eps was constructed at the cambridge wastewater treatment plant wwtp north island new zealand lat 37 53 54 63 s long 175 26 17 15 e the eps consisted of a covered anaerobic pond cap followed by two identical series of ponds each including a 1 ha single loop earth lined raceway high rate algal pond hrap two algal harvester ponds ahp and two series of maturation ponds mp1 and mp2 with each series consisting of three ponds fig 1 the hraps influent was the digested effluent from the cap the hraps had an operating depth of 300 mm a total treatment volume of 2900 m3 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of eight days a single paddlewheel in each of the hraps was used to mix the wastewater and microalgae bacteria consortia around the pond at a horizontal velocity of 0 2 m s 1 the ahps were in ground inverted pyramids with a depth of 4 m a total volume of 128 m3 and a 9 h retention time while the mp1 and mp2 series each had a total volume of 1968 m3 and a 5 3 day hrt further details on the design and construction of the hraps is described in craggs et al 2015 the eps treatment system downstream of the cap had a total design hrt of 13 6 days for the duration of the experiment microalgal biomass and nutrient removal did not differ significantly between the paired ponds over the course of the experiment allowing them to be treated as duplicates see sutherland et al 2017 for further details the ponds had been in operation for at least 18 months prior to the start of this experiment with a microalgal community that had naturally colonised 2 2 sample collection sampling occurred twice weekly over a nine month period from june 2016 to february 2017 for each pond integrated depth 0 300 mm water samples were collected adjacent to the outflow

during winter ankistrodesmus falcatus biovolume decreased from 95 in the hrap to only 41 in the mp2 while microcystis aeruginosa f aeruginosa became the co dominant species in the mp2 54 table 3 during spring micractinium pusillum was the dominant species in the hrap 47 followed by pediastrum boryanum 30 as the pond water left the hrap the relative dominance of m pusillum decreased while p

significantly higher p 0 01 than all other ponds which did not differ significantly from each other table 3 nmds ordination based on bray curtis similarities between the microalgal community biovolumes showed that during winter the communities were at least 80 similar in all ponds except for three occasions in the mp2 where the community was less than 50 similar to all other ponds fig 5 a during spring the similarity between the microalgal community in all ponds became less 60 similarity with mp1 and mp2 becoming increasingly dissimilar to hrap and ahp communities fig 5b during summer the microalgal community in the mp2 was always at least 50 dissimilar to the microalgal communities in the other ponds fig 5c 4 discussion 4 1 microalgal biomass productivity and nutrient removal microalgal biomass productivity occurred primarily in the hraps although the additional growth that occurred in the mps in summer as indicated by the change in microalgal communities was most likely due to longer than necessary hrt during summertime see discussion below microalgal biomass determined as either vss or chlorophyll a concentration was lower than that reported in another temperate full scale hrap system see sutherland et al 2013 and considerably lower than that reported from pilot scale hrap systems e g garcía et al 2006 matamoros et al 2015 de godos et al 2016 reasons for the considerably lower productivity at full scale compared to pilot scale are unclear as climatic conditions temperature light rainfall were similar to or the same as pilot scale studies undertake by the authors e g sutherland et al 2015a montemezzani et al 2016 further research into factors limiting biomass productivity at full scale compared to pilot scale is needed to better evaluate the viability of hraps for wastewater treatment and resource recovery nh4 n removal occurred predominantly in the hrap and both the percentage nh4 n removal and its seasonal trends were consistent with results reported from other full scale and pilot scale studies in temperate climates e g cromar and fallowfield 1997 garcía et al 2006 craggs et al 2012 tan and hu 2016 posadas et al 2017 however nutrient removal efficiency of nh4 n that is the amount of nh4 n removed per unit chl a was higher in the present study than compared to reported in another full scale hrap e g sutherland et al 2013 the higher removal rates in the present study may be related to the higher nh4 n load compared to that of sutherland et al 2013 2014 found that under higher nutrient loads the nutrient removal efficiency also increased regardless of season in the current study the higher nh4 n load is also the most probable explanation for the higher removal efficiency observed during summer compared to winter and spring aerobic nitrifying bacteria also play a role in nutrient removal in wastewater treatment hraps through nitrification denitrification processes cheng and fallowfield 2017 with optimal growth at ph 8 in wastewater ponds antoniou et al 1990 craggs 2005 in the present study while conditions were optimal for aerobic nitrifying bacteria growth nitrate concentrations below laboratory detection limits meant that the contribution of bacteria to nutrient removal could not be quantified in this instance a number of studies have shown that nitrification denitrification occurs under certain culture conditions in mesocosm and pilot scale hraps sutherland et al 2015c vergara et al 2016 cheng and fallowfield 2017 sniffen et al 2017 observed a decrease in nitrate nitrite concentrations as well as the relative abundances of ammonia and nitrate oxidising bacteria as the culture scale increased in algal bacterial leachate treatment systems percentage removal of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp was highly variable over the course of the study and there was no obvious relationship between drp removal and either microalgal biomass species composition or nitrogen removal at times percentage removal was negative meaning that there had been an increase in drp concentration from the time the water entered the pond influent until it exited effluent this mostly occurred in the mps and was most likely the result of the breakdown and release of drp from dead biological matter microalgae bacteria and or zooplankton on the bottom of the pond low and highly variable drp removal has been reported in other pilot scale and full scale studies that were operated as continuous or semi continuous cultures and its removal is considered to be dependent on microalgal growth rate hrt and nitrogen concentrations in the hrap cromar and fallowfield 1997 aslan and kapdan 2006 larsdotter 2006 craggs et al 2012 4 2 algal harvest pond efficiency gravity harvesting of microalgal biomass has previously been successfully demonstrated at both laboratory and pilot scales with a 48 85 harvest efficiency microalgal species dependant at retention times ranging from 12 to 24 h nurdogan and oswald 1996 park and craggs 2010 park and craggs 2011 gutiérrez et al 2016a in our study gravity harvesting of the microalgal biomass was unsuccessful in the full scale ahp regardless of season biomass concentration or dominant species one plausible explanation for the settling efficiency differences between pilot and full scale systems may be the presence of microbial flocs microbial flocs are an aggregate of microalgae bacteria and detrital material forming relatively large 0 5 1 0 mm wide colonies that readily settle out of the water column park and craggs 2010 found that large flocs settled rapidly in 250 l gravity harvesters with a total retention time of 12 h in the present study large microbial flocs were a rare occurrence with flocs typically forming only in response to increased grazer production data not shown nitrogen limitation recycling a settled biomass addition of co2 or chemical flocculants have all been successfully trialled at laboratory and pilot scales to enhance floc formation weissman and goebel 1985 benemann and oswald 1996 park and craggs 2010 park et al 2013 gutiérrez et al 2016a 2016b but to date are yet to be successfully demonstrated at full scale another explanation for the poor settling efficiency at full scale may be insufficient retention time to allow the microalgae to settle out of the water column with both microalgae and water having similar densities there is little density difference between the two to drive settlement of the microalgae out of the water column milledge and heaven 2013 the rate of sinking is dependent on the species present with a reported settling velocity of 0 2 0 4 m day 1 for diatoms and other silica walled algae 0 1 0 2 m day 1 for green microalgae and between 0 0 and 0 1 m day 1 for cyanobacteria cole and wells 1995 green algae were typically the dominant species in the hrap effluent over the course of our study with a depth of 4 m in the ahp a retention time of between 20 and 40 days would be required to ensure 100 removal such retention times in a full scale eps are not possible from either an economic or biomass viability prospective decreasing the ahp depth and or increasing the retention time are two options that may improve gravity settling in the full scale ahp however both options would require changes to the current design which may result in increased land requirement and or construction costs an alternative approach for enhancement of microalgal harvesting is the use of chemical additives that cause flocculation and or sedimentation flocculation results in an increased aggregation of microalgae and bacterial colonies which results in an increase in the specific gravity resulting in sedimentation mata et al 2010 several chemical flocculates that have been recently investigated for suitability for microalgal harvesting include alum vandamme et al 2018 calcium phosphate phasey et al 2017 ecotan and tanfloc gutiérrez et al 2015 the use of bio flocculants naturally occurring compounds that stimulate secretion of extracellular polymers from microalgal and bacterial cells that enhance clumping of cells for harvesting has recently gained a lot of attention ummalyma et al 2017 the appeal of bio flocculants is that they are relatively low cost and environmentally friendly compared to other chemicals making them suitable for bulk harvesting of microalgae ummalyma et al 2017 several bio flocculants under investigation include chiton guar gum inulin and cationic starch rahul et al 2014 singh et al 2017 úbeda et al 2017 ummalyma et al 2017 studies at full scale are needed to examine efficiency and cost effectiveness potential generation of microturbulence within the ahp due to the continual inflow outflow through the ahp as well as variations in the light dark cycle may also play a role in the harvest ability of microalgae burns and rosa 1980 demonstrated variability in the settling velocity of 10 microalgae in response to varying light intensities throughout the day further research is needed into enhancing gravity assisted harvesting at full scale before it can become commercially viable 4 3 maturation pond performance the maturation ponds provide additional treatment of the ahp effluent enabling further sunlight uv disinfection and suspended solids removal as well as providing storage capacity before final discharge or reuse oswald 1991 craggs et al 2015 mps are designed to promote zooplankton grazing of remaining microalgal biomass as well as provide further disinfection via exposure to solar radiation sedimentation and protozoan grazing tanner et al 2005 in our study substantial suspended solids organic matter and chl a biomass removal occurred in the maturation ponds regardless of the season considerably longer hrt in the mp compared to that in the ahp most likely helped to facilitate both sedimentation and zooplankton grazing tanner et al 2005 valero and mara 2007 abdel aatty and karnel 2008 however lower than expected net summer time removal rates in the second series of mps coupled with shifts in the microalgal community composition see section 4 4 below suggests that the hrt in mp2 was sufficiently long enough to allow for microalgal productivity and biomass accumulation issues with the leaking of pond water through the bottom of the earth lined ponds in mp2 resulted in hrts that were longer than the intended design through the series of ponds this coupled with increased microalgal growth rates associated with higher light and temperature most likely explained the lower net removal rates during summer the mps provide another potential opportunity to recover resources this time in the form of zooplankton biomass harvested zooplankton could be used as a feedstock for freshwater aquaculture or as a source of chitin proteins and lipids for the food and cosmetic industries sevrin reyssac 1998 cauchie et al 1995 kibria et al 1999 montemezzani et al 2015 harvesting of zooplankton was not trialled in this study 4 4 shifts in microalgal community composition through the eps throughout the study the microalgal community was dominated by members of the group chlorophyta cyanophyta and euglenophyta all genera recorded throughout the eps system are often found in highly enriched shallow aquatic systems reynolds 2012 and have been reported in other pilot scale and full scale wastewater hrap treatments systems see assemany et al 2015 cho et al 2015 sutherland et al 2017 for further details while the microalgal communities were similar between all ponds during winter the community composition in the mp2 became increasingly dissimilar to all other treatment ponds with the greatest measurable differences during summer reasons for this most probably are due to a combination of preferential settling out of some species selective zooplankton grazing and growth of new species in mp2 in winter the loss of over half the total biovolume of a falcatus was most likely a result of zooplankton grazing the cells of a falcatus are long and narrow and do not possess any defence mechanisms such as mucilage or spines gough 1969 a falcatus are readily consumed by both rotifers and cladocerans in wastewater treatment hraps montemezzani et al 2016 and the longer hrt in the mps likely further enhanced grazing of this species at the same time the potentially toxic cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa f aeruginosa increased in dominance due to m aeruginosa f aeruginosa had been present in mp2 and most probably formed resting cells in the pond sediment which subsequently germinated in response to the decreased microalgal biomass increased light to the bottom of the pond as a falcatus was grazed in mp1 before entering mp2 m aeruginosa f aeruginosa avoids zooplankton grazing through the formation of large colonies or by producing toxic compounds that interfere with filter feeding yang et al 2006 the decline in the abundance of the colonial micractinium pusillum through the mps during spring and summer may have been related to settling rather than grazing pressure previous pilot scale studies have shown that large spine bearing colonies of m pusillum such as those that occurred in our study rapidly settled out of the water column and were more resistant to grazing park et al 2013 montemezzani et al 2016 con current increases in the abundance of buoyant or motile species such as planktothrix isothrix m aeruginosa f aeruginosa and euglena obtusa further reflects a lower turbulence environment in the mps compared to the hrap dramatic shifts in microalgal community composition has been associated with changes in turbulence mixing in lakes and ponds with reduced vertical mixing associated with dominance by cyanobacteria huisman et al 2004 carey et al 2012 while the two mp series did provide additional polishing of the hrap effluent the shifts in community composition in both the mp1 and mp2 compared to the hrap during summer suggests that summer time hrt was sufficiently long enough to allow for new microalgal productivity in the mps 4 5 summer time hrt in the full scale eps shorter summer time hrt would likely reduce the time available for the new microalgal productivity and associated biomass accumulation in the mps while leaking issues associated with the mp2 would have extended the hrt beyond the intended hrt microalgal community compositional changes in mp1 indicate that the hrt of the combined mp1 and mp2 was too long in summer there are two simple operational changes that can be made to reduce the summer time hrt through the mps the first is to reduce the number of ponds in operation during summer this can be achieved by either retiring mp1 or mp2 during summer for each of the eps systems or to divert the ahp effluent of both eps systems through only one mp1 mp2 series this would effectively halve the hrt through the mps while the upstream hrt that is in the hraps and ahp would remain the same the second approach is to reduce the hrt through the entire eps system shorter summertime hrt 4 days compared to 7 8 days in hraps have resulted in higher microalgal productivity and lower bacterial productivity as well as decrease nitrification denitrification rates cromar and fallowfield 1997 park and craggs 2011 however in the present study while reducing the eps hrt most probably would have prevented new microalgal productivity in the mps final effluent water quality with respect to nh4 n concentrations would be poorer due to higher summer time nh4 n concentrations in the hrap influent under conditions where other growth factors were not limiting sutherland et al 2014 found that in hraps the percentage removal of nh4 n did not differ between high and moderate nh4 n concentrations but the effluent quality was poorer an alternate to reducing the entire hrt of the eps could be operating the hraps in series at half the hrt of parallel operation by feeding either the ahp or the mp1 effluent from the first hrap into the second hrap a longer hrt and associated higher nutrient removal would be achieved in the hraps whilst maintaining a shorter hrt in the mps in addition to the issues associated with increased microalgal growth in the mps during summer the long hrt 13 6 days of the eps system may be problematic from a wwtp operational perspective for small towns and rural communities an eps system with a 14 day hrt would be a viable prospective but for wwtp treating large volumes long hrt would require more eps systems with increased land and operational requirements enhancing the harvestability e g using bio flocculants in the ahp may also provide sufficient polishing of the pond water to meet discharge water quality requirements thus reducing the need for rf and mp 5 conclusion this study demonstrated the performance with respect to nutrient removal and recovery of a full scale eps treating municipal wastewater through winter spring and summer nutrient removal through assimilation into microalgal biomass occurred in the hraps while the purpose of the downstream ponds was biomass removal and final effluent polishing the ahp did not successfully harvest microalgal biomass regardless of the season biomass concentration or dominant species lack of flocc formation coupled with the relatively short hrt in the ahp may be the main contributor to the poor settle ability high percentage removal rates were achieved in the mp series particularly in winter and spring decreased efficiency of biomass removal and the growth of new microalgal species that were not in the present in the hrap communities suggests that summer time hrt in the mps should have been shorter further modifications to the operation of the ahp seasonal changes in the hrt of the mps or whole eps except the cap and potential harvesting of zooplankton grazers are all potential strategies for improving resource recovery and producing a higher quality

19654,enhanced pond systems eps consist of a series of ponds that have been designed to work in synergy to provide both cost effective enhanced wastewater treatment and resource recovery in the form of algal biomass for beneficial reuse due to the limited number of full scale eps systems worldwide our understanding of factors governing both enhanced wastewater treatment and resource recovery is limited this paper investigates the seasonal performance of a full scale municipal wastewater eps with respect to nutrient removal from the liquid fraction microalgal biomass production and subsequent removal through the system in the high rate algal pond both microalgal productivity determined as organic matter and chlorophyll a biomass and nh4 n removal varied seasonally with significantly higher biomass and removal rates in summer than in spring p 0 05 or winter p 0 01 microalgal biomass was not successfully harvested in the algal harvester pond ahp most likely due to poor flocc formation coupled with relatively short hydraulic residence time hrt high percentage removal rates from sedimentation and zooplankton grazing were achieved in the maturation pond mp series particularly in winter and spring however in summer decreased efficiency of biomass removal and the growth of new microalgal species suggests that summer time hrt in the mps could be shortened further modifications to the operation of the ahp seasonal changes in the hrt of the mps and potential harvesting of zooplankton grazers are all potential strategies for improving resource recovery and producing a higher quality final discharge effluent keywords wastewater treatment nutrient removal resource recovery enhanced pond systems 1 introduction enhanced pond systems eps are recognised as a cost effective and efficient upgrade to conventional wastewater ponds for the treatment of municipal agricultural and industrial wastewater craggs et al 2015 compared to conventional ponds eps offer improved nutrient removal and natural disinfection with the added benefit of resource recovery in the form of algal biomass for beneficial reuse as fertiliser feed or biofuel benemann 2008 rawat et al 2011 craggs et al 2012 eps consist of a series of ponds that have been designed to work in synergy to provide enhanced wastewater treatment coupled with high biomass yields and cost effective harvesting eps typically comprises of covered anaerobic ponds cap high rate algal ponds hrap algal harvest ponds ahp maturation ponds mp and rock filters rf wastewater treatment through an eps starts with the sedimentation of the solids fraction and subsequent anaerobic digestion within the cap the digested liquid fraction of the wastewater exists the cap and flows into the hrap where nutrient removal by assimilation into microalgal biomass occurs elevated daytime oxygen and ph also enhance disinfection by solar uv davies colley et al 2003 as well being beneficial for aerobic microorganisms that oxidise organic matter benemann 2008 as effluent from the hrap passes through the ahp algal biomass is settled and removed for subsequent resource recovery while further polishing of the treated effluent occurs in the mp and rf further details on the design and role of the individual ponds of eps are provided in craggs et al 2014 2015 wastewater treatment and resource recovery using microalgal bacterial based systems has been the focus of international research over the last couple of decades with the interest in algal based products such as biofuels whose production would otherwise be cost prohibitive at large scale driving much of this research benemann 2008 unc et al 2017 while treatment of wastewater and resource recovery has been successfully demonstrated at a range of scale there are still several challenges that need to be overcome with respect to optimised productivity resource recovery and the production of a final effluent that meets local authority discharge requirements to make full scale systems commercially viable these challenges include selection and maintenance of high biomass yielding microalgae increased nutrient removal particularly phosphorus removal optimising culture conditions including ph dissolved inorganic carbon available light and temperature rawat et al 2011 gonçalves et al 2017 liu et al 2017 salama et al 2017 there have been numerous mesocosm and pilot scale studies dedicated to understanding and improving culture conditions to enhance coupled nutrient removal and biomass production over the last decade sutherland et al 2015a identified that operational changes were likely to be the most cost effective way to enhance these processes however most studies investigating the effects of operational changes on pond performance have focused solely on hrap performance at mesocosm and or pilot scale while several have also investigated ahp performance e g gonzález et al 1997 park and craggs 2011 kothari et al 2012 park et al 2013 manheim and yarrow 2013 sutherland et al 2014 2015b studies investigating the performance of full scale eps with respect to nutrient removal biomass production harvesting and effluent polishing have been limited due to the limited number of full scale systems worldwide however microalgal biomass production in the full scale studies have been notably lower than that reported in pilot scale or mesocosm scale studies regardless of the season or the dominant microalgal species the disconnect between small scale and full scale productivity is unclear but needs to be resolved before coupled wastewater treatment and resource recovery can become a commercial reality as with studies that investigated enhancing biomass productivity at mesocosm and pilot scale the first step is understanding how a full scale eps system performs seasonally under constant operational conditions before we can start to manipulate the culture conditions to enhance performance similarly gravity harvesting and final polishing of effluent have not been investigated at full scale the aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal performance of a full scale municipal wastewater eps with respect to nutrient removal from the liquid fraction microalgal biomass production and subsequent removal through simple gravity harvesting and final polishing of the effluent 2 methods 2 1 study site and environmental variables the enhanced pond system eps was constructed at the cambridge wastewater treatment plant wwtp north island new zealand lat 37 53 54 63 s long 175 26 17 15 e the eps consisted of a covered anaerobic pond cap followed by two identical series of ponds each including a 1 ha single loop earth lined raceway high rate algal pond hrap two algal harvester ponds ahp and two series of maturation ponds mp1 and mp2 with each series consisting of three ponds fig 1 the hraps influent was the digested effluent from the cap the hraps had an operating depth of 300 mm a total treatment volume of 2900 m3 and a hydraulic retention time hrt of eight days a single paddlewheel in each of the hraps was used to mix the wastewater and microalgae bacteria consortia around the pond at a horizontal velocity of 0 2 m s 1 the ahps were in ground inverted pyramids with a depth of 4 m a total volume of 128 m3 and a 9 h retention time while the mp1 and mp2 series each had a total volume of 1968 m3 and a 5 3 day hrt further details on the design and construction of the hraps is described in craggs et al 2015 the eps treatment system downstream of the cap had a total design hrt of 13 6 days for the duration of the experiment microalgal biomass and nutrient removal did not differ significantly between the paired ponds over the course of the experiment allowing them to be treated as duplicates see sutherland et al 2017 for further details the ponds had been in operation for at least 18 months prior to the start of this experiment with a microalgal community that had naturally colonised 2 2

during winter ankistrodesmus falcatus biovolume decreased from 95 in the hrap to only 41 in the mp2 while microcystis aeruginosa f aeruginosa became the co dominant species in the mp2 54 table 3 during spring micractinium pusillum was the dominant species in the hrap 47 followed by pediastrum boryanum 30 as the pond water left the hrap the relative dominance of m pusillum decreased while p

significantly higher p 0 01 than all other ponds which did not differ significantly from each other table 3 nmds ordination based on bray curtis similarities between the microalgal community biovolumes showed that during winter the communities were at least 80 similar in all ponds except for three occasions in the mp2 where the community was less than 50 similar to all other ponds fig 5 a during spring the similarity between the microalgal community in all ponds became less 60 similarity with mp1 and mp2 becoming increasingly dissimilar to hrap and ahp communities fig 5b during summer the microalgal community in the mp2 was always at least 50 dissimilar to the microalgal communities in the other ponds fig 5c 4 discussion 4 1 microalgal biomass productivity and nutrient removal microalgal biomass productivity occurred primarily in the hraps although the additional growth that occurred in the mps in summer as indicated by the change in microalgal communities was most likely due to longer than necessary hrt during summertime see discussion below microalgal biomass determined as either vss or chlorophyll a concentration was lower than that reported in another temperate full scale hrap system see sutherland et al 2013 and considerably lower than that reported from pilot scale hrap systems e g garcía et al 2006 matamoros et al 2015 de godos et al 2016 reasons for the considerably lower productivity at full scale compared to pilot scale are unclear as climatic conditions temperature light rainfall were similar to or the same as pilot scale studies undertake by the authors e g sutherland et al 2015a montemezzani et al 2016 further research into factors limiting biomass productivity at full scale compared to pilot scale is needed to better evaluate the viability of hraps for wastewater treatment and resource recovery nh4 n removal occurred predominantly in the hrap and both the percentage nh4 n removal and its seasonal trends were consistent with results reported from other full scale and pilot scale studies in temperate climates e g cromar and fallowfield 1997 garcía et al 2006 craggs et al 2012 tan and hu 2016 posadas et al 2017 however nutrient removal efficiency of nh4 n that is the amount of nh4 n removed per unit chl a was higher in the present study than compared to reported in another full scale hrap e g sutherland et al 2013 the higher removal rates in the present study may be related to the higher nh4 n load compared to that of sutherland et al 2013 2014 found that under higher nutrient loads the nutrient removal efficiency also increased regardless of season in the current study the higher nh4 n load is also the most probable explanation for the higher removal efficiency observed during summer compared to winter and spring aerobic nitrifying bacteria also play a role in nutrient removal in wastewater treatment hraps through nitrification denitrification processes cheng and fallowfield 2017 with optimal growth at ph 8 in wastewater ponds antoniou et al 1990 craggs 2005 in the present study while conditions were optimal for aerobic nitrifying bacteria growth nitrate concentrations below laboratory detection limits meant that the contribution of bacteria to nutrient removal could not be quantified in this instance a number of studies have shown that nitrification denitrification occurs under certain culture conditions in mesocosm and pilot scale hraps sutherland et al 2015c vergara et al 2016 cheng and fallowfield 2017 sniffen et al 2017 observed a decrease in nitrate nitrite concentrations as well as the relative abundances of ammonia and nitrate oxidising bacteria as the culture scale increased in algal bacterial leachate treatment systems percentage removal of dissolved reactive phosphorus drp was highly variable over the course of the study and there was no obvious relationship between drp removal and either microalgal biomass species composition or nitrogen removal at times percentage removal was negative meaning that there had been an increase in drp concentration from the time the water entered the pond influent until it exited effluent this mostly occurred in the mps and was most likely the result of the breakdown and release of drp from dead biological matter microalgae bacteria and or zooplankton on the bottom of the pond low and highly variable drp removal has been reported in other pilot scale and full scale studies that were operated as continuous or semi continuous cultures and its removal is considered to be dependent on microalgal growth rate hrt and nitrogen concentrations in the hrap cromar and fallowfield 1997 aslan and kapdan 2006 larsdotter 2006 craggs et al 2012 4 2 algal harvest pond efficiency gravity harvesting of microalgal biomass has previously been successfully demonstrated at both laboratory and pilot scales with a 48 85 harvest efficiency microalgal species dependant at retention times ranging from 12 to 24 h nurdogan and oswald 1996 park and craggs 2010 park and craggs 2011 gutiérrez et al 2016a in our study gravity harvesting of the microalgal biomass was unsuccessful in the full scale ahp regardless of season biomass concentration or dominant species one plausible explanation for the settling efficiency differences between pilot and full scale systems may be the presence of microbial flocs microbial flocs are an aggregate of microalgae bacteria and detrital material forming relatively large 0 5 1 0 mm wide colonies that readily settle out of the water column park and craggs 2010 found that large flocs settled rapidly in 250 l gravity harvesters with a total retention time of 12 h in the present study large microbial flocs were a rare occurrence with flocs typically forming only in response to increased grazer production data not shown nitrogen limitation recycling a settled biomass addition of co2 or chemical flocculants have all been successfully trialled at laboratory and pilot scales to enhance floc formation weissman and goebel 1985 benemann and oswald 1996 park and craggs 2010 park et al 2013 gutiérrez et al 2016a 2016b but to date are yet to be successfully demonstrated at full scale another explanation for the poor settling efficiency at full scale may be insufficient retention time to allow the microalgae to settle out of the water column with both microalgae and water having similar densities there is little density difference between the two to drive settlement of the microalgae out of the water column milledge and heaven 2013 the rate of sinking is dependent on the species present with a reported settling velocity of 0 2 0 4 m day 1 for diatoms and other silica walled algae 0 1 0 2 m day 1 for green microalgae and between 0 0 and 0 1 m day 1 for cyanobacteria cole and wells 1995 green algae were typically the dominant species in the hrap effluent over the course of our study with a depth of 4 m in the ahp a retention time of between 20 and 40 days would be required to ensure 100 removal such retention times in a full scale eps are not possible from either an economic or biomass viability prospective decreasing the ahp depth and or increasing the retention time are two options that may improve gravity settling in the full scale ahp however both options would require changes to the current design which may result in increased land requirement and or construction costs an alternative approach for enhancement of microalgal harvesting is the use of chemical additives that cause flocculation and or sedimentation flocculation results in an increased aggregation of microalgae and bacterial colonies which results in an increase in the specific gravity resulting in sedimentation mata et al 2010 several chemical flocculates that have been recently investigated for suitability for microalgal harvesting include alum vandamme et al 2018 calcium phosphate phasey et al 2017 ecotan and tanfloc gutiérrez et al 2015 the use of bio flocculants naturally occurring compounds that stimulate secretion of extracellular polymers from microalgal and bacterial cells that enhance clumping of cells for harvesting has recently gained a lot of attention ummalyma et al 2017 the appeal of bio flocculants is that they are relatively low cost and environmentally friendly compared to other chemicals making them suitable for bulk harvesting of microalgae ummalyma et al 2017 several bio flocculants under investigation include chiton guar gum inulin and cationic starch rahul et al 2014 singh et al 2017 úbeda et al 2017 ummalyma et al 2017 studies at full scale are needed to examine efficiency and cost effectiveness potential generation of microturbulence within the ahp due to the continual inflow outflow through the ahp as well as variations in the light dark cycle may also play a role in the harvest ability of microalgae burns and rosa 1980 demonstrated variability in the settling velocity of 10 microalgae in response to varying light intensities throughout the day further research is needed into enhancing gravity assisted harvesting at full scale before it can become commercially viable 4 3 maturation pond performance the maturation ponds provide additional treatment of the ahp effluent enabling further sunlight uv disinfection and suspended solids removal as well as providing storage capacity before final discharge or reuse oswald 1991 craggs et al 2015 mps are designed to promote zooplankton grazing of remaining microalgal biomass as well as provide further disinfection via exposure to solar radiation sedimentation and protozoan grazing tanner et al 2005 in our study substantial suspended solids organic matter and chl a biomass removal occurred in the maturation ponds regardless of the season considerably longer hrt in the mp compared to that in the ahp most likely helped to facilitate both sedimentation and zooplankton grazing tanner et al 2005 valero and mara 2007 abdel aatty and karnel 2008 however lower than expected net summer time removal rates in the second series of mps coupled with shifts in the microalgal community composition see section 4 4 below suggests that the hrt in mp2 was sufficiently long enough to allow for microalgal productivity and biomass accumulation issues with the leaking of pond water through the bottom of the earth lined ponds in mp2 resulted in hrts that were longer than the intended design through the series of ponds this coupled with increased microalgal growth rates associated with higher light and temperature most likely explained the lower net removal rates during summer the mps provide another potential opportunity to recover resources this time in the form of zooplankton biomass harvested zooplankton could be used as a feedstock for freshwater aquaculture or as a source of chitin proteins and lipids for the food and cosmetic industries sevrin reyssac 1998 cauchie et al 1995 kibria et al 1999 montemezzani et al 2015 harvesting of zooplankton was not trialled in this study 4 4 shifts in microalgal community composition through the eps throughout the study the microalgal community was dominated by members of the group chlorophyta cyanophyta and euglenophyta all genera recorded throughout the eps system are often found in highly enriched shallow aquatic systems reynolds 2012 and have been reported in other pilot scale and full scale wastewater hrap treatments systems see assemany et al 2015 cho et al 2015 sutherland et al 2017 for further details while the microalgal communities were similar between all ponds during winter the community composition in the mp2 became increasingly dissimilar to all other treatment ponds with the greatest measurable differences during summer reasons for this most probably are due to a combination of preferential settling out of some species selective zooplankton grazing and growth of new species in mp2 in winter the loss of over half the total biovolume of a falcatus was most likely a result of zooplankton grazing the cells of a falcatus are long and narrow and do not possess any defence mechanisms such as mucilage or spines gough 1969 a falcatus are readily consumed by both rotifers and cladocerans in wastewater treatment hraps montemezzani et al 2016 and the longer hrt in the mps likely further enhanced grazing of this species at the same time the potentially toxic cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa f aeruginosa increased in dominance due to m aeruginosa f aeruginosa had been present in mp2 and most probably formed resting cells in the pond sediment which subsequently germinated in response to the decreased microalgal biomass increased light to the bottom of the pond as a falcatus was grazed in mp1 before entering mp2 m aeruginosa f aeruginosa avoids zooplankton grazing through the formation of large colonies or by producing toxic compounds that interfere with filter feeding yang et al 2006 the decline in the abundance of the colonial micractinium pusillum through the mps during spring and summer may have been related to settling rather than grazing pressure previous pilot scale studies have shown that large spine bearing colonies of m pusillum such as those that occurred in our study rapidly settled out of the water column and were more resistant to grazing park et al 2013 montemezzani et al 2016 con current increases in the abundance of buoyant or motile species such as planktothrix isothrix m aeruginosa f aeruginosa and euglena obtusa further reflects a lower turbulence environment in the mps compared to the hrap dramatic shifts in microalgal community composition has been associated with changes in turbulence mixing in lakes and ponds with reduced vertical mixing associated with dominance by cyanobacteria huisman et al 2004 carey et al 2012 while the two mp series did provide additional polishing of the hrap effluent the shifts in community composition in both the mp1 and mp2 compared to the hrap during summer suggests that summer time hrt was sufficiently long enough to allow for new microalgal productivity in the mps 4 5 summer time hrt in the full scale eps shorter summer time hrt would likely reduce the time available for the new microalgal productivity and associated biomass accumulation in the mps while leaking issues associated with the mp2 would have extended the hrt beyond the intended hrt microalgal community compositional changes in mp1 indicate that the hrt of the combined mp1 and mp2 was too long in summer there are two simple operational changes that can be made to reduce the summer time hrt through the mps the first is to reduce the number of ponds in operation during summer this can be achieved by either retiring mp1 or mp2 during summer for each of the eps systems or to divert the ahp effluent of both eps systems through only one mp1 mp2 series this would effectively halve the hrt through the mps while the upstream hrt that is in the hraps and ahp would remain the same the second approach is to reduce the hrt through the entire eps system shorter summertime hrt 4 days compared to 7 8 days in hraps have resulted in higher microalgal productivity and lower bacterial productivity as well as decrease nitrification denitrification rates cromar and fallowfield 1997 park and craggs 2011 however in the present study while reducing the eps hrt most probably would have prevented new microalgal productivity in the mps final effluent water quality with respect to nh4 n concentrations would be poorer due to higher summer time nh4 n concentrations in the hrap influent under conditions where other growth factors were not limiting sutherland et al 2014 found that in hraps the percentage removal of nh4 n did not differ between high and moderate nh4 n concentrations but the effluent quality was poorer an alternate to reducing the entire hrt of the eps could be operating the hraps in series at half the hrt of parallel operation by feeding either the ahp or the mp1 effluent from the first hrap into the second hrap a longer hrt and associated higher nutrient removal would be achieved in the hraps whilst maintaining a shorter hrt in the mps in addition to the issues associated with increased microalgal growth in the mps during summer the long hrt 13 6 days of the eps system may be problematic from a wwtp operational perspective for small towns and rural communities an eps system with a 14 day hrt would be a viable prospective but for wwtp treating large volumes long hrt would require more eps systems with increased land and operational requirements enhancing the harvestability e g using bio flocculants in the ahp may also provide sufficient polishing of the pond water to meet discharge water quality requirements thus reducing the need for rf and mp 5 conclusion this study demonstrated the performance with respect to nutrient removal and recovery of a full scale eps treating municipal wastewater through winter spring and summer nutrient removal through assimilation into microalgal biomass occurred in the hraps while the purpose of the downstream ponds was biomass removal and final effluent polishing the ahp did not successfully harvest microalgal biomass regardless of the season biomass concentration or dominant species lack of flocc formation coupled with the relatively short hrt in the ahp may be the main contributor to the poor settle ability high percentage removal rates were achieved in the mp series particularly in winter and spring decreased efficiency of biomass removal and the growth of new microalgal species that were not in the present in the hrap communities suggests that summer time hrt in the mps should have been shorter further modifications to the operation of the ahp seasonal changes in the hrt of the mps or whole eps except the cap and potential harvesting of zooplankton grazers are all potential strategies for improving resource recovery and producing a higher quality
