6685,the interactions of hydrological variables in the terrestrial hydrological cycle are complex to better predict the variables distributed and physically based models are used as they account for the complexity of interactions in this study we addressed the joint simulation of water and energy fluxes and the potential benefit of flux measurements in the parameter estimation process for this purpose we applied the hydrological model geotop to a prealpine catchment in southern germany river rott 55 km2 over two recent summer episodes as a test case due to its complexity the model is computationally demanding and only a limited number of forward runs can be afforded in inverse modelling and parameter estimation we applied the gradient based nonlinear gauss marquardt levenberg gml parameter estimation method and linked the geotop model to the parameter estimation tool pest using this developed geotop pest interface we particularly investigated the value added by including turbulent flux data in the parameter estimation process and analyse the impact of the additional flux data on the uncertainty bounds of the parameters to better understand the interplay of the model parameters and to identify the dominating parameters in the calibration process we also conducted a principal component analysis pca we were able to identify a set of model parameters that reproduced both observed streamflow and turbulent heat fluxes reasonably well the majority of the estimated parameters were highly sensitive to the considered variables we showed that the confidence bounds of estimated parameters are narrowed significantly when considering not only streamflow observations but also turbulent flux measurements in the calibration process in this manner correlations between estimated parameters could also be reduced keywords gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm geotop principle component analysis rott catchment 1 introduction the estimation of parameters is crucial for the successful application of distributed hydrological models as heterogeneity needs to be accounted for and large uncertainties exist in the parameter space which usually cannot be measured directly at field scale even in high resolution physically based hydrological models some parameters may remain that must be calibrated to obtain a satisfactory output liu et al 2005 fully distributed and physically based hydrological models are usually much more cpu time demanding than pure lumped models this is particularly true for the hydrological model geotop used in this study as it solves for example the nonlinear equations of three dimensional subsurface water flow and accounts for the full energy balance typically the trial and error method is applied for model calibration which is simple and accordingly has been widely used for hydrological models e g refsgaard 1997 senarath et al 2000 kunstmann et al 2006 hingerl et al 2016 soltani et al 2018 as this approach is time consuming automatic optimization algorithms are applied allowing to facilitate this effort eckhardt and arnold 2001 kunstmann et al 2006 lin 2011 automatic calibration can be fast on modern computer architectures and since it allows an efficient and extensive search within possible parameter ranges the results are expected to be more robust than those obtained by the manually based calibration approach bahremand and smedt 2008 different algorithms have been investigated in hydrological modelling for the automatic optimization process e g the simulated annealing method aarts and korst 1989 and the multiobjective complex evolution algorithm yapo et al 1998 these techniques however require a large number of model calls in order of several thousands which limits their application to fast conceptual or one dimensional models the gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm estimates the parameters using fewer model runs than any other optimization technique for nonlinear models e g monte carlo based algorithms doherty 2002 doherty and johnston 2003 bahremand and smedt 2006 however gml is based on a local search algorithm whose results may be affected by the initial value of the parameters e g kunstmann et al 2006 lin 2011 in this study the hydrologic model geotop 2 0 is coupled to the parameter estimation tool pest for an inverse hydrological modelling over two summer episodes of calibration 2013 and validation 2015 for the rott catchment located in the terrestrial environmental observatories tereno prealpine region in southern germany in the tereno prealpine observatory eco hydrometeorological variables such as evapotranspiration et and surface heat fluxes exhibit rapid changes within short distances soltani et al 2018 this is mainly because of the heterogeneity in topography landuse and soil type as well as interactions between the earth surface and the atmospheric boundary layer kunstmann et al 2004 2006 hingerl et al 2016 soltani et al 2017 thus the energy and water budgets in such environments are mainly controlled by the soil type properties pielke et al 1998 landcover characteristics dirmeyer et al 2010 and vegetation structure pielke et al 2011 previous studies in the tereno observatory and the surrounding areas e g bavarian alpine foothills and low mountain range have mainly focused on how climate change impacts runoff generation kunstmann et al 2004 runoff production processes and discharge related analysis wetzel et al 2003 2004a 2005a surface and sub surface water balances kunstmann et al 2006 wolf et al 2017 biosphere atmosphere exchange and greenhouse gases unteregelsbacher et al 2013 wang et al 2014 wolf et al 2017 zeeman et al 2017 energy balance closure ebc parameterization and ebc problem analysis ott et al 2013 eder et al 2014 soltani et al 2017 in addition to the studies listed above a limited number of studies have been carried out with regard to the calibration of hydrological models in this region i e kunstmann et al 2006 hingerl et al 2016 in which the models were only calibrated against streamflow data recently the coupled water and energy fluxes at high spatial resolution have been modelled using the geotop model over two different sized heterogeneous catchments i e rott and upper ammer in the tereno prealpine observatory by soltani et al 2018 the focus here was on the quantification of the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrometeorological variables and on the description of their underlying dependencies using empirical copula functions their results showed that the spatial variability of heat and water fluxes is significantly affected by diversity in topography radiation and wind components soil moisture properties as well as land cover and vegetation types across the region furthermore the empirical copula based function revealed that the dependence structures between the modelled and observed hydrometeorological variables are similar either at upper or lower density maxima this suggested a reasonable performance of the model as the interaction of variables was properly described however the model showed poorer performance in the middle ranks of the data while the main focus in soltani et al 2018 was the analysis of the model s variables this study here focuses on the model s parameters for this region therefore the following main objectives are considered in the present study 1 development of a new hydrological model optimization and uncertainty framework based on a geotop pest interface which allows an observational dataset to be involved in the calibration process via inverse modeling 2 quantification of the uncertainties pertaining to the estimated model parameters for which we particularly examine the benefit of additional heat flux observations on the parameter confidence bounds and 3 characterization of the intercorrelations between the model estimable parameters and their contributions to the calibration process this article is organized and structured as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study catchment and meteorological dataset methods including the hydrological modelling model setup and input data the parameter estimation tool and its utilities are described in section 3 results and discussion are given in section 4 followed by a summary and conclusion of our results in section 5 2 catchment characterization and available datasets 2 1 geography and climate the rott catchment 55 km2 is situated in the northern part of the terrestrial environmental observatories tereno prealpine region in southern germany fig 1 a and 1b it drains into lake ammer with 46 6 km2 is the sixth largest lake in germany the fendt eddy covariance ec site 47 831 n 11 061 e is within the southern part of the catchment at 598 mheight fig 1b and it is recognized as the tereno prealpine super ec site soltani et al 2017 the elevation of the catchment ranges from 902 m to 543 m a s l the outlet is at the discharge gauge raisting where it measures the water outflow from the catchment and no groundwater flow is considered the region is characterized by a cool temperate and humid climate the mean annual precipitation temperature is 1130 mm 6 9 c in the rott catchment kunstmann et al 2006 hingerl et al 2016 the highest amount of precipitation is received during summertime geologically most part of the catchment is situated in the quaternary moraines as well as in molasse and alluvium zones of the bavarian alpine foreland since most of the molasse area was overprinted by glacial erosion and deposition processes during the quaternary moraines and alluvial structures predominantly influence soil parent material conditions kiese et al 2018 thus the soil type distribution is closely intertwined with the geological properties where the dominant soil types in the catchment are fig 1c lessive 76 cambisol 13 and histosol 9 also the primary land cover is fig 1d pasture 44 coniferous 37 and mixed forests 18 followed by villages 2 as well as some peat 0 8 and marsh lands 0 5 as described in hingerl et al 2016 2 2 observational datasets hydrometeorological measurements were obtained from three sources for the calibration and validation periods in 01 may to 31 july 2013 and 2015 respectively as follows 1 ec based turbulent fluxes and the micrometeorological measurements are gathered from the fendt ec site de fen briefly described below 2 hourly meteorological forcing data for the wielenbach and hohenpeissenberg stations are received from the deutscher wetterdienst dwd https werdis dwd de 3 hourly data of precipitation for the diessen rain gauge and streamflow for the raisting discharge gauge are compiled from bayerisches landesamt für umwelt http www hnd bayern de we applied the model for the periods mentioned above because the computational costs of the inverse modelling with our developed geotop pest interface restricted the length of the simulation period moreover in the wintertime hydrometeorological fluxes are characterized by large uncertainties e g hingerl et al 2016 and the peak streamflow and the ec based measurements are of higher quality during summer periods in the tereno observatory soltani et al 2017 2018 2 2 1 eddy covariance measurements the basic principle of the ec measurements is that the vertical flux is calculated as a covariance between the concentration of a scalar e g air temperature and water vapour and the vertical wind velocity measured at the same point in space and time mauder and foken 2015 the fendt ec instruments were installed on a station 3 5 m above the surface see fig 1b the turbulent fluxes were measured with a 3 d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut oriented towards the prevailing wind direction along with an open path gas analyser all signals for the sensors were logged to a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific inc logan ut at a rate of 20 hz and were averaged for a half hourly period all the required procedures for the corrections and quality control qc of the turbulent fluxes were applied mauder et al 2013 foken et al 2004 as described in soltani et al 2017 the calculation of turbulent fluxes was done using the tk3 ec software mauder and foken 2015 tk3 is able to perform all of the post processing of turbulence measurements to produce the turbulent fluxes which includes all necessary corrections and tests lee et al 2004 aubinet et al 2012 for more information regarding the calculation of turbulent fluxes and qc using the tk3 software it is referred to mauder et al 2013 and mauder and foken 2015 3 methods 3 1 hydrological modelling the model geotop v 2 0 endrizzi et al 2014 was used for the catchment scale hydrologic simulation it is a fully distributed physically based hydrological model of the water and energy balance at and below the soil surface designed for simulations in continuum in small and mesoscale mountain catchments over complex terrain bertoldi et al 2004 rigon et al 2006 the model solves the heat and water flow equations for temperature and moisture in the soil with a coupled three dimensional numerical scheme bertoldi et al 2014 furthermore the model considers radiation correction for complex topography this includes the following i accounting for the solar incidence angle and the shadowing of direct solar radiation by surrounding mountains ii partitioning of radiation in direct and diffuse components according to erbs et al 1982 and iii the effects of topography on diffuse radiation coming on the surrounding terrain iqbal 1983 as described in bertoldi et al 2014 therefore geotop covers a variety of aspects of hydrological fluxes from the energy balance to snow cover and snowmelt zanotti et al 2004 the cryosphere endrizzi et al 2014 the effects of vegetation endrizzi and marsh 2010 and ecohydrological processes bertoldi et al 2010 della chiesa et al 2014 hingerl et al 2016 this is the reason for the choice of geotop in this study as we are interested in the interacting water and energy fluxes at and beneath the land surface since the core components of the geotop model are described in detail in endrizzi et al 2014 in the following only a brief overview of the model s capabilities i e water flow and energy flux equations that are our focus in this study are presented water flow equations the model solves the water balance in the soil using the system of equations represented below endrizzi et al 2014 1 θ w ph t ρ i ρ w θ i t 0 θ w f l t j w s w 0 where θ w ph is the fraction of liquid water content in soil subject to phase change θ w f l the fraction of liquid water content transferred by water flux ρ i kg m 3 the density of ice ρ w kg m 3 the density of liquid water in the soil θ i the fraction of ice in soil t s time divergence operator j w m s 1 the flux of liquid water and also s w s 1 as the mass sink term the above equation describes the water flow occurring below the soil surface and is referred to as the variably saturated richards equation according to darcy s law j w can be written as 2 j w k ψ z f where k m s 1 is the hydraulic conductivity ψ m the liquid liquid as water can also be ice water gauge pressure head and z f m the elevation head above a reference level if water pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure ψ is positive and thus soil is saturated and contrariwise when soil is unsaturated ψ 0 the water content θ w is calculated by means of the soil water retention curve according to the van genuchten 1980 model however when soil is saturated ψ 0 θ w should always be equal to the saturated value defining h m as the sum of the pressure and potential heads h ψ z f the second part of eq 1 combined with eq 2 becomes 3 θ w f l t k h s w 0 equation 3 is solved in a fully three dimensional way in order to describe the two gradients of h in the direction parallel and normal to the surface when the soil is saturated either because of precipitation or melting snow normal gradients become very small compared to those in the parallel direction which consequently are responsible for the routing of water through the soil endrizzi et al 2014 it is noted that the model also considers the canopy resistance for the calculation of the latent heat flux provided that the vegetation is available della chiesa et al 2014 additionally to fully describe the water balance in the soil and the runoff mechanisms the surface or overland water flow needs to be taken into account this process is described with the approximation proposed by gottardi and venutelli 1993 who extended to the surface flow the validity of darcy s law which would not be valid with the flow being turbulent using the water conservation and darcy s law for the overland flow the surface water balance is expressed as endrizzi et al 2014 4 ψ z 0 t ψ z 0 k s u r ψ z 0 z f z 0 p e 0 where ψ z 0 m and z f z 0 m are the liquid water pressure head and the elevation head at the soil surface k s u r m s 1 the conductance and p e m s 1 the effective precipitation per unit horizontal surface that reaches the soil surface including snowmelt flow and deducting evaporation from the soil the variable ψ z 0 cannot be negative in eq 4 and is written in place of water depth above the surface following gottardi and venutelli 1993 the conductance is 5 k sur c s ψ z 0 γ ψ z 0 s 0 5 where s m is the length along the direction of maximum local slope c s m1 y s 1 the surface roughness coefficient and γ an exponent between 0 and 1varying according to the formulation of c s it is noted that even though geotop solves the saturated and unsaturated surface subsurface and groundwater flows in a coupled way using the richards equations however it mainly describes water flow and aquifers in the soil that is close to the surface and hydrologically active normally a few meters or tens of meters for which it uses darcy s law to describe water flow in a porous medium this implies that solving all deep layers of groundwater and water in the fractured rocks is time consuming for geotop and it requires large amounts of data that typically are either not available or difficult to access for these practical reasons our optimization approach was mainly limited to the surface layers energy flux equations in the geotop model the surface heat flux s exchanged with the atmosphere is assigned by the sum of net shortwave radiation sw net longwave radiation lw and turbulent fluxes of sensible h and latent heat le that is 6 s t s u r s w l w t s u r h t s u r l e t s u r θ w the surface heat flux is dependent on the temperature of the surface t s u r which is unknown in the equation also the le flux depends on the soil moisture at the surface θ w which is a further coupling term to the water flow equations as described before the net shortwave radiation is a balance given by the incoming radiation sw in from the atmosphere and the reflected radiation sw out which is given by sw in multiplied by the broadband albedo sw in on a flat ground surface is the result of the top of atmosphere sw toa shortwave radiation and transmissivities of atmosphere τ a and cloud τ c as follows 7 sw in sw toa τ a τ c if the surface is snow free albedo varies linearly with the liquid water contents of the top soil layer however if it is snow covered the formulation of dickinson et al 1993 is used also the net longwave radiation is a balance of the component lw in coming from the atmosphere and lw out emitted by the surface lw in is the integrated result of the radiation emitted at different levels in the atmosphere with different temperatures and gas concentrations clear sky radiation is calculated with one of the several empirical formulations present in the literature see endrizzi et al 2014 which in general apply the stefan boltzmann law σ using the air temperature measured at the surface t a in k with an effective atmosphere emissivity a dependent on air temperature t a and water vapour pressure e a bar that is 8 l w in c l e a r a t a e a σ t a 4 however in cloudy skies the emissivity of the atmosphere is increased to a value c which may be significantly higher than a l w out emitted by the surface is also calculated with σ as follows 9 l w out s σ t sur 4 where t sur is the temperature of the surface k and s is the emissivity of the surface for further details it is referred to endrizzi et al 2014 the turbulent fluxes of sensible heat h and latent heat le along with the radiative fluxes described above play a significant role in the surface energy balance closure ebc the h le flux which is associated with convection driven by difference in temperature vapour pressure between land surface and the atmosphere however they are both largely driven by wind speed thus it is important to consider in the model a topographically dependent wind field to describe the effect of topography on the surface ebc according to endrizzi et al 2014 a full resolution of the fluid dynamic equations is too computationally heavy for geotop the wind field is therefore parameterised using topography liston and elder 2006 the model calculates the turbulent fluxes h and le with the flux gradient relationship e g garratt 1992 10 h ρ a c p w s t a t s u r r a 11 l e β y p l e ρ a c p w s q a α y p q s r a where ρ a is the air density kg m 3 c p the specific heat at constant pressure j kg 1 k 1 w s the wind speed m s 1 l e the specific heat of vaporisation j kg 1 q s the saturated specific humidity kg kg 1 at the surface q a the specific humidity of the air and r a the aerodynamic resistance the α yp and β yp coefficients take into account the soil resistance to evaporation and only depend on the liquid water pressure close to the soil surface they are calculated according to the parameterisation of ye and pielke 1993 which considers evaporation as the sum of the proper evaporation from the surface and diffusion of water vapour in soil pores at greater depths the aerodynamical resistance is obtained applying the monin obukhov similarity theory monin and obukhov 1954 which requires that values of wind speed air temperature and specific humidity are available at least at two different heights above the surface the meteorological forcing of precipitation air temperature and humidity wind speed and incoming solar radiation are distributed by height dependent interpolation methods liston and elder 2006 over the study catchment and define the surface boundary conditions further detailed on the model description is found in endrizzi et al 2014 and bertoldi et al 2014 as well as in the geotop user s manual by dall amico et al 2011 3 1 1 model setup and input dataset the geotop simulation domain covers a prealpine mountainous catchment in southern germany see fig 1a b which includes three main soil types see fig 1c and six main land covers see fig 1d for this application the following static datasets were used for simulation by the model first the dem 90 90 m2 obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm http srtm csi cgiar org then we calculated the river network terrain aspect and slope using arcmap gis esri 2011 based on techniques described by ghesla and rigon 2006 also the land cover 250 250 m2 and the soil type 2 2 km2 maps taken from hingerl et al 2016 were separately interpolated to the same resolution of the dem according to bertoldi et al 2004 in the model setup the soil is discretized in 13 layers with thicknesses increasing from the surface to the deep layers the top 8 layers starting from the surface have thicknesses ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 m with respect to the vertical gradients of water pressure and temperature endrizzi et al 2014 while the lowest 5 layers have thicknesses ranging from 1 0 to 5 0 m however in our simulation experiment only the first two layers of the soils i e 0 1 and 0 2 m were actively involved in the optimization process and the rest of the layers were kept constant because it was found that these two layers show the highest influence on the model s outputs soltani et al 2018 and also due to decreasing the insignificant parameters in the optimization process to reduce the number of model calls further the initial condition on the water table depth was set as initwatertableheightovertoposurface 5000 mm and initwatertabledepth 1000 mm the initial condition for the soil pressure i e initsoilpressure and initsoilpressurebedrock were kept constant by default for the rott catchment the hourly meteorological data of precipitation temperature wind speed wind direction and radiation components were provided as input forcing for simulation by the model model runs are integrated at one hour intervals further information regarding the interpolation of meteorological data in geotop is described in endrizzi et al 2014 two types of measurements involved in the model calibration that is the catchment integrating variable of discharge and the turbulent fluxes of h and le the simulation was run first for a summer episode starting from 01 may to 31 july 2013 as calibration and then the performance of the calibrated model was validated for the period of 01 may 30 july 2015 as validation a two week spin up period starting from 15 april to 30 april 2013 was conducted as it was found experimentally that this is sufficient for our experimental period soltani et al 2018 3 1 2 model performance evaluation and validation typically a variety of linear statistical metrics are used to evaluate the model performance as no single metric encapsulates all aspects of interest hence in this research we employed six statistical metrics to evaluate the performance of geotop they are described in table 1 the estimation of geotop parameters was performed for an independent period of 01 may to 31 july 2015 for the validation episode 3 1 3 post processing analysis of the model parameters to characterize the model parameter intercorrelation and their contributions in the calibration process a principal component analysis pca is performed on the parameter covariance matrix pca reduces the dimensionalityof a multivariate dataset this is achieved by transforming the initial variables into a new small set of variables without losing the most important information in the original dataset these new variables are calledprincipal components pcs the pcs are ranked in that way that pc1 explains the largest fraction of the variance in a dataset pc2 the second largest etc abdi and williams 2010 for further details of how the pca was performed it is referred to soltani et al 2017 3 2 parameter estimation strategy for parameter estimation we apply the gml method and its technical realization within the parameter estimation tool pest doherty 2002 we used pest also for a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the model parameters pest is model independent in the way that it communicates with the model through the model s input and output files doherty et al 2010 it minimizes a least squares objective function φ which is the sum of squared weighted residuals doherty 2016a 12a φ c x b t q c x b or 12b φ i 1 m w i r i 2 where x and b denote in turn the model s inputs and parameters and c is the observations the t superscript indicates the matrix transpose operation q is a diagonal matrix of the squared observation weights w i r i the i th residual expresses the differences between the model output and the field measurement for the i th observation to improve the performance of φ the residuals are given different weights the weights effectively normalize the components of φ it may be that some of the field data are more important to the model results than other data and therefore receive greater weight thus to ensure that no observation group dominates or is invisible in φ the pwtadj1 utility of pest was used to automate the weights adjustment procedure by doing so the reference variance or standard error of weighted residuals becomes equal to 1 0 meaning that the contribution made to φ by each observation group is equal for more details it is referred to doherty 2016b optimization of simple linear models can be achieved in one step however for nonlinear models like geotop the relationships between the model parameters and observations must be linearized to achieve the parameter estimation through an iterative process doherty 2016a for the optimization iterations pest applies a robust algorithm called the gauss marquardt levenberg gml method which is defined as doherty 2015 13 u j t q j λ i 1 j t q r where u is the parameter upgrade vector and r is the vector of residuals for the current parameter set the jacobian j is the sensitivity matrix as it indicates the partial derivative of the model simulations with respect to the model parameters i is the n n identity matrix λ is the marquardt lambda named after marquardt 1963 who employed this strategy although the use of this parameter was originally pioneered by levenberg 1944 even after calibration the model parameters remain uncertain due to i incomplete information regarding the input data e g the temporal and spatial variability of parameters initial and boundary conditions ii simplification of the reality by models and iii the measurements for model calibration and validation muleta and nicklow 2004 bahremand and smedt 2006 2008 makowski 2013 therefore we analyse the parameter uncertainty using the generalized linear predictive uncertainty error analyser genlinpred utility within pest prior to parameter optimization we performed a sensitivity analysis using the sensan utility of pest to identify the key model parameters these utilities are described in the following subsections 3 2 1 parameter sensitivity calculation sensitivity analysis is applied to investigate which parameters are sensitive with respect to the model s outputs and which are insensitive and can be neglected in the parameter estimation procedure for this purpose we applied the sensan utility of pest to assess the relative sensitivity of the geotop outputs with respect to the changing parameters sensan adopts a local sensitivity analysis method which takes a one at a time approach doherty 2016a in this approach the impact of changing values of each model parameter on the model outputs is evaluated individually that is model output responses are determined by sequentially varying each of the model parameters and by fixing all other parameters to their nominal values helton 1993 lin 2011 these nominal values represent a specific point parameter space results of such a local method are dependent on the choice of this point and the model behaviour is identified only locally in the parameter space hill 1998 the results of such analysis then need to be interpreted with care to measure the magnitude of the sensitivity the normalized sensitivity coefficient nsc index was applied lin 2011 14 n s c o o b p p b p b o b where o b and p b are model outcome and parameter base values and o and p are the model outcome and parameter values pertaining to a particular model run nsc is a dimensionless positive number whose value indicates the relative importance of parameter on the model output 3 2 2 parameter uncertainty estimation the generalized linear predictive uncertainty error analyser genlinpred utility of pest was used to compute the parameter uncertainty the calculations of genlinpred are made on the basis of sensitivities i e the jacobian matrix and the pest control file are required and no parameter adjustment takes place doherty 2016b this utility does not require the model to be calibrated before uncertainty analysis however in this study it was performed on the calibrated geotop model genlinpred is a driver utility which runs a set of pest programs here we use the predunc predictive uncertainty approach to compute i the uncertainty variance reduction of the parameters and ii the contributions to uncertainty variance of the nominated parameter made by different parameter groups the following equation is employed doherty 2015 15 σ 2 s y t c k y y t c k z t z c k z t c ε 1 z c k y t where σ 2 s is the uncertainty variance of a parameter s y is the sensitivity of this parameter to model predictions c k is the prior parameter covariance matrix k represents parameters employed by the model z is a matrix represents the linearized action of the model under calibration conditions which is represented by the jacobian matrix c ε is the covariance matrix of measurement noise error for further information regarding this program and its computational statistics it is referred to doherty 2015 it is noted that in this research we combined the geotop model with pest for the automatic parameter estimation and inverse modelling the geotop model and thepest software as well as a brief description on the required steps and procedures for our developed geotop pest interface together with thedataset applied are available through the links provided in appendix a 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is capable of identifying the dominant parameters and hence enhance the model optimization efficiency the geotop parameters used for the discharge and turbulent fluxes were selected based on the literature kunstmann et al 2006 hingerl et al 2016 these are shown in table 2 the initial simulation to determine the sensitivity of these parameters to the model s outputs was performed using the parameter values obtained via trial and error procedure by soltani et al 2018 then the key parameters acting on variability of the discharge and turbulent fluxes were identified and quantified using the approach described in section 3 2 1 of this document fig 2 illustrates the result of the parameter sensitivity analysis the nsc values of these parameters for the discharge and turbulent fluxes varies within the range of 0 0 0 7 overall α cf and ε which together control evapotranspiration from soil and runoff generation on the land surface have the highest sensitivities it is not surprising to see that the soil parameters of kv and kh affect merely discharge with no influence on the turbulent fluxes the hydraulic conductivity in general controls how the precipitated water can percolate vertically into the ground depending on this property during intense precipitation water might be unable to infiltrate into the soil leading to surface discharge however ε only indicates a strong sensitivity on the turbulent fluxes in particular on h flux 0 7 nsc this could be due to the fact that the model overestimates the outgoing longwave radiation indicating a warmer surface ch shows some degree of relative sensitivity on the considered variables in particular on h since in this approach the sensitivities are calculated by changing the parameters one by one they are not influenced by parameter correlations bahremand and smedt 2006 the sensan based parameter sensitivity identification resulted in the reduction of 8 categories of the adjustable geotop parameters which were used for the automatic calibration 4 2 inverse modelling using the developed geotop pest interface 4 2 1 parameter estimation pest calculates the objective function φ arising out of the initial parameter values the progress of φ and marquardt lambda λ achieved during the optimization iterations is shown in fig 3 pest performed a total of ten optimization iterations with 538 model forward integrations as described in doherty 2016a pest attempts parameter improvement using a number of λ e g 10 0 is recommended for nonlinear models during individual iterations in our case the first iteration process was started with an initial λ value of 10 0 and then was terminated at the end of the tenth iteration with the lowest λ of 2 00e 04 however the behaviour of φ is different throughout the optimization process as shown in fig 3 φ was initiated with the highest value of 3 10 in the first iteration with 30 model forward integrations and the lowest φ value of 2 92 was achieved in the seventh iteration with 368 model forward integrations thereafter φ was rising until the end of the tenth iteration where pest stopped the optimization with 538 model forward integrations as it was not worth undertaking more optimization iterations due to an increase of the residuals finally pest used the best parameter values with the lowest φ which achieved in the seventh iteration to run the model one final time to obtain the best model outputs the geotop model indicates a nonlinear behaviour thus the parameter upgrade vector is overshooting the objective function minimum consequently the new value of φ becomes worse than that of achieved in the previous iterations this is because as described in doherty 2016a the equations employed for calculation of the upgrade vector are all based on a local quasi linearity assumption that may not extend as far into parameter space from current parameter estimates as the magnitude of the upgrade vector itself 4 2 2 optimized parameter values and confidence intervals the optimization results are given in table 3 it is observed that the calibrated land cover parameters in general do not indicate large differences compared to their initial values the maximum change is observed for the value of ch with the highest standard deviation sd 0 4336 in comparison with other land cover parameters however the calibrated values of the soil types show comparatively large changes the highest change is observed for the top layer of kv and kh whereas the lowest one is seen in α accordingly the highest and lowest sd is observed for the aforesaid parameters respectively on average the cambisol soil type indicates the highest change between the initial and estimated values of all soil parameters pest also calculates the 95 confidence limits of the calibrated parameters see table 3 it is noted that the confidence limits provide only an indication of the parameter uncertainty as described in doherty 2016a these limits rely on a linearity assumption and the upper lower parameter bounds are not accounted for the calculation of 95 confidence intervals which may cause these limits to lie outside the parameter s allowed domain for instance the upper confidence limits for kv and kh in the histosol and cambisol soil types at 0 1 m depth exceed their allowed upper bounds i e 1 0 conversely the lower confidence limits for α in the lessive and cambisol soil types in order at 0 1 and 0 2 m depths are below their allowed lower bounds i e 0 0003 and 0 0001 4 2 3 analysis of residuals residual analysis is an essential component of each calibration practice thus the statistics pertaining to the residuals of discharge h and le observation groups are briefly discussed ideally after the parameter estimation process is complete weighted residuals should have a mean of zero doherty 2015 as shown in table 4 the mean value of non zero weighted residuals is close to zero for all observations i e discharge 0 00470 h 0 0064 and le 0 0069 also a low variance of weighted residual is observed which is almost identical between the observation groups further no outlier is found as the maximum weighted residuals are not unusually high in the observations the residuals are statistically insignificant for all observation groups which indicates a good performance of φ in the calibration process 4 2 4 results of calibration and validation episodes the comparison of measured versus modelled discharge and turbulent fluxes of h and le is illustrated in fig 4 the respective statistical metrics are given in table 5 for discharge fig 4a reasonable improvement was achieved in the simulation by the developed geotop pest interface e g low error rmse 1 16 and high efficiency nse 0 87 and coe 0 54 compared to the manual based calibration efforts performed by the geotop model for the same watershed soltani et al 2018 hingerl et al 2016 or worldwide e g rigon et al 2006 bertoldi et al 2006 the model captures the peak flow reasonably well in the catchment and also an increased runoff volume in early june highlights the importance of snow dynamics for runoff generation in the basin however the base flow is rather underestimated this could be due to the fact that geotop does not describe the hydrogeological processes e g contribution of the groundwater to the surface stream flows additionally the post calibration parameters verified that the model distributed streamflow values are satisfactory and reliable this was confirmed by the strong linear relationship r2 0 78 very low residual rmse 0 98 and high nash sutcliff efficiency nse 0 78 values for the simulated discharge during the validation episode fig 5 b the study conducted by hingerl et al 2016 attempted to calibrate the hydrological model geotop v 1 45 for discharge only in the rott catchment moreover using the last version of geotop v 2 0 in the same catchment soltani et al 2018 modelled the spatiotemporal variability of the coupled water and energy fluxes via a trial and error procedure however in this study using the developed geotop pest interface we jointly optimized the parameters for the discharge coupled to the heat fluxes our automatic optimization effort achieved reasonably better results when compared to hingerl et al 2016 and soltani et al 2018 for the simulated turbulent fluxes during the calibration episode fig 4c this can be seen not only by the strong linear relationship between the measured and simulated fluxes h r2 value of 0 65 and le r2 value of 0 76 but also with low error h rmse value of 20 54 and le rmse value of 63 30 as well as high efficiency h nse coe values of 0 37 0 48 and le nse coe values of 0 74 0 50 however geotop slightly overestimates le flux mb 15 16 in particular during the first part of the day with a peak at around 10 00 or 11 00 am the midday overestimation of the simulated le flux could be due to the fact that the ec based technique usually underestimates turbulent fluxes in particular le measurement as reported worldwide e g hendricks franssen et al 2010 stoy et al 2013 imukova et al 2016 also in the tereno prealpine observatory eder et al 2014 soltani et al 2017 as a result there is a lack of energy balance closure ebc in the ec based measurements where the imbalance residual energy at fendt is 31 soltani et al 2018 according to table 5 the simulation results for the turbulent fluxes show in general a better performance fig 5d over the validation episode compared to the results obtained in the calibration episode 4 3 uncertainty analysis pertaining to the model parameters 4 3 1 pre and post calibration uncertainty the model parameter s pre and post calibration uncertainty variance is given in table 6 it can be seen that the range of uncertainty reduction varies between different groups of parameters among the landuse parameters for example the uncertainty variance for the parameter ch was significantly decreased from 25 0 to 2 73e 05 similarly cc indicates a high decrease in the uncertainty ranging from 0 0249 to 5 83e 13 in general all the considered landuse parameters show a significant reduction of uncertainty variance pertaining to the model parameters with regards to the soil parameters of kh and kv we found that a noticeable decrease in the magnitude of uncertainty is also observed for all soil types of lessive histosol and cambisol especially at top layer of 0 1 m depth however the highest reduction in the uncertainty range is seen for kh les 1 and kh cam 1 with the values ranging from 0 225 to 2 50e 07 and from 0 225 to 5 98e 07 respectively the soil parameter of α shows insignificant change in the uncertainty variance for the pre and post calibration parameters however α his 1 0 000162 2 74e 16 and α his 2 0 000150 2 17e 16 show a considerable decrease in the magnitude of uncertainty overall this analysis indicates that the uncertainty ranges were highly decreased for the calibrated parameters this denotes a robust parameter estimation by pest 4 3 2 parameters contributions to reduction of uncertainty after calculation of the considered model parameters uncertainty see table 6 now the contribution to decrease in uncertainty made by different parameter groups is investigated overall we found that the contribution of the parameter groups is quite different for each nominated parameter as shown in fig 5 for example the parameter group of cf made the highest contribution to reduce the uncertainty of ch the soil parameter group of α plays a significant role in uncertainty reduction not only for the soil parameters of kv and kh but also for the landuse parameters of cf and ε also kh is the only parameter group that highly contributed to the uncertainty reduction of the surface water flow parameter of ϒ furthermore kv α kh and cc were found the parameter groups that largely contributed to the uncertainty reduction of the soil parameters not shown to see the post calibration uncertainty values of all parameters it is referred to table 6 4 3 3 additional observations effect on the parameter confidence ellipses to quantify the influence of additional values of the observation groups i e h and le fluxes on the confidence ellipses uncertainty range of the estimated parameters those observations were consecutively added to the base observation dataset i e discharge in the calibration process then the confidence bounds of the estimated parameters were obtained by covariance analysis the square roots of the diagonals of the parameter covariance matrix result in sd of the estimated parameters and therefore the uncertainty of the estimated parameter values is robustly quantified kunstmann et al 1997 2006 for detailed information on the analysis of confidence ellipses it is referred to carrera and neumann 1986 and friendly et al 2013 here we derived the probabilities of 68 3 equivalent to 1 sd 95 4 2 sd and 99 7 3 sd to show the corresponding confidence ellipses of the considered parameters it is noted that in total 23 parameters are considered in the present research to show all these parameters with respect to their uncertainty ranges confidence ellipses influenced by additional values of observations a range of hundreds of graphs would be needed being plotted considering a matrix of 23 23 parameters this is not practical and it is beyond the scope of this research to show all combinations of confidence ellipses therefore for the reason described above the parameters were randomly selected while we still tried to include a variety of the model parameters i e landuse soil as well as a combination of landuse and soil surface water flow parameters for this analysis to get the results more robust we found that in general the uncertainty ranges and correlations of the post calibration parameters were significantly decreased and improved by adding the h and le fluxes to the base observation i e discharge however the magnitude of changes in reduction of uncertainty varies not only for the different parameter groups of landuse soil and surface water flow but also between the h and le fluxes fig 6 shows confidence regions for the estimated landuse parameters ε and cc top panels as well as ε and cf bottom panels the uncertainty for ε is comparatively large while uncertainty of cc is smaller having the turbulent fluxes added to the calibration dataset the confidence ellipses at multiple significance levels were significantly improved and decreased this however has no effect on their intercorrelations it implies that these parameters were independently calibrated during the optimization process top panels in fig 6 a considerable correlation between the model parameters ε and cf is revealed but this correlation was eliminated when le flux was added to the calibration dataset bottom panels in fig 6 fig 7 shows confidence regions for the estimated soil parameters kv his 2 and kh his 2 top panels as well as α his 1 and kh his 1 bottom panels the parameters of hydraulic conductivities kh and kv show a larger uncertainty than the van genuchten parameter α in this case a slight correlation between the soil parameters kv his 2 and kh his 2 is revealed it was then eliminated by add of additional heat observations top panels in fig 7 however α his 1 and kh his 1 indicate a different behaviour when the surface heat fluxes are added it means that the uncertainty was highly reduced but a slight correlation is then revealed between these parameters bottom panels in fig 7 overall the soil parameters show less reduction in the uncertainty range than those of the landuse parameters fig 8 shows confidence regions for the combinations of the estimated parameters α les 1 and cf top panels as well as ϒ and cf bottom panels the uncertainty for cf is comparatively larger than the uncertainty of α les 1 and ϒ the uncertainty ranges for these parameters however were significantly reduced by additional values of turbulent fluxes to the calibration dataset this also resulted in an elimination of the correlation between the parameters α les 1 and cf top panels in fig 8 whereas additional values do not show any effects on the correlation between ϒ and cf bottom panels in fig 8 it implies that they were independently calibrated furthermore we found that additional values of h flux to the base observation of discharge in the calibration dataset as shown in fig 6b fig 7b and fig 8b was resulted in not only a significant decrease of uncertainty range in the considered model parameters but also eliminating the intercorrelation between the parameters e g between cf and α les 1 however the addition of le to discharge and h as shown in fig 6c fig 7c and fig 8c insignificantly improved the confidence bounds or in some cases makes it even slightly worse e g between ε and cf as well as α his 1 and kh his 1 in general this indicates a similar effect of the turbulent fluxes on the parameter confidence improvement in summary since almost no or only little correlation is seen between the estimated parameters by pest fig 6c fig 7c and fig 8c lowering in the uncertainty range of these parameters is considered to be reliable also it indicates that these parameters contributed equally and none of the parameters were dominated by others in the calibration process the results of uncertainty analysis on the model parameter confidence ellipses achieved in this study could be used as an input quantity e g via the identified standard deviation for stochastic hydrological modelling e g by means of monte carlo based simulations in this way the uncertainty propagation of input parameter uncertainty into the corresponding variables of water and energy balances can be further quantified kunstmann et al 2006 therefore the analysis of observation addition is useful for assessing the relative worth of individual variables in reducing the uncertainty of model parameters 4 4 correlation and contribution of model parameters pca based analysis to identify the intercorrelation of the model parameters as well as to quantify the extent to which these parameters are sensitive to the calibration process a pca analysis on the post calibration parameter covariance matrix was performed as shown in fig 9 the intercorrelation between the model parameters is not strong this indicates that the calibrated parameters are not or insignificantly correlated in case of high parameter correlation the minimum of the objective function will be difficult to obtain and the ability of pest will be limited doherty 2015 however most parameters show low intercorrelations this also was confirmed by the analysis of the post calibration parameter correlation coefficient matrix not shown more importantly it can be seen that majority of the parameters with the longest arrows contain the highest contributions to the eigenvectors i e both pc1 and pc2 therefore these are the parameters whose values were quite sensitive in the calibration process in other words these parameters are highly estimable as they lie in the calibration solution space this indicates a successful sensitivity analysis to identify the key model parameters see fig 3 however a few of the parameters show low contributions to the calibration process with the lowest arrows such as kv cam 1 and a cam 1 these are mostly insensitive and less estimable parameters as they lie in the calibration null space this could be explained by either a rather high negative correlation coefficient between these parameters see fig 9 or the fact that the cambisol soil type covers only a limited part of the rott catchment see fig 1c we note that the results obtained from the pca analysis for the parameter contribution importance in the calibration process is in good agreement with the outcomes of parameter identifiability analysis not shown additionally the posedness condition of the inverse problem was examined by i correlation analysis ii eigenvalues and iii condition number the correlation analysis informs us whether immoderate correlation with other parameters results in high error variance of a particular parameter if so the inverse problem is ill posed i e φ contours do not close when the number of parameters are high the likelihood of an ill posed inverse problem is also increased doherty 2015 however the pca based correlation analysis shows low correlations between the parameters indicating a well posed inverse problem also if the ratio of highest to lowest eigenvalue of the post calibration covariance matrix exceeds 10e 7 there is a strong possibility that pest has had serious difficulties in calculating the parameter upgrade vector see eq 13 because of matrix ill conditioning born of parameter insensitivity or high correlation doherty 2016a however we obtained a ratio of 4 49e 12 which is far less than the recommended value finally the condition number of the covariance matrix must be inverted to estimate the parameter values in fact this is recorded for every marquardt lambda tested during every pest iteration the square root of the ratio mentioned above is related to the condition number of the covariance matrix matrices that have a high condition number are difficult to invert as numerical errors are amplified in their inversion doherty 2015 however the well posedness of the inverse problem was also confirmed by the achieved low condition number i e 15 8 out of 7297 8 5 summary and conclusions we coupled the fully distributed hydrological model geotop to the parameter estimation tool pest which applies the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm for the nonlinear estimation of model parameters using the developed geotop pest interface the hydrometeorological variables of the surface streamflow and the turbulent fluxes of h and le were calibrated for the rott catchment in southern germany in addition the intercorrelation and contributions together with the sensitivity and uncertainty pertaining to the model parameters were quantified prior to parameter estimation the most sensitive parameters to variability of the model simulations were identified this resulted in considerable reduction of the estimable parameters in the calibration process for the studied watershed the parameter estimation was conducted by a 10 step iteration approach however the objective function φ minimum was already achieved in the 7th iteration analysis of the residuals showed that the mean value of non zero weighted residuals was almost zero for the model simulations which indicates a reasonable performance of φ in solving the inverse problem the quality of the modelled streamflow and the turbulent fluxes of the calibrated model was satisfying both in the calibration episode and the validation episode this was confirmed by the linear statistical metrics applied for the model performance evaluation the pca based analysis of the model parameters showed a low and insignificant cross correlation between the geotop parameters as a result most of the estimated parameters were highly sensitive to the calibration process as lay in the solution space of the inverse problem this indicates the successful application of sensitivity analysis for the key parameters identification because of the robust parameter estimation technique applied by pest the uncertainty variance of most calibrated parameters was significantly reduced in addition it was found that the soil parameter groups of α and kv highly contributed to this uncertainty reduction more importantly the benefit of adding the turbulent fluxes to the calibration dataset in order to improve the parameter confidence ellipses was determined using covariance analysis we particularity found that the additional values of the turbulent fluxes resulted in both lowering the uncertainty ranges significantly and eliminating the correlation of most model parameters however the magnitude of reduction in uncertainty ranges and also the effect on their intercorrelations varied not only for the different considered parameters but also between the heat fluxes of h and le therefore the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm realized in pest proved to be highly suitable not only for a robust nonlinear parameter estimation but also for the uncertainty estimates of the cpu time intensive physically based model applied conflict of interest there is

6685,the interactions of hydrological variables in the terrestrial hydrological cycle are complex to better predict the variables distributed and physically based models are used as they account for the complexity of interactions in this study we addressed the joint simulation of water and energy fluxes and the potential benefit of flux measurements in the parameter estimation process for this purpose we applied the hydrological model geotop to a prealpine catchment in southern germany river rott 55 km2 over two recent summer episodes as a test case due to its complexity the model is computationally demanding and only a limited number of forward runs can be afforded in inverse modelling and parameter estimation we applied the gradient based nonlinear gauss marquardt levenberg gml parameter estimation method and linked the geotop model to the parameter estimation tool pest using this developed geotop pest interface we particularly investigated the value added by including turbulent flux data in the parameter estimation process and analyse the impact of the additional flux data on the uncertainty bounds of the parameters to better understand the interplay of the model parameters and to identify the dominating parameters in the calibration process we also conducted a principal component analysis pca we were able to identify a set of model parameters that reproduced both observed streamflow and turbulent heat fluxes reasonably well the majority of the estimated parameters were highly sensitive to the considered variables we showed that the confidence bounds of estimated parameters are narrowed significantly when considering not only streamflow observations but also turbulent flux measurements in the calibration process in this manner correlations between estimated parameters could also be reduced keywords gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm geotop principle component analysis rott catchment 1 introduction the estimation of parameters is crucial for the successful application of distributed hydrological models as heterogeneity needs to be accounted for and large uncertainties exist in the parameter space which usually cannot be measured directly at field scale even in high resolution physically based hydrological models some parameters may remain that must be calibrated to obtain a satisfactory output liu et al 2005 fully distributed and physically based hydrological models are usually much more cpu time demanding than pure lumped models this is particularly true for the hydrological model geotop used in this study as it solves for example the nonlinear equations of three dimensional subsurface water flow and accounts for the full energy balance typically the trial and error method is applied for model calibration which is simple and accordingly has been widely used for hydrological models e g refsgaard 1997 senarath et al 2000 kunstmann et al 2006 hingerl et al 2016 soltani et al 2018 as this approach is time consuming automatic optimization algorithms are applied allowing to facilitate this effort eckhardt and arnold 2001 kunstmann et al 2006 lin 2011 automatic calibration can be fast on modern computer architectures and since it allows an efficient and extensive search within possible parameter ranges the results are expected to be more robust than those obtained by the manually based calibration approach bahremand and smedt 2008 different algorithms have been investigated in hydrological modelling for the automatic optimization process e g the simulated annealing method aarts and korst 1989 and the multiobjective complex evolution algorithm yapo et al 1998 these techniques however require a large number of model calls in order of several thousands which limits their application to fast conceptual or one dimensional models the gauss marquardt levenberg gml algorithm estimates the parameters using fewer model runs than any other optimization technique for nonlinear models e g monte carlo based algorithms doherty 2002 doherty and johnston 2003 bahremand and smedt 2006 however gml is based on a local search algorithm whose results may be affected by the initial value of the parameters e g kunstmann et al 2006 lin 2011 in this study the hydrologic model geotop 2 0 is coupled to the parameter estimation tool pest for an inverse hydrological modelling over two summer episodes of calibration 2013 and validation 2015 for the rott catchment located in the terrestrial environmental observatories tereno prealpine region in southern germany in the tereno prealpine observatory eco hydrometeorological variables such as evapotranspiration et and surface heat fluxes exhibit rapid changes within short distances soltani et al 2018 this is mainly because of the heterogeneity in topography landuse and soil type as well as interactions between the earth surface and the atmospheric boundary layer kunstmann et al 2004 2006 hingerl et al 2016 soltani et al 2017 thus the energy and water budgets in such environments are mainly controlled by the soil type properties pielke et al 1998 landcover characteristics dirmeyer et al 2010 and vegetation structure pielke et al 2011 previous studies in the tereno observatory and the surrounding areas e g bavarian alpine foothills and low mountain range have mainly focused on how climate change impacts runoff generation kunstmann et al 2004 runoff production processes and discharge related analysis wetzel et al 2003 2004a 2005a surface and sub surface water balances kunstmann et al 2006 wolf et al 2017 biosphere

2013 eder et al 2014 soltani et al 2017 in addition to the studies listed above a limited number of studies have been carried out with regard to the calibration of hydrological models in this region i e kunstmann et al 2006 hingerl et al 2016 in which the models were only calibrated against streamflow data recently the coupled water and energy fluxes at high spatial resolution have been modelled using the geotop model over two different sized heterogeneous catchments i e rott and upper ammer in the tereno prealpine observatory by soltani et al 2018 the focus here was on the quantification of the spatiotemporal variability of the hydrometeorological variables and on the description of their underlying dependencies using empirical copula functions their results showed that the spatial variability of heat and water fluxes is significantly affected by diversity in topography radiation and wind components soil moisture properties as well as land cover and vegetation types across the region furthermore the empirical copula based function revealed that the dependence structures between the modelled and observed hydrometeorological variables are similar either at upper or lower density maxima this suggested a reasonable performance of the model as the interaction of variables was properly described however the model showed poorer performance in the middle ranks of the data while the main focus in soltani et al 2018 was the analysis of the model s variables this study here focuses on the model s parameters for this region therefore the following main objectives are considered in the present study 1 development of a new hydrological model optimization and uncertainty framework based on a geotop pest interface which allows an observational dataset to be involved in the calibration process via inverse modeling 2 quantification of the uncertainties pertaining to the estimated model parameters for which we particularly examine the benefit of additional heat flux observations on the parameter confidence bounds and 3 characterization of the intercorrelations between the model estimable parameters and their contributions to the calibration process this article is organized and structured as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study catchment and meteorological dataset methods including the hydrological modelling model setup and input data the parameter estimation tool and its utilities are described in section 3 results and discussion are given in section 4 followed by a summary and conclusion of our results in section 5 2 catchment characterization and available datasets 2 1 geography and climate the rott catchment 55 km2 is situated in the northern part of the terrestrial environmental observatories tereno prealpine region in southern germany fig 1 a and 1b it drains into lake ammer with 46 6 km2 is the sixth largest lake in germany the fendt eddy covariance ec site 47 831 n 11 061 e is within the southern part of the catchment at 598 mheight fig 1b and it is recognized as the tereno prealpine super ec site soltani et al 2017 the elevation of the catchment ranges from 902 m to 543 m a s l the outlet is at the discharge gauge raisting where it measures the water outflow from the catchment and no groundwater flow is considered the region is characterized by a cool temperate and humid climate the mean annual precipitation temperature is 1130 mm 6 9 c in the rott catchment kunstmann et al 2006 hingerl et al 2016 the highest amount of precipitation is received during summertime geologically most part of the catchment is situated in the quaternary moraines as well as in molasse and alluvium zones of the bavarian alpine foreland since most of the molasse area was overprinted by glacial erosion and deposition processes during the quaternary moraines and alluvial structures predominantly influence soil parent material conditions kiese et al 2018 thus the soil type distribution is closely intertwined with the geological properties where the dominant soil types in the catchment are fig 1c lessive 76 cambisol 13 and histosol 9 also the primary land cover is fig 1d pasture 44 coniferous 37 and mixed forests 18 followed by villages 2 as well as some peat 0 8 and marsh lands 0 5 as described in hingerl et al 2016 2 2 observational datasets hydrometeorological measurements were obtained from three sources for the calibration and validation periods in 01 may to 31 july 2013 and 2015 respectively as follows 1 ec based turbulent fluxes and the micrometeorological measurements are gathered from the fendt ec site de fen briefly described below 2 hourly meteorological forcing data for the wielenbach and hohenpeissenberg stations are received from the deutscher wetterdienst dwd https werdis dwd de 3 hourly data of precipitation for the diessen rain gauge and streamflow for the raisting discharge gauge are compiled from bayerisches landesamt für umwelt http www hnd bayern de we applied the model for the periods mentioned above because the computational costs of the inverse modelling with our developed geotop pest interface restricted the length of the simulation period moreover in the wintertime hydrometeorological fluxes are characterized by large uncertainties e g hingerl et al 2016 and the peak streamflow and the ec based measurements are of higher quality during summer periods in the tereno observatory soltani et al 2017 2018 2 2 1 eddy covariance measurements the basic principle of the ec measurements is that the vertical flux is calculated as a covariance between the concentration of a scalar e g air temperature and water vapour and the vertical wind velocity measured at the same point in space and time mauder and foken 2015 the fendt ec instruments were installed on a station 3 5 m above the surface see fig 1b the turbulent fluxes were measured with a 3 d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut oriented towards the prevailing wind direction along with an open path gas analyser all signals for the sensors were logged to a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific inc logan ut at a rate of 20 hz and were averaged for a half hourly period all the required procedures for the corrections and quality control qc of the turbulent fluxes were applied mauder et al 2013 foken et al 2004 as described in soltani et al 2017 the calculation of turbulent fluxes was done using the tk3 ec software mauder and foken 2015 tk3 is able to perform all of the post processing of turbulence measurements to produce the turbulent fluxes which includes all necessary corrections and tests lee et al 2004 aubinet et al 2012 for more information regarding the calculation of turbulent fluxes and qc using the tk3 software it is referred to mauder et al 2013 and mauder and foken 2015 3 methods 3 1 hydrological modelling the model geotop v 2 0 endrizzi et al 2014 was used for the catchment scale hydrologic simulation it is a fully distributed physically based hydrological model of the water and energy balance at and below the soil surface designed for simulations in continuum in small and mesoscale mountain catchments over complex terrain bertoldi et al 2004 rigon et al 2006 the model solves the heat and water flow equations for temperature and moisture in the soil with a coupled three dimensional numerical scheme bertoldi et al 2014 furthermore the model considers radiation correction for complex topography this includes the following i accounting for the solar incidence angle and the shadowing of direct solar radiation by surrounding mountains ii partitioning of radiation in direct and diffuse components according to erbs et al 1982 and iii the effects of topography on diffuse radiation coming on the surrounding terrain iqbal 1983 as described in bertoldi et al 2014 therefore geotop covers a variety of aspects of hydrological fluxes from the energy balance to snow cover and snowmelt zanotti et al 2004 the cryosphere endrizzi et al 2014 the effects of vegetation endrizzi and marsh 2010 and ecohydrological processes bertoldi et al 2010 della chiesa et al 2014 hingerl et al 2016 this is the reason for the choice of geotop in this study as we are interested in the interacting water and energy fluxes at and beneath the land surface since the core components of the geotop model are described in detail in endrizzi et al 2014 in the following only a brief overview of the model s capabilities i e water flow and energy flux equations that are our focus in this study are presented water flow equations the model solves the water balance in the soil using the system of equations represented below endrizzi et al 2014 1 θ w ph t ρ i ρ w θ i t 0 θ w f l t j w s w 0 where θ w ph is the fraction of liquid water content in soil subject to phase change θ w f l the fraction of liquid water content transferred by water flux ρ i kg m 3 the density of ice ρ w kg m 3 the density of liquid water in the soil θ i the fraction of ice in soil t s time divergence operator j w m s 1 the flux of liquid water and also s w s 1 as the mass sink term the above equation describes the water flow occurring below the soil surface and is referred to as the variably saturated richards equation according to darcy s law j w can be written as 2 j w k ψ z f where k m s 1 is the hydraulic conductivity ψ m the liquid liquid as water can also be ice water gauge pressure head and z f m the elevation head above a reference level if water pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure ψ is positive and thus soil is saturated and contrariwise when soil is unsaturated ψ 0 the water content θ w is calculated by means of the soil water retention curve according to the van genuchten 1980 model however when soil is saturated ψ 0 θ w should always be equal to the saturated value defining h m as the sum of the pressure and potential heads h ψ z f the second part of eq 1 combined with eq 2 becomes 3 θ w f l t k h s w 0 equation 3 is solved in a fully three dimensional way in order to describe the two gradients of h in the direction parallel and normal to the surface when the soil is saturated either because of precipitation or melting snow normal gradients become very small compared to those in the parallel direction which consequently are responsible for the routing of water through the soil endrizzi et al 2014 it is noted that the model also considers the canopy resistance for the calculation of the latent heat flux provided that the vegetation is available della chiesa et al 2014 additionally to fully describe the water balance in the soil and the runoff mechanisms the surface or overland water flow needs to be taken into account this process is described with the approximation proposed by gottardi and venutelli 1993 who extended to the surface flow the validity of darcy s law which would not be valid with the flow being turbulent using the water conservation and darcy s law for the overland flow the surface water balance is expressed as endrizzi et al 2014 4 ψ z 0 t ψ z 0 k s u r ψ z 0 z f z 0 p e 0 where ψ z 0 m and z f z 0 m are the liquid water pressure head and the elevation head at the soil surface k s u r m s 1 the conductance and p e m s 1 the effective precipitation per unit horizontal surface that reaches the soil surface including snowmelt flow and deducting evaporation from the soil the variable ψ z 0 cannot be negative in eq 4 and is written in place of water depth above the surface following gottardi and venutelli 1993 the conductance is 5 k sur c s ψ z 0 γ ψ z 0 s 0 5 where s m is the length along the direction of maximum local slope c s m1 y s 1 the surface roughness coefficient and γ an exponent between 0 and 1varying according to the formulation of c s it is noted that even though geotop solves the saturated and unsaturated surface subsurface and groundwater flows in a coupled way using the richards equations however it mainly describes water flow and aquifers in the soil that is close to the surface and hydrologically active normally a few meters or tens of meters for which it uses darcy s law to describe water flow in a porous medium this implies that solving all deep layers of groundwater and water in the fractured rocks is time consuming for geotop and it requires large amounts of data that typically are either not available or difficult to access for these practical reasons our optimization approach was mainly limited to the surface layers energy flux equations in the geotop model the surface heat flux s exchanged with the atmosphere is assigned by the sum of net shortwave radiation sw net longwave radiation lw and turbulent fluxes of sensible h and latent heat le that is 6 s t s u r s w l w t s u r h t s u r l e t s u r θ w the surface heat flux is dependent on the temperature of the surface t s u r which is unknown in the equation also the le flux depends on the soil moisture at the surface θ w which is a further coupling term to the water flow equations as described before the net shortwave radiation is a balance given by the incoming radiation sw in from the atmosphere and the reflected radiation sw out which is given by sw in multiplied by the broadband albedo sw in on a flat ground surface is the result of the top of atmosphere sw toa shortwave radiation and transmissivities of atmosphere τ a and cloud τ c as follows 7 sw in sw toa τ a τ c if the surface is snow free albedo varies linearly with the liquid water contents of the top soil layer however if it is snow covered the formulation of dickinson et al 1993 is used also the net longwave radiation is a balance of the component lw in coming from the atmosphere and lw out emitted by the surface lw in is the integrated result of the radiation emitted at different levels in the atmosphere with different temperatures and gas concentrations clear sky radiation is calculated with one of the several empirical formulations present in the literature see endrizzi et al 2014 which in general apply the stefan boltzmann law σ using the air temperature measured at the surface t a in k with an effective atmosphere emissivity a dependent on air temperature t a and water vapour pressure e a bar that is 8 l w in c l e a r a t a e a σ t a 4 however in cloudy skies the emissivity of the atmosphere is increased to a value c which may be significantly higher than a l w out emitted by the surface is also calculated with σ as follows 9 l w out s σ t sur 4 where t sur is the temperature of the surface k and s is the emissivity of the surface for further details it is referred to endrizzi et al 2014 the turbulent fluxes of sensible heat h and latent heat le along with the radiative fluxes described above play a significant role in the surface energy balance closure ebc the h le flux which is associated with convection driven by difference in temperature vapour pressure between land surface and the atmosphere however they are both largely driven by wind speed thus it is important to consider in the model a topographically dependent wind field to describe the effect of topography on the surface ebc according to endrizzi et al 2014 a full resolution of the fluid dynamic equations is too computationally heavy for geotop the wind field is therefore parameterised using topography liston and elder 2006 the model calculates the turbulent fluxes h and le with the flux gradient relationship e g garratt 1992 10 h ρ a c p w s t a t s u r r a 11 l e β y p l e ρ a c p w s q

specific humidity kg kg 1 at the surface q a the specific humidity of the air and r a the aerodynamic resistance the α yp and β yp coefficients take into account the soil resistance to evaporation and only depend on the liquid water pressure close to the soil surface they are calculated according to the parameterisation of ye and pielke 1993 which considers evaporation as the sum of the proper evaporation from the surface and diffusion of water vapour in soil pores at greater depths the aerodynamical resistance is obtained applying the monin obukhov similarity theory monin and obukhov 1954 which requires that values of wind speed air temperature and specific humidity are available at least at two different heights above the surface the meteorological forcing of precipitation air temperature and humidity wind speed and incoming solar radiation are distributed by height dependent interpolation methods liston and elder 2006 over the study catchment and define the surface boundary conditions further detailed on the model description is found in endrizzi et al 2014 and bertoldi et al 2014 as well as in the geotop user s manual by dall amico et al 2011 3 1 1 model setup and input dataset the geotop simulation domain covers a prealpine mountainous catchment in southern germany see fig 1a b which includes three main soil types see fig 1c and six main land covers see fig 1d for this application the following static datasets were used for simulation by the model first the dem 90 90 m2 obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm http srtm csi cgiar org then we calculated the river network terrain aspect and slope using arcmap gis esri 2011 based on techniques described by ghesla and rigon 2006 also the land cover 250 250 m2 and the soil type 2 2 km2 maps taken from hingerl et al 2016 were separately interpolated to the same resolution of the dem according to bertoldi et al 2004 in the model setup the soil is discretized in 13 layers with thicknesses increasing from the surface to the deep layers the top 8 layers starting from the surface have thicknesses ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 m with respect to the vertical gradients of water pressure and temperature endrizzi et al 2014 while the lowest 5 layers have thicknesses ranging from 1 0 to 5 0 m however in our simulation experiment only the first two layers of the soils i e 0 1 and 0 2 m were actively involved in the optimization process and the rest of the layers were kept constant because it was found that these two layers show the highest influence on the model s outputs soltani et al 2018 and also due to decreasing the insignificant parameters in the optimization process to reduce the number of model calls further the initial condition on the water table depth was set as initwatertableheightovertoposurface 5000 mm and initwatertabledepth 1000 mm the initial condition for the soil pressure i e initsoilpressure and initsoilpressurebedrock were kept constant by default for the rott catchment the hourly meteorological data of precipitation temperature wind speed wind direction and radiation components were provided as input forcing for simulation by the model model runs are integrated at one hour intervals further information regarding the interpolation of meteorological data in geotop is described in endrizzi et al 2014 two types of measurements involved in the model calibration that is the catchment integrating variable of discharge and the turbulent fluxes of h and le the simulation was run first for a summer episode starting from 01 may to 31 july 2013 as calibration and then the performance of the calibrated model was validated for the period of 01 may 30 july 2015 as validation a two week spin up period starting from 15 april to 30 april 2013 was conducted as it was found experimentally that this is sufficient for our experimental period soltani et al 2018 3 1 2 model performance evaluation and validation typically a variety of linear statistical metrics are used to evaluate the model performance as no single metric encapsulates all aspects of interest hence in this research we employed six statistical metrics to evaluate the performance of geotop they are described in table 1 the estimation of geotop parameters was performed for an independent period of 01 may to 31 july 2015 for the validation episode 3 1 3 post processing analysis of the model parameters to characterize the model parameter intercorrelation and their contributions in the calibration process a principal component analysis pca is performed on the parameter covariance matrix pca reduces the dimensionalityof a multivariate dataset this is achieved by transforming the initial variables into a new small set of variables without losing the most important information in the original dataset these new variables are calledprincipal components pcs the pcs are ranked in that way that pc1 explains the largest fraction of the variance in a dataset pc2 the second largest etc abdi and williams 2010 for further details of how the pca was performed it is referred to soltani et al 2017 3 2 parameter estimation strategy for parameter estimation we apply the gml method and its technical realization within the parameter estimation tool pest doherty 2002 we used pest also for a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the model parameters pest is model independent in the way that it communicates with the model through the model s input and output files doherty et al 2010 it minimizes a least squares objective function φ which is the sum of squared weighted residuals doherty 2016a 12a φ c x b t q c x b or 12b φ i 1 m w i r i 2 where x and b denote in turn the model s inputs and parameters and c is the observations the t superscript indicates the matrix transpose operation q is a diagonal matrix of the squared observation weights w i r i the i th residual expresses the differences between the model output and the field measurement for the i th observation to improve the performance of φ the residuals are given different weights the weights effectively normalize the components of φ it may be that some of the field data are more important to the model results than other data and therefore receive greater weight thus to ensure that no observation group dominates or is invisible in φ the pwtadj1 utility of pest was used to automate the weights adjustment procedure by doing so the reference variance or standard error of weighted residuals becomes equal to 1 0 meaning that the contribution made to φ by each observation group is equal for more details it is referred to doherty 2016b optimization of simple linear models can be achieved in one step however for nonlinear models like geotop the relationships between the model parameters and observations must be linearized to achieve the parameter estimation through an iterative process doherty 2016a for the optimization iterations pest applies a robust algorithm called the gauss marquardt levenberg gml method which is defined as doherty 2015 13 u j t q j λ i 1 j t q r where u is the parameter upgrade vector and r is the vector of residuals for the current parameter set the jacobian j is the sensitivity matrix as it indicates the partial derivative of the model simulations with respect to the model parameters i is the n n identity matrix λ is the marquardt lambda named after marquardt 1963 who employed this strategy although the use of this parameter was originally pioneered by levenberg 1944 even after calibration the model parameters remain uncertain due to i incomplete information regarding the input data e g the temporal and spatial variability of parameters initial and boundary conditions ii simplification of the reality by models and iii the measurements for model calibration and validation muleta and nicklow 2004 bahremand and smedt 2006 2008 makowski 2013 therefore we analyse the parameter uncertainty using the generalized linear predictive uncertainty error analyser genlinpred utility within pest prior to parameter optimization we performed a sensitivity analysis using the sensan utility of pest to identify the key model parameters these utilities are described in the following subsections 3 2 1 parameter sensitivity calculation sensitivity analysis is applied to investigate which parameters are sensitive with respect to the model s outputs and which are insensitive and can be neglected in the parameter estimation procedure for this purpose we applied the sensan utility of pest to assess the relative sensitivity of the geotop outputs with respect to the changing parameters sensan adopts a local sensitivity analysis method which takes a one at a time approach doherty 2016a in this approach the impact of changing values of each model parameter on the model outputs is evaluated individually that is model output responses are determined by sequentially varying each of the model parameters and by fixing all other parameters to their nominal values helton 1993 lin 2011 these nominal values represent a specific point parameter space results of such a local method are dependent on the choice of this point and the model behaviour is identified only locally in the parameter space hill 1998 the results of such analysis then need to be interpreted with care to measure the magnitude of the sensitivity the normalized sensitivity coefficient nsc index was applied lin 2011 14 n s c o o b p p b p b o b where o b and p b are model outcome and parameter base values and o and p are the model outcome and parameter values pertaining to a particular model run nsc is a dimensionless positive number whose value indicates the relative importance of parameter on the model output 3 2 2 parameter uncertainty estimation the generalized linear predictive uncertainty error analyser genlinpred utility of pest was used to compute the parameter uncertainty the calculations of genlinpred are made on the basis of sensitivities i e the jacobian matrix and the pest control file are required and no parameter adjustment takes place doherty 2016b this utility does not require the model to be calibrated before uncertainty analysis however in this study it was performed on the calibrated geotop model genlinpred is a driver utility which runs a set of pest programs here we use the predunc predictive uncertainty approach to compute i the uncertainty variance reduction of the parameters and ii the contributions to uncertainty variance of the nominated parameter made by different parameter groups the following equation is employed doherty 2015 15 σ 2 s y t c k y y t c k z t z c k z t c ε 1 z c k y t where σ 2 s is the uncertainty variance of a parameter s y is the sensitivity of this parameter to model predictions c k is the prior parameter covariance matrix k represents parameters employed by the model z is a matrix represents the linearized action of the model under calibration conditions which is represented by the jacobian matrix c ε is the covariance matrix of measurement noise error for further information regarding this program and its computational statistics it is referred to doherty 2015 it is noted that in this research we combined the geotop model with pest for the automatic parameter estimation and inverse modelling the geotop model and thepest software as well as a brief description on the required steps and procedures for our developed geotop pest interface together with thedataset applied are available through the links provided in appendix a 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is capable of identifying the dominant parameters and hence enhance the model optimization efficiency the geotop parameters used for the discharge and turbulent fluxes were selected based on the literature kunstmann et al 2006 hingerl et al 2016 these are shown in table 2 the initial simulation to determine the sensitivity of these parameters to the model s outputs was performed using the parameter values obtained via trial and error procedure by soltani et al 2018 then the key parameters acting on variability of the discharge and turbulent fluxes were identified and quantified using the approach described in section 3 2 1 of this document fig 2 illustrates the result of the parameter sensitivity analysis the nsc values of these parameters for the discharge and turbulent fluxes varies within the range of 0 0 0 7 overall α cf and ε which together control evapotranspiration from soil and runoff generation on the land surface have the highest sensitivities it is not surprising to see that the soil parameters of kv and kh affect merely discharge with no influence on the turbulent fluxes the hydraulic conductivity in general controls how the precipitated water can percolate vertically into the ground depending on this property during intense precipitation water might be unable to infiltrate into the soil leading to surface discharge however ε only indicates a strong sensitivity on the turbulent fluxes in particular on h flux 0 7 nsc this could be due to the fact that the model overestimates the outgoing longwave radiation indicating a warmer surface ch shows some degree of relative sensitivity on the considered variables in particular on h since in this approach the sensitivities are calculated by changing the parameters one by one they are not influenced by parameter correlations bahremand and smedt 2006 the sensan based parameter sensitivity identification resulted in the reduction of 8 categories of the adjustable geotop parameters which were used for the automatic calibration 4 2 inverse modelling using the developed geotop pest interface 4 2 1 parameter estimation pest calculates the objective function φ arising out of the initial parameter values the progress of φ and marquardt lambda λ achieved during the optimization iterations is shown in fig 3 pest performed a total of ten optimization iterations with 538 model forward integrations as described in doherty 2016a pest attempts parameter improvement using a number of λ e g 10 0 is recommended for nonlinear models during individual iterations in our case the first iteration process was started with an initial λ value of 10 0 and then was terminated at the end of the tenth iteration with the lowest λ of 2 00e 04 however the behaviour of φ is different throughout the optimization process as shown in fig 3 φ was initiated with the highest value of 3 10 in the first iteration with 30 model forward integrations and the lowest φ value of 2 92 was achieved in the seventh iteration with 368 model forward integrations thereafter φ was rising until the end of the tenth iteration where pest stopped the optimization with 538 model forward integrations as it was not worth undertaking more optimization iterations due to an increase of the residuals finally pest used the best parameter values with the lowest φ which achieved in the seventh iteration to run the model one final time to obtain the best model outputs the geotop model indicates a nonlinear behaviour thus the parameter upgrade vector is overshooting the objective function minimum consequently the new value of φ becomes worse than that of achieved in the previous iterations this is because as described in doherty 2016a the equations employed for calculation of the upgrade vector are all based on a local quasi linearity assumption that may not extend as far into parameter space from current parameter estimates as the magnitude of the upgrade vector itself 4 2 2 optimized parameter values and confidence intervals the optimization results are given in table 3 it is observed that the calibrated land cover parameters in general do not indicate large differences compared to their initial values the maximum change is observed for the value of ch with the highest standard deviation sd 0 4336 in comparison with other land cover parameters however the calibrated values of the soil types show comparatively large changes the highest change is observed for the top layer of kv and kh whereas the lowest one is seen in α accordingly the highest and lowest sd is observed for the aforesaid parameters respectively on average the cambisol soil type indicates the highest change between the initial and estimated values of all soil parameters pest also calculates the 95 confidence limits of the calibrated parameters see table 3 it is noted that the confidence limits provide only an indication of the parameter uncertainty as described in doherty 2016a these limits rely on a linearity assumption and the upper lower parameter bounds are not accounted for the calculation of 95 confidence intervals which may cause these limits to lie outside the parameter s allowed domain for instance the upper confidence limits for kv and kh in the histosol and cambisol soil types at 0 1 m depth exceed their allowed upper bounds i e 1 0 conversely the lower confidence limits for α in the lessive and cambisol soil types in order at 0 1 and 0 2 m depths are below their allowed lower bounds i e 0 0003 and 0 0001 4 2 3 analysis of residuals residual analysis is an essential component of each calibration practice thus the statistics pertaining to the residuals of discharge h and le observation groups are briefly discussed ideally after the parameter estimation process is complete weighted residuals should have a mean of zero doherty 2015 as shown in table 4 the mean value of non zero weighted residuals is close to zero for all observations i e discharge 0 00470 h 0 0064 and le 0 0069 also a low variance of weighted residual is observed which is almost identical between the observation groups further no outlier is found as the maximum weighted residuals are not unusually high in the observations the residuals are statistically insignificant for all observation groups which indicates a good performance of φ in the calibration process 4 2 4 results of calibration and validation episodes the comparison of measured versus modelled discharge and turbulent fluxes of h and le is illustrated in fig 4 the respective statistical metrics are given in table 5 for discharge fig 4a reasonable improvement was achieved in the simulation by the developed geotop pest interface e g low error rmse 1 16 and high efficiency nse 0 87 and coe 0 54 compared to the manual based calibration efforts performed by the geotop model for the same watershed soltani et al 2018 hingerl et al 2016 or worldwide e g rigon et al 2006 bertoldi et al 2006 the model captures the peak flow reasonably well in the catchment and also an increased runoff volume in early june highlights the importance of snow dynamics for runoff generation in the basin however the base flow is rather underestimated this could be due to the fact that geotop does not describe the hydrogeological processes e g contribution of the groundwater to the surface stream flows additionally the post calibration parameters verified that the model distributed streamflow values are satisfactory and reliable this was confirmed by the strong linear relationship r2 0 78 very low residual rmse 0 98 and high nash sutcliff efficiency nse 0 78 values for the simulated discharge during the validation episode fig 5 b the study conducted by hingerl et al 2016 attempted to calibrate the hydrological model geotop v 1 45 for discharge only in the rott catchment moreover using the last version of geotop v 2 0 in the same catchment soltani et al 2018 modelled the spatiotemporal variability of the coupled water and energy fluxes via a trial and error procedure however in this study using the developed geotop pest interface we jointly optimized the parameters for the discharge coupled to the heat fluxes our automatic optimization effort achieved reasonably better results when compared to hingerl et al 2016 and soltani et al 2018 for the simulated turbulent fluxes during the calibration episode fig 4c this can be seen not only by the strong linear relationship between the measured and simulated fluxes h r2 value of 0 65 and le r2 value of 0 76 but also with low error h rmse value of 20 54 and le rmse value of 63 30 as well as high efficiency h nse coe values of 0 37 0 48 and le nse coe values of 0 74 0 50 however geotop slightly overestimates le flux mb 15 16 in particular during the first part of the day with a peak at around 10 00 or 11 00 am the midday overestimation of the simulated le flux could be due to the fact that the ec based technique usually underestimates turbulent fluxes in particular le measurement as reported worldwide e g hendricks franssen et al 2010 stoy et al 2013 imukova et al 2016 also in the tereno prealpine observatory eder et al 2014 soltani et al 2017 as a result there is a lack of energy balance closure ebc in the ec based measurements where the imbalance residual energy at fendt is 31 soltani et al 2018 according to table 5 the simulation results for the turbulent fluxes show in general a better performance fig 5d over the validation episode compared to the results obtained in the calibration episode 4 3 uncertainty analysis pertaining to the model parameters 4 3 1 pre and post calibration uncertainty the model parameter s pre and post calibration uncertainty variance is given in table 6 it can be seen that the range of uncertainty reduction varies between different groups of parameters among the landuse parameters for example the uncertainty variance for the parameter ch was significantly decreased from 25 0 to 2 73e 05 similarly cc indicates a high decrease in the uncertainty ranging from 0 0249 to 5 83e 13 in general all the considered landuse parameters show a significant reduction of uncertainty variance pertaining to the model parameters with regards to the soil parameters of kh and kv we found that a noticeable decrease in the magnitude of uncertainty is also observed for all soil types of lessive histosol and cambisol especially at top layer of 0 1 m depth however the highest reduction in the uncertainty range is seen for kh les 1 and kh cam 1 with the values ranging from 0 225 to 2 50e 07 and from 0 225 to 5 98e 07 respectively the soil parameter of α shows insignificant change in the uncertainty variance for the pre and post calibration parameters however α his 1 0 000162 2 74e 16 and α his 2 0 000150 2 17e 16 show a considerable decrease in the magnitude of uncertainty overall this analysis indicates that the uncertainty ranges were highly decreased for the calibrated parameters this denotes a robust parameter estimation by pest 4 3 2 parameters contributions to reduction of uncertainty after calculation of the considered model parameters uncertainty see table 6 now the contribution to decrease in uncertainty made by different parameter groups is investigated overall we found that the contribution of the parameter groups is quite different for each nominated parameter as shown in fig 5 for example the parameter group of cf made the highest contribution to reduce the uncertainty of ch the soil parameter group of α plays a significant role in uncertainty reduction not only for the soil parameters of kv and kh but also for the landuse parameters of cf and ε also kh is the only parameter group that highly contributed to the uncertainty reduction of the surface water flow parameter of ϒ furthermore kv α kh and cc were found the parameter groups that largely contributed to the uncertainty reduction of the soil parameters not shown to see the post calibration uncertainty values of all parameters it is referred to table 6 4 3 3 additional observations effect on the parameter confidence ellipses to quantify the influence of additional values of the observation groups i e h and le fluxes on the confidence ellipses uncertainty range of the estimated parameters those observations were consecutively added to the base observation dataset i e discharge in the calibration process then the confidence bounds of the estimated parameters were obtained by covariance analysis the square roots of the diagonals of the parameter covariance matrix result in sd of the estimated parameters and therefore the uncertainty of the estimated parameter values is robustly quantified kunstmann et al 1997 2006 for detailed information on the analysis of confidence ellipses it is referred to carrera and neumann 1986 and friendly et al 2013 here we derived the probabilities of 68 3 equivalent to 1 sd 95 4 2 sd and 99 7 3 sd to show the corresponding confidence ellipses of the considered parameters it is noted that in total 23 parameters are considered in the present research to show all these parameters with respect to their uncertainty ranges confidence ellipses influenced by additional values of observations a range of hundreds of graphs would be needed being plotted considering a matrix of 23 23 parameters this is not practical and it is beyond the scope of this research to show all combinations of confidence ellipses therefore for the reason described above the parameters were randomly selected while we still tried to include a variety of the model parameters i e landuse soil as well as a combination of landuse and soil surface water flow parameters for this analysis to get the results more robust we found that in general the uncertainty ranges and correlations of the post calibration parameters were significantly decreased and improved by adding the h and le fluxes to the base observation i e discharge however the magnitude of changes in reduction of uncertainty varies not only for the different parameter groups of landuse soil and surface water flow but also between the h and le fluxes fig 6 shows confidence regions for the estimated landuse parameters ε and cc top panels as well as ε and cf bottom panels the uncertainty for ε is comparatively large while uncertainty of cc is smaller having the turbulent fluxes added to the calibration dataset the confidence ellipses at multiple significance levels were significantly improved and decreased this however has no effect on their intercorrelations it implies that these parameters were independently calibrated during the optimization process top panels in fig 6 a considerable correlation between the model parameters ε and cf is revealed but this correlation was eliminated when le flux was added to the calibration dataset bottom panels in fig 6 fig 7 shows confidence regions for the estimated soil parameters kv his 2 and kh his 2 top panels as well as α his 1 and kh his 1 bottom panels the parameters of hydraulic conductivities kh and kv show a larger uncertainty than the van genuchten parameter α in this case a slight correlation between the soil parameters kv his 2 and kh his 2 is revealed it was then eliminated by add of additional heat observations top panels in fig 7 however α his 1 and kh his 1 indicate a different behaviour when the surface heat fluxes are added it means that the uncertainty was highly reduced but a slight correlation is then revealed between these parameters bottom panels in fig 7 overall the soil parameters show less reduction in the uncertainty range than those of the landuse parameters fig 8 shows confidence regions for the combinations of the estimated parameters α les 1 and cf top panels as well as ϒ and cf bottom panels the uncertainty for cf is comparatively larger than the uncertainty of α les 1 and ϒ the uncertainty ranges for these parameters however were significantly reduced by additional values of turbulent fluxes to the calibration dataset this also resulted in an elimination of the correlation between the parameters α les 1 and cf top panels in fig 8 whereas additional values do not show any effects on the correlation between ϒ and cf bottom panels in fig 8 it implies that they were independently calibrated furthermore we found that additional values of h flux to the base observation of discharge in the calibration dataset as shown in fig 6b fig 7b and fig 8b was resulted in not only a significant decrease of uncertainty range in the considered model parameters but also eliminating the intercorrelation between the parameters e g between cf and α les 1 however the addition of le to discharge and h as shown in fig 6c fig 7c and fig 8c insignificantly improved the confidence bounds or in some cases makes it even slightly worse e g between ε and cf as well as α his 1 and kh his 1 in general this indicates a similar effect of the turbulent fluxes on the parameter confidence improvement in summary since almost no or only little correlation is seen between the estimated parameters by pest fig 6c fig 7c and fig 8c lowering in the uncertainty range of these parameters is considered to be reliable also it indicates that these parameters contributed equally and none of the parameters were dominated by others in the calibration process the results of uncertainty analysis on the model parameter confidence ellipses achieved in this study could be used as an input quantity e g via the identified standard deviation for stochastic hydrological modelling e g by means of monte carlo based simulations in this way the uncertainty propagation of input parameter uncertainty into the corresponding variables of water and energy balances can be further quantified kunstmann et al 2006 therefore the analysis of observation addition is useful for assessing the relative worth of individual variables in reducing the uncertainty of model parameters 4 4 correlation and contribution of model parameters pca based analysis to identify the intercorrelation of the model parameters as well as to quantify the extent to which these parameters are sensitive to the calibration process a pca analysis on the post calibration parameter covariance matrix was performed as shown in fig 9 the intercorrelation between the model parameters is not strong this indicates that the calibrated parameters are not or insignificantly correlated in case of high parameter correlation the minimum of the objective function will be difficult to obtain and the ability of pest will be limited doherty 2015 however most parameters show low intercorrelations this also was confirmed by the analysis of the post calibration parameter correlation coefficient matrix not shown more importantly it can be seen that majority of the parameters with the longest arrows contain the highest contributions to the eigenvectors i e both pc1 and pc2 therefore these are the parameters whose values were quite sensitive in the calibration process in other words these parameters are highly estimable as they lie in the calibration solution space this indicates a successful sensitivity analysis to identify the key model parameters see fig 3 however a few of the parameters show low contributions to the calibration process with the lowest arrows such as kv cam 1 and a cam 1 these are mostly insensitive and less estimable parameters as they lie in the calibration null space this could be explained by either a rather high negative correlation coefficient between these parameters see fig 9 or the fact that the cambisol soil type covers only a limited part of the rott catchment see fig 1c we note that the results obtained from the pca analysis for the parameter contribution importance in the calibration process is in good agreement with the outcomes of parameter identifiability analysis not shown additionally the posedness condition of the inverse problem was examined by i correlation analysis ii eigenvalues and iii condition number the correlation analysis informs us whether immoderate correlation with other parameters results in high error variance of a particular parameter if so the inverse problem is ill posed i e φ contours do not close when the number of parameters are high the likelihood of an ill posed inverse problem is also increased doherty 2015 however the pca based correlation analysis shows low correlations between the parameters indicating a well posed inverse problem also if the ratio of highest to lowest eigenvalue of the post calibration covariance matrix exceeds 10e 7 there is a strong possibility that pest has had serious difficulties in calculating the parameter upgrade vector see eq 13 because of matrix ill conditioning born of parameter insensitivity or high correlation doherty 2016a however we obtained a ratio of 4 49e 12 which is far less than the recommended value finally the condition number of the covariance matrix must be inverted to estimate the parameter values in fact this is recorded for every marquardt lambda tested during every pest iteration the square root of the ratio mentioned above is related to the condition number of the covariance matrix matrices that have a high condition number are difficult to invert as numerical errors are amplified in their inversion doherty 2015 however the well posedness of the inverse problem was also confirmed by the achieved low condition number i e 15 8 out of 7297 8 5 summary and conclusions we coupled the fully distributed hydrological model geotop to the parameter estimation tool pest which applies the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm for the nonlinear estimation of model parameters using the developed geotop pest interface the hydrometeorological variables of the surface streamflow and the turbulent fluxes of h and le were calibrated for the rott catchment in southern germany in addition the intercorrelation and contributions together with the sensitivity and uncertainty pertaining to the model parameters were quantified prior to parameter estimation the most sensitive parameters to variability of the model simulations were identified this resulted in considerable reduction of the estimable parameters in the calibration process for the studied watershed the parameter estimation was conducted by a 10 step iteration approach however the objective function φ minimum was already achieved in the 7th iteration analysis of the residuals showed that the mean value of non zero weighted residuals was almost zero for the model simulations which indicates a reasonable performance of φ in solving the inverse problem the quality of the modelled streamflow and the turbulent fluxes of the calibrated model was satisfying both in the calibration episode and the validation episode this was confirmed by the linear statistical metrics applied for the model performance evaluation the pca based analysis of the model parameters showed a low and insignificant cross correlation between the geotop parameters as a result most of the estimated parameters were highly sensitive to the calibration process as lay in the solution space of the inverse problem this indicates the successful application of sensitivity analysis for the key parameters identification because of the robust parameter estimation technique applied by pest the uncertainty variance of most calibrated parameters was significantly reduced in addition it was found that the soil parameter groups of α and kv highly contributed to this uncertainty reduction more importantly the benefit of adding the turbulent fluxes to the calibration dataset in order to improve the parameter confidence ellipses was determined using covariance analysis we particularity found that the additional values of the turbulent fluxes resulted in both lowering the uncertainty ranges significantly and eliminating the correlation of most model parameters however the magnitude of reduction in uncertainty ranges and also the effect on their intercorrelations varied not only for the different considered parameters but also between the heat fluxes of h and le therefore the gauss marquardt levenberg algorithm realized in pest proved to be highly suitable not only for a robust nonlinear parameter estimation but also for the uncertainty estimates of the cpu time intensive physically based model applied conflict of interest there is

6686,urban flooding occurs frequently in the world and urban hydrological models are widely applied in urban flood management and disaster mitigation in this study an enhanced inundation method eim for urban flood hazard mapping at the large catchment scale is proposed eim can be easily coupled with urban hydrological models and the coupled framework can consider both source flooding and non source flooding in floodwater generation in eim the floodwater spreading order in the positive process is based on the topological relationship between depression outlets the floodwater from lower depression elements is considered as a feedback process these improvements make this proposed method suitable for inundation estimation in large urban catchments dahongmen dhm catchment in beijing china was selected as the case study area to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method historical inundation records during one heavy storm were applied to test the performance of the method eim is compared with usism urban storm inundation simulation method on the flood hazard map in the dhm catchment which reveals the effectiveness of the improvements the results show that all inundation locations are successfully identified by eim and are distributed in flooding areas water depth greater than 0 15 m in the catchment the average relative error of simulated inundation depths is 15 which indicates that eim can successfully simulate flooding scopes and depths in the study area the results revealed that eim can be a valuable tool for mapping urban flood hazards at the large catchment scale based on gis techniques keywords enhanced inundation method flood hazard map large urban catchment gis swmm 1 introduction urban flood is regarded as a type of flash flood which can result in serious loss of lives and property smith 2006 for example flooding caused by hurricane harvey in the city of houston texas usa in 2017 led to thousands of homes flooded the cost of reconstruction was estimated to be as high as 200 billion bbc news 2017 the flood hazard in urban areas is predicted to increase with the warmer climate and urban sprawl ashley et al 2005 huong and pathirana 2013 li et al 2013 ntelekos et al 2010 urban flood hazard mapping at the large catchment scale can give a comprehensive understanding of the flood prone areas of a city and is urgently required for city planning and disaster mitigation bathrellos et al 2012 fernandez and lutz 2010 the preferred method to reliably map flood hazard in urban areas is to use hydrodynamic models such as mike urban lee et al 2015 info works icm cheng et al 2017 and lisflood fp wu et al 2017 these models are based on shallow water equations that describe the physical process of flooding and have been widely applied in small catchments 1 10 km2 the main challenge of applying the above hydrodynamic models in a large catchment more than 100 km2 is the difficulty in preparing the required datasets fewtrell et al 2011 salvadore et al 2015 for example the detailed information of sewer systems for large urban catchments is difficult to acquire this problem can be simplified by deducting drainage volume from runoff chu et al 2014 zhang and pan 2014 however this deduction ignores the distribution of sewer systems and the drainage capacity is set by the modeler s prior experience another challenge is the great computational cost of the hydrodynamic models that use high resolution terrain datasets in large catchments high resolution terrain datasets such as lidar based digital elevation model dem have been successfully used for hydrodynamic modelling in small urban catchments fewtrell et al 2011 ozdemir et al 2013 however these datasets are seldom used in large catchments because of the high computational demand neal et al 2010 these challenges limit the applicability of hydrodynamic models for urban flood hazard mapping at the large catchment scale geographic information system gis is an effective tool to map flood hazard at the large catchment scale the most popular method is the multi criteria decision approach mcda fernandez and lutz 2010 tang et al 2018 mcda identifies flood prone areas using different explanatory factors based on gis techniques however mcda cannot provide the scope and depth of flooding some inundation methods based on gis such as rfim krupka and wallis 2007 rfsm gouldby et al 2008 and fcdc zhang et al 2014 have been proposed for mapping the scope and depth of flooding these methods can simulate the spreading process of floodwater but they do not consider the process of floodwater generation to consider the floodwater generation process zhang and pan 2014 proposed an urban flood hazard mapping framework named urban storm inundation simulation method usism and successfully applied it to a small catchment in harbin helongjiang province china however usism only included a simple floodwater generation model scs cn model and floodwater spreading order is based on flow accumulation fa furthermore this method focused only on non source flooding in urban areas consequently the applicability of the method proposed by zhang and pan 2014 is limited when applied to a large urban catchment to improve the simulation of urban flooding in a large catchment two improvements were further introduced in this study based on the usism the first was to introduce an urban hydrological model swmm to provide the volume of floodwater in floodwater generation in the usism method runoff calculation was based on the scs cn model mccuen 1982 and the sewer system runoff was represented by one parameter in the water balance model the exact value of this parameter is very difficult to obtain because of the complexity of the urban rainfall runoff process and the very limited sewer system data zhang and pan 2014 usism also only accounts for non source flooding and ignores floodwater from rivers the swmm model is a popular urban hydrological model and has been widely used for urban rainfall runoff modelling in large catchment case studies barco et al 2008 bisht et al 2016 swmm which can provide the volume of floodwater in the drainage system shows advantages in urban runoff simulation hsu et al 2000 the second improvement was that the floodwater spreading order was determined by the elevation and location of depression outlets but not by the value of fa the value of fa reflects the order of water spreading from upper to lower in filled dem in urban areas the elevation of contiguous depression changes significantly and some local depressions are easily flooded these areas are usually ignored in hydrological modelling because of the depression filling process the order of water spreading in these areas does not strictly follow the order of the fa value maksimović et al 2009 furthermore the upper depression will receive floodwater from the lower depression when the water level of lower depression is higher than contiguous depressions the structure of the proposed model in this study better describes urban flooding in a large catchment by adding the feedback process of floodwater from lower depression elements in this study an enhanced inundation method eim was proposed for urban hazard mapping at the large catchment scale this method introduced the swmm model for floodwater generation and floodwater spreading was based on the topological relation of depression outlets a large catchment dahongmen dhm in beijing china was selected as a case study area to apply and validate the eim two representative areas in the dhm catchment were selected to compare the corresponding flood hazard mapping performance based on eim and usism historical inundation datasets were used to test the performance of eim in terms of inundation locations and water depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description dhm catchment 39 48 39 55 n 116 9 116 24 e is located upstream of the liangshui river in the metropolitan area of beijing china the annual precipitation of this area is about 520 mm and 80 of the precipitation is dispersed during heavy summer storms the terrain of this catchment shows a downtrend from the northwest to the southeast fig 1 a with a total area of 131 km2 dhm catchment has been urbanized rapidly in the past decades and has gradually become a beijing metropolitan transport hub about 90 of this catchment area has been modified to be waterproof this catchment is one of the flood prone areas in the city and 30 of the inundation sites during the storm of 21 july 2012 were located in this catchment this 2012 storm caused the heaviest urban flood in the past two decades it produced 200 mm excess rainfall in the urban area causing 79 casualties and 11 6 billion chinese yuan nearly 2 billion in damage to beijing city shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 2 2 data description eim spreads floodwater based on the dem data in this study the dem dataset was provided by advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model version 1 gdem the resolution of gdem used in this study is 30 metre and the resolution can successfully identify the depressions for a large catchment by comparing them with sunken areas in the dhm catchment one historical inundation dataset in the dhm catchment was used for model validation the dataset comprised 14 inundation sites during the heavy storm of 21 july 2012 in the dhm catchment these inundation sites were published online http map sogou com special jishui and geo referenced by gf 2 images the locations of inundation sites during the 2012 storm are shown in fig 1 a water depth observations of four inundation sites were provided by the national disaster reduction centre of china 2 3 floodwater generation method the storm water management model swmm was selected to generate the volume of floodwater for eim swmm was developed by the environmental protection agency epa of america for water planning and management in urban areas huber et al 1989 swmm has been widely used in urban water management in many cities of china jiang et al 2015 liao et al 2015 su et al 2014 yu et al 2014 the model applied in the dhm catchment of beijing city was originally developed and validated in terms of discharge process by zhao et al 2014 and improved by considering the impact of urbanization on the rainfall runoff process xu and zhao 2016 the uncertainty of the swmm application in urban catchments was studied by morris and glue methods knighton et al 2016 shi et al 2014 shi et al 2016 sun et al 2014 the model structure of swmm in this study is shown in fig 1 b the dhm catchment was delineated with 79 sub catchments in swmm and each sub catchment comprised several depression elements fig 2 a the eim and swmm were coupled by the volume of floodwater swmm generates runoff in each sub catchment and transports this runoff through drainage and river system it can quantitatively calculate the volume of sourced and non sourced floodwater the volume of sourced floodwater vs in swmm is directly reflected by the volume of overflow at the river or sewer junction points the volume of non sourced floodwater vn and total floodwater vt for each depression element in one sub catchment is calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 v n p i d a d where p is the depth of precipitation mm in the sub catchment i is the depth of infiltration mm in the sub catchment d is the depth of drainage water mm in the sub catchment and ad is the area of one depression element m2 in the sub catchment 2 v t m 1 m v s m v n where m is the number of junction points in one depression element and v s m is the volume of floodwater of junction m in the swmm model the horton model and kinematic wave model were selected for estimating the amount of infiltration and drainage water xu and zhao 2016 four hourly precipitation gauges dahongmen dhm youanmen yam shijingshan sjs and longyuanzha lyz were used as model driven data hourly discharge data of the dhm station was used for validation in terms of water balance in this catchment observed precipitation and discharge data were provided by the hydrographic station of beijing the river and sewer system datasets were provided by the hydrographic station of beijing and the beijing municipal institute of city planning and design respectively these datasets include locations section shapes and conveyance capacities of the river and sewer system in the study area the performance of swmm in terms of drainage flow was calibrated and validated with four real storms including the storm of 21 july 2012 in previous studies xu and zhao 2016 2 4 floodwater spreading method depressions are sunken areas below the surrounding terrain and can be easily flooded during heavy storms inundation models based on gis techniques are widely used for flooding scopes and depths estimation gouldby et al 2008 krupka and wallis 2007 zhang et al 2014 this section describes the floodwater spreading process of the enhanced inundation model eim in detail the general idea of floodwater spreading in eim is described as follows the catchment is firstly delineated with several depression elements fig 2 a based on gis and each depression element has its own relationship between water level and water volume named as h v curve the flooding depth of depression elements can be rapidly estimated based on the volume boundary from swmm and h v curve in previous studies zhang and pan 2014 flow spreading only follows the positive order of flow accumulation value in this study spreading order was based on the topological relationship between depression outlets and water volume from the lower depression elements was considered as feedback process in the eim fig 2 a the calculation process of eim is described as follows 1 depression elements delineation and h v curve calculation each depression element includes the depression area and the catchment of this depression it can be extracted by using arcgis software with dem depressions are calculated by the elevation difference between the filled dem map and the original dem map and the catchments of depression are delineated based on the flow direction map with d8 algorithm fairfield and leymarie 1991 these procedures are processed with module of hydrology in arcgis software maidment 2002 the sketch map of a depression element is shown in fig 2 a each depression element has a h v curve that reflects the relationship between the water level and volume of this depression element the height of the depression element can be divided into j parts as given by eq 3 3 j h max h min δ h where h min is the minimal elevation of the depression element in metre h max is the maximal elevation of the depression element in metre δ h is the water level interval during h v curve calculation δ v h j is the water volume of each j height and can be estimated by eq 4 4 δ v h j δ h s j where j is one part of the total j parts j 1 2 3 j 1 j sj is the depression area that elevation is less than h j in m2 h j is the elevation at j th height in metre 5 h j h min δ h j there is a corresponding v j for each h j 6 v j 1 j δ v h j where v j is the volume of water at j th height the h v curve can be estimated by h j as x axis and v j as y axis fig 3 h l and v l are maximal water level and volume of the depression in positive process for each depression element the elevation of depression outlet ho is equal to h l in this study the h v curve started to stabilize when the value of δ h was less than 0 1 m therefore δ h was set to 0 1 in this study 2 determination of flow spreading order the spreading order of water between depression elements is mainly based on the location and elevation of the maximal water level of each depression h l the flow routes from the upper depression element with higher h l value to the contiguous depression element that has lower h l value in the positive process to simplify the problem each depression element has multiple inputs from upper depression elements and only one output to the lower element the flow spreading order of a catchment can be described as several tree structures fig 4 for a depression element e m n the spreading order can be related to two parameters m and n m is the level number of the tree and water transfer from high level to the root in the positive process n is the node number in each level and is ordered by the maximum water level of each depression h l from the lowest to the highest 3 the positive process the positive process calculated from the highest levels of depression elements to the root node the floodwater volume changes at a certain time step t in a depression element e m n can be described as eq 7 7 δ v m n t v m p n t v m t n t v m u t where m is the level of depression elements and n is the number of depression elements in each level m 1 2 m 1 m n 1 2 n 1 n δ v m n t is the water volume change of depression e m n at time t v m p n t is the water volume of surface interception at time t v m t n t is the volume of total floodwater in depression e m n at time t v m u t is the water volume from upper depression element at time t the water volume of a depression element at time t can be described in eq 8 as 8 v m n t v m n t 1 δ v m n t the water level of e m n at time t can be calculated as 9 v m n t v m l n h m n t f m n v m n t v m n t v m l n h m n t h m l n v m d n t v m n t v m l n where v m l n is the maximum volume of e m n h m l n is the maximum water level of e m n f m n is the h v curve function of e m n in positive process h m n t is the water level that is interpolated with h v curve v m d n t is the water volume of overflow to the lower element 4 the feedback process v 1 l 1 is the maximum volume of the root depression in positive process if v 1 u 1 v 1 l 1 the calculation will stop fig 5 a and the water level of this depression element will be interpolated with h v curve of root element f 1 1 otherwise the feedback process will start and the water level of e 1 1 can exceed the maximum water level of this depression element and follow a new h c curve f fig 5 d the h c curve in the feedback process can be calculated with eq 8 and one tree structure has only one feedback curve 10 f i 1 m k 1 n f i k h where f is the h c curve in the feedback process of one tree structure the maximum volume of each depression element will be modified as in eq 11 11 v m n f h m l n where v m n is the maximum volume of the depression element in the feedback process the water level of these depressions in the feedback process can be interpolated with h c curve f in eq 12 12 h f f v 1 u 1 s t v m n 1 v 1 u 1 v m n where h f is the water level after the feedback process v 1 u 1 is the water volume of root depression after positive process 2 5 method validation the eim was compared with usism and validated in the real storm of 21 july 2012 in the dhm catchment according to the code for the design of outdoor drainage systems of china gb 50014 2006 2016 the catchment can be divided into flooding areas and non flooding areas by the critical water depth 0 15 m flooding areas are defined as the water depth greater than 0 15 m since water depth observations are only available at certain inundation sites in the study area two methods were adopted for model validation to quantify the overall model performance for inundation sites with observed water depth relative errors re was applied to evaluate the model performance re can be described as eq 13 13 re h s h o h o 100 where h s is the simulated water depth and h o is the observed water depth in addition to re metric prediction rate curve prc is applied to test the performance of model results because some inundation sites do not have water depth records prc is widely used for model validation in binary 1 and 0 i e inundated and non inundated areas in this study problems tehrany et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 prc is constructed by plotting the cumulative percentage of flood depth areas from the highest value to the lowest against the cumulative percentage of flooding evidence a higher auc value area under the prc curve represents more inundation events falling in flooding areas with higher water depth 3 results and discussions 3 1 method development and comparison 3 1 1 floodwater generation floodwater generation processes in usism and eim were compared in this study in usism the floodwater was generated with the scs model and average drainage velocity scs cn d zhang and pan 2014 the floodwater generation process during the storm event of 21 july 2012 is shown in fig 6 the curve number cn was extracted from the nrcs cn global dataset zeng et al 2017 with value ranges from 49 to 85 in the dhm catchment for the whole catchment the depth of floodwater in the scs cn d model was about 76 mm by subtracting the depth of drainage water 97 mm from the total runoff depth 173 mm in the eim the floodwater and drainage water depths were calculated by swmm the depth of total runoff 125 mm and floodwater 60 mm in the swmm model were less than the corresponding results in the usism in the scs cn d model the maximum drainage capacity was set as 655 m3 s 18 mm h by experience zhang and pan 2014 the swmm model can reflect the practical distribution of the drainage system and the capacity was calibrated and validated with real storm events compared with observed drainage flow from the dhm gauge the drainage capacity was overestimated by usism in the dhm catchment the distribution of floodwater by the two methods is shown in fig 7 in the usism the volume of floodwater was highly dependent on the area of each depression usism ignored the spatial distribution of the drainage process and did not reflect the surcharge from the river system source flooding by using usism the flood hazard would be underestimated near rivers especially during heavy rainfall events and large urban catchment modelling swmm showed advantages on the drainage system modelling in fig 7 b the surcharges from rivers are successfully identified 3 1 2 flow spreading as mentioned earlier flow spreading in usism is only based on the flow accumulation fa value or order from upstream lower fa value to downstream higher fa value accordingly the maximum water depth of each depression is hl and floodwater will flow to the next depression element when floodwater exceeds the maximum volume of this depression however some depression elements root elements in urban areas do not have lower depression elements in unfilled dem thus hl value and outlet location were used to determine spreading order in the proposed eim to better represent the flow spreading process in urban areas for example e1 is the root depression of the tree1 structure in the unfilled dem fig 8 b and floodwater should flow from e3 to e2 then to e1 in the unfilled dem however the spreading order with flow accumulation was from e1 to e2 to e3 because these depressions were filled fig 8 c the correct order of floodwater spreading can be achieved by introducing h l value and outlet location in the proposed eim when the volume of floodwater exceeds the vl of e2 floodwater will spread from e2 to e1 via h l 2 56 m firstly but not h l 3 59 m when floodwater of e1 exceeds the maximum volume of this depression feedback process will work and floodwater can flow from e1 to e2 to e4 h l 4 58 m the dhm catchment was delineated with 159 tree structures and 781 depression elements respectively in eim the tree structures and depression elements are shown in fig 9 3 1 3 flood hazard map comparison this section compares the flood hazard map by usism and eim in two representative areas in the dhm catchment the locations of the two areas are shown in fig 10 a tree1 is upstream of the catchment and inundations in tree1 are mainly caused by non source flooding as shown in fig 10 b and c the simulated flood scopes by the two methods in tree1 are similar and observed inundation site a can be successfully identified tree2 is midstream of the catchment and the observed water depth of inundation site b is 2 m the simulated water depth at site b is underestimated by usism and can be correctly simulated by eim figs 13 e and f in tree2 the reason for this is that source flooding occurred in tree2 fig 7 b that cannot be represented in usism fig 7 a feedback process did not work in tree1 because all the floodwater could be filled in the positive process the flood scopes of tree2 both before and after the feedback process are shown in figs 13 e and f following the positive process about 190 000 m3 of floodwater left in root depression needed to be filled with neighbour depressions in tree2 therefore the flood hazard will be significantly underestimated by usism which does not have the feedback process eim shows superiority in such cases 3 2 method validation drainage flow simulated by swmm was validated with observed discharge data in a previous study xu and zhao 2016 which ensures the accurate simulation of the water balance in the catchment in this section we compared the observed inundation sites and the simulated flood depths and scopes by eim and usism the inundation depth maps simulated by the two methods are shown in fig 11 and the model performance is evaluated with a prc curve in fig 12 specifically 7 4 and 7 of the catchment area were simulated as flooding areas in both the eim and uisim the eim overperformed usism in the study area with a higher auc value 0 94 compared with usism some depressions along the river are simulated as flooding areas in eim these depressions can reflect the inundation caused by source flooding all inundation sites were successfully identified by eim however two inundation sites were misclassified to non flooding areas by usism some sites in the study area have information about inundation depth during the storm and such information is valuable for model validation compared with the inundation location the inundation depth information has more uncertainties since the inundation depth was usually obtained by investigation after the storm and the obtained depth may not accurately represent the actual inundation during the storm the results of observed and simulated depth from the two methods in this study area are shown in table 1 from table 1 it is clear that there was an obvious underestimation of inundation depth by usism the average relative errors of eim and usism are 15 and 34 respectively which shows that eim can better simulate inundation depth in the dhm catchment 4 conclusions and recommendations most cities in china are suffering from urban flooding and the urban hydrological model is a useful tool for urban water management jiang et al 2018 salvadore et al 2015 these models are efficient tools for flood prediction but show limitations on estimating flooding scopes the proposed method in this paper can be easily coupled with the water volume boundary which can be obtained from the urban hydrological model to estimate the urban flooding scopes rapidly and accurately the comparison in this study clearly demonstrates that eim is superior to usism in terms of flood hazard mapping in a large urban catchment the eim presents advantages as follows 1 floodwater generation is based on the urban hydrological model in eim it considers source and non source flooding and is suitable for mapping flood hazard in large urban catchments 2 floodwater spreading is based on the topological relationship among depression outlets and 3 the feedback process of floodwater from the lower depression element was introduced in the calculation it is more suitable for the inundation estimation in complex elevation areas such as urban areas there are also recommendations from this study 1 gdem was used for model development in this study gdem is global coverage dataset that helps the application of eim to other regions however gdem is a type of dtm digital terrain model which cannot accurately reflect buildings and other detailed urban landscapes thus high resolution datasets are necessary to properly model flooding in urban areas aktaruzzaman 2011 however these datasets are commercially sensitive in the study areas and gdem is the finest resolution currently available eim is quite suitable for flood hazard mapping with high resolution dem because the computation consumption will not significantly grow with the increase of the data resolution high resolution datasets are desired to test the model robustness and accuracy in future works 2 water spreading between tree structures should be considered during extreme rainfall events due to data limitations a representative storm was selected for model validation the return time of this storm is about 10 20 years bai et al 2012 xu and zhao 2016 and there is no floodwater left after the feedback process however in some extreme rainfall events such as 100 year return period storm the floodwater may remain after all depression elements in one tree structure are filled after the feedback process in that case the floodwater will flow to downstream tree structures and this should be considered in modelling thus the model performance should be further tested with more storms especially extreme events when the data is available conflict of interest none acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the

volume from runoff chu et al 2014 zhang and pan 2014 however this deduction ignores the distribution of sewer systems and the drainage capacity is set by the modeler s prior experience another challenge is the great computational cost of the hydrodynamic models that use high resolution terrain datasets in large catchments high resolution terrain datasets such as lidar based digital elevation model dem have been successfully used for hydrodynamic modelling in small urban catchments fewtrell et al 2011 ozdemir et al 2013 however these datasets are seldom used in large catchments because of the high computational demand neal et al 2010 these challenges limit the applicability of hydrodynamic models for urban flood hazard mapping at the large catchment scale geographic information system gis is an effective tool to map flood hazard at the large catchment scale the most popular method is the multi criteria decision approach mcda fernandez and lutz 2010 tang et al 2018 mcda identifies flood prone areas using different explanatory factors based on gis techniques however mcda cannot provide the scope and depth of flooding some inundation methods based on gis such as rfim krupka and wallis 2007 rfsm gouldby et al 2008 and fcdc zhang et al 2014 have been proposed for mapping the scope and depth of flooding these methods can simulate the spreading process of floodwater but they do not consider the process of floodwater generation to consider the floodwater generation process zhang and pan 2014 proposed an urban flood hazard mapping framework named urban storm inundation simulation method usism and successfully applied it to a small catchment in harbin helongjiang province china however usism only included a simple floodwater generation model scs cn model and floodwater spreading order is based on flow accumulation fa furthermore this method focused only on non source flooding in urban areas consequently the applicability of the method proposed by zhang and pan 2014 is limited when applied to a large urban catchment to improve the simulation of urban flooding in a large catchment two improvements were further introduced in this study based on the usism the first was to introduce an urban hydrological model swmm to provide the volume of floodwater in floodwater generation in the usism method runoff calculation was based on the scs cn model mccuen 1982 and the sewer system runoff was represented by one parameter in the water balance model the exact value of this parameter is very difficult to obtain because of the complexity of the urban rainfall runoff process and the very limited sewer system data zhang and pan 2014 usism also only accounts for non source flooding and ignores floodwater from rivers the swmm model is a popular urban hydrological model and has been widely used for urban rainfall runoff modelling in large catchment case studies barco et al 2008 bisht et al 2016 swmm which can provide the volume of floodwater in the drainage system shows advantages in urban runoff simulation hsu et al 2000 the second improvement was that the floodwater spreading order was determined by the elevation and location of depression outlets but not by the value of fa the value of fa reflects the order of water spreading from upper to lower in filled dem in urban areas the elevation of contiguous depression changes significantly and some local depressions are easily flooded these areas are usually ignored in hydrological modelling because of the depression filling process the order of water spreading in these areas does not strictly follow the order of the fa value maksimović et al 2009 furthermore the upper depression will receive floodwater from the lower depression when the water level of lower depression is higher than contiguous depressions the structure of the proposed model in this study better describes urban flooding in a large catchment by adding the feedback process of floodwater from lower depression elements in this study an enhanced inundation method eim was proposed for urban hazard mapping at the large catchment scale this method introduced the swmm model for floodwater generation and floodwater spreading was based on the topological relation of depression outlets a large catchment dahongmen dhm in beijing china was selected as a case study area to apply and validate the eim two representative areas in the dhm catchment were selected to compare the corresponding flood hazard mapping performance based on eim and usism historical inundation datasets were used to test the performance of eim in terms of inundation locations and water depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description dhm catchment 39 48 39 55 n 116 9 116 24 e is located upstream of the liangshui river in the metropolitan area of beijing china the annual precipitation of this area is about 520 mm and 80 of the precipitation is dispersed during heavy summer storms the terrain of this catchment shows a downtrend from the northwest to the southeast fig 1 a with a total area of 131 km2 dhm catchment has been urbanized rapidly in the past decades and has gradually become a beijing metropolitan transport hub about 90 of this catchment area has been modified to be waterproof this catchment is one of the flood prone areas in the city and 30 of the inundation sites during the storm of 21 july 2012 were located in this catchment this 2012 storm caused the heaviest urban flood in the past two decades it produced 200 mm excess rainfall in the urban area causing 79 casualties and 11 6 billion chinese yuan nearly 2 billion in damage to beijing city shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 2 2 data description eim spreads floodwater based on the dem data in this study the dem dataset was provided by advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model version 1 gdem the resolution of gdem used in this study is 30 metre and the resolution can successfully identify the depressions for a large catchment by comparing them with sunken areas in the dhm catchment one historical inundation dataset in the dhm catchment was used for model validation the dataset comprised 14 inundation sites during the heavy storm of 21 july 2012 in the dhm catchment these inundation sites were published online http map sogou com special jishui and geo referenced by gf 2 images the locations of inundation sites during the 2012 storm are shown in fig 1 a water depth observations of four inundation sites were provided by the national disaster reduction centre of china 2 3 floodwater generation method the storm water management model swmm was selected to generate the volume of floodwater for eim swmm was developed by the environmental protection agency epa of america for water planning and management in urban areas huber et al 1989 swmm has been widely used in urban water management in many cities of china jiang et al 2015 liao et al 2015 su et al 2014 yu et al 2014 the model applied in the dhm catchment of beijing city was originally developed and validated in terms of discharge process by zhao et al 2014 and improved by considering the impact of urbanization on the rainfall runoff process xu and zhao 2016 the uncertainty of the swmm application in urban catchments was studied by morris and glue methods knighton et al 2016 shi et al 2014 shi et al 2016 sun et al 2014 the model structure of swmm in this study is shown in fig 1 b the dhm catchment was delineated with 79 sub catchments in swmm and each sub catchment comprised several depression elements fig 2 a the eim and swmm were coupled by the volume of floodwater swmm generates runoff in each sub catchment and transports this runoff through drainage and river system it can quantitatively calculate the volume of sourced and non sourced floodwater the volume of sourced floodwater vs in swmm is directly reflected by the volume of overflow at the river or sewer junction points the volume of non sourced floodwater vn and total floodwater vt for each depression element in one sub catchment is calculated by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 v n p i d a d where p is the depth of precipitation mm in the sub catchment i is the depth of infiltration mm in the sub catchment d is the depth of drainage water mm in the sub catchment and ad is the area of one depression element m2 in the sub catchment 2 v t m 1 m v s m v n where m is the number of junction points in one depression element and v s m is the volume of floodwater of junction m in the swmm model the horton model and kinematic wave model were selected for estimating the amount of infiltration and drainage water xu and zhao 2016 four hourly precipitation gauges dahongmen dhm youanmen yam shijingshan sjs and longyuanzha lyz were used as model driven data hourly discharge data of the dhm station was used for validation in terms of water balance in this catchment observed precipitation and discharge data were provided by the hydrographic station of beijing the river and sewer system datasets were provided by the hydrographic station of beijing and the beijing municipal institute of city planning and design respectively these datasets include locations section shapes and conveyance capacities of the river and sewer system in the study area the performance of swmm in terms of drainage flow was calibrated and validated with four real storms including the storm of 21 july 2012 in previous studies xu and zhao 2016 2 4 floodwater spreading method depressions are sunken areas below the surrounding terrain and can be easily flooded during heavy storms inundation models based on gis techniques are widely used for flooding scopes and depths estimation gouldby et al 2008 krupka and wallis 2007 zhang et al 2014 this section describes the floodwater spreading process of the enhanced inundation model eim in detail the general idea of floodwater spreading in eim is described as follows the catchment is firstly delineated with several depression elements fig 2 a based on gis and each depression element has its own relationship between water level and water volume named as h v curve the flooding depth of depression elements can be rapidly estimated based on the volume boundary from swmm and h v curve in previous studies zhang and pan 2014 flow spreading only follows the positive order of flow accumulation value in this study spreading order was based on the topological relationship between depression outlets and water volume from the lower depression elements was considered as feedback process in the eim fig 2 a the calculation process of eim is described as follows 1 depression elements delineation and h v curve calculation each depression element includes the depression area and the catchment of this depression it can be extracted by using arcgis software with dem depressions are calculated by the elevation difference between the filled dem map and the original dem map and the catchments of depression are delineated based on the flow direction map with d8 algorithm fairfield and leymarie 1991 these procedures are processed with module of hydrology in arcgis software maidment 2002 the sketch map of a depression element is shown in fig 2 a each depression element has a h v curve that reflects the relationship between the water level and volume of this depression element the height of the depression element can be divided into j parts as given by eq 3 3 j h max h min δ h where h min is the minimal elevation of the depression element in metre h max is the maximal elevation of the depression element in metre δ h is the water level interval during h v curve calculation δ v h j is the water volume of each j height and can be estimated by eq 4 4 δ v h j δ h s j where j is one part of the total j parts j 1 2 3 j 1 j sj is the depression area that elevation is less than h j in m2 h j is the elevation at j th height in metre 5 h j h min δ h j there is a corresponding v j for each h j 6 v j 1 j δ v h j where v j is the volume of water at j th height the h v curve can be estimated by h j as x axis and v j as y axis fig 3 h l and v l are maximal water level and volume of the depression in positive process for each depression element the elevation of depression outlet ho is equal to h l in this study the h v curve started to stabilize when the value of δ h was less than 0 1 m therefore δ h was set to 0 1 in this study 2 determination of flow spreading order the spreading order of water between depression elements is mainly based on the location and elevation of the maximal water level of each depression h l the flow routes from the upper depression element with higher h l value to the contiguous depression element that has lower h l value in the positive process to simplify the problem each depression element has multiple inputs from upper depression elements and only one output to the lower element the flow spreading order of a catchment can be described as several tree structures fig 4 for a depression element e m n the spreading order can be related to two parameters m and n m is the level number of the tree and water transfer from high level to the root in the positive process n is the node number in each level and is ordered by the maximum water level of each depression h l from the lowest to the highest 3 the positive process the positive process calculated from the highest levels of depression elements to the root node the floodwater volume changes at a certain time step t in a depression element e m n can be described as eq 7 7 δ v m n t v m p n t v m t n t v m u t where m is the level of depression elements and n is the number of depression elements in each level m 1 2 m 1 m n 1 2 n 1 n δ v m n t is the water volume change of depression e m n at time t v m p n t is the water volume of surface interception at time t v m t n t is the volume of total floodwater in depression e m n at time t v m u t is the water volume from upper depression element at time t the water volume of a depression element at time t can be described in eq 8 as 8 v m n t v m n t 1 δ v m n t the water level of e m n at time t can be calculated as 9 v m n t v m l n h m n t f m n v m n t v m n t v m l n h m n t h m l n v m d n t v m n t v m l n where v m l n is the maximum volume of e m n h m l n is the maximum water level of e m n f m n is the h v curve function of e m n in positive process h m n t is the water level that is interpolated with h v curve v m d n t is the water volume of overflow to the lower element 4 the feedback process v 1 l 1 is the maximum volume of the root depression in positive process if v 1 u 1 v 1 l 1 the calculation will stop fig 5 a and the water level of this depression element will be interpolated with h v curve of root element f 1 1 otherwise the feedback process will start and the water level of e 1 1 can exceed the maximum water level of this depression element and follow a new h c curve f fig 5 d the h c curve in the feedback process can be calculated with eq 8 and one tree structure has only one feedback curve 10 f i 1 m k 1 n f i k h where f is the h c curve in the feedback process of one tree structure the maximum volume of each depression element will be modified as in eq 11 11 v m n f h m l n where v m n is the maximum volume of the depression element in the feedback process the water level of these depressions in the feedback process can be interpolated with h c curve f in eq 12 12 h f f v 1 u 1 s t v m n 1 v 1 u 1 v m n where h f is the water level after the feedback process v 1 u 1 is the water volume of root depression after positive process 2 5 method validation the eim was compared with usism and validated in the real storm of 21 july 2012 in the dhm catchment according to the code for the design of outdoor drainage systems of china gb 50014 2006 2016 the catchment can be divided into flooding areas and non flooding areas by the critical water depth 0 15 m flooding areas are defined as the water depth greater than 0 15 m since water depth observations are only available at certain inundation sites in the study area two methods were adopted for model validation to quantify the overall model performance for inundation sites with observed water depth relative errors re was applied to evaluate the model performance re can be described as eq 13 13 re h s h o h o 100 where h s is the simulated water depth and h o is the observed water depth in addition to re metric prediction rate curve prc is applied to test the performance of model results because some inundation sites do not have water depth records prc is widely used for model validation in binary 1 and 0 i e inundated and non inundated areas in this study problems tehrany et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 prc is constructed by plotting the cumulative percentage of flood depth areas from the highest value to the lowest against the cumulative percentage of flooding evidence a higher auc value area under the prc curve represents more inundation events falling in flooding areas with higher water depth 3 results and discussions 3 1 method development and comparison 3 1 1 floodwater generation floodwater generation processes in usism and eim were compared in this study in usism the floodwater was generated with the scs model and average drainage velocity scs cn d zhang and pan 2014 the floodwater generation process during the storm event of 21 july 2012 is shown in fig 6 the curve number cn was extracted from the nrcs cn global dataset zeng et al 2017 with value ranges from 49 to 85 in the dhm catchment for the whole catchment the depth of floodwater in the scs cn d model was about 76 mm by subtracting the depth of drainage water 97 mm from the total runoff depth 173 mm in the eim the floodwater and drainage water depths were calculated by swmm the depth of total runoff 125 mm and floodwater 60 mm in the swmm model were less than the corresponding results in the usism in the scs cn d model the maximum drainage capacity was set as 655 m3 s 18 mm h by experience zhang and pan 2014 the swmm model can reflect the practical distribution of the drainage system and the capacity was calibrated and validated with real storm events compared with observed drainage flow from the dhm gauge the drainage capacity was overestimated by usism in the dhm catchment the distribution of floodwater by the two methods is shown in fig 7 in the usism the volume of floodwater was highly dependent on the area of each depression usism ignored the spatial distribution of the drainage process and did not reflect the surcharge from the river system source flooding by using usism the flood hazard would be underestimated near rivers especially during heavy rainfall events and large urban catchment modelling swmm showed advantages on the drainage system modelling in fig 7 b the surcharges from rivers are successfully identified 3 1 2 flow spreading as mentioned earlier flow spreading in usism is only based on the flow accumulation fa value or order from upstream lower fa value to downstream higher fa value accordingly the maximum water depth of each depression is hl and floodwater will flow to the next depression element when floodwater exceeds the maximum volume of this depression however some depression elements root elements in urban areas do not have lower depression elements in unfilled dem thus hl value and outlet location were used to determine spreading order in the proposed eim to better represent the flow spreading process in urban areas for example e1 is the root depression of the tree1 structure in the unfilled dem fig 8 b and floodwater should flow from e3 to e2 then to e1 in the unfilled dem however the spreading order with flow accumulation was from e1 to e2 to e3 because these depressions were filled fig 8 c the correct order of floodwater spreading can be achieved by introducing h l value and outlet location in the proposed eim when the volume of floodwater exceeds the vl of e2 floodwater will spread from e2 to e1 via h l 2 56 m firstly but not h l 3 59 m when floodwater of e1 exceeds the maximum volume of this depression feedback process will work and floodwater can flow from e1 to e2 to e4 h l 4 58 m the dhm catchment was delineated with 159 tree structures and 781 depression elements respectively in eim the tree structures and depression elements are shown in fig 9 3 1 3 flood hazard map comparison this section compares the flood hazard map by usism and eim in two representative areas in the dhm catchment the locations of the two areas are shown in fig 10 a tree1 is upstream of the catchment and inundations in tree1 are mainly caused by non source flooding as shown in fig 10 b and c the simulated flood scopes by the two methods in tree1 are similar and observed inundation site a can be successfully identified tree2 is midstream of the catchment and the observed water depth of inundation site b is 2 m the simulated water depth at site b is underestimated by usism and can be correctly simulated by eim figs 13 e and f in tree2 the reason for this is that source flooding occurred in tree2 fig 7 b that cannot be represented in usism fig 7 a feedback process did not work in tree1 because all the floodwater could be filled in the positive process the flood scopes of tree2 both before and after the feedback process are shown in figs 13 e and f following the positive process about 190 000 m3 of floodwater left in root depression needed to be filled with neighbour depressions in tree2 therefore the flood hazard will be significantly underestimated by usism which does not have the feedback process eim shows superiority in such cases 3 2 method validation drainage flow simulated by swmm was validated with observed discharge data in a previous study xu and zhao 2016 which ensures the accurate simulation of the water balance in the catchment in this section we compared the observed inundation sites and the simulated flood depths and scopes by eim and usism the inundation depth maps simulated by the two methods are shown in fig 11 and the model performance is evaluated with a prc curve in fig 12 specifically 7 4 and 7 of the catchment area were simulated as flooding areas in both the eim and uisim the eim overperformed usism in the study area with a higher auc value 0 94 compared with usism some depressions along the river are simulated as flooding areas in eim these depressions can reflect the inundation caused by source flooding all inundation sites were successfully identified by eim however two inundation sites were misclassified to non flooding areas by usism some sites in the study area have information about inundation depth during the storm and such information is valuable for model validation compared with the inundation location the inundation depth information has more uncertainties since the inundation depth was usually obtained by investigation after the storm and the obtained depth may not accurately represent the actual inundation during the storm the results of observed and simulated depth from the two methods in this study area are shown in table 1 from table 1 it is clear that there was an obvious underestimation of inundation depth by usism the average relative errors of eim and usism are 15 and 34 respectively which shows that eim can better simulate inundation depth in the dhm catchment 4 conclusions and recommendations most cities in china are suffering from urban flooding and the urban hydrological model is a useful tool for urban water management jiang et al 2018 salvadore et al 2015 these models are efficient tools for flood prediction but show limitations on estimating flooding scopes the proposed method in this paper can be easily coupled with the water volume boundary which can be obtained from the urban hydrological model to estimate the urban flooding scopes rapidly and accurately the comparison in this study clearly demonstrates that eim is superior to usism in terms of flood hazard mapping in a large urban catchment the eim presents advantages as follows 1 floodwater generation is based on the urban hydrological model in eim it considers source and non source flooding and is suitable for mapping flood hazard in large urban catchments 2 floodwater spreading is based on the topological relationship among depression outlets and 3 the feedback process of floodwater from the lower depression element was introduced in the calculation it is more suitable for the inundation estimation in complex elevation areas such as urban areas there are also recommendations from this study 1 gdem was used for model development in this study gdem is global coverage dataset that helps the application of eim to other regions however gdem is a type of dtm digital terrain model which cannot accurately reflect buildings and other detailed urban landscapes thus high resolution datasets are necessary to properly model flooding in urban areas aktaruzzaman 2011 however these datasets are commercially sensitive in the study areas and gdem is the finest resolution currently available eim is quite suitable for flood hazard mapping with high resolution dem because the computation consumption will not significantly grow with the increase of the data resolution high resolution datasets are desired to test the model robustness and accuracy in future works 2 water spreading between tree structures should be considered during extreme rainfall events due to data limitations a representative storm was selected for model validation the return time of this storm is about 10 20 years bai et al 2012 xu and zhao 2016 and there is no floodwater left after the feedback process however in some extreme rainfall events such as 100 year return period storm the floodwater may remain after all depression elements in one tree structure are filled after the feedback process in that case the floodwater will flow to downstream tree structures and this should be considered in modelling thus the model performance should be further tested with more storms especially extreme events when the data is available conflict of interest none acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the

6687,complex hydrological processes affect valuable water resources in inland regions across arid central asia historically this was a critical part of the silk road and it is now named the modern silk road economic belt using the qilian mountains and hexi corridor in china as a case study of the inland region we collected a total of 2311 water samples from the area and performed a comprehensive investigation of the water cycle results from stable isotope tracing indicate clear spatial patterns in the upstream mountainous regions glacier snow meltwater becomes groundwater at the periglacial belt supra permafrost water develops into river runoff in the permafrost region there are also frequent exchanges between groundwater and river runoff along the vegetation belt in the middle downstream region river runoff becomes groundwater throughout these processes both river runoff and groundwater are consumed by evapotranspiration are recycled and make a substantial contribution to precipitation overall the upstream mountainous region is a critical part of the water resources the cryosphere belt accounts for 44 of the mountainous region but contributes to about 80 of water resources recycling of moisture also plays an important role during the summer months may to september moisture recycling accounted for 24 and 14 of precipitation in upstream and middle downstream regions respectively the findings from the stable isotope tracing provide insights into hydrological processes and can help improve water management in inland regions of central asia

role in determining runoff studies have found that moisture recycling occurs mainly during the warm season of the year zhao et al 2011 li et al 2015c using an isotopic technique cui and li 2015 found that the monthly contribution of lake evaporation to basin precipitation ranged from 3 03 to 37 93 with an annual contribution of 23 42 or 90 54 mm in the inland basin qinghaihu lake the majority of

highlight the need to integrate adjacent inland river basins in the analysis they also emphasize the need to study how hydrological processes change with the changing climate as well as revealing the importance of understanding the water cycle and environmental effects in inland regions in arid central asia including kazakhstan uzbekistan kyrghyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and northwest china water is a critical resource for regional development and most inhabitants live at oases surrounded by deserts across this inland region water is sourced from glaciers snow permafrost and precipitation in the tianshan mountains pamirs kunlun mountains and qilian mountains it is then consumed in oases and deserts using the qilian mountains and hexi corridor as a case study in this paper we conduct a comprehensive stable isotope study of an inland region we aim to understand the pathways of hydrological fluxes across the mountainous regions rivers and oases and to appreciate the importance of this for the security of water resources historically the qilian mountains and hexi corridor was a critical part of the silk road liu 2010 and is now named as the golden section of the

there are three inland river basins in the region the shiyanghe heihe and shulehe each with different geographic extent oases scale and quantity of water resources this provides a unique opportunity to explore the water cycle and evolution of water resources in an inland region we particularly focus on the upstream mountainous area especially the cryosphere belt which is distributed with glaciers

qilian mountains has a cold semi arid to semi humid climate the annual mean air temperature is less than 2 c and the annual precipitation increases from about 200 mm in the low mountain zone to about 500 mm in the high mountain zone the ecosystem changes vertically from low to high altitude moving from dry shrubbery grassland through forest grassland sub alpine shrubbery meadow alpine cold desert meadow and alpine permafrost and glaciers as the consumption region for the water resources the middle stream of the three inland river basins altitude 1500 2000 m is a cool arid zone with an annual precipitation of 150 300 mm here there are many oasis cities including wuwei zhangye jiuquan and donghuang with a combined population of 5 million and a developing irrigation agriculture as the terminal lake for a river with deserts the downstream portion of the inland river basin is a temperate arid zone altitude 1300 1500 m with an annual precipitation of less than 150 mm overall due to its arid climate limited water resources and inappropriate use of water resources by humans the inland region has developed a serious loss of natural vegetation gradual soil salinization and desertification this has greatly impeded the sustainable development of the silk road economic belt 3 data and methods 3 1 water samples collection and preparation we have collected a total of 2311 samples of precipitation river water groundwater supra permafrost water glacier snow meltwater lake water plant stem water and soil water from the upper middle and downstream portions of the three inland river basins table 1 the samples were collected within one hydrological year from the basins of the shiyanghe river the heihe river and shulehe river fig 1 river water supra permafrost water

minqin changma and donghuang in the middle downstream region table 1 ten stations excluding anyuan suli changma and xidahe are national meteorology observation stations fig 1 to avoid contamination from pollutant sources the sample collectors were placed on a rooftop 8 m above the ground and 1 m above the roof rainfall or snow was sampled manually using a wet collector which was fitted with a 5 l polyethylene collecting flask at the bottom and a polyethylene funnel of 26 cm in diameter before installation of collectors the funnels and flasks were carefully cleaned and dried the collected rainwater or snow was loaded into pre cleaned polyethylene sample bottles after each precipitation event during sample collection the precipitation amount air temperature wind speed and relative humidity were recorded at corresponding automatic meteorological stations or national meteorology observation stations 3 1 2 river water samples were collected weekly within one hydrological year from ten hydrological observation stations at the outlets of the shiyanghe river heihe river and shulehe river leading to a total of 490 samples table 1 an additional 206 samples were collected at different altitudes in the upstream mountainous regions during may october and 62 river water samples were also collected within one hydrological year from three hydrological observation stations in

et al 2016a b for the heihe river basin and from zhang et al 2005 he 2013 and wang et al 2017 for the shulehe river basin 3 1 4 supra permafrost water samples as a runoff component in cold regions the supra permafrost water is mainly stored in the permafrost active layer this type of groundwater is the most widely distributed type and is affected by permafrost and the seasonal freeze thaw process a total of 102 supra permafrost water samples were collected by excavating 30 active layers of the permafrost profile at different altitudes during may october fig 1 the samples were then collected from underneath the profile 3 1 5 glacier snow meltwater samples a total of 126 samples were collected at glaciers in the source regions of the three inland river basins in two ways table 1 firstly the samples were collected from underneath the snowpack at dongdahe no 1 glacier and ningchanhe no 3 glacier of the shiyanghe river basin shiyi glacier and bayi glacier of the heihe river basin taolaihe no 1 glacier of the western branch of heihe river basin and denglonghe no 1 glacier and laohugou glacier of the shulehe river basin secondly samples were collected at the glacier front once every 15 days during may october fig 1 3 1 6 soil water samples and vegetation stem water samples in addition 268 soil water samples and 74 vegetation stem water samples were collected from forests scrubs grass and crops by excavating 30 soil profiles at different vegetation belts during may september this included alpine meadow belts alpine grassland belts alpine forest belts alpine farmland and oasis farmland of the three inland rivers 3 2 measurement of δd and δ18o before the analysis all the samples were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator without evaporation precipitation river water groundwater

project mod16 3 3 methods of stable isotope tracing we conducted end member mixing analysis emma hooper et al 1990 hooper 2003 using isotopic compositions in water samples the emma tracer approach is a popular method for analyzing potential water sources contributing to stream flow this tracer approach assumes that the isotopic composition of the water is spatial temporally constant and any variations are of a result of water mixing along the flow path in order to evaluate the contribution from moisture recycling to precipitation in inland river basins methods based on stable isotope tracing have been developed in this study the details for these methods are in appendix a 4 results 4 1 transformations of water an inland river basin can conceptually be divided into four parts these are the cryosphere belt glacier snow and permafrost vegetation belt oases belt and desert belt as illustrated in fig 2 the runoff mainly originates from the upstream mountainous region and is consumed by oasis irrigation and evapotranspiration in middle downstream region isotope tracing shows that there are frequent transformations of water especially upstream of inland river basins we observe similar values of δ18o in the glacier snow meltwater and the groundwater in the periglacial belt table 2 this can be interpreted as glacier snow meltwater transforming into groundwater at the glacier terminus this can be explained by the many glacial moraines in the periglacial environment from 4200 m to 4400 m e g lateral moraines and marginal moraines fig 2 therefore alteration often occurs between fissure pore water and meltwater scatter plots of δ18o in river water and δ18o in groundwater in the mountainous region are observed to be similar fig 3 a this can be interpreted as a similar source for each supra permafrost water transforms into river water at the permafrost region fig 2 as the water storage layer the widely distributed active layers of the permafrost can hold surface water in the freezing season and then melt to increase the quantity of water in the ablation season precipitation and meltwater held in the active layers of the permafrost can turn into groundwater and finally flow into the river channel similar isotopic compositions are observed between groundwater and river water in the vegetation belt fig 3a this implies that there are transformations between groundwater and river water in the vegetation belt fig 2 the dense grassland vegetation absorbs and infiltrates precipitation at the same time precipitation can penetrate the soil increase soil water recharge and reduce the amount of surface runoff during the wet season however unconsolidated sediments and faults in the vegetation belt lead to escape of river water which then supplies groundwater to the middle downstream region in summary precipitation glacier snow meltwater and supra permafrost water firstly transform into groundwater and then supply runoff in upstream mountainous region this can be verified by two facts 1 the isotopic composition and clustering distribution in lwml is similar between river water and groundwater fig 3 2 the monthly variation of δ18o is similar in groundwater and river water whilst precipitation displays obvious seasonal fluctuation in inland river basins fig 4 4 2 components of outlet runoff the relationship between these types of water in upstream mountainous regions is illustrated in fig 3 supra permafrost water has average δ18o and δd values of 6 67 and 43 91 respectively with a relatively strong influence of soil evaporation glacier snow meltwater has average δ18o and δd value of 9 77 and 52 42 respectively the isotopic composition of river water and groundwater was close to that of the lmwl fig 3a and the δ18o and δd values varied among precipitation glacier snow meltwater and supra permafrost water these characteristics suggest that river water was recharged by multiple sources including glacier snow meltwater supra permafrost water and precipitation in the middle downstream region the groundwater has more negative δ18o and δd than the river water fig 3b the data for river water and groundwater also show a cluster pattern which indicates groundwater is mainly supplied by river water from the mountainous region the emma model was used to identify the variable source areas and mixing processes and to quantify the contribution of each end member there are considerable differences in the concentrations of d excess and δ18o for glacier snow meltwater supra permafrost water precipitation and river water in upstream mountainous region fig 5 a accordingly the concentrations of δ18o and d excess were selected for the analysis because this combination provides a reasonable separation of sources therefore precipitation supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater can be treated as three end members there are large spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of these solutes and the outlet runoff is located within the triangle spanning the three end members suggesting that the runoff is a mixture of them fig 5a in general precipitation supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater account for 70 22 and 8 of the outlet runoff in the study region respectively fig 6 in the qilian mountains the runoff process is mainly concentrated during the period of may october so the contribution of runoff components to monthly runoff was also evaluated as shown in fig 7 evidently the contribution rate from precipitation tends to increase from may to august and then decreases until october which is consistent with the monthly precipitation variation and about 80 of precipitation is concentrated during may september li et al 2014a b for supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater the contribution rate decreases from may to august and then increases until october this is the reverse of the trend in the precipitation s contribution the cryosphere meltwater dominates the outlet runoff in may owing to strong snow melting and both surface and subsurface flows can occur to supply water to the stream during the melting of the top of permafrost in october precipitation is scarce the freezing process begins and the residual supra permafrost water in the permafrost active layer replenishes the runoff the contribution rate from the cryosphere meltwater to runoff gradually reduces with increasing precipitation during june september in summer the coarse materials facilitate rapid infiltration and exfiltration of the permafrost active layer where the channel slope is steep in the upper basin thus the meltwater and precipitation streamflow rapidly transforms into groundwater and then supplies the river runoff as overall precipitation dominates the river runoff in the three inland rivers as is well known meanwhile glaciers with an area of 1047 18 km2 and ice reserves of 52 43 km3 in the northern qilian mountains which only accounted for 1 2 of the total area in the upstream mountainous region and permafrost accounted only for 28 7 of the total area of the northern qilian mountains for the outlet runoff the local evaporation line lel is δd 6 51δ18o 4 39 r2 0 76 the intersection of the lel with the lmwl is at 8 5 for δ18o and 49 8 for δd of river water according to the altitude effect of δ18o for precipitation 0 18 100 m in the qilian mountains li et al 2016 the river water recharging is at an altitude of 3500 m in the upstream mountainous region again these characteristics indicate that the water resources are mainly from the upstream mountainous region based on the permafrost boundary in the qilian mountains at an altitude of 3600 m zhou et al 2000 the mountainous region can be divided into two belts the cryosphere belt above 3600 m and the vegetation belt between 2000 m and 3600 m the average δ18o of precipitation in the two belts is 8 95 and 6 67 respectively fig 5b our calculations indicate that water from the cryosphere belt accounts for 80 of the outlet runoff and the other 20 is water from the vegetation belt fig 5b overall it was found that the cryosphere belt accounts for 44 of the area of the upstream mountainous region but that it contributes to about 80 of the water resources in the qilian mountains and hexi corridor this outcome is attributable to high precipitation rapid infiltration and high runoff coefficient under high altitude low air temperature steep terrain and sparse vegetation it is known that precipitation tends to increase as altitude increases observations at the qilian mountains show that precipitation increases from 476 mm at an altitude of 2980 m to 842 mm at an altitude of 4166 m chen et al 2014 in contrast relatively lower evapotranspiration 452 6 mm occurs at high altitudes 4166 m than at lower altitudes yang et al 2017 therefore low evapotranspiration and high precipitation tend to generate runoff in the cryosphere belt the widely distributed glaciers and permafrost store solid water resources at the same time the active layers of the permafrost may increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff during precipitation events the intersections absorption and redistribution of precipitation in rock fragments affect the distribution pattern of precipitation runoff the characteristics of sparse protective vegetation coarse particle size of soil and high infiltration rates in the cryosphere belt are beneficial to the infiltration of glacier snow meltwater supra permafrost water and precipitation which then turn into groundwater and supply the outlet runoff li et al 2014a b 4 3 moisture recycling moisture recycling plays an important role in inland regions the analysis based on stable isotope tracing highlights that recycled moisture contributes 78 mm and 16 mm to the total precipitation from may to september in the upstream mountainous region and the middle downstream region respectively fig 8 in upstream mountainous regions the evaporation and transpiration fraction have contributed 23 mm and 55 mm to precipitation fig 8 which accounts for 8 and 16 of the total precipitation from may to september this is equivalent to 69 108 m3 water 4 6 times more than the average outlet runoff of the heihe river specifically moisture recycling contributes 3 mm 19 mm 27 mm 22 mm and 7 mm to the corresponding precipitation in may june july august and september respectively figs 9 and 10 in the middle downstream region the evaporation and transpiration fraction have contributed 5 mm and 11 mm respectively to the corresponding precipitation from may to september fig 8 this accounts for 5 and 9 of the total precipitation over this time period this value is equivalent to the total amount of condensing water used for desert vegetation during the growing season at the linze desert regarding the seasonal variation the contribution of moisture recycling increases starting in may and then decreases from the maximum in june and the corresponding precipitation is 1 mm 5 mm 4 mm 3 mm and 1 mm respectively figs 9 and 10 although the absolute contribution from moisture recycling to precipitation is relatively low it is significant for regional water resources and ecological protection in the inland region as is illustrated in figs 9 and 10 both the evaporation and transpiration fractions increase from lower altitudes to higher altitudes with a maximum in the southeastern region this trend occurs because the lower temperature and higher water vapor pressure in the qilian mountains is favorable to producing more precipitation and the strong evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation in the mountainous region provides abundant water vapor which promotes local moisture recycling this is consistent with the spatial pattern of the actual evapotranspiration fig 11 a this is because evapotranspiration is stronger in the moist forest meadow and grass of upstream mountainous regions than it is in the middle downstream region fig 11b these similar spatial patterns reflect the better vegetation cover and the stronger moisture recycling the regional average actual evapotranspiration is 113 mm between may and september it consists of 143 mm of evapotranspiration in the upstream mountainous region and 83 mm of evapotranspiration in the middle downstream region fig 11a the moisture recycling is sourced from the evapotranspiration so the ratio between the precipitation from moisture recycling and evapotranspiration can be defined as the local moisture recycling ratio the average local moisture recycling ratio is 46 in the study region the corresponding values in the mountainous region and the middle downstream region are 61 and 19 respectively this result also reflects the strong moisture recycling and the high efficiency of water vapor use in the mountainous region it can also be interpreted that the qilian mountains is the main water source for the hexi corridor 5 discussion 5 1 runoff and climate change in the upstream mountainous region the annual average temperature increased by 0 34 c 10a between 1961 and 2016 as shown in fig 12 over the same period the annual average precipitation increased by 14 7 mm 10a and the diurnal temperature range decreased by 0 14 c 10a under these warmer and wetter conditions the ice days and frost days significantly decreased by 3 3 d 10a and 3 9 d 10a respectively however the length of the growing season increased by 3 5d 10a these changes have caused a shortening of the freezing period and a lengthening of the ablation period moreover the area and volume of glaciers have decreased by 420 81 km2 20 88 and 21 63 km3 20 26 respectively in the past half century sun et al 2015a b in the qilian mountains the permafrost area is also in degradation it has decreased from 9 75 104 km2 in the 1970 s to 7 66 104 km2 in 2000 s chunling et al 2014 the accelerating decrease of the cryosphere and the increasing meltwater due to climate change has profound impacts on hydrological processes and the global water cycle huss and hock 2018 previous studies have quantified the contribution of glacier snow meltwater to runoff based on stable isotope tracing in single inland river basins or smaller basins for example kong and pang 2012 found that glacier snow meltwater accounted for 57 64 of river flow in the kumalak river sun et al 2015a illustrated that in 2012 the proportions of glacier snow meltwater in the stream flow was 14 7 in the urumqi river basin wang et al 2015 showed that the contributions of glacier snow meltwater and groundwater to the yushugou river in the tianshan mountains were 63 and 37 respectively in the aksu river 36 44 of the runoff was derived from glacier snow meltwater sun et al 2015b similarly in the tizinafu river the contribution of glacier snow meltwater to runoff was 43 fan et al 2015 in the tarim river basin the contribution of glacier snow meltwater to river runoff was approximately 41 5 during 1961 2006 gao et al 2010 and 23 for runoff in the juntanghu basin in the tianshan mountains wang and tang 2013 li et al 2014a b confirmed that about 32 of runoff in the hulugou small river basin in the central qilian mountains was sourced from cryosphere meltwater however bin et al 2014 found that snow meltwater contributed only 4 to the runoff in the dayekou small basin in the qilian mountains in the three inland rivers of the qilian mountains the cryosphere also accounted about 30 of the outlet runoff the annual average outlet runoff for inland rivers is increasing as precipitation increases and glaciers and permafrost degrade the runoff in shiyanghe river basin increased from 12 73 108 m3 during 1990 2002 to 15 56 108 m3 during 2003 2016 yuhong et al 2017 from 1945 to 2014 the annual average outlet runoff in the heihe river basin has progressively increased from 14 16 108 m3 in 1945 1949 to about 20 108 m3 in 2011 2014 cheng et al 2017 in the western branch of the heihe river basin the annual average outlet runoff of the taolaihe river basin increased by 1 37 m3 s from the 1990s to 2000s xu et al 2014 furthermore in the shulehe river basin the annual average outlet runoff increased by 0 91 108 m3 10a during 1958 2015 and increased from 12 95 108 m3 in 1990 to 16 97 108 m3 in 2010 yang et al 2017 5 2 groundwater in middle downstream region in the upstream mountainous region of inland river basins some groundwater and river water will have escaped as through faults concealed by unconsolidated sediments ma et al 2010 some of the infiltrated river and groundwater has overflowed as springs at the margins of alluvial fans the remaining infiltration recharged the groundwater in the middle stream however while the stable isotope values of modern direct precipitation recharge are close to those of the outlet runoff and groundwater in the upstream mountainous region the depleted stable isotope for groundwater suggests that there is no general relationship based on water balance calculations about 32 40 and 71 of outlet runoff has transformed into groundwater in the middle stream of the shiyanghe river basin heihe river basin and shulehe river basin respectively donglin and xiangyuan 2005 the downstream spring and lateral groundwater flow also have a similar isotopic composition to the groundwater in the middle stream due to the common recharge sources which have been the main supply for groundwater in the downstream inland river basin wang and tang 2013 this has accounted for 68 46 and 84 of groundwater downstream of the shiyanghe river basin the heihe river basin and the shulehe river basin respectively donglin and xiangyuan 2005 the groundwater in the middle downstream region is also recharged by surface water via river infiltration canal system seepage and farmland irrigation water seepage ma et al 2005 these can also be verified by the clustering distribution in lwml between river and groundwater fig 3b notably for some deep groundwater when the well depth is 150 m the mean values of δ18o and δd in the deep aquifers beneath the jinchang and minqin basins are lower by 1 5 and 18 8 respectively compared with the values of shallow groundwater in the basin zhu et al 2007 these results along with lower 14c or undetected 3h concentrations indicate that the majority of the deep groundwater is principally maintained by paleo water rather than modern recharge zhu et al 2008 the results from a series of studies in the hexi corridor chen et al 2003 edmunds et al 2006 and also downstream wu et al 2001 chen et al 2006 zhu et al 2008 ruan et al 2015 in the badain jaran desert zhao et al 2011 and in the zhangye basin of heihe river basin zhang et al 2005 zhu et al 2008 ruan et al 2015 all showed that the major body of deep groundwater is late pleistocene in age apart from a small proportion which is marginally recharged by modern river runoff 5 3 moisture recycling and climate change with warming due to climate change the strong evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation in the mountainous region provides abundant water vapors which promote local moisture recycling the potential evapotranspiration has increased by 9 11 mm 10a during the past 60 years with the average value of 1100 mm in the heihe river basin wang et al 2017 in the shiyanghe river basin the referenced evapotranspiration increased by 5 2 mm 10a with an average value of 950 mm during 1959 2011 chunling et al 2014 in the shulehe river basin the average potential evapotranspiration was 920 6 mm with an increasing trend of 9 8 mm 10a during 1961 2011 jinkui et al 2013 field observations also confirmed the strengthening evapotranspiration the daily average grassland evapotranspiration was 2 6 mm from july to august of 2015 in the mountainous region wang et al 2016a b and the total evapotranspiration at the grassland spots was 439 9 mm for a whole year at an altitude of 3000 m li et al 2013 yang et al 2013 in the middle stream of the heihe river basin when the average temperature rises by 1 c in the linze oasis the referenced crop evapotranspiration increases by 0 11 mm wang and tang 2013 upstream of the shiyanghe river basin the transpiration fraction ranged from 0 to 6 3 mm d whilst the evaporation fraction ranged from 0 to 4 3 mm d at an altitude of 4200 m in shulehe river basin the total evapotranspiration was 238 3 mm between may 22nd and september 22nd 2013 li et al 2016 as well as strengthening evapotranspiration good vegetation cover also promotes moisture recycling chen et al 2015 found that the vegetation ndvi has generally increased during 1982 2014 in the qilian mountains the largest increase occurred in summer followed by autumn and spring the vegetation cover increased as a whole in recent years the increasing area is the largest in summer with a cover of 91 669 km2 accounting for 48 7 of the area in the qilian mountains zhengli et al 2015 the inter annual variation of the start dates of the growing season in the qilian mountains shows that it has been moving earlier at a rate of 0 44d 10a during 1982 2010 zhou et al 2013 the vegetation cover has been increasing rapidly in the upstream mountainous region and remaining steady in the middle downstream of the shulehe river basin during 2000 2014 jinghui et al 2016 the ndvi of the shiyanghe river basin has also showed an increase from 1999 to 2010 and the area of vegetation restoration was far greater than the area of vegetation degeneration xing et al 2013 oases are a type of medium or small non zonal landscape which is supported by natural or artificial rivers in a desert in general the widely distributed oases are considered to greatly influence the local climate there is an increase in precipitation and water vapor as well as a decrease of air temperature and a reduction in the diurnal temperature range within an oasis furthermore there is a cooling effect due to extensive evapotranspiration of vegetation in oases comparing to the surroundings lv et al 2004 in the hexi corridor the oasis area increased by 14 8 and by an area of 19 233 km2 from 1975 to 2010 zhang et al 2015 the jinta oasis area increased by 167 37 km2 from 1963 to 2009 and the ejina oasis area increased by 87 05 from 1963 to 2012 yaowen et al 2014 the zhangye oasis area of the heihe river basin increased from 545 9 km2 in 2001 to 721 6 km2 in 2010 jun et al 2012 the oasis area of the shiyanghe river basin increased from 7131 56 km2 in 2000 to 7459 43 km2 in 2010 xing et al 2013 zhenzhen et al 2016 found that the oasis area of the shulehe river basin also increased by 937 85 km2 during 1997 2011 it is interesting to note that the contribution rate of moisture recycling to precipitation had a statistical positive correlation with the size of oasis areas fig 13 this reflects the strong evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation for large oases 5 4 implications for water management in recent decades water saving measures have been adopted extensively in inland regions of china however the issue of water shortage is still becoming increasingly serious mainly due to population increase therefore it is critical to ensure a reliable water supply in inland river basins the water from the cryosphere belt has accounted for 80 of outlet runoff therefore water resource security is mainly focused on the cryosphere belt in inland river basins ecological conservation of the cryosphere belt with its high precipitation low evapotranspiration and high runoff coefficient is a key element of local water resource security in inland regions moisture recycling accounts for 24 of precipitation in mountainous regions it is noted that this ratio of contribution rate is similar to that obtained by other studies for example the contribution of the evaporation from a large surface water body to local precipitation is 28 31 in the nam co basin of china xu et al 2011 23 in the qinghai lake basin of china cui and li 2015 16 50 in ihorty lake of madagascar vallet coulomb et al 2008 10 20 in kasumigaura lake of japan yamanaka and shimizu 2007 10 18 in michigan lake bowen et al 2012 and 5 16 in the north american great lakes gat et al 1994 these results reflect moisture recycling the ability of water resources to renew is especially strong in upstream mountainous region which is an important part of local water resource security in inland regions the significance of moisture recycling to regional water resources highlights the importance of ecological conservation in upstream mountainous regions the conservation in upstream regions should be coupled with the rational use of water resources in the middle downstream portion of inland river basins these would be the most effective strategies for providing a reliable water supply in inland regions of china 6 conclusions based on stable isotope tracing this paper illustrates three prominent features of water cycles in inland regions firstly water transformations are frequent upstream of inland river basins glacier snow meltwater transforms into groundwater at the periglacial belt and supra permafrost water transforms into river water at the permafrost region there is also transformation between groundwater and river water at the vegetation belt in the water formation region precipitation glacier snow meltwater and supra permafrost water firstly transform into groundwater and then supply the river runoff in upstream mountainous regions there is some escape of groundwater and river water which has provided the main supply of groundwater in the middle streams further downstream the spring and lateral groundwater flow is also sourced from the groundwater in the middle stream in addition the groundwater is recharged by surface water via river infiltration canal system seepage and farmland irrigation water seepage in oases regions secondly cryosphere meltwater plays an important role in inland river basins as the climate has become warmer and wetter in recent decades the average annual outlet runoff has increased glacier snow meltwater and supra permafrost water have accounted for approximately 8 and 22 of the outlet runoff respectively the cryosphere belt accounts for 44 of the area of upstream mountainous regions but it contributes about 80 of water resources under high altitude low air temperature steep terrain and sparse vegetation conditions furthermore the widely distributed glaciers and permafrost store solid water resources the active layers of permafrost may increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff during precipitation events and the intersections absorption and redistribution of precipitation in rock fragments also affect the hydrological process thirdly local moisture recycling makes a considerable contribution to precipitation moisture recycling in mountainous regions and in the middle downstream region accounts for 24 and 14 of precipitation during may september respectively it has contributed 78 mm to the precipitation upstream of the three inland rivers equivalent to 69 108 m3 water and 4 6 times more than the outlet runoff in the heihe river the contribution is 16 mm in the middle downstream region which is equivalent to the total condensing water used for desert vegetation in the growing season at the linze desert with warming due to climate change strong evapotranspiration and good vegetation cover in upstream mountainous regions would promote local moisture recycling the conservation of upstream regions should be coupled with the rational use of water resources in middle downstream portions of inland river basins these would be the most effective strategies for providing a reliable water

subscripts represent stream water sample and 1 2 and 3 represent water from the respective contribution of three respective source waters end members to s stream water the fraction of each end source is denoted by f the solutions for f1 f2 and f3 in regards to tracer concentrations in eq 1a and 1b can be expressed as follows 2a f1 x3 xs x3 x2 y3 ys y3 y2 y1 y3 y3 y2 x1 x3 x3 x2 2b f2 x3 xs x3 x1

trace can be considered in eq 1a and 1b 3 xs f1x1 f2x2 and the solution for f1 and f2in terms of tracer concentrations in eq 1a and 1b can be expressed as follows peng et al 2012 4a f1 xs x2 x1 x2 4b f2 1 f1 quantification on moisture recycling 1 δ18o and δd of local subcloud precipitation in arid regions sub cloud evaporation increases the δ18o and δd of precipitation froehlich et al 2008 pang et al 2011 kong et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to correct the measured δ18o and δd in precipitation under the effect of sub cloud evaporation when estimating the recycling fractions kong et al 2013 and froehlich et al 2008 confirmed that the δ18o and δd of precipitation in the cloud base can be determined by 5 i f 1 i γ i α f i β 1 where i is 18 18o and 2 2h and the equilibrium fraction factor for δ18o and δd is ɑ which can be dominated by the condensation temperature and can be calculated by 6 103lnα18ow v 1 137 106 t2 0 4156 103 t 2 0667 7 103lnα2hw v 24 844 106 t2 76 248 103 t 52 612 where t is the average temperature the β and γ are estimated by 8 β i 1 α i d d n 1 h α i d d n 1 h 9 γ i α i h 1 α i d d n 1 h where f is the remaining fraction of the water drop mass which depends on the initial radius rin evaporation rate vevap and fall time of the drop t the parameter h is the relative humidity d and d are the diffusion constants of 1h2h16o 1h1h18o and 1h1h16o in air and the ratio of d d is 1 024 1 0289 the evaporation rate vevap of falling drops can be calculated by 10 v evap 4 π a d 1 fa s ρ a ρ b where s represents the effective thickness of a shell around the drop a is the radius of falling drops ρa and ρb are densities at the surface of the falling drop and in the ambient air respectively and f is a dimensionless quantity that measures the actual heat of moisture exchange the part of eq d ρ a ρ b can be dominated by humidity and temperature and the part of eq 5 4 π a 1 fa s is mainly determined by the drop size and ambient temperature so the calculation of these two factors needs information on temperature drop size and humidity the falling time of the water drop would be estimated by falling velocity v and the distance between ground and cloud base the falling velocity can be calculated by the following relationship 11 v 9 58 1 exp r 0 885 1 147 where r is the water drop radius assuming that precipitation forms close to the average cloud base level corresponding to the 850 hpa so the falling time of the water drop would be estimated based on meteorological data the effect of subcloud evaporation can then be determined 2 δ18o and δd of atmospheric water vapor based on precipitation isotopes the δ18o and δd for atmospheric water vapor can be estimated by the following method gibson and reid 2014 12 δ a δ p k ε 1 10 3 k ε where δa is isotopic compositions in atmospheric water vapor and δp is isotopic compositions in precipitation at the cloud base k is the adjusting parameter and ɛ is the equilibrium fractionation factor between water and vapor and can be calculated by 13 ε α 1 α is the equilibrium fractionation factor 14 10 3 i n 2 α 1158 8 t 3 10 9 1620 1 t 2 10 6 794 84 t 10 3 161 04 2 9992 10 9 t 3 15 10 3 i n 18 α 7 685 6 7123 10 3 t 1 6664 10 6 t 2 0 35041 10 9 t 3 where t is the temperature in k the parameter k can be calculated by the following steps firstly the local evaporation line slope slel by the stable isotope values of river water resevitor water and spring water samples was confirmed and then calculations were repeated using k between 0 6 and 1 0 with step width of 0 0001 the final value of k was determined when the difference between slel and the measured lel slope was the lowest or k reached the boundary values 0 6 and 1 0 more details about the calculations were described by skrzypek et al 2015 the measured lel can be calculated as 16 s lel h 10 3 18 ε h 2 δ a 2 δ p 2 ε 1 10 3 2 δ p h 10 3 2 ε h 18 δ a 18 δ p 18 ε 1 10 3 18 δ p where h is relative humidity and ɛ is the total fractionation factor defined as 17 ε ε α ε k where kinetic fractionation factor ɛk is calculated as 18 ε k 1 h θ n c d where the weighting value θ for small water body evaporation flux does not influence ambient humidity is 1 and for larger water body like the great lakes and the mediterranean sea is 0 5 the value n for a stable layer like soil and leaf cover is 1 and for a large open water body is 0 5 the values of cd are 25 1 for hydrogen and 28 5 for oxygen respectively araguas araguas et al 2000 as suggested by skrzypek et al 2015 the values of h and n were both set to 1 3 δ18o and δd of advection water vapor to estimate the isotope ratios in advection water vapor δadv from upwind site to downwind site when vapor isotopes show a depleting trend along the transportation path and isotopic fractionation was assumed to be due to rayleigh distillation 19 δ adv δ up a α 1 i n f where δup a is the isotope ratios in advection water vapor at upwind site α is equilibrium fractionation factor and f is a ratio between final and initial vapor which can be calculated by the value of surface vapor pressure at sampling station 4 δ18o and δd of soil evaporation water vapor using the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 theδd and δ18o of the soil evaporation water vapor can be calculated by 20 δ ev δ s α h δ a ε 1 h ε k where ev sand a are the isotopic composition of soil evaporation water vapor soil water and atmospheric water vapor other parameters are the same as in the equations above the kinetic fraction factor αk for oxygen 18 18αk and for deuterium 2αk can be estimated by froehlich et al 2008 21 2αk 1 0 024n 22 18αk 1 0 0289n with n 0 58 5 δ18o and δd of vegetation transpiration water vapor according to previous work by li et al 2016 there is no isotope fractionation when plant transpired water is taken up by roots therefore the isotope composition δ18ops of local vegetation stem water is the same as that of the transpired water vapor 23 δ18otr δ18ops 24 dtr dps 6 calculations on the moisture recycling to precipitation a three component mixing model was used to calculate the recycling fractions from soil evaporation water vapor and vegetation transpiration water vapor the δ18o and d excess have been used as tracers in such studies assuming that the precipitation is a mixture of water vapor originates from advection soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration the recycling fractions can be calculated by 25 f1δ18oadv f2δ18otr f3δ18oev δ18oa 26 f1dadv f2dtr fdev da 27 f1 f2 f3 1 where f1 f2 f3 are the fractions of

6687,complex hydrological processes affect valuable water resources in inland regions across arid central asia historically this was a critical part of the silk road and it is now named the modern silk road economic belt using the qilian mountains and hexi corridor in china as a case study of the inland region we collected a total of 2311 water samples from the area and performed a comprehensive investigation of the water cycle results from stable isotope tracing indicate clear spatial patterns in the upstream mountainous regions glacier snow meltwater becomes groundwater at the periglacial belt supra permafrost water develops into river runoff in the permafrost region there are also frequent exchanges between groundwater and river runoff along the vegetation belt in the middle downstream region river runoff becomes groundwater throughout these processes both river runoff and groundwater are consumed by evapotranspiration are recycled and make a substantial contribution to precipitation overall the upstream mountainous region is a critical part of the water resources the cryosphere belt accounts for 44 of the mountainous region but contributes to about 80 of water resources recycling of moisture also plays an important role during the summer months may to september moisture recycling accounted for 24 and 14 of precipitation in upstream and middle downstream regions respectively the findings from the stable isotope tracing provide insights into hydrological processes and can help improve water management in inland regions of central asia keywords inland region stable isotope water cycle hydrological process 1 introduction stable isotopes provide an efficient and effective way of investigating regional and global water cycles craig 1961 tian et al 2001 vallet coulomb et al 2008 bowen et al 2012 gibson et al 2017 at present isotopic methods have been used either independently or in combination with hydrometric and geochemical methods in order to elucidate hydrological processes including flow components flow pathways residence times moisture recycling stream behavior and the biogeochemical cycle gat and matsui 1991 gat et al 1994 tian et al 2007 yamanaka and shimizu 2007 peng et al 2012 for inland river basins with widely distributed glaciers and permafrost areas stable isotope tracing is particularly useful as direct continuous field observation of hydrological processes is extremely difficult due to the harsh environment kong et al 2013 cui and li 2015 li et al 2015a stable isotope tracing represents a promising method to study the water cycle such measurements provide direct information on the water cycle and circumvent substantial uncertainties in water cycle modeling xu et al 2011 gibson et al 2017 for inland river basins investigations using stable isotope tracing are typically at the basin scale for small rivers at this scale stable isotope tracing has been used to analyze the local meteoric water line lmwl hydrological processes seasonal variation and isotopic properties of precipitation kong and pang 2012 bin et al 2014 it has also been used to identify sources of water vapor and to explore the environmental factors that influence them zhao et al 2011 ma et al 2012 stable isotope tracing can be used to quantify the contributions of different water sources to runoff and to find the geographic extent of different sources li et al 2014a b 2015a this method has revealed extremely important connections between surface water and groundwater and allowed investigation of the effects of climate change on isotopic time series partitioning of streamflow components wang et al 2015 sun et al 2015a b peng et al 2016 it has been used to investigate stable isotope evolution and the mechanisms that affect stream water chemistry li et al 2015b nie et al 2010 overall it has been found that precipitation constitutes the primary runoff source in inland river basins wang et al 2009 sun et al 2015a there are also in depth investigations of stable isotopes in individual parts of river basins zhu et al 2007 ma et al 2010 li et al 2015c d wang et al 2016a b these studies mostly focus on the middle downstream section of inland river basins where there are oasis cities with dense populations agriculture and industry such cities include wuwei and zhangye which date back to 100 bce for example wang et al 2017 established an integrated conceptual model for groundwater in the middle downstream section of a basin in other studies the isotopic characteristics of groundwater and its renewal have been investigated zhang et al 2005 nie et al 2010 wang et al 2016a b further to this the isotopic and geochemical evolutions of the groundwater cycle have been studied wang and tang 2013 zhu et al 2007 and isotopic and geochemical evidence has been used to confirm recharge sources and water quality ma et al 2010 it has been found repeatedly that there is frequent exchange between groundwater and river water zhang et al 2005 2006 2009 jia et al 2008 in addition to these river basin studies kong et al 2013 and wang et al 2016a b found that moisture recycling plays an important role in determining runoff studies have found that moisture recycling occurs mainly during the warm season of the year zhao et al 2011 li et al 2015c using an isotopic technique cui and li 2015 found that the monthly contribution of lake evaporation to basin precipitation ranged from 3 03 to 37 93 with an annual contribution of 23 42 or 90 54 mm in the inland basin qinghaihu lake the majority of which occurred in summer in the nam co basin of china another inland lake basin the moisture recycling from lake evaporation accounted for 28 4 31 1 of precipitation xu et al 2011 these studies highlight the need to integrate adjacent inland river basins in the analysis they also emphasize the need to study how hydrological processes change with the changing climate as well as revealing the importance of understanding the water cycle and environmental effects in inland regions in arid central asia including kazakhstan uzbekistan kyrghyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and northwest china water is a critical resource for regional development and most inhabitants live at oases surrounded by deserts across this inland region water is sourced from glaciers snow permafrost and precipitation in the tianshan mountains pamirs kunlun mountains and qilian mountains it is then consumed in oases and deserts using the qilian mountains and hexi corridor as a case study in this paper we conduct a comprehensive stable isotope study of an inland region we aim to understand the pathways of hydrological fluxes across the mountainous regions rivers and oases and to appreciate the importance of this for the security of water resources historically the qilian mountains and hexi corridor was a critical part of the silk road liu 2010 and is now named as the golden section of the modern silk road economic belt which is the economic corridor and cultural communication channel of the world glacier snow permafrost oases and deserts are the core environments in the inland regions there are three inland river basins in the region the shiyanghe heihe and shulehe each with different geographic extent oases scale and quantity of water resources this provides a unique opportunity to explore the water cycle and evolution of water resources in an inland region we particularly focus on the upstream mountainous area especially the cryosphere belt which is distributed with glaciers snow and permafrost it is highlighted that the upstream section of inland river basins i e the water formation region and runoff source region dominates the quantity spatial temporal variation and seasonal pattern of water resources this isclosely associated with water shortage issues of oasis towns in the middle downstream portion of the inland river basin the analysis was based on 2311 samples of precipitation river water groundwater supra permafrost water i e the groundwater stored mainly in the permafrost active layer glacier snow meltwater plant stem water and soil water from the upper middle and downstream portions of the three inland river basins 2 study region the qilian mountains and hexi corridor 92 107 e 36 43 n are located between the north tibetan plateau and the gobi deserts in northwest china they have a geographic extent of 31 55 104 km2 and stretch 850 km from northwest to southeast liu 2010 the qilian mountains are on the southwest of the corridor there are 2859 glaciers with a total area of 1597 km2 sun et al 2015a b the total glacier reserve is 84 48 108 m3 and the permafrost area is 9 39 104 km2 the gobi deserts are to the northeast of the corridor the badain jaran desert 39 n 41 n and 100 e 104 e spans approximately 50 000 km2 and the tengger desert has a total area of 36 000 km2 the three river basins shiyanghe heihe and shulehe are orientated from southeast to northwest in this region as shown in fig 1 the basin of the heihe river is the second largest inland river basin of china with an area of 14 29 104 km2 including its two branches the eastern branch is the heihe river and the western branch is the taolaihe river the shulehe river is the third largest inland river basin of china with a whole catchment area of approximately 14 21 104 km2 the shiyanghe river is the fourth largest inland river basin with an area of 4 16 104 km2 the annual mean runoff is 1 6 billion m3 for the shiyanghe river 3 2 billion m3 for heihe river and 1 72 billion m3 for the shulehe river the water formation region is the cryosphere belt which is distributed with glaciers snow and permafrost this upstream mountainous region altitude 2000 5000 m in the qilian mountains has a cold semi arid to semi humid climate the annual mean air temperature is less than 2 c and the annual precipitation increases from about 200 mm in the low mountain zone to about 500 mm in the high mountain zone the ecosystem changes vertically from low to high altitude moving from dry shrubbery grassland through forest grassland sub alpine shrubbery meadow alpine cold desert meadow and alpine permafrost and glaciers as the consumption region for the water resources the middle stream of the three inland river basins altitude 1500 2000 m is a cool arid zone with an annual precipitation of 150 300 mm here there are many oasis cities including wuwei zhangye jiuquan and donghuang with a combined population of 5 million and a developing irrigation agriculture as the terminal lake for a river with deserts the downstream portion of the inland river basin is a temperate arid zone altitude 1300 1500 m with an annual precipitation of less than 150 mm overall due to its arid climate limited water resources and inappropriate use of water resources by humans the inland region has developed a serious loss of natural vegetation gradual soil salinization and desertification this has greatly impeded the sustainable development of the silk road economic belt 3 data and methods 3 1 water samples collection and preparation we have collected a total of 2311 samples of precipitation river water groundwater supra permafrost water glacier snow meltwater lake water plant stem water and soil water from the upper middle and downstream portions of the three inland river basins table 1 the samples were collected within one hydrological year from the basins of the shiyanghe river the heihe river and shulehe river fig 1 river water supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater samples concentrated on the upstream portion i e the water formation region of the inland river basins precipitation groundwater vegetation stem water and soil water samples were collected across the whole region the sampling details for specific water types are described in the following sections 3 1 1 precipitation samples a total of 606 event scale samples were collected within one hydrological year across seven stations anyuan xidahe qilian yeniugou tuole suli and minle in the upstream mountainous regions and seven stations gulang wuwei zhangye jiayuguan minqin changma and donghuang in the middle downstream region table 1 ten stations excluding anyuan suli changma and xidahe are national meteorology observation stations fig 1 to avoid contamination from pollutant sources the sample collectors were placed on a rooftop 8 m above the ground and 1 m above the roof rainfall or snow was sampled manually using a wet collector which was fitted with a 5 l polyethylene collecting flask at the bottom and a polyethylene funnel of 26 cm in diameter before installation of collectors the funnels and flasks were carefully cleaned and dried the collected rainwater or snow was loaded into pre cleaned polyethylene sample bottles after each precipitation event during sample collection the precipitation amount air temperature wind speed and relative humidity were recorded at corresponding automatic meteorological stations or national meteorology observation stations 3 1 2 river water samples were collected weekly within one hydrological year from ten hydrological observation stations at the outlets of the shiyanghe river heihe river and shulehe river leading to a total of 490 samples table 1 an additional 206 samples were collected at different altitudes in the upstream mountainous regions during may october and 62 river water samples were also collected within one hydrological year from three hydrological observation stations in the middle downstream regions of the three inland rivers fig 1 in addition 21 lake reservoir water samples were collected in the middle downstream region at different altitudes from the three inland rivers during may october 3 1 3 groundwater a total of 192 samples were weekly collected from four wells in the upstream mountainous regions of the three inland river basins within one hydrological year a further 102 samples were collected at different altitudes during may october in the middle downstream region 62 groundwater samples were collected from three wells within one hydrological year fig 1 isotopic data from another 196 groundwater samples were taken from zhu et al 2007 ma et al 2010 and wang and tang 2013 for the shiyanghe river basin from zhang et al 2006 jia et al 2008 and wang et al 2016a b for the heihe river basin and from zhang et al 2005 he 2013 and wang et al 2017 for the shulehe river basin 3 1 4 supra permafrost water samples as a runoff component in cold regions the supra permafrost water is mainly stored in the permafrost active layer this type of groundwater is the most widely distributed type and is affected by permafrost and the seasonal freeze thaw process a total of 102 supra permafrost water samples were collected by excavating 30 active layers of the permafrost profile at different altitudes during may october fig 1 the samples were then collected from underneath the profile 3 1 5 glacier snow meltwater samples a total of 126 samples were collected at glaciers in the source regions of the three inland river basins in two ways table 1 firstly the samples were collected from underneath the snowpack at dongdahe no 1 glacier and ningchanhe no 3 glacier of the shiyanghe river basin shiyi glacier and bayi glacier of the heihe river basin taolaihe no 1 glacier of the western branch of heihe river basin and denglonghe no 1 glacier and laohugou glacier of the shulehe river basin secondly samples were collected at the glacier front once every 15 days during may october fig 1 3 1 6 soil water samples and vegetation stem water samples in addition 268 soil water samples and 74 vegetation stem water samples were collected from forests scrubs grass and crops by excavating 30 soil profiles at different vegetation belts during may september this included alpine meadow belts alpine grassland belts alpine forest belts alpine farmland and oasis farmland of the three inland rivers 3 2 measurement of δd and δ18o before the analysis all the samples were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator without evaporation precipitation river water groundwater supra permafrost water glacier snow meltwater and lake water samples were analyzed for δ18o and δd using laser absorption spectroscopy with los gatos research del 100 at the key laboratory of ecohydrology of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences measurement precisions for δd and δ18o were greater than 0 5 and 0 2 respectively for soil water samples and vegetation stem water samples the δd measurements were performed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms x 7 series thermo scientific with a precision of 0 5 the δ18o measurements were performed with a mat

project mod16 3 3 methods of stable isotope tracing we conducted end member mixing analysis emma hooper et al 1990 hooper 2003 using isotopic compositions in water samples the emma tracer approach is a popular method for analyzing potential water sources contributing to stream flow this tracer approach assumes that the isotopic composition of the water is spatial temporally constant and any variations are of a result of water mixing along the flow path in order to evaluate the contribution from moisture recycling to precipitation in inland river basins methods based on stable isotope tracing have been developed in this study the details for these methods are in appendix a 4 results 4 1 transformations of water an inland river basin can conceptually be divided into four parts these are the cryosphere belt glacier snow and permafrost vegetation belt oases belt and desert belt as illustrated in fig 2 the runoff mainly originates from the upstream mountainous region and is consumed by oasis irrigation and evapotranspiration in middle downstream region isotope tracing shows that there are frequent transformations of water especially upstream of inland river basins we observe similar values of δ18o in the glacier snow meltwater and the groundwater in the periglacial belt table 2 this can be interpreted as glacier snow meltwater transforming into groundwater at the glacier terminus this can be explained by the many glacial moraines in the periglacial environment from 4200 m to 4400 m e g lateral moraines and marginal moraines fig 2 therefore alteration often occurs between fissure pore water and meltwater scatter plots of δ18o in river water and δ18o in groundwater in the mountainous region are observed to be similar fig 3 a this can be interpreted as a similar source for each supra permafrost water transforms into river water at the permafrost region fig 2 as the water storage layer the widely distributed active layers of the permafrost can hold surface water in the freezing season and then melt to increase the quantity of water in the ablation season precipitation and meltwater held in the active layers of the permafrost can turn into groundwater and finally flow into the river channel similar isotopic compositions are observed between groundwater and river water in the vegetation belt fig 3a this implies that there are transformations between groundwater and river water in the vegetation belt fig 2 the dense grassland vegetation absorbs and infiltrates precipitation at the same time precipitation can penetrate the soil increase soil water recharge and reduce the amount of surface runoff during the wet season however unconsolidated sediments and faults in the vegetation belt lead to escape of river water which then supplies groundwater to the middle downstream region in summary precipitation glacier snow meltwater and supra permafrost water firstly transform into groundwater and then supply runoff in upstream mountainous region this can be verified by two facts 1 the isotopic composition and clustering distribution in lwml is similar between river water and groundwater fig 3 2 the monthly variation of δ18o is similar in groundwater and river water whilst precipitation displays obvious seasonal fluctuation in inland river basins fig 4 4 2 components of outlet runoff the relationship between these types of water in upstream mountainous regions is illustrated in fig 3 supra permafrost water has average δ18o and δd values of 6 67 and 43 91 respectively with a relatively strong influence of soil evaporation glacier snow meltwater has average δ18o and δd value of 9 77 and 52 42 respectively the isotopic composition of river water and groundwater was close to that of the lmwl fig 3a and the δ18o and δd values varied among precipitation glacier snow meltwater and supra permafrost water these characteristics suggest that river water was recharged by multiple sources including glacier snow meltwater supra permafrost water and precipitation in the middle downstream region the groundwater has more negative δ18o and δd than the river water fig 3b the data for river water and groundwater also show a cluster pattern which indicates groundwater is mainly supplied by river water from the mountainous region the emma model was used to identify the variable source areas and mixing processes and to quantify the contribution of each end member there are considerable differences in the concentrations of d excess and δ18o for glacier snow meltwater supra permafrost water precipitation and river water in upstream mountainous region fig 5 a accordingly the concentrations of δ18o and d excess were selected for the analysis because this combination provides a reasonable separation of sources therefore precipitation supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater can be treated as three end members there are large spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations of these solutes and the outlet runoff is located within the triangle spanning the three end members suggesting that the runoff is a mixture of them fig 5a in general precipitation supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater account for 70 22 and 8 of the outlet runoff in the study region respectively fig 6 in the qilian mountains the runoff process is mainly concentrated during the period of may october so the contribution of runoff components to monthly runoff was also evaluated as shown in fig 7 evidently the contribution rate from precipitation tends to increase from may to august and then decreases until october which is consistent with the monthly precipitation variation and about 80 of precipitation is concentrated during may september li et al 2014a b for supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater the contribution rate decreases from may to august and then increases until october this is the reverse of the trend in the precipitation s contribution the cryosphere meltwater dominates the outlet runoff in may owing to strong snow melting and both surface and subsurface flows can occur to supply water to the stream during the melting of the top of permafrost in october precipitation is scarce the freezing process begins and the residual supra permafrost water in the permafrost active layer replenishes the runoff the contribution rate from the cryosphere meltwater to runoff gradually reduces with increasing precipitation during june september in summer the coarse materials facilitate rapid infiltration and exfiltration of the permafrost active layer where the channel slope is steep in the upper basin thus the meltwater and precipitation streamflow rapidly transforms into groundwater and then supplies the river runoff as overall precipitation dominates the river runoff in the three inland rivers as is well known meanwhile glaciers with an area of 1047 18 km2 and ice reserves of 52 43 km3 in the northern qilian mountains which only accounted for 1 2 of the total area in the upstream mountainous region and permafrost accounted only for 28 7 of the total area of the northern qilian mountains for the outlet runoff the local evaporation line lel is δd 6 51δ18o 4 39 r2 0 76 the intersection of the lel with the lmwl is at 8 5 for δ18o and 49 8 for δd of river water according to the altitude effect of δ18o for precipitation 0 18 100 m in the qilian mountains li et al 2016 the river water recharging is at an altitude of 3500 m in the upstream mountainous region again these characteristics indicate that the water resources are mainly from the upstream mountainous region based on the permafrost boundary in the qilian mountains at an altitude of 3600 m zhou et al 2000 the mountainous region can be divided into two belts the cryosphere belt above 3600 m and the vegetation belt between 2000 m and 3600 m the average δ18o of precipitation in the two belts is 8 95 and 6 67 respectively fig 5b our calculations indicate that water from the cryosphere belt accounts for 80 of the outlet runoff and the other 20 is water from the vegetation belt fig 5b overall it was found that the cryosphere belt accounts for 44 of the area of the upstream mountainous region but that it contributes to about 80 of the water resources in the qilian mountains and hexi corridor this outcome is attributable to high precipitation rapid infiltration and high runoff coefficient under high altitude low air temperature steep terrain and sparse vegetation it is known that precipitation tends to increase as altitude increases observations at the qilian mountains show that precipitation increases from 476 mm at an altitude of 2980 m to 842 mm at an altitude of 4166 m chen et al 2014 in contrast relatively lower evapotranspiration 452 6 mm occurs at high altitudes 4166 m than at lower altitudes yang et al 2017 therefore low evapotranspiration and high precipitation tend to generate runoff in the cryosphere belt the widely distributed glaciers and permafrost store solid water resources at the same time the active layers of the permafrost may increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff during precipitation events the intersections absorption and redistribution of precipitation in rock fragments affect the distribution pattern of precipitation runoff the characteristics of sparse protective vegetation coarse particle size of soil and high infiltration rates in the cryosphere belt are beneficial to the infiltration of glacier snow meltwater supra permafrost water and precipitation which then turn into groundwater and supply the outlet runoff li et al 2014a b 4 3 moisture recycling moisture recycling plays an important role in inland regions the analysis based on stable isotope tracing highlights that recycled moisture contributes 78 mm and 16 mm to the total precipitation from may to september in the upstream mountainous region and the middle downstream region respectively fig 8 in upstream mountainous regions the evaporation and transpiration fraction have contributed 23 mm and 55 mm to precipitation fig 8 which accounts for 8 and 16 of the total precipitation from may to september this is equivalent to 69 108 m3 water 4 6 times more than the average outlet runoff of the heihe river specifically moisture recycling contributes 3 mm 19 mm 27 mm 22 mm and 7 mm to the corresponding precipitation in may june july august and september respectively figs 9 and 10 in the middle downstream region the evaporation and transpiration fraction have contributed 5 mm and 11 mm respectively to the corresponding precipitation from may to september fig 8 this accounts for 5 and 9 of the total precipitation over this time period this value is equivalent to the total amount of condensing water used for desert vegetation during the growing season at the linze desert regarding the seasonal variation the contribution of moisture recycling increases starting in may and then decreases from the maximum in june and the corresponding precipitation is 1 mm 5 mm 4 mm 3 mm and 1 mm respectively figs 9 and 10 although the absolute contribution from moisture recycling to precipitation is relatively low it is significant for regional water resources and ecological protection in the inland region as is illustrated in figs 9 and 10 both the evaporation and transpiration fractions increase from lower altitudes to higher altitudes with a maximum in the southeastern region this trend occurs because the lower temperature and higher water vapor pressure in the qilian mountains is favorable to producing more precipitation and the strong evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation in the mountainous region provides abundant water vapor which promotes local moisture recycling this is consistent with the spatial pattern of the actual evapotranspiration fig 11 a this is because evapotranspiration is stronger in the moist forest meadow and grass of upstream mountainous regions than it is in the middle downstream region fig 11b these similar spatial patterns reflect the better vegetation cover and the stronger moisture recycling the regional average actual evapotranspiration is 113 mm between may and september it consists of 143 mm of evapotranspiration in the upstream mountainous region and 83 mm of evapotranspiration in the middle downstream region fig 11a the moisture recycling is sourced from the evapotranspiration so the ratio between the precipitation from moisture recycling and evapotranspiration can be defined as the local moisture recycling ratio the average local moisture recycling ratio is 46 in the study region the corresponding values in the mountainous region and the middle downstream region are 61 and 19 respectively this result also reflects the strong moisture recycling and the high efficiency of water vapor use in the mountainous region it can also be interpreted that the qilian mountains is the main water source for the hexi corridor 5 discussion 5 1 runoff and climate change in the upstream mountainous region the annual average temperature increased by 0 34 c 10a between 1961 and 2016 as shown in fig 12 over the same period the annual average precipitation increased by 14 7 mm 10a and the diurnal temperature range decreased by 0 14 c 10a under these warmer and wetter conditions the ice days and frost days significantly decreased by 3 3 d 10a and 3 9 d 10a respectively however the length of the growing season increased by 3 5d 10a these changes have caused a shortening of the freezing period and a lengthening of the ablation period moreover the area and volume of glaciers have decreased by 420 81 km2 20 88 and 21 63 km3 20 26 respectively in the past half century sun et al 2015a b in the qilian mountains the permafrost area is also in degradation it has decreased from 9 75 104 km2 in the 1970 s to 7 66 104 km2 in 2000 s chunling et al 2014 the accelerating decrease of the cryosphere and the increasing meltwater due to climate change has profound impacts on hydrological processes and the global water cycle huss and hock 2018 previous studies have quantified the contribution of glacier snow meltwater to runoff based on stable isotope tracing in single inland river basins or smaller basins for example kong and pang 2012 found that glacier snow meltwater accounted for 57 64 of river flow in the kumalak river sun et al 2015a illustrated that in 2012 the proportions of glacier snow meltwater in the stream flow was 14 7 in the urumqi river basin wang et al 2015 showed that the contributions of glacier snow meltwater and groundwater to the yushugou river in the tianshan mountains were 63 and 37 respectively in the aksu river 36 44 of the runoff was derived from glacier snow meltwater sun et al 2015b similarly in the tizinafu river the contribution of glacier snow meltwater to runoff was 43 fan et al 2015 in the tarim river basin the contribution of glacier snow meltwater to river runoff was approximately 41 5 during 1961 2006 gao et al 2010 and 23 for runoff in the juntanghu basin in the tianshan mountains wang and tang 2013 li et al 2014a b confirmed that about 32 of runoff in the hulugou small river basin in the central qilian mountains was sourced from cryosphere meltwater however bin et al 2014 found that snow meltwater contributed only 4 to the runoff in the dayekou small basin in the qilian mountains in the three inland rivers of the qilian mountains the cryosphere also accounted about 30 of the outlet runoff the annual average outlet runoff for inland rivers is increasing as precipitation increases and glaciers and permafrost degrade the runoff in shiyanghe river basin increased from 12 73 108 m3 during 1990 2002 to 15 56 108 m3 during 2003 2016 yuhong et al 2017 from 1945 to 2014 the annual average outlet runoff in the heihe river basin has progressively increased from 14 16 108 m3 in 1945 1949 to about 20 108 m3 in 2011 2014 cheng et al 2017 in the western branch of the heihe river basin the annual average outlet runoff of the taolaihe river basin increased by 1 37 m3 s from the 1990s to 2000s xu et al 2014 furthermore in the shulehe river basin the annual average outlet runoff increased by 0 91 108 m3 10a during 1958 2015 and increased from 12 95 108 m3 in 1990 to 16 97 108 m3 in 2010 yang et al 2017 5 2 groundwater in middle downstream region in the upstream mountainous region of inland river basins some groundwater and river water will have escaped as through faults concealed by unconsolidated sediments ma et al 2010 some of the infiltrated river and groundwater has overflowed as springs at the margins of alluvial fans the remaining infiltration recharged the groundwater in the middle stream however while the stable isotope values of modern direct precipitation recharge are close to those of the outlet runoff and groundwater in the upstream mountainous region the depleted stable isotope for groundwater suggests that there is no general relationship based on water balance calculations about 32 40 and 71 of outlet runoff has transformed into groundwater in the middle stream of the shiyanghe river basin heihe river basin and shulehe river basin respectively donglin and xiangyuan 2005 the downstream spring and lateral groundwater flow also have a similar isotopic composition to the groundwater in the middle stream due to the common recharge sources which have been the main supply for groundwater in the downstream inland river basin wang and tang 2013 this has accounted for 68 46 and 84 of groundwater downstream of the shiyanghe river basin the heihe river basin and the shulehe river basin respectively donglin and xiangyuan 2005 the groundwater in the middle downstream region is also recharged by surface water via river infiltration canal system seepage and farmland irrigation water seepage ma et al 2005 these can also be verified by the clustering distribution in lwml between river and groundwater fig 3b notably for some deep groundwater when the well depth is 150 m the mean values of δ18o and δd in the deep aquifers beneath the jinchang and minqin basins are lower by 1 5 and 18 8 respectively compared with the values of shallow groundwater in the basin zhu et al 2007 these results along with lower 14c or undetected 3h concentrations indicate that the majority of the deep groundwater is principally maintained by paleo water rather than modern recharge zhu et al 2008 the results from a series of studies in the hexi corridor chen et al 2003 edmunds et al 2006 and also downstream wu et al 2001 chen et al 2006 zhu et al 2008 ruan et al 2015 in the badain jaran desert zhao et al 2011 and in the zhangye basin of heihe river basin zhang et al 2005 zhu et al 2008 ruan et al 2015 all showed that the major body of deep groundwater is late pleistocene in age apart from a small proportion which is marginally recharged by modern river runoff 5 3 moisture recycling and climate change with warming due to climate change the strong evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation in the mountainous region provides abundant water vapors which promote local moisture recycling the potential evapotranspiration has increased by 9 11 mm 10a during the past 60 years with the average value of 1100 mm in the heihe river basin wang et al 2017 in the shiyanghe river basin the referenced evapotranspiration increased by 5 2 mm 10a with an average value of 950 mm during 1959 2011 chunling et al 2014 in the shulehe river basin the average potential evapotranspiration was 920 6 mm with an increasing trend of 9 8 mm 10a during 1961 2011 jinkui et al 2013 field observations also confirmed the strengthening evapotranspiration the daily average grassland evapotranspiration was 2 6 mm from july to august of 2015 in the mountainous region wang et al 2016a b and the total evapotranspiration at the grassland spots was 439 9 mm for a whole year at an altitude of 3000 m li et al 2013 yang et al 2013 in the middle stream of the heihe river basin when the average temperature rises by 1 c in the linze oasis the referenced crop evapotranspiration increases by 0 11 mm wang and tang 2013 upstream of the shiyanghe river basin the transpiration fraction ranged from 0 to 6 3 mm d whilst the evaporation fraction ranged from 0 to 4 3 mm d at an altitude of 4200 m in shulehe river basin the total evapotranspiration was 238 3 mm between may 22nd and september 22nd 2013 li et al 2016 as well as strengthening evapotranspiration good vegetation cover also promotes moisture recycling chen et al 2015 found that the vegetation ndvi has generally increased during 1982 2014 in the qilian mountains the largest increase occurred in summer followed by autumn and spring the vegetation cover increased as a whole in recent years the increasing area is the largest in summer with a cover of 91 669 km2 accounting for 48 7 of the area in the qilian mountains zhengli et al 2015 the inter annual variation of the start dates of the growing season in the qilian mountains shows that it has been moving earlier at a rate of 0 44d 10a during 1982 2010 zhou et al 2013 the vegetation cover has been increasing rapidly in the upstream mountainous region and remaining steady in the middle downstream of the shulehe river basin during 2000 2014 jinghui et al 2016 the ndvi of the shiyanghe river basin has also showed an increase from 1999 to 2010 and the area of vegetation restoration was far greater than the area of vegetation degeneration xing et al 2013 oases are a type of medium or small non zonal landscape which is supported by natural or artificial rivers in a desert in general the widely distributed oases are considered to greatly influence the local climate there is an increase in precipitation and water vapor as well as a decrease of air temperature and a reduction in the diurnal temperature range within an oasis furthermore there is a cooling effect due to extensive evapotranspiration of vegetation in oases comparing to the surroundings lv et al 2004 in the hexi corridor the oasis area increased by 14 8 and by an area of 19 233 km2 from 1975 to 2010 zhang et al 2015 the jinta oasis area increased by 167 37 km2 from 1963 to 2009 and the ejina oasis area increased by 87 05 from 1963 to 2012 yaowen et al 2014 the zhangye oasis area of the heihe river basin increased from 545 9 km2 in 2001 to 721 6 km2 in 2010 jun et al 2012 the oasis area of the shiyanghe river basin increased from 7131 56 km2 in 2000 to 7459 43 km2 in 2010 xing et al 2013 zhenzhen et al 2016 found that the oasis area of the shulehe river basin also increased by 937 85 km2 during 1997 2011 it is interesting to note that the contribution rate of moisture recycling to precipitation had a statistical positive correlation with the size of oasis areas fig 13 this reflects the strong evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation for large oases 5 4 implications for water management in recent decades water saving measures have been adopted extensively in inland regions of china however the issue of water shortage is still becoming increasingly serious mainly due to population increase therefore it is critical to ensure a reliable water supply in inland river basins the water from the cryosphere belt has accounted for 80 of outlet runoff therefore water resource security is mainly focused on the cryosphere belt in inland river basins ecological conservation of the cryosphere belt with its high precipitation low evapotranspiration and high runoff coefficient is a key element of local water resource security in inland regions moisture recycling accounts for 24 of precipitation in mountainous regions it is noted that this ratio of contribution rate is similar to that obtained by other studies for example the contribution of the evaporation from a large surface water body to local precipitation is 28 31 in the nam co basin of china xu et al 2011 23 in the qinghai lake basin of china cui and li 2015 16 50 in ihorty lake of madagascar vallet coulomb et al 2008 10 20 in kasumigaura lake of japan yamanaka and shimizu 2007 10 18 in michigan lake bowen et al 2012 and 5 16 in the north american great lakes gat et al 1994 these results reflect moisture recycling the ability of water resources to renew is especially strong in upstream mountainous region which is an important part of local water resource security in inland regions the significance of moisture recycling to regional water resources highlights the importance of ecological conservation in upstream mountainous regions the conservation in upstream regions should be coupled with the rational use of water resources in the middle downstream portion of inland river basins these would be the most effective strategies for providing a reliable water supply in inland regions of china 6 conclusions based on stable isotope tracing this paper illustrates three prominent features of water cycles in inland regions firstly water transformations are frequent upstream of inland river basins glacier snow meltwater transforms into groundwater at the periglacial belt and supra permafrost water transforms into river water at the permafrost region there is also transformation between groundwater and river water at the vegetation belt in the water formation region precipitation glacier snow meltwater and supra permafrost water firstly transform into groundwater and then supply the river runoff in upstream mountainous regions there is some escape of groundwater and river water which has provided the main supply of groundwater in the middle streams further downstream the spring and lateral groundwater flow is also sourced from the groundwater in the middle stream in addition the groundwater is recharged by surface water via river infiltration canal system seepage and farmland irrigation water seepage in oases regions secondly cryosphere meltwater plays an important role in inland river basins as the climate has become warmer and wetter in recent decades the average annual outlet runoff has increased glacier snow meltwater and supra permafrost water have accounted for approximately 8 and 22 of the outlet runoff respectively the cryosphere belt accounts for 44 of the area of upstream mountainous regions but it contributes about 80 of water resources under high altitude low air temperature steep terrain and sparse vegetation conditions furthermore the widely distributed glaciers and permafrost store solid water resources the active layers of permafrost may increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff during precipitation events and the intersections absorption and redistribution of precipitation in rock fragments also affect the hydrological process thirdly local moisture recycling makes a considerable contribution to precipitation moisture recycling in mountainous regions and in the middle downstream region accounts for 24 and 14 of precipitation during may september respectively it has contributed 78 mm to the precipitation upstream of the three inland rivers equivalent to 69 108 m3 water and 4 6 times more than the outlet runoff in the heihe river the contribution is 16 mm in the middle downstream region which is equivalent to the total condensing water used for desert vegetation in the growing season at the linze desert with warming due to climate change strong evapotranspiration and good vegetation cover in upstream mountainous regions would promote local moisture recycling the conservation of upstream regions should be coupled with the rational use of water resources in middle downstream portions of inland river basins these would be the most effective strategies for providing a reliable water

al 2011 kong et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to correct the measured δ18o and δd in precipitation under the effect of sub cloud evaporation when estimating the recycling fractions kong et al 2013 and froehlich et al 2008 confirmed that the δ18o and δd of precipitation in the cloud base can be determined by 5 i f 1 i γ i α f i β 1 where i is 18 18o and 2 2h and the equilibrium fraction factor for δ18o and δd is ɑ which can be dominated by the condensation temperature and can be calculated by 6 103lnα18ow v 1 137 106 t2 0 4156 103 t 2 0667 7 103lnα2hw v 24 844 106 t2 76 248 103 t 52 612 where t is the average temperature the β and γ are estimated by 8 β i 1 α i d d n 1 h α i d d n 1 h 9 γ i α i h 1 α i d d n 1 h where f is the remaining fraction of the water drop mass which depends on the initial radius rin evaporation rate vevap and fall time of the drop t the parameter h is the relative humidity d and d are the diffusion constants of 1h2h16o 1h1h18o and 1h1h16o in air and the ratio of d d is 1 024 1 0289 the evaporation rate vevap of falling drops can be calculated by 10 v evap 4 π a d 1 fa s ρ a ρ b where s represents the effective thickness of a shell around the drop a is the radius of falling drops ρa and ρb are densities at the surface of the falling drop and in the ambient air respectively and f is a dimensionless quantity that measures the actual heat of moisture exchange the part of eq d ρ a ρ b can be dominated by humidity and temperature and the part of eq 5 4 π a 1 fa s is mainly determined by the drop size and ambient temperature so the calculation of these two factors needs information on temperature drop size and humidity the falling time of the water drop would be estimated by falling velocity v and the distance between ground and cloud base the falling velocity can be calculated by the following relationship 11 v 9 58 1 exp r 0 885 1 147 where r is the water drop radius assuming that precipitation forms close to the average cloud base level corresponding to the 850 hpa so the falling time of the water drop would be estimated based on meteorological data the effect of subcloud evaporation can then be determined 2 δ18o and δd of atmospheric water vapor based on precipitation isotopes the δ18o and δd for atmospheric water vapor can be estimated by the following method gibson and reid 2014 12 δ a δ p k ε 1 10 3 k ε where δa is isotopic compositions in atmospheric water vapor and δp is isotopic compositions in precipitation at the cloud base k is the adjusting parameter and ɛ is the equilibrium fractionation factor

stable isotope values of river water resevitor water and spring water samples was confirmed and then calculations were repeated using k between 0 6 and 1 0 with step width of 0 0001 the final value of k was determined when the difference between slel and the measured lel slope was the lowest or k reached the boundary values 0 6 and 1 0 more details about the calculations were described by skrzypek et al 2015 the measured lel can be calculated as 16 s lel h 10 3 18 ε h 2 δ a 2 δ p 2 ε 1 10 3 2 δ p h 10 3 2 ε h 18 δ a 18 δ p 18 ε 1 10 3 18 δ p where h is relative humidity and ɛ is the total fractionation factor defined as 17 ε ε α ε k where kinetic fractionation factor ɛk is calculated as 18 ε k 1 h θ n c d where the weighting value θ for small water body evaporation flux does not influence ambient humidity is 1 and for larger water body like the great lakes and the mediterranean sea is 0 5 the value n for a stable layer like soil and leaf cover is 1 and for a large open water body is 0 5 the values of cd are 25 1 for hydrogen and 28 5 for oxygen respectively araguas araguas et al 2000 as suggested by skrzypek et al 2015 the values of h and n were both set to 1 3 δ18o and δd of advection water vapor to estimate the isotope ratios in advection water vapor δadv from upwind site to downwind site when vapor isotopes show a depleting trend along the transportation path and isotopic fractionation was assumed to be due to rayleigh distillation 19 δ adv δ up a α 1 i n f where δup a is the isotope ratios in advection water vapor at upwind site α is equilibrium fractionation factor and f is a ratio between final and initial vapor which can be calculated by the value of surface vapor pressure at sampling station 4 δ18o and δd of soil evaporation water vapor using the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 theδd and δ18o of the soil evaporation water vapor can be calculated by 20 δ ev δ s α h δ a ε 1 h ε k where ev sand a are the isotopic composition of soil evaporation water vapor soil water and atmospheric water vapor other parameters are the same as in the equations above the kinetic fraction factor αk for oxygen 18 18αk and for deuterium 2αk can be estimated by froehlich et al 2008 21 2αk 1 0 024n 22 18αk 1 0 0289n with n 0 58 5 δ18o and δd of vegetation transpiration water vapor according to previous work by li et al 2016 there is no isotope

6688,global climate models gcms produce informative seasonal forecasts of global precipitation months ahead of the occurrence for hydrological forecasting meanwhile the skill of gcm forecasts varies by location and initialization time in this paper we investigate the anomaly correlation which indicates the correspondence between forecasts and observations for 10 sets of global precipitation forecasts in the north american multi model ensemble nmme project we propose to use principal component analysis to characterize the variation of anomaly correlation we identify the existence of spatial and temporal patterns at the global scale the spatial pattern reveals that high low anomaly correlation at one initialization time coincides with high low anomaly correlation at other initialization times in other words for a grid cell the anomaly correlation at different initialization times tends to be similarly high or low it is observed that some of the regions where grid cells are with overall high anomaly correlation tend to exhibit tele connections with global climate drivers on the other hand the temporal pattern suggests that the anomaly correlation tends to improve with initialization time this pattern is attributable to data assimilation that bases forecasts at a later initialization time on more global observations and simulations generally the two patterns are effective and explain 50 to 70 of the variation of anomaly correlation for the 10 sets of nmme forecasts the projections of anomaly correlation vectors onto the two patterns help illustrate where

correlation between cpc cmap observations and nmme forecasts in the hindcast period from 1982 to 2010 is calculated 3 methods 3 1 formulation of anomaly correlation each of the 10 sets of nmme forecasts has five dimensions namely latitude longitude initialization time lead time and ensemble member the cpc cmap observations have three dimensions which are latitude longitude and time in this paper the focus is on the nmme seasonal forecasts initialized in january february march april may and june specifically the forecasts targeting at the total precipitation in the three months of june july and august are investigated in the northern hemisphere the three targeted months generally comprise the summer when floods and droughts are of concern e g yuan and wood 2013 emerton et al 2017 in the southern hemisphere they are winter months when floods and droughts occur under the mediterranean climate bennett et al 2017 the anomaly correlation between raw ensemble means and observations is calculated that is the anomaly correlation is obtained for forecasts initialized from january to june for each grid cell the six anomaly correlation coefficients are formulated as a vector 1 r c r c 1 r c 2 r c 3 r c 4 r c 5 r c 6 it is worthwhile to note the dimensions considered in eq 1 first of all the subscript c is the index of grid cell it accounts for the first two dimensions i e latitude and longitude of gcm forecasts the value of c ranges from 1 to 16 643 because 16 643 grid cells of land surface locate between 60 s and 80 n secondly the script m in r c m represents the third dimension of initialization time i e m 1 2 3 4 5 6 as the targeted months are fixed m also indicates the fourth dimension of lead time that is the lead time is reduced from 5 months to 0 month as m progresses from january to june finally the fifth dimension of the ensemble member is eliminated because the anomaly correlation is calculated for the ensemble mean in eq 1 the vector r c formulates the anomaly correlation at 6 initialization times at grid cell c the anomaly correlation vectors are obtained for each set of nmme forecasts the 10 sets of anomaly correlation vectors lay the basis for the investigation of spatial and temporal patterns following the mathematical formulations of pca hotelling 1933 demsar et al 2013 the variation of r c is calculated as the sum of the squared anomaly correlation 2 va r c r c 2 r c r c t m 1 6 r c m 2 the variation across the globe is calculated based on eq 2 3 va r total c 1 16643 va r c c 1 16643 r c 2 c 1 16643 m 1 6 r c m 2 in this way the variation of anomaly correlation with initialization time across the globe is quantified 3 2 variation of anomaly correlation pca is a data driven approach that has been widely used to analyze linear dependency relationships among a group of variables hotelling 1933 demsar et al 2013 in this paper pca is applied to anomaly correlation at different initialization times the core of pca is a set of eigenvectors v n n 1 2 3 4 5 6 which are unit vectors orthogonal to one another that is 4 v n 1 v n 2 t 1 n 1 n 2 0 n 1 n 2 the anomaly correlation vectors r c c 1 2 16 643 are projected onto the space of the eigenvectors using the mathematical operation of inner product 5 r c n 1 6 v c n v n v c n r c v n t where v c n is the projection of r c onto v n the variation at grid cell c is re calculated with eq 5 i e 6 va r c r c 2 n 1 1 6 n 2 1 6 v c n 1 v n 1 v n 2 t v c n 2 the above eq 6 is simplified using eq 4 7 va r c r c 2 n 1 6 v c n 2 as is illustrated pca retains the variation of the anomaly correlation at grid cell c specifically 8 va r c m 1 6 r c m 2 n 1 6 v c n 2 the above equation also indicates that pca preserves the variation of anomaly correlation across the globe 9 va r total c 1 16643 r c 2 c 1 16643 n 1 6 v c n 2 n 1 6 c 1 16643 v c n 2 where c 1 16643 v c n 2 is the variation explained by the n th eigenvector v n based on linear algebraic operations pca makes v 1 the most effective and explain the most variation of anomaly correlation v 2 the second most effective and explain the second most variation and so on 10 c 1 16643 v c 1 2 c 1 16643 v c 2 2 c 1 16643 v c 3 2 c 1 16643 v c 4 2 c 1 16643 v c 5 2 c 1 16643 v c 6 2 therefore the effectiveness of vn is measured by the percentage of variation explained by this eigenvector 11 v n 100 c 1 16643 v c n 2 va r total n 1 2 3 4 5 6 the eigenvectors determined by pca are wholly driven by the anomaly correlation vectors from this perspective pca facilitates an objective examination of the variation of anomaly correlation according to the formulations the first and second eigenvectors v 1 and v 2 are respectively the most and second most effective in characterizing how r c 1 r c 2 r c 3 r c 4 r c 5 r c 6 correlate with one another across the 16 643 grid cells in the analysis the attention is paid to these two eigenvectors when deriving v 1 and v 2 their sampling uncertainty is also assessed it is through bootstrapping specifically the 16 643 anomaly correlation vectors are sampled randomly with replacement for 1000 times the first and second eigenvectors in the 1000 rounds of sampling are saved the 1000 sets of eigenvectors tell how the eigenvectors are varying subject to the sampling variability of anomaly correlation vectors by pooling the eigenvectors the 10th 25th 75th and 90th percentiles are obtained respectively for v 1 and v 2 then the 50 and 80 uncertainty intervals of the eigenvectors are determined the uncertainty intervals show whether the relationships among r c 1 r c 2 r c 3 r c 4 r c 5 r c 6 as are characterized by v 1 and v 2 are robust 3 3 spatial and temporal patterns this paper focuses on the variation of anomaly correlation between nmme forecasts and observations in an investigation of nmme forecasts of summer precipitation in china zhao et al 2018 observed two patterns spatial and temporal of the anomaly correlation this paper examines the two patterns at a global scale and verifies them objectively using the eigenvectors of pca the spatial pattern suggests that the anomaly correlation at different initialization times tends to be at the same level it is formulated as follows 12 p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 from a mathematical perspective this pattern means that for certain grid cells high low anomaly correlation at one initialization time coincides with high low anomaly correlation at other initialization times the temporal pattern suggests that the anomaly correlation improves linearly with initialization time the formulation is shown below 13 p 2 5 3 1 1 3 5 5 2 3 2 1 2 1 2 3 2 5 2 the indication of the temporal pattern is that the anomaly correlation at a later initialization time tends to be higher the two patterns are unit vectors orthogonal to each other this feature follows the definition of eigenvectors in pca p 1 and p 2 facilitate spatial and temporal projections respectively to investigate the properties of anomaly correlation vectors the projections of the anomaly correlation vector onto the two patterns are obtained using inner product hotelling 1933 demsar et al 2013 14 p c 1 r c p 1 t p c 2 r c p 2 t where pc i i 1 2 is the projection of r c onto p i in the meantime the projections allow the quantification of the effectiveness of the two patterns for all grid cells across the globe the effectiveness is measured by the percentage of variation explained by the patterns 15 p 1 100 c 1 16643 p c 1 2 va r total p 2 100 c 1 16643 p c 2 2 va r total an illustrative example is presented for the mathematical projection supposing an anomaly correlation vector is as follows 16 r c 0 25 0 35 0 45 0 55 0 65 0 75 in this case the anomaly correlation vector has two nice properties first of all it is positive at the six initialization times the positive anomaly correlation means that high low values of forecasts correspond to high low values of observations secondly the correlation linearly increases from january to june that is the correspondence between forecasts and observations improves steadily with initialization time using eq 14 the projections of r c onto p 1 and p 2 are obtained 17 p c 1 r c p 1 t 1 225 p c 2 r c p 2 t 0 418 further 18 r c 1 225 p 1 0 418 p 2 the above equation can be verified using the values in eq 16 eq 12 and eq 13 in the meantime the fact that pca preserves the variation of anomaly correlation can also be verified 19 r c 2 0 25 2 0 35 2 0 45 2 0 55 2 0 65 2 0 75 2 1 675 r c 2 1 225 2 0 418 2 1 675 with eq 19 the percentage of variation of r c explained by the first and second pattern is quantified 20 p 1 100 1 225 2 1 675 89 6 p 2 100 0 418 2 1 675 10 4 the example in eqs 16 20 is hypothetical with the variation of r c wholly explained by the two patterns for nmme forecasts the variation of anomaly correlation is far more complex the anomaly correlation can be negative and it can change drastically with initialization time as a result the anomaly correlation vector of nmme forecasts can be projected onto not only the spatial and temporal patterns but also other directions in the following the spatial and temporal patterns are used as exploratory tools to handle the variation of anomaly correlation the existence and effectiveness of the two patterns are verified by pca 4 results 4 1 spatial temporal variation of anomaly correlation the anomaly correlation measures the correspondence between forecasts and observations it is one of the most popular measures of the skill of gcm forecasts e g merryfield et al 2013 saha et al 2014 jia et al 2015 for cfsv2 seasonal forecasts initialized in january february march april may and june the anomaly correlation is shown by month in fig 1 in this figure the red blue color scheme represents the value of anomaly correlation many instances of red pixels that indicate high positive correlation exist forecasts are informative in these cases that is large values of forecasts correspond to large values of observations and small values of forecasts coincide with small values of observations however blue pixels that represent negative correlation also exist they imply that large small values of forecasts tend to correspond to small large values of observations in those cases forecasts are generally non informative given the variation of anomaly correlation from january to june users of the forecasts would look for regions where clusters of red pixels exist the regions with good anomaly correlation persistently high across the six initialization times or steadily improving with initialization time would be of particular interest taking a close look at fig 1 clusters of red pixels can be seen for example in the northwest united states north brazil southeast asia and east australia however over these regions the spatial extents of the clustered red pixels tend to change from month to month in some regions such as siberia and north canada clusters of red pixels are even scattered and surrounded by blue pixels overall it is none too easy for users to identify regions with good anomaly correlation this outcome implies the complexity of the predictive performance of gcm forecasts it also calls for exploratory mathematical tools to deal with the variation of anomaly correlation 4 2 existence of spatial and temporal patterns while the spatial temporal variation is highlighted in fig 1 the temporal variation is further detailed in fig 2 for the 16 643 grid cells under investigation the anomaly correlation is plotted against initialization time in the upper parts of fig 2 each colored thin line is for one grid cell the anomaly correlation is observed to vary drastically with initialization time in addition the anomaly correlation falls below zero in many instances pca is employed to handle the variation of anomaly correlation with initialization time across the 16 643 grid cells in pca the eigenvectors tell how the anomaly correlation in january february and june relate to one another the blue dashed lines in the left and right hand sides of fig 2 respectively show the first and second eigenvectors from pca the eigenvectors yield insights into the spatial temporal variation the first eigenvector has similar loadings on the six initialization times the indication is that the anomaly correlation tends to be at a similar level in other words for a grid cell the anomaly correlation at different initialization times can be similarly high or low quantitatively this eigenvector explains 57 2 of the variation of anomaly correlation for cfsv2 forecasts the message is that the variation of anomaly correlation as is shown in fig 1 is largely spatial this result can to some extent be observed in the subplots of fig 1 for example in australia high correlation can generally be observed in the eastern and western parts of the country from january to june by contrast the correlation appears to be always low in the middle part of the country the loadings of the second eigenvector tend to increase from january to june this result implies the temporal improvement of anomaly correlation with initialization time on the other hand the temporal improvement is more difficult to be observed than the spatial difference this outcome is in accordance with the fact that the second eigenvector is not as prominent as the first one and explains 12 7 of the variation nevertheless the cumulative improvements can be observed globally in fig 1 the anomaly correlation exhibits more instances of red pixels in june than in january the first and second eigenvectors are respectively illustrated with the spatial and temporal patterns in fig 2 the similarity of the eigenvectors to the patterns highlights the existence of the conceptual patterns zhao et al 2018 at the global scale furthermore the persistence of the patterns is evaluated by bootstrapping i e sampling the anomaly correlation vectors randomly with replacement for 1000 times the 50 and 80 uncertainty intervals of the eigenvectors are shown in the lower part of fig 2 it can be observed that the intervals are very narrow therefore it is concluded that the sampling variability of anomaly correlation vectors across the globe has a very small impact on the eigenvectors in other words the patterns as are indicated by the eigenvectors are robust this result is attributed to the large sample size i e 16 643 anomaly correlation vectors are employed to derive the eigenvectors 4 3 projection onto the spatial pattern as the existence of spatial pattern has been verified by pca the anomaly correlation vectors are projected onto the spatial pattern as shown in fig 3 this figure uses a red blue scheme which is slightly different from the color scheme of fig 1 to represent the value of the projection while the spatial temporal variation complicates the analysis of anomaly correlation the projection yields insights into the variation the projection onto the spatial pattern helps locate the regions where forecasts tend to be highly correlated with observations across the six initialization times in fig 3 the projection is high in the northwest united states north brazil southeast asia and eastern and western australia based on fig 1 it can be observed that these regions tend to exhibit high positive anomaly correlation from january to june the projection also suggests that the anomaly correlation tends to be high in southern europe north africa and south africa therein clusters of red pixels can also be seen in fig 1 it is noted that some of the regions with overall high anomaly correlation were shown to exhibit hydro climatic tele connections by previous studies for example el niño southern oscillation and pacific decadal oscillation are observed to impact northwest united states and have been incorporated into seasonal hydro climatic forecasting since the 1990s hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 also el niño southern oscillation is shown to affect the precipitation in north brazil southeast asia and eastern and western australia emerton et al 2017 dai and wigley 2000 on the other hand the projection is negative in north asia and north canada fig 3 this result is in accordance with the low and negative anomaly correlation across six initialization times therein fig 1 the overall low anomaly correlation in some regions suggests that gcms are not yet perfect and can have limitations for example the anomaly correlation in the great lakes region in the northeast united states and southeast canada is not satisfactory for cfsv2 forecasts it is also deemed to be unsatisfactory for the other 9 sets of nmme forecasts under investigation supplementary material this outcome can be due to that the great lakes considerably influence the surrounding climate but the resolution of gcms is too coarse to realistically account for the impacts of the great lakes gula and peltier 2012 4 4 projection onto the temporal pattern the projection to the temporal pattern is illustrated in fig 4 unfortunately the temporal projection is no longer high in northwest united states north brazil southeast asia and east australia where the spatial projection is prominently high the implication is that though forecasts are overall skillful in these regions they would not necessarily become increasingly more skillful as initialization time progresses on the other hand the projection is high in part of north asia and north canada this result suggests that the anomaly correlation tends to improve with initialization time therein the temporal pattern is meant to reflect the temporal improvement of anomaly correlation the improvement is generally attributable to data assimilation systems in gcms bauer et al 2015 specifically more observations as well as model simulations become available as initialization time progresses the information is assimilated into the gcm forecasting process conceptually forecasts at a later initialization time are based on more information from this perspective the anomaly correlation is expected to increase with initialization time which would contribute to the effectiveness of the temporal pattern in explaining the variation however the anomaly correlation turns out to change drastically with initialization time in many cases there is thus a gap between the conceptual improvement and the actual drastic changes this gap implies the difficulty of assimilating information from multiple sources at a global scale merryfield et al 2013 saha et al 2014 jia et al 2015 nevertheless the existence of the temporal pattern does suggest that data assimilation works as assimilation algorithms become more efficient the temporal pattern is expected to be more effective 4 5 results for 10 sets of nmme forecasts the variation of anomaly correlation has been investigated for all the 10 sets of nmme forecasts please refer to the supplementary material for the details the 10 first and second eigenvectors are obtained and their effectiveness is evaluated in fig 5 a and b the two patterns are illustrated with the first two eigenvectors it can be observed that the spatial and temporal patterns are respectively similar to the first and second eigenvectors for all the 10 sets of forecasts in nmme this result highlights the existence of the spatial and temporal patterns at the global scale the percentage of the variation of anomaly correlation explained by the patterns and the eigenvectors is quantified and shown by bar plots in fig 5c the spatial pattern explains 56 6 of the variation for cfsv2 38 8 for cancm3 48 3 for cancm4 39 2 for ccsm3 50 6 for ccsm4 50 2 for cm2p1 54 1 for cm2p1 aer04 52 0 for flor a06 50 9 for flor b01 and 52 8 for cesm1 the temporal pattern is not as prominent it explains 12 8 of the variation for cfsv2 14 6 for cancm3 13 5 for cancm4 15 1 for ccsm3 11 6 for ccsm4 13 2 for cm2p1 11 5 for cm2p1 aer04 12 5 for flor a06 13 3 for flor b01 and 11 1 for cesm1 the stacked bar charts in fig 5c indicate that the two patterns and the first two eigenvectors are similar not only in the loadings on the 6 initialization times fig 5a and b but also in the effectiveness in explaining the variation of anomaly correlation furthermore the percentage of explained variation is plotted against the average variation for the 10 sets of forecasts in fig 6 for cmc1 cancm3 and cmc2 cancm4 the respective average variations are 0 265 and 0 278 and the respective percentages of explained variations are 53 4 and 61 8 for cola rsmas ccsm3 and cola rsmas ccsm4 the respective average variations are 0 251 and 0 288 and the respective percentages of explained variations are 54 3 and 62 2 the upgrades in the gcms appear to contribute to the variation of anomaly correlation also they tend to contribute to the effectiveness of the two patterns in explaining the variation for the 10 sets of nmme forecasts a linear relationship exists between the average variation and the percentage of explained variation the correlation coefficient is as high as 0 94 for fig 6 it is noted that the dot in the top right corner is for cfsv2 forecasts in other words among the 10 sets of forecasts cfsv2 forecasts exhibit the highest average variation and are with the highest percentage of variation explained by the spatial and temporal patterns this result is in accordance with a previous finding that cfsv2 overall exhibits the highest anomaly correlation skill in nmme kirtman et al 2014 despite this result it is noted that in some regions e g north asia and north canada cfsv2 can still be outperformed by other gcms in terms of the spatial and temporal projections supplementary material this outcome highlights that besides global investigation it is also important to consider regional difference of predictive performance for the use of gcm forecasts the spatial and temporal patterns can serve as exploratory tools to investigate the predictive performance at both global and regional scales 5 discussion this paper has investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of anomaly correlation for 10 sets of nmme seasonal forecasts overall the two patterns are effective and explain 50 to 70 of the variation of anomaly correlation in this paper the analysis of the patterns is conducted by characterizing anomaly correlation at a single grid cell as a vector and pooling vectors across the grid cells the mathematical formulations are demonstrated to be effective in addressing the variation of anomaly correlation at the global scale flexibility is an advantage of this approach while it is applied to anomaly correlation it is applicable to other measures of predictive performance such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error computational efficiency is another advantage pca and the related projections rely on linear algebraic operations hotelling 1933 demsar et al 2013 they can be adapted to handle large datasets for example forecasts produced by regional climate models rcms and numerical weather predictions nwps that have higher spatial resolutions and are more frequently initialized the projections of the anomaly correlation vectors onto the spatial and temporal patterns yield insights into the use of gcm forecasts for regions with positive projection onto the spatial pattern the anomaly correlation tends to be at a high level in january february and june for these regions hydrological forecasting systems can be developed to leverage gcm forecasts to predict streamflow months ahead hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 emerton et al 2017 lehner et al 2017 for regions with positive projection onto the temporal pattern the anomaly correlation tends to steadily improve from january to june for those regions it is important to incorporate timely updated gcm forecasts into hydrological forecasting schepen and wang 2014 bennett et al 2017 on the other hand there exist regions with low projections onto the spatial and temporal patterns the implication is that the anomaly correlation of gcm forecasts is neither high at the six initialization times nor improve with initialization time therein hydrological forecasting may need to seek information other than gcm forecasts such as rcm forecasts and nwps 6 conclusions gcms produce informative seasonal forecasts of global precipitation months ahead of its occurrence in this paper we propose two patterns to characterize the predictive performance as is indicated by anomaly correlation of gcm forecasts of global precipitation the projections of anomaly correlation vectors onto the two patterns help illustrate where and when the gcm precipitation forecasts are skillful the spatial pattern locates where high low anomaly correlation at one initialization time coincides with high low anomaly correlation at other initialization times the temporal pattern tells how anomaly correlation improves with initialization time overall the two patterns explain 50 to 70 of the variation of anomaly correlation for the 10 sets of nmme seasonal forecasts of global precipitation in june july and august future studies can analyze gcm forecasts for other seasons and apply the spatial and temporal patterns to investigate the predictive performance apart from precipitation gcms also produce forecasts of other climate variables of interest such as temperature wind speed and solar radiation in the future efforts can be devoted to investigating the patterns for more variables and

6688,global climate models gcms produce informative seasonal forecasts of global precipitation months ahead of the occurrence for hydrological forecasting meanwhile the skill of gcm forecasts varies by location and initialization time in this paper we investigate the anomaly correlation which indicates the correspondence between forecasts and observations for 10 sets of global precipitation forecasts in the north american multi model ensemble nmme project we propose to use principal component analysis to characterize the variation of anomaly correlation we identify the existence of spatial and temporal patterns at the global scale the spatial pattern reveals that high low anomaly correlation at one initialization time coincides with high low anomaly correlation at other initialization times in other words for a grid cell the anomaly correlation at different initialization times tends to be similarly high or low it is observed that some of the regions where grid cells are with overall high anomaly correlation tend to exhibit tele connections with global climate drivers on the other hand the temporal pattern suggests that the anomaly correlation tends to improve with initialization time this pattern is attributable to data assimilation that bases forecasts at a later initialization time on more global observations and simulations generally the two patterns are effective and explain 50 to 70 of the variation of anomaly correlation for the 10 sets of nmme forecasts the projections of anomaly correlation vectors onto the two patterns help illustrate where and when the nmme precipitation forecasts are skillful keywords global climate model seasonal forecasts precipitation anomaly correlation north american multi model ensemble 1 introduction global climate models gcms that formulate land ocean atmosphere processes to predict climate around the world are run by major climate centers to provide operational forecasts merryfield et al 2013 saha et

their predictive performance is elusive as it varies spatially and temporally wilks and hamill 2007 yuan et al 2011 kim et al 2012 luo et al 2013 saha et al 2014 for gridded gcm precipitation forecasts the variation means that the performance changes by grid cell and that for one grid cell the performance differs by initialization time zhao et al 2017a b spatial averaging at catchment and region levels is used to deal with the variation e g ma et al 2016 mcevoy et al 2016 slater et al 2016 schepen et al 2018 and to facilitate more efficient use of gcm forecasts lots of efforts are

slater et al 2017 on the other hand it is still largely unknown whether general patterns exist in the spatially and temporally varying predictive performance for regions with skillful gcm forecasts do forecasts improve steadily with initialization time for regions with poor forecasts is forecast skill always unsatisfactory these issues have useful implications for hydrological forecasting and are yet to be addressed in this paper we aim to identify patterns to characterize the variation of anomaly correlation a widely used measure of forecast skill e g yuan et al 2011 luo et al 2013 becker et al 2014 barnston and lyon 2016 ma et al 2016 of gcm seasonal forecasts of global precipitation the objectives are threefold 1 to show patterns of the spatially and temporally varying anomaly correlation at the global scale we retrieve the retrospective forecasts i e hindcasts of 10 gcms in nmme and conduct principal component analysis pca 2 to quantify the variation explained by the patterns the quantification is achieved by formulating anomaly correlation at different initialization times as a vector and projecting vectors across grid cells onto the patterns and 3 to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the patterns for the 10 sets of forecasts as will be demonstrated later in this paper the proposed patterns are effective and explain 50 to 70 of the variation of anomaly correlation globally 2 data the nmme retrospective forecasts are obtained from the data library of the international research institute iri at columbia university https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources models nmme the gcms were originally run at different spatial resolutions and time steps in nmme their forecasts have been re gridded and aggregated to form a consistent gridded dataset specifically the spatial resolution of the nmme forecasts is 1 by 1 and the temporal resolution is 1 month the data preprocessing facilitates efficient inter comparison of results for different sets of forecasts e g kirtman et al 2014 ma et al 2016 shukla et al 2016 slater et al 2016 2017 basic information such as the number of ensemble members and the range of lead times on the nmme forecasts are summarized in table 1 the climate prediction center s merged analysis of precipitation cpc cmap corresponding to the forecasts is also obtained from the iri s data library https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources models nmme cpc cmap the cpc cmap dataset which is a monthly dataset on a 2 5 latitude longitude grid was produced through the integration of worldwide gauge observations satellite estimates and numerical model outputs xie and arkin 1997 xie et al 2007 in nmme this dataset has been re gridded to match its resolution with that of the forecasts kirtman et al 2014 in this paper the anomaly correlation between cpc cmap observations and nmme forecasts in the hindcast period from 1982 to 2010 is calculated 3 methods 3 1 formulation of anomaly correlation each of the 10 sets of nmme forecasts has five dimensions namely latitude longitude initialization time lead time and ensemble member the cpc cmap observations have three dimensions which are latitude longitude and time in this paper the focus is on the nmme seasonal forecasts initialized in january february march april may and june specifically the forecasts targeting at the total precipitation in the three months of june july and august are investigated in the northern hemisphere the three targeted months generally comprise the summer when floods and droughts are of concern e g yuan and wood 2013 emerton et al 2017 in the southern hemisphere they are winter months when floods and droughts occur under the mediterranean climate bennett et al 2017 the anomaly correlation between raw ensemble means and observations is calculated that is the anomaly correlation is obtained for forecasts initialized from january to june for each grid cell the six anomaly correlation coefficients are formulated as a vector 1 r c r c 1 r c 2 r c 3 r c 4 r c 5 r c 6 it is worthwhile to note the dimensions considered in eq 1 first of all the subscript c is the index of grid cell it accounts for the first two dimensions i e latitude and longitude of gcm forecasts the value of c ranges from 1 to 16 643 because 16 643 grid cells of land surface locate between 60 s and 80 n secondly the script m in r c m represents the third dimension of initialization time i e m 1 2 3 4 5 6 as the targeted months are fixed m also indicates the fourth dimension of lead time that is the lead time is reduced from 5 months to 0 month as m progresses from january to june finally the fifth dimension of the ensemble member is eliminated because the anomaly correlation is calculated for the ensemble mean in eq 1 the vector r c formulates the anomaly correlation at 6 initialization times at grid cell c the anomaly correlation vectors are obtained for each set of nmme forecasts the 10 sets of anomaly correlation vectors lay the basis for the investigation of spatial and temporal patterns following the mathematical formulations of pca hotelling 1933 demsar et al 2013 the variation of r c is calculated as the sum of the squared anomaly correlation 2 va r c r c 2 r c r c t m 1 6 r c m 2 the variation across the globe is calculated based on eq 2 3 va r total c 1 16643 va r c c 1 16643 r c 2 c 1 16643 m 1 6 r c m 2 in this way the variation of anomaly correlation with initialization time across the globe is quantified 3 2 variation of anomaly correlation pca is a data driven approach that has been widely used to analyze linear dependency relationships among a group of variables hotelling 1933 demsar et al 2013 in this paper pca is applied to anomaly correlation at different initialization times the core of pca is a set of eigenvectors v n n 1 2 3 4 5 6 which are unit vectors orthogonal to one another that is 4 v n 1 v n 2 t 1 n 1 n 2 0 n 1 n 2 the anomaly correlation vectors r c c 1 2 16 643 are projected onto the space of the eigenvectors using the mathematical operation of inner product 5 r c n 1 6 v c n v n v c n r c v n t where v c n is the projection of r c onto v n the variation at grid cell c is re calculated with eq 5 i e 6 va r c r c 2 n 1 1 6 n 2 1 6 v c n 1 v n 1 v n 2 t v c n 2 the above eq 6 is simplified using eq 4 7 va r c r c 2 n 1 6 v c n 2 as is illustrated pca retains the variation of the anomaly correlation at grid cell c specifically 8 va r c m 1 6 r c m 2 n 1 6 v c n 2 the above equation also indicates that pca preserves the variation of anomaly correlation across the globe 9 va r total c 1 16643 r c 2 c 1 16643 n 1 6 v c n 2 n 1 6 c 1 16643 v c n 2 where c 1 16643 v c n 2 is the variation explained by the n th eigenvector v n based on linear algebraic operations pca makes v 1 the most effective and explain the most variation of anomaly correlation v 2 the second most effective and explain the second most variation and so on 10 c 1 16643 v c 1 2 c 1 16643 v c 2 2 c 1 16643 v c 3 2 c 1 16643 v c 4 2 c 1 16643 v c 5 2 c 1 16643 v c 6 2 therefore the effectiveness of vn is measured by the percentage of variation explained by this eigenvector 11 v n 100 c 1 16643 v c n 2 va r total n 1 2 3 4 5 6 the eigenvectors determined by pca are wholly driven by the anomaly correlation vectors from this perspective pca facilitates an objective examination of the variation of anomaly correlation according to the formulations the first and second eigenvectors v 1 and v 2 are respectively the most and second most effective in characterizing how r c 1 r c 2 r c 3 r c 4 r c 5 r c 6 correlate with one another across the 16 643 grid cells in the analysis the attention is paid to these two eigenvectors when deriving v 1 and v 2 their sampling uncertainty is also assessed it is through bootstrapping specifically the 16 643 anomaly correlation vectors are sampled randomly with replacement for 1000 times the first and second eigenvectors in the 1000 rounds of sampling are saved the 1000 sets of eigenvectors tell how the eigenvectors are varying subject to the sampling variability of anomaly correlation vectors by pooling the eigenvectors the 10th 25th 75th and 90th percentiles are obtained respectively for v 1 and v 2 then the 50 and 80 uncertainty intervals of the eigenvectors are determined the uncertainty intervals show whether the relationships among r c 1 r c 2 r c 3 r c 4 r c 5 r c 6 as are characterized by v 1 and v 2 are robust 3 3 spatial and temporal patterns this paper focuses on the variation of anomaly correlation between nmme forecasts and observations in an investigation of nmme forecasts of summer precipitation in china zhao et al 2018 observed two patterns spatial and temporal of the anomaly correlation this paper examines the two patterns at a global scale and verifies them objectively using the eigenvectors of pca the spatial pattern suggests that the anomaly correlation at different initialization times tends to be at the same level it is formulated as follows 12 p 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 from a mathematical perspective this pattern means that for certain grid cells high low anomaly correlation at one initialization time coincides with high low anomaly correlation at other initialization times the temporal pattern suggests that the anomaly correlation improves linearly with initialization time the formulation is shown below 13 p 2 5 3 1 1 3 5 5 2 3 2 1 2 1 2 3 2 5 2 the indication of the temporal pattern is that the anomaly correlation at a later initialization time tends to be higher the two patterns are unit vectors orthogonal to each other this feature follows the definition of eigenvectors in pca p 1 and p 2 facilitate spatial and temporal projections respectively to investigate the properties of anomaly correlation vectors the projections of the anomaly correlation vector onto the two patterns are obtained using inner product hotelling 1933 demsar et al 2013 14 p c 1 r c p 1 t p c 2 r c p 2 t where pc i i 1 2 is the projection of r c onto p i in the meantime the projections allow the quantification of the effectiveness of the two patterns for all grid cells across the globe the effectiveness is measured by the percentage of variation explained by the patterns 15 p 1 100 c 1 16643 p c 1 2 va r total p 2 100 c 1 16643 p c 2 2 va r total an illustrative example is presented for the mathematical projection supposing an anomaly correlation vector is as follows 16 r c 0 25 0 35 0 45 0 55 0 65 0 75 in this case the anomaly correlation vector has two nice properties first of all it is positive at the six initialization times the positive anomaly correlation means that high low values of forecasts correspond to high low values of observations secondly the correlation linearly increases from january to june that is the correspondence between forecasts and observations improves steadily with initialization time using eq 14 the projections of r c onto p 1 and p 2 are obtained 17 p c 1 r c p 1 t 1 225 p c 2 r c p 2 t 0 418 further 18 r c 1 225 p 1 0 418 p 2 the above equation can be verified using the values in eq 16 eq 12 and eq 13 in the meantime the fact that pca preserves the variation of anomaly correlation can also be verified 19 r c 2 0 25 2 0 35 2 0 45 2 0 55 2 0 65 2 0 75 2 1 675 r c 2 1 225 2 0 418 2 1 675 with eq 19 the percentage of variation of r c explained by the first and second pattern is quantified 20 p 1 100 1 225 2 1 675 89 6 p 2 100 0 418 2 1 675 10 4 the example in eqs 16 20 is hypothetical with the variation of r c wholly explained by the two patterns for nmme forecasts the variation of anomaly correlation is far more complex the anomaly correlation can be negative and it can change drastically with initialization time as a result the anomaly correlation vector of nmme forecasts can be projected onto not only the spatial and temporal patterns but also other directions in the following the spatial and temporal patterns are used as exploratory tools to handle the variation of anomaly correlation the existence and effectiveness of the two patterns are verified by pca 4 results 4 1 spatial temporal variation of anomaly correlation the anomaly correlation measures the correspondence between forecasts and observations it is one of the most popular measures of the skill of gcm forecasts e g merryfield et al 2013 saha et al 2014 jia et al 2015 for cfsv2 seasonal forecasts initialized in january february march april may and june the anomaly correlation is shown by month in fig 1 in this figure the red blue color scheme represents the value of anomaly correlation many instances of red pixels that indicate high positive correlation exist forecasts are informative in these cases that is large values of forecasts correspond to large values of observations and small values of forecasts coincide with small values of observations however blue pixels that represent negative correlation also exist they imply that large small values of forecasts tend to correspond to small large values of observations in those cases forecasts are generally non informative given the variation of anomaly correlation from january to june users of the forecasts would look for regions where clusters of red pixels exist the regions with good anomaly correlation persistently high across the six initialization times or steadily improving with initialization time would be of particular interest taking a close look at fig 1 clusters of red pixels can be seen for example in the northwest united states north brazil southeast asia and east australia however over these regions the spatial extents of the clustered red pixels tend to change from month to month in some regions such as siberia and north canada clusters of red pixels are even scattered and surrounded by blue pixels overall it is none too easy for users to identify regions with good anomaly correlation this outcome implies the complexity of the predictive performance of gcm forecasts it also calls for exploratory mathematical tools to deal with the variation of anomaly correlation 4 2 existence of spatial and temporal patterns while the spatial temporal variation is highlighted in fig 1 the temporal variation is further detailed in fig 2 for the 16 643 grid cells under investigation the anomaly correlation is plotted against initialization time in the upper parts of fig 2 each colored thin line is for one grid cell the anomaly correlation is observed to vary drastically with initialization time in addition the anomaly correlation falls below zero in many instances pca is employed to handle the variation of anomaly correlation with initialization time across the 16 643 grid cells in pca the eigenvectors tell how the anomaly correlation in january february and june relate to one another the blue dashed lines in the left and right hand sides of fig 2 respectively show the first and second eigenvectors from pca the eigenvectors yield insights into the spatial temporal variation the first eigenvector has similar loadings on the six initialization times the indication is that the anomaly correlation tends to be at a similar level in other words for a grid cell the anomaly correlation at different initialization times can be similarly high or low quantitatively this eigenvector explains 57 2 of the variation of anomaly correlation for cfsv2 forecasts the message is that the variation of anomaly correlation as is shown in fig 1 is largely spatial this result can to some extent be observed in the subplots of fig 1 for example in australia high correlation can generally be observed in the eastern and western parts of the country from january to june by contrast the correlation appears to be always low in the middle part of the country the loadings of the second eigenvector tend to increase from january to june this result implies the temporal improvement of anomaly correlation with initialization time on the other hand the temporal improvement is more difficult to be observed than the spatial difference this outcome is in accordance with the fact that the second eigenvector is not as prominent as the first one and explains 12 7 of the variation nevertheless the cumulative improvements can be observed globally in fig 1 the anomaly correlation exhibits more instances of red pixels in june than in january the first and second eigenvectors are respectively illustrated with the spatial and temporal patterns in fig 2 the similarity of the eigenvectors to the patterns highlights the existence of the conceptual patterns zhao et al 2018 at the global scale furthermore the persistence of the patterns is evaluated by bootstrapping i e sampling the anomaly correlation vectors randomly with replacement for 1000 times the 50 and 80 uncertainty intervals of the eigenvectors are shown in the lower part of fig 2 it can be observed that the intervals are very narrow therefore it is concluded that the sampling variability of anomaly correlation vectors across the globe has a very small impact on the eigenvectors in other words the patterns as are indicated by the eigenvectors are robust this result is attributed to the large sample size i e 16 643 anomaly correlation vectors are employed to derive the eigenvectors 4 3 projection onto the spatial pattern as the existence of spatial pattern has been verified by pca the anomaly correlation vectors are projected onto the spatial pattern as shown in fig 3 this figure uses a red blue scheme which is slightly different from the color scheme of fig 1 to represent the value of the projection while the spatial temporal variation complicates the analysis of anomaly correlation the projection yields insights into the variation the projection onto the spatial pattern helps locate the regions where forecasts tend to be highly correlated with observations across the six initialization times in fig 3 the projection is high in the northwest united states north brazil southeast asia and eastern and western australia based on fig 1 it can be observed that these regions tend to exhibit high positive anomaly correlation from january to june the projection also suggests that the anomaly correlation tends to be high in southern europe north africa and south africa therein clusters of red pixels can also be seen in fig 1 it is noted that some of the regions with overall high anomaly correlation were shown to exhibit hydro climatic tele connections by previous studies for example el niño southern oscillation and pacific decadal oscillation are observed to impact northwest united states and have been incorporated into seasonal hydro climatic forecasting since the 1990s hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 also el niño southern oscillation is shown to affect the precipitation in north brazil southeast asia and eastern and western australia emerton et al 2017 dai and wigley 2000 on the other hand the projection is negative in north asia and north canada fig 3 this result is in accordance with the low and negative anomaly correlation across six initialization times therein fig 1 the overall low anomaly correlation in some regions suggests that gcms are not yet perfect and can have limitations for example the anomaly correlation in the great lakes region in the northeast united states and southeast canada is not satisfactory for cfsv2 forecasts it is also deemed to be unsatisfactory for the other 9 sets of nmme forecasts under investigation supplementary material this outcome can be due to that the great lakes considerably influence the surrounding climate but the resolution of gcms is too coarse to realistically account for the impacts of the great lakes gula and peltier 2012 4 4 projection onto the temporal pattern the projection to the temporal pattern is illustrated in fig 4 unfortunately the temporal projection is no longer high in northwest united states north brazil southeast asia and east australia where the spatial projection is prominently high the implication is that though forecasts are overall skillful in these regions they would not necessarily become increasingly more skillful as initialization time progresses on the other hand the projection is high in part of north asia and north canada this result suggests that the anomaly correlation tends to improve with initialization time therein the temporal pattern is meant to reflect the temporal improvement of anomaly correlation the improvement is generally attributable to data assimilation systems in gcms bauer et al 2015 specifically more observations as well as model simulations become available as initialization time progresses the information is assimilated into the gcm forecasting process conceptually forecasts at a later initialization time are based on more information from this perspective the anomaly correlation is expected to increase with initialization time which would contribute to the effectiveness of the temporal pattern in explaining the variation however the anomaly correlation turns out to change drastically with initialization time in many cases there is thus a gap between the conceptual improvement and the actual drastic changes this gap implies the difficulty of assimilating information from multiple sources at a global scale merryfield et al 2013 saha et al 2014 jia et al 2015 nevertheless the existence of the temporal pattern does suggest that data assimilation works as assimilation algorithms become more efficient the temporal pattern is expected to be more effective 4 5 results for 10 sets of nmme forecasts the variation of anomaly correlation has been investigated for all the 10 sets of nmme forecasts please refer to the supplementary material for the details the 10 first and second eigenvectors are obtained and their effectiveness is evaluated in fig 5 a and b the two patterns are illustrated with the first two eigenvectors it can be observed that the spatial and temporal patterns are respectively similar to the first and second eigenvectors for all the 10 sets of forecasts in nmme this result highlights the existence of the spatial and temporal patterns at the global scale the percentage of the variation of anomaly correlation explained by the patterns and the eigenvectors is quantified and shown by bar plots in fig 5c the spatial pattern explains 56 6 of the variation for cfsv2 38 8 for cancm3 48 3 for cancm4 39 2 for ccsm3 50 6 for ccsm4 50 2 for cm2p1 54 1 for cm2p1 aer04 52 0 for flor a06 50 9 for flor b01 and 52 8 for cesm1 the temporal pattern is not as prominent it explains 12 8 of the variation for cfsv2 14 6 for cancm3 13 5 for cancm4 15 1 for ccsm3 11 6 for ccsm4 13 2 for cm2p1 11 5 for cm2p1 aer04 12 5 for flor a06 13 3 for flor b01 and 11 1 for cesm1 the stacked bar charts in fig 5c indicate that the two patterns and the first two eigenvectors are similar not only in the loadings on the 6 initialization times fig 5a and b but also in the effectiveness in explaining the variation of anomaly correlation furthermore the percentage of explained variation is plotted against the average variation for the 10 sets of forecasts in fig 6 for cmc1 cancm3 and cmc2 cancm4 the respective average variations are 0 265 and 0 278 and the respective percentages of explained variations are 53 4 and 61 8 for cola rsmas ccsm3 and cola rsmas ccsm4 the respective average variations are 0 251 and 0 288 and the respective percentages of explained variations are 54 3 and 62 2 the upgrades in the gcms appear to contribute to the variation of anomaly correlation also they tend to contribute to the effectiveness of the two patterns in explaining the variation for the 10 sets of nmme forecasts a linear relationship exists between the average variation and the percentage of explained variation the correlation coefficient is as high as 0 94 for fig 6 it is noted that the dot in the top right corner is for cfsv2 forecasts in other words among the 10 sets of forecasts cfsv2 forecasts exhibit the highest average variation and are with the highest percentage of variation explained by the spatial and temporal patterns this result is in accordance with a previous finding that cfsv2 overall exhibits the highest anomaly correlation skill in nmme kirtman et al 2014 despite this result it is noted that in some regions e g north asia and north canada cfsv2 can still be outperformed by other gcms in terms of the spatial and temporal projections supplementary material this outcome highlights that besides global investigation it is also important to consider regional difference of predictive performance for the use of gcm forecasts the spatial and temporal patterns can serve as exploratory tools to investigate the predictive performance at both global and regional scales 5 discussion this paper has investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of anomaly correlation for 10 sets of nmme seasonal forecasts overall the two patterns are effective and explain 50 to 70 of the variation of anomaly correlation in this paper the analysis of the patterns is conducted by characterizing anomaly correlation at a single grid cell as a vector and pooling vectors across the grid cells the mathematical formulations are demonstrated to be effective in addressing the variation of anomaly correlation at the global scale flexibility is an advantage of this approach while it is applied to anomaly correlation it is applicable to other measures of predictive performance such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error computational efficiency is another advantage pca and the related projections rely on linear algebraic operations hotelling 1933 demsar et al 2013 they can be adapted to handle large datasets for example forecasts produced by regional climate models rcms and numerical weather predictions nwps that have higher spatial resolutions and are more frequently initialized the projections of the anomaly correlation vectors onto the spatial and temporal patterns yield insights into the use of gcm forecasts for regions with positive projection onto the spatial pattern the anomaly correlation tends to be at a high level in january february and june for these regions hydrological forecasting systems can be developed to leverage gcm forecasts to predict streamflow months ahead hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 emerton et al 2017 lehner et al 2017 for regions with positive projection onto the temporal pattern the anomaly correlation tends to steadily improve from january to june for those regions it is important to incorporate timely updated gcm forecasts into hydrological forecasting schepen and wang 2014 bennett et al 2017 on the other hand there exist regions with low projections onto the spatial and temporal patterns the implication is that the anomaly correlation of gcm forecasts is neither high at the six initialization times nor improve with initialization time therein hydrological forecasting may need to seek information other than gcm forecasts such as rcm forecasts and nwps 6 conclusions gcms produce informative seasonal forecasts of global precipitation months ahead of its occurrence in this paper we propose two patterns to characterize the predictive performance as is indicated by anomaly correlation of gcm forecasts of global precipitation the projections of anomaly correlation vectors onto the two patterns help illustrate where and when the gcm precipitation forecasts are skillful the spatial pattern locates where high low anomaly correlation at one initialization time coincides with high low anomaly correlation at other initialization times the temporal pattern tells how anomaly correlation improves with initialization time overall the two patterns explain 50 to 70 of the variation of anomaly correlation for the 10 sets of nmme seasonal forecasts of global precipitation in june july and august future studies can analyze gcm forecasts for other seasons and apply the spatial and temporal patterns to investigate the predictive performance apart from precipitation gcms also produce forecasts of other climate variables of interest such as temperature wind speed and solar radiation in the future efforts can be devoted to investigating the patterns for more variables and

6689,the accurate determination of land surface water fluxes at various spatiotemporal scales remains a challenge in hydrological sciences it is intuitive that land surface net water flux i e infiltration minus evapotranspiration directly affects near surface soil moisture however there exists no hydrological model suitable to calculate net water flux based on measured near surface soil moisture data this is a consequence of the mathematical structure of existing models that use boundary conditions to determine internal conditions whereas what is needed is a model amenable to use near surface soil moisture data an internal condition to determine the surface water flux a boundary condition to pursue the idea of utilizing remotely sensed or in situ i e sensor networks near surface soil moisture data for estimation of net water flux we derived an analytical model via inversion of warrick s 1975 analytical solution to the linearized richards equation for arbitrary time varying surface flux boundary conditions the applicability of the new analytical solution was evaluated based on actual water flux observations as well as hydrus 1d simulations for four vastly different sites in arizona california idaho and indiana our results demonstrate that the proposed model reasonably captures net water flux variations in natural settings including layered and vegetated soils especially at larger time scales e g monthly while the model works for a wide range of climatic conditions the prediction accuracy is somewhat lower for extreme dry or wet conditions a major advantage of the new model is that it does not require calibration which provides an unprecedented opportunity for large scale estimation of land surface net water flux using remotely sensed near surface soil moisture observations keywords analytical model richards equation infiltration evapotranspiration remote sensing near surface soil moisture 1 introduction and motivation hydrological fluxes connect the water energy and biogeochemical cycles and are affected by anthropogenic forcing on the water cycle fundamental gaps exist in understanding patterns and dynamics of these fluxes for large regions according to the national research council 2012 ground based and remote sensing observations and modeling are key to filling these knowledge gaps two critical hydrological fluxes at the land surface are infiltration i i e precipitation minus surface runoff and evapotranspiration et combined these processes yield net water flux f i et which determines the terrestrial water balance i e gain or loss of subsurface water resources accurate determination of the net water flux at various spatiotemporal scales is a remaining challenge in hydrological sciences energy balance and water balance are the two general approaches for estimation of surface hydrological fluxes the widely applied eddy covariance method is considered the standard energy balance approach determining the latent heat flux actual et as a residual of the energy balance equation wilson et al 2001 this method currently applied at global fluxnet sites baldocchi et al 2001 requires complex and expensive instrumentation as well as a number of corrections that are often ill defined and empirical allen et al 2011 while energy balance methods provide only et estimates water balance calculations yield both i and et fluxes among the water balance methods lysimetry is the most accurate as it directly measures any water gain or loss however weighing lysimeters are expensive to build and maintain and they are only applicable for measurements at small spatial scales rapidly advancing soil moisture θ sensing technology provides an alternative means to close the water balance in recent years numerous national and international in situ θ monitoring networks e g scan schaefer et al 2007 crn coopersmith et al 2015 cosmos zreda et al 2008 ismn dorigo et al 2011 have been established providing unique opportunities for estimation of the net water flux with the water balance approach applying near surface θ data e g 0 5 cm is of special interest as such data are not only available from point scale in situ measurements vaz et al 2013 but also from airborne and satellite remote sensing observations at watershed moran et al 2004 sadeghi et al 2017 babaeian et al 2018 and global scales kerr et al 2001 entekhabi et al 2010 wagner et al 2013 there is an obvious connection between land surface net water flux and near surface θ however there exists no hydrological model that can calculate net water flux based on measured near surface soil moisture data this is a consequence of the mathematical structure of existing analytical e g warrick 1975 warrick et al 1991 chen et al 2001 menziani et al 2007 and numerical e g hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 models that use boundary conditions to determine internal conditions whereas what is needed is a model amenable to use near surface soil moisture data an internal condition to determine the surface water flux a boundary condition motivated by advances in airborne and satellite remote sensing of large scale near surface soil moisture recent efforts have been devoted to convert soil moisture time series retrievals to either precipitation brocca et al 2013 2014 ciabatta et al 2015 koster et al 2016 2018 or soil moisture loss which is the aggregated impact of evapotranspiration and internal drainage koster et al 2017 akbar et al 2018 these models are mainly based on simple mass balance and empirical equations and lack a rigorous mathematical solution to the governing soil water flow equation this is why they commonly need extensive calibration to advance the understanding of the land surface water dynamics here we present a novel analytical model for calculation of the net water flux from near surface soil moisture data the proposed model was derived via inversion of warrick s 1975 analytical solution to the linearized richards equation for arbitrary time varying surface flux boundary conditions the proposed model can be parameterized without the need for calibration with measured data 2 model derivation the diffusivity form of the richards equation is given as 1 θ t z d θ z k where θ is volumetric soil moisture content d is the soil water diffusivity k is unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity t is time and z is soil depth assuming d is a constant and k a linear function of θ 2 k k θ the linearized richards equation is obtained 3 θ t d 2 θ z 2 k θ z our new approach relies on warrick s 1975 analytical solution to eq 3 subject to the following boundary and initial conditions 4a d θ z k z 0 f t 4b limit z θ z t θ 4c θ z 0 θ i z θ 1 g z where f and g can be any arbitrary functions of time and depth respectively θi is the initial soil moisture content and θ is the limiting soil moisture content at large depths that is equivalent to the long term average soil moisture along the soil profile with the following normalized variables 5 z kz d 6 t k 2 t d 7 θ θ θ θ e 0 5 z 0 25 t 8 f f k θ k θ warrick s 1975 solution can be written as 9 θ z t θ bc z t θ ic z t where θ bc is due to the boundary condition and is given as 10 θ bc z t 0 t e 0 25 τ f τ e 0 25 z 2 t τ π t τ 0 5 e 0 25 t τ 0 5 z erfc 0 5 z t τ t τ d τ and θ ic is due to the initial condition and is given as 11 θ ic z t 0

moisture near the surface evolves from its initial status after a short period of time especially when precipitation is high and et is low capehart and carlson 1994 hence for the sake of simplicity we assume that θi θ yielding θ ic 0 this assumption simplifies the application of this method especially at larger scales and where information on the soil moisture profile is lacking we consider n time steps of δt and assume a constant surface net water flux at each time step 12 f t f 1 0 t δ t f 2 δ t t 2 δ t f n n 1 δ t t n δ t for this case eq 10 yields warrick 1975 13 θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u

warrick s 1975 solution presented above is for calculation of soil moisture at any depth and time when the surface net water flux is known in this study however we are interested in the inverse calculation i e the surface flux in terms of the soil moisture hence we invert eq 13 to analytically calculate net water flux f or f at any time t nδt from measured soil moisture data θ yielding θ through eq 7 15 f n θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t u z δ t n 1 t δ t f 1 θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u z t u z δ t n 2 t 2 δ t f n 1 1 u z δ t θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u z t i 3 n f i 1 f i 2 u z n i 2 δ t n 2 t n δ t note that surface net water flux will be best predicted with near surface soil moisture data because the response to the surface flux is dampened with depth this means a significant change in surface flux only results in a small change in soil moisture at large depths shown in fig 1 for a sinusoidal surface boundary condition this is why the new analytical model is practical for near surface soil moisture data only 3 model calibration and validation to examine the applicability of eq 15 for calculation of land surface net water flux from near surface soil moisture data we used measured data from four sites located in different regions of the u s arizona california idaho and indiana covering a broad range of soil types and climatic and land cover conditions the data include 5 cm soil moisture information from in situ sensors actual evapotranspiration et from eddy covariance towers and precipitation p from weather stations because of the lack of actual infiltration data it was assumed that precipitation equals infiltration i e runoff is neglected however note that the new model yields the actual infiltration rate and not the precipitation input we compared water flux calculated with eq 15 with the observed net water flux defined as f p et for the comparisons between measured and estimated data we used the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and bias defined as 1 σ where σ is slope of the regression line with zero intercept fitted to the estimated versus measured data araya lópez et al 2018 as discussed in the following section parametrization of the proposed model without calibration is feasible however to gain insight into the model parameters d and k and model performance with and without calibration we first calibrated the model with measured water flux data we applied the global simulated annealing optimization algorithm contained in the matlab optimization toolboxtm release 2018a the mathworks inc natick massachusetts usa for model calibration and minimized the rmse between the measured and calculated θ derived from measured water fluxes with eq 13 with the optimized model parameters we then inversely calculated f from measured θ data with eq 15 for this analysis θ was directly calculated as the average of all measured θ data 3 1 test site i tonzi ranch california the tonzi ranch site is located in a flat area of the willow creek watershed in eastern california with a mediterranean climate an average annual temperature of 16 c and an average precipitation of 560 mm at this site the land surface is covered with oak savanna mixed forests grasslands and shrublands and the dominant soil texture is sandy clay loam with low organic matter content additional information about this site is provided in baldocchi 2016 the best fit of eq 13 d 152 7 cm2 d 1 and k 0 148 cm d 1 to 14 years of measured soil moisture data is shown in fig 2 top although several simplifying assumptions were applied for derivation of eq 13 good agreement can be observed between measured and calculated θ data leading to reasonable agreement between measured and calculated f fig 2 bottom the differences can be partially attributed to the simplifying assumptions of the analytical model eq 15 e g neglecting root water uptake at this vegetated site however there are several other potential error sources such as the measurement sensing errors of the reference data themselves and the scale and location mismatch between soil moisture et and precipitation measurements because of the lack of information about actual infiltration rates precipitation data were used for model estimates of infiltration rates instead this might introduce some uncertainty because potential surface runoff is not taken into account to better understand the attribution of the observed discrepancies to the simplifying modeling assumptions we simulated θ and f dynamics with the more sophisticated hydrus 1d code šimůnek et al 2016 that solves the nonlinear richards equation eq 1 a sink term feddes et al 1978 to account for root water uptake as well as vapor flow dynamics were considered a uniform soil profile parameterized with van genuchten s 1980 soil hydraulic functions was assumed the soil profile was discretized using 1 cm increments free drainage was assumed for the bottom boundary at 100 cm depth the measured water fluxes precipitation and actual et were used as the input surface boundary conditions the initial condition was set to θi θ the van genuchten model parameters were optimized to best fit hydrus 1d simulations to the measured soil moisture data at the 5 cm depth note that et inputs in hydrus 1d are considered as potential not actual hence we specified a high value 106 cm for the critical pressure head at the surface to maintain stage i evaporation i e actual et potential et during the simulation fig 3 depicts a comparison between the analytical model eq 13 or 15 and hydrus 1d simulations high correlations are shown between the two models about 85 of variations of both θ and f from the sophisticated hydrus 1d model could be captured with the analytical model this indicates that the simplifying assumptions used for model derivations e g linearized richards equation homogeneous soil profile uniform initial condition no root water uptake no vapor flow do not significantly affect the analytical model s applicability and most of the scattering observed in fig 2 bottom right is mainly due to the other potential error sources discussed above 3 2 test site ii lower sage idaho to evaluate how the new analytical model performs for a distinctly layered soil profile we used data from the lower sage site located in the reynolds creek experimental watershed in southwestern idaho the site is located at an altitude of 1600 m and is part of the reynolds creek critical zone observatory czo the climatic conditions range from arid to temperate the mean annual temperature and precipitation for the lower sage site are 8 5 c and 345 mm respectively the site is grazed by cattle and covered with sagebrush the soil profile is distinctly layered with textures ranging from sandy clay loam to clay and has an average rock content of 0 25 m3 m 3 for further information about this site readers are referred to fellows et al 2017 and parajuli et al 2019 the analytical model performance for the lower sage site is depicted in fig 4 a good agreement is observed between the measured and calculated θ fig 4 top the agreement for f is slightly biased but still reasonable when considering that the analytical model neglects several factors such as the spatial variability i e soil layering and rock inclusions root water uptake and soil freezing thawing that affect water flow at this site as discussed above other error sources tied to the reference data themselves could potentially contribute to the observed deviations between measured and modeled f to quantify errors due to the model s simplifying assumptions we again simulated θ and f time series with hydrus 1d a 5 layer soil profile each layer quantified with van genuchten s 1980 soil hydraulic functions was assumed the soil profile was discretized with 1 cm increments free drainage was assumed for the bottom boundary at 200 cm depth the measured precipitation and actual et were used to quantify the input surface boundary conditions the moisture measurements in 5 15 30 60 and 90 cm depths from october 1 2014 i e t 0 in fig 4 were used as initial conditions the van genuchten parameters for each layer were optimized with inverse hydrus 1d simulations such that model predictions simultaneously best fit the measured θ data at depths of 5 15 30 60 and 90 cm root water uptake and vapor flow were also considered results of this analysis are shown in fig 5 again a high correlation between the analytical model and hydrus 1d simulations can be observed about 87 of soil moisture variations and 77 of water flux variations from the hydrus 1d simulations were captured with the analytical model eq 13 or 15 which indicates that despite the simplifying assumptions the analytical model is also applicable for highly heterogeneous soil profiles 3 3 test site iii kendall arizona the results for the tonzi ranch and lower sage sites presented above indicate that the analytical model tends to overestimate soil moisture in dry seasons one potential explanation for the observed deviations is that significant non isothermal water and vapor flow which are not accounted for in the linearized richards equation occur under dry and warm conditions hence we next challenged the new analytical model with data from the semiarid kendall site located in the walnut gulch experimental watershed in southeastern arizona at the kendall site the average annual air temperature is 17 7 c the annual precipitation amounts to 350 mm and the annual potential et is 2600 mm the site is predominantly covered with shrubs and grasses the major soil textures are sandy loam and gravelly loam with low organic matter content additional information about this site is provided in keefer et al 2008 results for the kendall site are depicted in fig 6 the new analytical model does not capture the measured 5 cm depth θ time series well especially during dry periods as mentioned these deviations can be potentially attributed to significant non isothermal flows which are expected in such warm and dry environments accordingly the proposed model for f eq 15 is less accurate for this site when compared to the tonzi ranch and lower sage sites the model tends to underestimate f which likely stems from the simplifying model assumptions the bias may also be due to significant surface runoff during the heavy summer monsoon storms common in this region i e the actual infiltration rate is lower than measured precipitation 3 4 site case iv morgan monroe indiana the linearized richards equation does not apply to oversaturated soils when a positive pressure head exists a potential source of the analytical model prediction error in extremely wet environments to evaluate the analytical model performance under humid conditions we used measured θ and f data from the morgan monroe site located northeast of bloomington indiana the site is covered with a broadleaf deciduous forest the climate is humid sub tropical with an average annual air temperature of 10 8 c and annual precipitation of 1032 mm the average elevation is 275 m above sea level and the surface topography comprises moderate hills with well drained clay loam soils further information about this site can be found in brzostek et al 2014 results for the morgan monroe site are depicted in fig 7 the θ estimates based on eq 13 vary within a narrower range than the measured values this is mainly because of the large optimized d value obtained from matching the soil moisture spikes after high intensity precipitation events the proposed f model eq 15 reasonably captured the measured flux variations r2 0 293 with a model bias towards flux underestimation the bias likely stems from the neglect of surface runoff which is expected under these hilly and wet conditions furthermore upward water flux from shallow water tables which is common in wet regions is another potential source of error 4 calibration free model parametrization 4 1 approach as shown above calibration of the analytical model parameters d and k relies on the availability of measured water flux data this limits the applicability of the model especially for large scales to circumvent this limitation we introduce a method for calibration free parametrization of eq 15 sensitivity of the net water flux values calculated with eq 15 to variations in d and k is depicted in fig 8 for the measured soil moisture time series from the tonzi ranch site the f estimates based on arbitrary values of k and the calibrated d values are nearly the same as the estimates based on calibrated values for both k and d the f estimates using arbitrary values of d and calibrated k values are biased compared to but highly correlated with estimates based on calibrated k and d values therefore an arbitrary k within a typical range should suffice for parameterization of eq 15 calculation of an optimum d value for unbiased f estimation follows as results indicate the ratio k d is typically a very small number in cm 1 leading to very small typical values of z and t for z 0 near surface and t 0 1 equivalent to t 274 years for d 100 cm2 d 1 and k 0 01 cm d 1 we empirically found that function u in eq 14 can be closely approximated with 16 u t t from eq 16 the surface soil moisture θsur due to a constant net water flux f can be approximated as 17 θ sur t θ θ f t based on eq 17 6 and 8 we may approximate the maximum soil moisture θ max at a given location from a maximum water flux f max or f max occurring at time t max and its relationship to k and d 18 θ max θ θ f max t max f max k θ k θ k 2 t max d assuming f max kθ eq 18 yields 19 d t max θ max θ 2 f max 2 equation 19 was shown to be valid for the four evaluation sites with different random values of d and k therefore for a given location constant θ max θ and t max an invariant linear relationship between d used in eq 15 and the resulting f max 2 is expected therefore we suggest the following equation to estimate d for a given location 20 d d f max f max 2 in this equation d is an initial guess for diffusivity e g an arbitrary value of 100 cm2 d 1 which applied in conjunction with an arbitrary k e g 0 01 cm d 1 in eq 15 yields an initial guess for the maximum water flux f max equation 20 allows estimation of a diffusivity value d corresponding to the actual maximum water flux measured during the period of interest f max from the initial guesses d and f max note that f max is the only site specific information required for this calibration free parameterization method 4 2 results for daily fluxes the calibration free parameterization approach was evaluated for the four sites discussed above first we calculated f with eq 15 with arbitrary parameters of d 100 cm2 d 1 and k 0 01 cm d 1 then we calculated d with eq 20 and recalculated f with eq 15 with k 0 01 cm d 1 and the newly calculated d results of this analysis are presented in fig 9 the accuracy of the estimates in terms of r2 and rmse is comparable to that of the calibrated model figs 2 to 7 the bias for the calibration free model is even less than that of the calibrated model this is mainly due to the incorporation of the maximum measured water flux f max used for calculating d with eq 20 it should be noted that the calibration free parametrization introduced here is appropriate for the inverse calculation only i e calculation of f θ with eq 15 the forward calculation with eq 13 using the same parameters does not necessarily yield good θ estimates 4 3 results for monthly fluxes monthly water fluxes are also important for water cycle studies especially at larger scales intuitively simulation of daily fluxes should be more challenging than for monthly fluxes as data uncertainties are significantly lower at the monthly time scale however it was unclear how well the richards equation originally developed for instantaneous soil water flow would work at monthly time scales hence we tested the new analytical model eq 15 for calculation of monthly net water flux at the four study sites we integrated the daily data over each month then smoothed the data over a 3 month window using a gaussian filter to further remove random variations i e keeping seasonality only to apply the analytical model parameterized based on the calibration free approach we first calculated f with eq 15 with arbitrary parameters of d 3000 cm2 month 1 and k 0 3 cm month 1 then we calculated d with eq 20 and recalculated f with eq 15 with k 0 3 cm month 1 and the newly calculated d the monthly flux estimates are presented in fig 10 revealing the estimates at all sites being significantly better than for the daily flux estimates see fig 9 these results present strong evidence for validity of the richards equation based flux model for monthly time scales correlations at the tonzi ranch site are remarkable r2 0 842 this reveals that richards equation even without the sink term may be adequately applied to vegetated soils this may be justified by the fact that soil evaporation and plant transpiration are highly correlated in wet regions where evaporation remains mostly near stage i philip 1957 correlations at the other sites are moderate due to various sources of uncertainty discussed previously 5 discussion about the value of near surface soil moisture observations because most remote sensing techniques only capture a shallow surface layer there is an ongoing debate within the remote sensing community about the information contained in the time series of near surface soil moisture versus root zone soil moisture while significant efforts have been devoted to estimation of the root zone soil moisture from near surface soil moisture e g albergel et al 2008 manfreda et al 2014 faridani et al 2016 there is a strong presumption that root zone soil moisture contains information not extractable from near surface soil moisture observations in line with recent empirical findings that challenged this presumption qiu et al 2014 2016 tayfur et al 2014 our theoretical analysis and validation results allay such concerns about near surface observations equation 15 provides a solid mathematical indication for the recent findings of koster et al 2018 that near surface soil moisture time series contain information that can be used to estimate surface water fluxes in the following we challenge a few common philosophies regarding near surface soil moisture 1 it is commonly assumed that near surface soil moisture observations become decoupled from deeper soil moisture at drier states and this decoupling limits the utility of near surface observations for hydrological purposes capehart and carlson 1997 we note that the decoupling of near surface soil moisture from deeper layers can be simulated with flow models such as coupled equations of liquid water water vapor flow sadeghi et al 2014 hence near surface soil moisture history time series of even a dry surface fed into an appropriate flow model will suffice for estimation of either root zone soil moisture or soil evaporative fluxes 2 it is commonly assumed that near surface soil moisture observations are not correlated with plant transpiration in deeply rooted soils e g albergel et al 2008 as we discussed earlier soil evaporation and plant transpiration are highly correlated especially during the first stage of evaporation philip 1957 therefore near surface soil moisture observations that are highly correlated with surface evaporation may also contain information about plant transpiration results shown in fig 10 for the tonzi ranch site provide strong evidence for this hypothesis 3 because water flux is highly correlated with soil moisture temporal variation it may be wrongly assumed that when the surface soil is fully saturated information about water flux will be lost or the resultant flux is zero this is not the case because according to richards equation infiltration can occur through a saturated surface layer at a rate equal to the drainage flux from the bottom of the layer we note that although near surface soil moisture contains adequate information about infiltration it will stop informing about precipitation when saturated as their physical connection will be lost this case has been a major source of error when soil moisture observations were utilized to enhance precipitation data e g crow et al 2011 koster et al 2018 and it is the most likely reason for underestimation of the peak precipitation events illustrated in figs 2 4 6 and 7 these results suggest that soil moisture is more physically connected to net land atmosphere water exchange than to precipitation we expect that the success of precipitation estimation models based on soil moisture observations brocca et al 2014 koster et al 2016 is owed to the strong statistical relationship between precipitation and net water flux 6 summary and conclusions a new analytical model for calculation of land surface net water flux i e infiltration minus evapotranspiration from near surface soil moisture data was derived the model described in eq 15 involves only two parameters the soil water diffusivity d and the proportionality coefficient k between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and volumetric moisture content the model was derived via inversion of warrick s 1975 solution to the linearized richards equation for arbitrary time varying surface flux boundary conditions the model derivation relies on several simplifying assumptions nonetheless it reasonably captures near surface soil moisture and surface net water flux dynamics for natural settings including layered and vegetated soils although initial condition effects were neglected in the solution no bias was observed at early simulation times owing to the fact that near surface soil moisture evolves from its initial status after a relatively short period of time the model proved to be applicable for a wide range of soil types and climatic conditions with a slightly lower prediction accuracy for extremely dry or wet conditions in addition to its simplicity the advantage of the new model when compared to more complex numerical models such as hydrus 1d is its amenability for calculation of land surface net water flux directly and solely from near surface soil moisture data the model can be parameterized without calibration k arbitrary and d from eq 20 hence it provides an unprecedented opportunity for potential large scale estimations of land surface net water flux from remotely sensed near surface soil moisture data the extent to which the proposed model can be used for large scale flux estimation will depend on various factors including soil and land cover heterogeneity spatial resolution and temporal sampling of the soil moisture data this remains a question for feature research acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge funding from national science foundation nsf grants no

6689,the accurate determination of land surface water fluxes at various spatiotemporal scales remains a challenge in hydrological sciences it is intuitive that land surface net water flux i e infiltration minus evapotranspiration directly affects near surface soil moisture however there exists no hydrological model suitable to calculate net water flux based on measured near surface soil moisture data this is a consequence of the mathematical structure of existing models that use boundary conditions to determine internal conditions whereas what is needed is a model amenable to use near surface soil moisture data an internal condition to determine the surface water flux a boundary condition to pursue the idea of utilizing remotely sensed or in situ i e sensor networks near surface soil moisture data for estimation of net water flux we derived an analytical model via inversion of warrick s 1975 analytical solution to the linearized richards equation for arbitrary time varying surface flux boundary conditions the applicability of the new analytical solution was evaluated based on actual water flux observations as well as hydrus 1d simulations for four vastly different sites in arizona california idaho and indiana our results demonstrate that the proposed model reasonably captures net water flux variations in natural settings including layered and vegetated soils especially at larger time scales e g monthly while the model works for a wide range of climatic conditions the prediction accuracy is somewhat lower for extreme dry or wet conditions a major advantage of the new model is that it does not require calibration which provides an unprecedented opportunity for large scale estimation of land surface net water flux using remotely sensed near surface soil moisture observations keywords analytical model richards equation infiltration evapotranspiration remote sensing near surface soil moisture 1 introduction and motivation hydrological fluxes connect the water energy and biogeochemical cycles and are affected by anthropogenic forcing on the water cycle fundamental gaps exist in understanding patterns and dynamics of these fluxes for large regions according to the national research council 2012 ground based and remote sensing observations and modeling are key to filling these knowledge gaps two critical hydrological fluxes at the land surface are infiltration i i e precipitation minus surface runoff and evapotranspiration et combined these processes yield net water flux f i et which determines the terrestrial water balance i e gain or loss of subsurface water resources accurate determination of the net water flux at various spatiotemporal scales is a remaining challenge in hydrological sciences energy balance and water balance are the two general approaches for estimation of surface hydrological fluxes the widely applied eddy covariance method is considered the standard energy balance approach determining the latent heat flux actual et as a residual of the energy balance equation wilson et al 2001 this method currently applied at global fluxnet sites baldocchi et al 2001 requires complex and expensive instrumentation as well as a number of corrections that are often ill defined and empirical allen et al 2011 while energy balance methods provide only et estimates water balance calculations yield both i and et fluxes among the water balance methods lysimetry is the most accurate as it directly measures any water gain or loss however weighing lysimeters are expensive to build and maintain and they are only applicable for measurements at small spatial scales rapidly advancing soil moisture θ sensing technology provides an alternative means to close the water balance in recent years numerous national and international in situ θ monitoring networks e g scan schaefer et al 2007 crn coopersmith et al 2015 cosmos zreda et al 2008 ismn dorigo et al 2011 have been established providing unique opportunities for estimation of the net water flux with the water balance approach applying near surface θ data e g 0 5 cm is of special interest as such data are not only available from point scale in situ measurements vaz et al 2013 but also from airborne and satellite remote sensing observations at watershed moran et al 2004 sadeghi et al 2017 babaeian et al 2018 and global scales kerr et al 2001 entekhabi et al 2010 wagner et al 2013 there is an obvious connection between land surface net water flux and near surface θ however there exists no hydrological model that can calculate net water flux based on measured near surface soil moisture data this is a consequence of the mathematical structure of existing analytical e g warrick 1975 warrick et al 1991 chen et al 2001 menziani et al 2007 and numerical e g hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 models that use boundary conditions to determine internal conditions whereas what is needed is a model amenable to use near surface soil moisture data an internal condition to determine the surface water flux a boundary condition motivated by advances in airborne and satellite remote sensing of large scale near surface soil moisture recent efforts have been devoted to convert soil moisture time series retrievals to either precipitation brocca et al 2013 2014 ciabatta et al 2015 koster et al 2016 2018 or soil moisture loss which is the aggregated impact of evapotranspiration and internal drainage koster et al 2017 akbar et al 2018 these models are mainly based on simple mass balance and empirical equations and lack a rigorous mathematical solution to the governing soil water flow equation this is why they commonly need extensive calibration to advance the understanding of the land surface water dynamics here we present a novel analytical model for calculation of the net water flux from near surface soil moisture data the proposed model was derived via inversion of warrick s 1975 analytical solution to the linearized richards equation for arbitrary time varying surface flux boundary conditions the proposed model can be parameterized without the need for calibration with measured data 2 model derivation the diffusivity form of the richards equation is given as 1 θ t z d θ z k where θ is volumetric soil moisture content d is the soil water diffusivity k is unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity t is time and z is soil depth assuming d is a constant and k a linear function of θ 2 k k θ the linearized richards equation is obtained 3 θ t d 2 θ z 2 k θ z our new approach relies on warrick s 1975 analytical solution to eq 3 subject to the following boundary and initial conditions 4a d θ z k z 0 f t 4b limit z θ z t θ 4c θ z 0 θ i z θ 1 g z where f and g can be any arbitrary functions of time and depth respectively θi is the initial soil moisture content and θ is the limiting soil moisture content at large depths that is equivalent to the long term average soil moisture along the soil profile with the following normalized variables 5 z kz d 6 t k 2 t d 7 θ θ θ θ e 0 5 z 0 25 t 8 f f k θ k θ warrick s 1975 solution can be written as 9 θ z t θ bc z t θ ic z t where θ bc is due to the

moisture near the surface evolves from its initial status after a short period of time especially when precipitation is high and et is low capehart and carlson 1994 hence for the sake of simplicity we assume that θi θ yielding θ ic 0 this assumption simplifies the application of this method especially at larger scales and where information on the soil moisture profile is lacking we consider n time steps of δt and assume a constant surface net water flux at each time step 12 f t f 1 0 t δ t f 2 δ t t 2 δ t f n n 1 δ t t n δ t for this case eq 10 yields warrick 1975 13 θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u

warrick s 1975 solution presented above is for calculation of soil moisture at any depth and time when the surface net water flux is known in this study however we are interested in the inverse calculation i e the surface flux in terms of the soil moisture hence we invert eq 13 to analytically calculate net water flux f or f at any time t nδt from measured soil moisture data θ yielding θ through eq 7 15 f n θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t u z δ t n 1 t δ t f 1 θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u z t u z δ t n 2 t 2 δ t f n 1 1 u z δ t θ n z e 0 5 z 0 25 t f 1 u z t i 3 n f i 1 f i 2 u z n i 2 δ t n 2 t n δ t note that surface net water flux will be best predicted with near surface soil moisture data because the response to the surface flux is dampened with depth this means a significant change in surface flux only results in a small change in soil moisture at large depths shown in fig 1 for a sinusoidal surface boundary condition this is why the new analytical model is practical for near surface soil moisture data only 3 model calibration and validation to examine the applicability of eq 15 for calculation of land surface net water flux from near surface soil moisture data we used measured data from four sites located in different regions of the u s arizona california idaho and indiana covering a broad range of soil types and climatic and land cover conditions the data include 5 cm soil moisture information from in situ sensors actual evapotranspiration et from eddy covariance towers and precipitation p from weather stations because of the lack of actual infiltration data it was assumed that precipitation equals infiltration i e runoff is neglected however note that the new model yields the actual infiltration rate and not the precipitation input we compared water flux calculated with eq 15 with the observed net water flux defined as f p et for the comparisons between measured and estimated data we used the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and bias defined as 1 σ where σ is slope of the regression line with zero intercept fitted to the estimated versus measured data araya lópez et al 2018 as discussed in the following section parametrization of the proposed model without calibration is feasible however to gain insight into the model parameters d and k and model performance with and without calibration we first calibrated the model with measured water flux data we applied the global simulated annealing optimization algorithm contained in the matlab optimization toolboxtm release 2018a the mathworks inc natick massachusetts usa for model calibration and minimized the rmse between the measured and calculated θ derived from measured water fluxes with eq 13 with the optimized model parameters we then inversely calculated f from measured θ data with eq 15 for this analysis θ was directly calculated as the average of all measured θ data 3 1 test site i tonzi ranch california the tonzi ranch site is located in a flat area of the willow creek watershed in eastern california with a mediterranean climate an average annual temperature of 16 c and an average precipitation of 560 mm at this site the land surface is covered with oak savanna mixed forests grasslands and shrublands and the dominant soil texture is sandy clay loam with low organic matter content additional information about this site is provided in baldocchi 2016 the best fit of eq 13 d 152 7 cm2 d 1 and k 0 148 cm d 1 to 14 years of measured soil moisture data is shown in fig 2 top although several simplifying assumptions were applied for derivation of eq 13 good agreement can be observed between measured and calculated θ data leading to reasonable agreement between measured and calculated f fig 2 bottom the differences can be partially attributed to the simplifying assumptions of the analytical model eq 15 e g neglecting root water uptake at this vegetated site however there are several other potential error sources such as the measurement sensing errors of the reference data themselves and the scale and location mismatch between soil moisture et and precipitation measurements because of the lack of information about actual infiltration rates precipitation data were used for model estimates of infiltration rates instead this might introduce some uncertainty because potential surface runoff is not taken into account to better understand the attribution of the observed discrepancies to the simplifying modeling assumptions we simulated θ and f dynamics with the more sophisticated hydrus 1d code šimůnek et al 2016 that solves the nonlinear richards equation eq 1 a sink term feddes et al 1978 to account for root water uptake as well as vapor flow dynamics were considered a uniform soil profile parameterized with van genuchten s 1980 soil hydraulic functions was assumed the soil profile was discretized using 1 cm increments free drainage was assumed for the bottom boundary at 100 cm depth the measured water fluxes precipitation and actual et were used as the input surface boundary conditions the initial condition was set to θi θ the van genuchten model parameters were optimized to best fit hydrus 1d simulations to the measured soil moisture data at the 5 cm depth note that et inputs in hydrus 1d are considered as potential not actual hence we specified a high value 106 cm for the critical pressure head at the surface to maintain stage i evaporation i e actual et potential et during the simulation fig 3 depicts a comparison between the analytical model eq 13 or 15 and hydrus 1d simulations high correlations are shown between the two models about 85 of variations of both θ and f from the sophisticated hydrus 1d model could be captured with the analytical model this indicates that the simplifying assumptions used for model derivations e g linearized richards equation homogeneous soil profile uniform initial condition no root water uptake no vapor flow do not significantly affect the analytical model s applicability and most of the scattering observed in fig 2 bottom right is mainly due to the other potential error sources discussed above 3 2 test site ii lower sage idaho to evaluate how the new analytical model performs for a distinctly layered soil profile we used data from the lower sage site located in the reynolds creek experimental watershed in southwestern idaho the site is located at an altitude of 1600 m and is part of the reynolds creek critical zone observatory czo the climatic conditions range from arid to temperate the mean annual temperature and precipitation for the lower sage site are 8 5 c and 345 mm respectively the site is grazed by cattle and covered with sagebrush the soil profile is distinctly layered with textures ranging from sandy clay loam to clay and has an average rock content of 0 25 m3 m 3 for further information about this site readers are referred to fellows et al 2017 and parajuli et al 2019 the analytical model performance for the lower sage site is depicted in fig 4 a good agreement is observed between the measured and calculated θ fig 4 top the agreement for f is slightly biased but still reasonable when considering that the analytical model neglects several factors such as the spatial variability i e soil layering and rock inclusions root water uptake and soil freezing thawing that affect water flow at this site as discussed above other error sources tied to the reference data themselves could potentially contribute to the observed deviations between measured and modeled f to quantify errors due to the model s simplifying assumptions we again simulated θ and f time series with hydrus 1d a 5 layer soil profile each layer quantified with van genuchten s 1980 soil hydraulic functions was assumed the soil profile was discretized with 1 cm increments free drainage was assumed for the bottom boundary at 200 cm depth the measured precipitation and actual et were used to quantify the input surface boundary conditions the moisture measurements in 5 15 30 60 and 90 cm depths from october 1 2014 i e t 0 in fig 4 were used as initial conditions the van genuchten parameters for each layer were optimized with inverse hydrus 1d simulations such that model predictions simultaneously best fit the measured θ data at depths of 5 15 30 60 and 90 cm root water uptake and vapor flow were also considered results of this analysis are shown in fig 5 again a high correlation between the analytical model and hydrus 1d simulations can be observed about 87 of soil moisture variations and 77 of water flux variations from the hydrus 1d simulations were captured with the analytical model eq 13 or 15 which indicates that despite the simplifying assumptions the analytical model is also applicable for highly heterogeneous soil profiles 3 3 test site iii kendall arizona the results for the tonzi ranch and lower sage sites presented above indicate that the analytical model tends to overestimate soil moisture in dry seasons one potential explanation for the observed deviations is that significant non isothermal water and vapor flow which are not accounted for in the linearized richards equation occur under dry and warm conditions hence we next challenged the new analytical model with data from the semiarid kendall site located in the walnut gulch experimental watershed in southeastern arizona at the kendall site the average annual air temperature is 17 7 c the annual precipitation amounts to 350 mm and the annual potential et is 2600 mm the site is predominantly covered with shrubs and grasses the major soil textures are sandy loam and gravelly loam with low organic matter content additional information about this site is provided in keefer et al 2008 results for the kendall site are depicted in fig 6 the new analytical model does not capture the measured 5 cm depth θ time series well especially during dry periods as mentioned these deviations can be potentially attributed to significant non isothermal flows which are expected in such warm and dry environments accordingly the proposed model for f eq 15 is less accurate for this site when compared to the tonzi ranch and lower sage sites the model tends to underestimate f which likely stems from the simplifying model assumptions the bias may also be due to significant surface runoff during the heavy summer monsoon storms common in this region i e the actual infiltration rate is lower than measured precipitation 3 4 site case iv morgan monroe indiana the linearized richards equation does not apply to oversaturated soils when a positive pressure head exists a potential source of the analytical model prediction error in extremely wet environments to evaluate the analytical model performance under humid conditions we used measured θ and f data from the morgan monroe site located northeast of bloomington indiana the site is covered with a broadleaf deciduous forest the climate is humid sub tropical with an average annual air temperature of 10 8 c and annual precipitation of 1032 mm the average elevation is 275 m above sea level and the surface topography comprises moderate hills with well drained clay loam soils further information about this site can be found in brzostek et al 2014 results for the morgan monroe site are depicted in fig 7 the θ estimates based on eq 13 vary within a narrower range than the measured values this is mainly because of the large optimized d value obtained from matching the soil moisture spikes after high intensity precipitation events the proposed f model eq 15 reasonably captured the measured flux variations r2 0 293 with a model bias towards flux underestimation the bias likely stems from the neglect of surface runoff which is expected under these hilly and wet conditions furthermore upward water flux from shallow water tables which is common in wet regions is another potential source of error 4 calibration free model parametrization 4 1 approach as shown above calibration of the analytical model parameters d and k relies on the availability of measured water flux data this limits the applicability of the model especially for large scales to circumvent this limitation we introduce a method for calibration free parametrization of eq 15 sensitivity of the net water flux values calculated with eq 15 to variations in d and k is depicted in fig 8 for the measured soil moisture time series from the tonzi ranch site the f estimates based on arbitrary values of k and the calibrated d values are nearly the same as the estimates based on calibrated values for both k and d the f estimates using arbitrary values of d and calibrated k values are biased compared to but highly correlated with estimates based on calibrated k and d values therefore an arbitrary k within a typical range should suffice for parameterization of eq 15 calculation of an optimum d value for unbiased f estimation follows as results indicate the ratio k d is typically a very small number in cm 1 leading to very small typical values of z and t for z 0 near surface and t 0 1 equivalent to t 274 years for d 100 cm2 d 1 and k 0 01 cm d 1 we empirically found that function u in eq 14 can be closely approximated with 16 u t t from eq 16 the surface soil moisture θsur due to a constant net water flux f can be approximated as 17 θ sur t θ θ f t based on eq 17 6 and 8 we may approximate the maximum soil moisture θ max at a given location from a maximum water flux f max or f max occurring at time t max and its relationship to k and d 18 θ max θ θ f max t max f max k θ k θ k 2 t max d assuming f max kθ eq 18 yields 19 d t max θ max θ 2 f max 2 equation 19 was shown to be valid for the four evaluation sites with different random values of d and k therefore for a given location constant θ max θ and t max an invariant linear relationship between d used in eq 15 and the resulting f max 2 is expected therefore we suggest the following equation to estimate d for a given location 20 d d f max f max 2 in this equation d is an initial guess for diffusivity e g an arbitrary value of 100 cm2 d 1 which applied in conjunction with an arbitrary k e g 0 01 cm d 1 in eq 15 yields an initial guess for the maximum water flux f max equation 20 allows estimation of a diffusivity value d corresponding to the actual maximum water flux measured during the period of interest f max from the initial guesses d and f max note that f max is the only site specific information required for this calibration free parameterization method 4 2 results for daily fluxes the calibration free parameterization approach was evaluated for the four sites discussed above first we calculated f with eq 15 with arbitrary parameters of d 100 cm2 d 1 and k 0 01 cm d 1 then we calculated d with eq 20 and recalculated f with eq 15 with k 0 01 cm d 1 and the newly calculated d results of this analysis are presented in fig 9 the accuracy of the estimates in terms of r2 and rmse is comparable to that of the calibrated model figs 2 to 7 the bias for the calibration free model is even less than that of the calibrated model this is mainly due to the incorporation of the maximum measured water flux f max used for calculating d with eq 20 it should be noted that the calibration free parametrization introduced here is appropriate for the inverse calculation only i e calculation of f θ with eq 15 the forward calculation with eq 13 using the same parameters does not necessarily yield good θ estimates 4 3 results for monthly fluxes monthly water fluxes are also important for water cycle studies especially at larger scales intuitively simulation of daily fluxes should be more challenging than for monthly fluxes as data uncertainties are significantly lower at the monthly time scale however it was unclear how well the richards equation originally developed for instantaneous soil water flow would work at monthly time scales hence we tested the new analytical model eq 15 for calculation of monthly net water flux at the four study sites we integrated the daily data over each month then smoothed the data over a 3 month window using a gaussian filter to further remove random variations i e keeping seasonality only to apply the analytical model parameterized based on the calibration free approach we first calculated f with eq 15 with arbitrary parameters of d 3000 cm2 month 1 and k 0 3 cm month 1 then we calculated d with eq 20 and recalculated f with eq 15 with k 0 3 cm month 1 and the newly calculated d the monthly flux estimates are presented in fig 10 revealing the estimates at all sites being significantly better than for the daily flux estimates see fig 9 these results present strong evidence for validity of the richards equation based flux model for monthly time scales correlations at the tonzi ranch site are remarkable r2 0 842 this reveals that richards equation even without the sink term may be adequately applied to vegetated soils this may be justified by the fact that soil evaporation and plant transpiration are highly correlated in wet regions where evaporation remains mostly near stage i philip 1957 correlations at the other sites are moderate due to various sources of uncertainty discussed previously 5 discussion about the value of near surface soil moisture observations because most remote sensing techniques only capture a shallow surface layer there is an ongoing debate within the remote sensing community about the information contained in the time series of near surface soil moisture versus root zone soil moisture while significant efforts have been devoted to estimation of the root zone soil moisture from near surface soil moisture e g albergel et al 2008 manfreda et al 2014 faridani et al 2016 there is a strong presumption that root zone soil moisture contains information not extractable from near surface soil moisture observations in line with recent empirical findings that challenged this presumption qiu et al 2014 2016 tayfur et al 2014 our theoretical analysis and validation results allay such concerns about near surface observations equation 15 provides a solid mathematical indication for the recent findings of koster et al 2018 that near surface soil moisture time series contain information that can be used to estimate surface water fluxes in the following we challenge a few common philosophies regarding near surface soil moisture 1 it is commonly assumed that near surface soil moisture observations become decoupled from deeper soil moisture at drier states and this decoupling limits the utility of near surface observations for hydrological purposes capehart and carlson 1997 we note that the decoupling of near surface soil moisture from deeper layers can be simulated with flow models such as coupled equations of liquid water water vapor flow sadeghi et al 2014 hence near surface soil moisture history time series of even a dry surface fed into an appropriate flow model will suffice for estimation of either root zone soil moisture or soil evaporative fluxes 2 it is commonly assumed that near surface soil moisture observations are not correlated with plant transpiration in deeply rooted soils e g albergel et al 2008 as we discussed earlier soil evaporation and plant transpiration are highly correlated especially during the first stage of evaporation philip 1957 therefore near surface soil moisture observations that are highly correlated with surface evaporation may also contain information about plant transpiration results shown in fig 10 for the tonzi ranch site provide strong evidence for this hypothesis 3 because water flux is highly correlated with soil moisture temporal variation it may be wrongly assumed that when the surface soil is fully saturated information about water flux will be lost or the resultant flux is zero this is not the case because according to richards equation infiltration can occur through a saturated surface layer at a rate equal to the drainage flux from the bottom of the layer we note that although near surface soil moisture contains adequate information about infiltration it will stop informing about precipitation when saturated as their physical connection will be lost this case has been a major source of error when soil moisture observations were utilized to enhance precipitation data e g crow et al 2011 koster et al 2018 and it is the most likely reason for underestimation of the peak precipitation events illustrated in figs 2 4 6 and 7 these results suggest that soil moisture is more physically connected to net land atmosphere water exchange than to precipitation we expect that the success of precipitation estimation models based on soil moisture observations brocca et al 2014 koster et al 2016 is owed to the strong statistical relationship between precipitation and net water flux 6 summary and conclusions a new analytical model for calculation of land surface net water flux i e infiltration minus evapotranspiration from near surface soil moisture data was derived the model described in eq 15 involves only two parameters the soil water diffusivity d and the proportionality coefficient k between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and volumetric moisture content the model was derived via inversion of warrick s 1975 solution to the linearized richards equation for arbitrary time varying surface flux boundary conditions the model derivation relies on several simplifying assumptions nonetheless it reasonably captures near surface soil moisture and surface net water flux dynamics for natural settings including layered and vegetated soils although initial condition effects were neglected in the solution no bias was observed at early simulation times owing to the fact that near surface soil moisture evolves from its initial status after a relatively short period of time the model proved to be applicable for a wide range of soil types and climatic conditions with a slightly lower prediction accuracy for extremely dry or wet conditions in addition to its simplicity the advantage of the new model when compared to more complex numerical models such as hydrus 1d is its amenability for calculation of land surface net water flux directly and solely from near surface soil moisture data the model can be parameterized without calibration k arbitrary and d from eq 20 hence it provides an unprecedented opportunity for potential large scale estimations of land surface net water flux from remotely sensed near surface soil moisture data the extent to which the proposed model can be used for large scale flux estimation will depend on various factors including soil and land cover heterogeneity spatial resolution and temporal sampling of the soil moisture data this remains a question for feature research acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge funding from national science foundation nsf grants no
