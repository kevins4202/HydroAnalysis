24175,agrobacteria is a type of microorganism capable of transferring a fragment of its dna t dna into plant genome that consequently leads to tumor degeneration of transformed cell being an evolutionary process devoted to survivance and multiplication of bacterial population on the other hand it is pathogenic to the attacked plant however some transformed individuals have not merely survived but spread their genes and replaced their not transformed relatives the purpose of the article is to make an assumption explaining a possible reason of such event the hypothesis emphasizes on the change of sexual reproduction options among transformed plants three possible situations are described in the article switch from cross pollination to self pollination prezygotic incompatibility and postzygotic incompatibility the results have shown that the most probable and logical situation is a break of self incompatibility mechanism and self pollination domination among transformed plants the findings suggest this approach could also be useful for maladaptive traits simulation that change organism s sexual reproduction options keywords agrobacterial transformation t dna insertion modeling of evolutionary processes maladaptive traits plant population data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the spread of maladaptive traits in populations is a very difficult not fully resolved problem in modern biology one of the first who worked on this issue was s wright alongside with r a fisher and j b s haldane s wright had founded population genetics he had introduced two concepts that worth mentioning in this work the first is genetic drift a change in allele frequency among population due to random reasons his experiments have shown the smaller population the more genetic drift influences it wright 1931 moreover s wright was the chief developer of an adaptive landscape temporary decrease in adaptivity leave local adaptive peak caused by stochastic mechanisms and mutations could allow population reach an adaptation maximum this can explain the appearance of non adaptive traits among multiple organisms however there are examples of negative traits that cannot be explained by random processes one such example is a multiple fixation of agrobacterial transformation in the genomes of plants from different families nicotiana white et al 1983 linaria matveeva et al 2012 ipomoea kyndt et al 2015 etc matveeva and otten 2019 it was found that representatives of these families have dna regions homologous to the t dna of agrobacterium rhizogenes the sequences of genes included in ct dna cellular t dna of linaria vulgaris vladimirov et al 2019 and nicotiana glauca suzuki et al 2002 have been studied in detail in addition the rolc gene suzuki et al 2002 is the most conservative in several plant species pavlova 2013 worth mentioning that this agrotransformation leads to severe morphogenetic consequences of plants in terms of evolution it is beneficial only to bacteria it is assumed that the first transgenic plant originated from the regeneration of the root of a naturally infected plant chen and otten 2017 this happened as a result of horizontal transfer of a fragment of agrobacterial dna t dna into the plant genome followed by tumor degeneration of transformed cells normally t dna is not inherited since it does not enter the generative cell line infected plants nevertheless cases of the spread of less adapted plants with a t dna insert in the population have occurred many times to finally gain a foothold new transgenic plant had to pass on their ct dna to their offspring and successfully compete with non transgenic relatives according to chen and otten 2017 a natural transgenic plant could not survive without reproductive isolation sympatric speciation later the need for reproductive isolation may have disappeared when enough differences have accumulated to prevent hybridization with ancestral species this would lead to a counter selection of ct dna genes that were important for speciation especially if they reduced growth and reproduction selection to reduce the negative effects of ct dna could also occur in other parts of the plant genome chen and otten 2017 however the acquisition of t dna by many genera and species of plants white et al 1983 matveeva et al 2012 kyndt et al 2015 matveeva and otten 2019 growing in completely different environmental conditions multiple and independent repeated absorption of the t dna insert by the same plant species chen et al 2014 replication and distribution of t dna in genome vladimirov et al 2019 as well as the significant prevalence of this phenomenon in nature matveeva and otten 2019 make it possible to doubt the randomness of the chain of unique events previously assumed chen and otten 2017 during the t dna capture it is believed that for further spread t dna containing plants had to have some advantages or structural features that would allow them to gain a foothold in the population tepfer 1983 meyer et al 1995 hypotheses below explain the phenomenon of plants with t dna insert distribution in the population 1 1 hypothesis 1 stability of the root system in a dry climate the hypothesis about the effect of ct dna on the root mass was first described by suzuki suzuki et al 2002 it has been suggested that increasing root mass may be beneficial for arid conditions tolerance ancient transformed plants with an increased root mass may have demonstrated an increased adaptability to a dry environment thus surviving in arid conditions tanaka 2008 this hypothesis is rather weak for the following reasons firstly the phenomenon occurs among plants from different ecological niches for example for vaccinium matveeva and otten 2019 an increase in suction area of the root system is not an adaptive trait secondly the capture of the insert among different species was carried out repeatedly chen et al 2014 the biological significance of the root s high hairiness is doubtful lastly the size of root system can be easily increased by simpler evolutionary genetic mechanisms mutations of regulatory regions a greater response of root growth to auxins etc 1 2 hypothesis 2 increased ability to regenerate the high regenerative capacity of transformed plants may be one of the prerequisites for the natural appearance of species containing agrobacterial dna in their genomes in this case it is expected that the offspring of the transformed plants will retain this ability another hypothesis suggests the influence of ct dna on endogenous hormonal metabolism which can change the characteristics of regeneration processes ichikawa et al 1990 to study the ability of various plants to regenerate representatives of both inserted and non inserted plants nicotiana linaria ipomoea were selected in vitro experiments have shown that plants with ct dna have a higher rate of regeneration from isolated organs than plants without insertion moreover the formation of calli and shoots on explants in l vulgaris was observed even in a hormone free environment matveeva 2018 in addition an experiment carried out on tobacco showed that plants transformed with a rhizogenes a4 spontaneously formed shoots from roots when grown in pots in contrast to common tobacco tepfer 1984 since all the studied species have a high regenerative potential this apparently allowed the transformed tissues hairy roots to regenerate spontaneously but this would hardly help to compete with plants without t dna 1 3 hypothesis 3 life cycles it has been suggested that insertion of ct dna can convert biennial plants into annuals this possibility was experimentally shown for cichorium intybus and daucus carota transformed with rolc or wild type pri limami et al 1998 such features of the life cycle can bring evolutionary benefits due to the wider distribution of transgenic plants compared to their non transformed relatives in absence of cold weather conditions early flowering can allow new ecotypes to expand their range however biennial species were not found in the genera nicotiana ipomoea and linaria all these plants are perennial matveeva and sokornova 2017 1 4 hypothesis 4 getting immunity in addition to altering plant growth the expression of the ct dna gene can provide immunity to agrobacteria by silencing the incoming t dna escobar et al 2001 however with regard to tomentosae and nicotiana agrobacterium were able to re infect already transformed species that contradicts this assumption chen and otten 2017 1 5 hypothesis 5 useful plant microbial interactions this assumption concerns the first stage of beneficial plant microbial interactions plants containing ct dna can potentially support bacteria of certain species in their rhizosphere by exudating opines in the root zone the large number of potentially beneficial bacteria around the root can affect the root microbiome and have nutritional or protective properties oger et al 1997 oger et al 2000 however this hypothesis does not hold water after all the genes encoding the decay of opines are located on the same ti or ri plasmid but outside the t dna consequently the opines secreted by the transgenic cell are metabolized only by agrobacteria possessing a ti ri plasmid or a derivative plasmid similar to that which transformed plant tissue this gives a selective advantage to such bacteria and creates a kind of ecological niche for pathogenic agrobacterium strains oger et al 1997 oger et al 2000 1 6 hypothesis 6 secondary metabolites the most common biologically active secondary plant metabolites include glycosides alkaloids polyphenols flavonoids terpenoids coumarins saponins and essential oils all these chemical groups can be efficiently synthesized in hairy root cultures matveeva and sokornova 2016 under natural conditions these compounds are of great importance for the protection of plants from various environmental factors as well as for the interaction of plants with various organisms biologically active compounds produced by naturally transgenic plants belong to different chemical groups they are not unique for some species and are synthesized in noticeable quantities by various representatives of the same genera and families matveeva 2018 however there is currently no direct evidence that ct dna genes in natural transformants alter the secondary metabolism of plants thus above mentioned hypotheses are based on reasoning t dna presence adaptability the assumption introduced in this work on the other hand emphasizes on negative effect of the t dna insert on plants though explains its distribution in population plants that have undergone agrobacterial transformation belong to flowering plants such plants reproduce by cross pollination and self pollination the main task of cross pollination is the exchange of genetic material between organisms of the same species and as a consequence ensuring diversity maintaining a high level of heterozygotes and determining the unity and integrity of the species demyanova 2010 this way of pollination is the most optimal and most widespread it is typical for almost 90 of higher plants in addition there are morphological and physiological adaptations that limit self pollination and contribute to cross pollination separation of the sexes dichogamy heterostyly the phenomenon of self incompatibility etc self incompatibility the inability of a fertile hermaphrodite plant to produce viable seeds when self pollinated is the main and most effective mechanism for preventing self pollination in flowering plants there are sporophytic and gametophytic self incompatibility control systems both of them suppress the development of the pollen tube at different stages of its formation vishnyakova 1997 interestingly with a sporophytic control system callose is released on the surface of the stigma during contact with the pollen grain which prevents the penetration of the pollen tube into the tissue of the column recognition occurs by tryphin proteins meshkov et al 2007 what if change in biochemical reaction in transgenic plants leads to break of self incompatibility mechanism that could enhance self pollination among transgenic plants to confirm this assumption rolc gene function of t dna insert was studied in detail it is considered this gene to have two main functions 1 oncogenic associated with the hydrolysis of cytokinin beta glucosides and the release of active cytokinins plant hormones which is based on the conclusions estruch et al 1991a but later refuted faiss et al 1996 2 secondary metabolites activation in transformed tissues bulgakov et al 2004 nevertheless there is a contradiction between the postulated functions of the rolc gene and the features of its work and regulation 1 the gene is located under the sugar sensitive promoter yokoyama et al 1994 and its product is present only in the vascular tissue sieve tubes and satellite cells why do phloem elements need oncogenic activity and synthesis of secondary metabolites it is still unknown 2 activation of the synthesis of secondary plant metabolites many of which have antimicrobial activity should suppress the growth and development of agrobacteria more logical seems the function of rolc as a blocker of the callose plugs formation these plugs should be formed during tumor growth as a protective reaction of the plant against nutrient loss beta gluconase activity of the rolc gene product has been shown estruch et al 1991a and callose belongs to β glycans 1 7 the proposed role of the rolc gene in transgenic plants therefore the function of the rolc gene in transgenic plants could be to prevent callose or similar polysaccharide plugs formation that block phloem transport into infected tissues as it was mentioned earlier the sporophytic type of self incompatibility ensures callose formation on stigma surface which prevents the growth of the pollen tube it is possible that in transgenic plants with the rolc gene the formation of callose or similar polysaccharide plugs is blocked it ultimately leads to a breakdown of the self incompatibility mechanism and transition to self pollination finally computer simulation described below made it possible to understand how self pollination gives an advantage in reproduction even to less adapted plants 2 methods consider a population model consisting of three genotypes ii iw ww where i infected is the designation for the mutant gene and w is wildtype iw genotype organisms are heterozygotes the distribution of genotypes in every following generation can be expressed as follows p i 1 p i 1 2 h i 2 h i 1 2 p i 1 2 h i q i 1 2 h i q i 1 q i 1 2 h i 2 where p h q are the proportions of plants with genotypes ii iw ww respectively the distribution of alleles under the condition of random crossing and the absence of external influence is described by the classical hardy weinberg principle in order to take into account self incompatibility it is necessary to subtract the probability of obtaining a genotype in a new generation when a plant is self pollinated modification that is needed to exclude self pollination p 1 p 0 1 2 h 0 2 1 n 2 p 0 1 2 h 0 h 1 2 p 0 1 2 h 0 q 0 1 2 h 0 1 n p 0 h 0 q 0 q 1 q 0 1 2 h 0 2 1 n 2 q 0 1 2 h 0 p 1 p 1 p 1 h 1 q 1 h 1 h 1 p 1 h 1 q 1 q 1 q 1 p 1 h 1 q 1 where n is a total number of plants in the population thus there is a dependence on the total number of plants in the observed population finally the switch to self pollination among plants with mutant gene i can be taken into account the proportion of plants undergoing self pollination is indicated by the coefficient k s p if k s p 1 all plants containing mutant gene will self pollinate k c p 1 k s p cross pollination coefficient the proportion of plants with mutant gene but participating in cross pollination the distribution of genotypes in the next generation can be expressed as follows p 1 k c p p 0 1 2 h 0 2 1 n 2 k c p p 0 1 2 h 0 k s p p 0 1 3 h 0 h 1 2 k c p p 0 k c p 1 2 h 0 q 0 k c p 1 2 h 0 k s p 1 3 h 0 q 1 q 0 k c p 1 2 h 0 2 1 n 2 k c p q 0 1 2 h 0 k s p 1 3 h 0 p 1 p 1 p 1 h 1 q 1 h 1 h 1 p 1 h 1 q 1 q 1 q 1 p 1 h 1 q 1 the lower fitness of plants carrying the mutant gene can be taken into account at each modeling step p i g p i 1 h i g h i 1 where g is the coefficient of viability since the subject of our interest is population dynamics when first mutant allele appears the initial distribution of genotypes is chosen as follows p 0 h 0 q 0 0 1 n 1 1 n thus the variability of the model is determined by three parameters k s p 0 1 g 0 1 n 1 3 results and discussion the behavior of the model was examined by iterating over the parameters g k s p n and fixing the number of generations required to reach the domination of the mutant allele 3 1 parameter enumeration results the results of enumeration of the parameters g k s p n show the limitations of the model firstly the fitness of organisms having mutant allele should be more than 0 8 g 0 8 in order to be able to dominate in the population secondly the population should be relatively small n t o t a l 170 for such trait to be fixed in it figs 1 3 the fig 4 shows the process of mutant allele capture in the plant population the limitations of this model include 1 the spatial characteristics of the population are not considered 2 all parameters are constant within one simulation 3 the behavior of a large population with a constant probability of a mutant gene insertion is not considered 4 conclusion the model of evolutionary processes was created in this work described model makes it possible to study the distribution of non adaptive traits the program investigates evolutionary events self incompatibility breakdown mechanism and the transition to self pollination included in the algorithm of this program was first implemented as a genetic algorithm when designing a model the model can also be used for maladaptive traits spread simulation that leads to change in allele frequency in the population declaration of

24176,we consider here forecasting models in ecology or in agronomy aiming at decision making based upon exceeding a quantitative threshold we address specifically how to link the intrinsic quality of the model its accuracy with its decisional quality ie its capacity to avoid false decisions and their associated costs the accuracy of the model can be evaluated by the ρ of the regression of observed values versus estimated ones or by the determination coefficient r 2 we show that the decisional quality depends not only of this accuracy but also of the threshold retained to make the decision as well as on the state of nature the two kinds of decisional errors consists either in deciding no action while an action is required false negatives or to act while it is useless false positives we also prove that the costs associated to those decisions depend also both of the accuracy of the model and of the value of the decision threshold keywords forecasting decision model quality model accuracy costs and benefits modelling data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction framework ecology environment crop protection halieutics and wildlife management use more and more forecasting models of diverse nature mechanistic deterministic models based upon ecosystemic processes knowledge stochastic models analysing random functions mixture of both such as sde stochastic differential equations or statistic regression models obtained either by classical multiple regressions or by more sophisticated modern methods based on ai artificial intelligence whatever the model s style we address here the particular and widespread case where the use of a forecasting model results in a decision of action based on a quantitative threshold when the prediction of the model exceeds the threshold an action is decided while in the inverse case the decision is not to do anything this procedure leads to two types of decisional errors the first one analogous to false positives in clinical research scannell and bosley 2016 is to decide an action while none is actually required the reverse one analogous to false negatives is to decide of no action while one would be required those two types of errors are also well known in the statistical theory of tests as the risks α and β agosta 2020 berger 1985 see also fig 1 we show here that the probabilities of these two failures and their associated costs depend of the statistical quality of the model also called accuracy petchey et al 2015 of course but also of the threshold accepted for the decision relatively to the states of nature actually in the totally unprobable case of a perfect model r 2 1 the probabilities of these two errors are null in the general case of an imperfect model however it is obvious that the rarer the cases of threshold overshooting the smaller is the probability of a positive decision as well as those of decisional errors and the associated costs the present short note aims at quantifying this question we restrict ourselves to the frequentist point of view although the bayesian one could be of strong interest especially if there is a need to question the model after a decision berger 1985 williams and hooten 2016 quality of ecological models we have to discuss in depth the concepts of statistical quality and of decisional quality and how they are linked most often the statistical quality of the models are measured by standard statistics such as the r 2 the corrected r 2 and various informational criteria derived from the akaike informational criterion aic aicc bic mallows c p etc planque et al 2022 went a bit further proposing a standard protocol to evaluate ecological models their analysis is very relevant but the question of the threshold is reduced to the question of defining the very threshold level in the match between observed and modelled patterns that can separate acceptable from unacceptable models from another point of view grimm et al 2020 present three questions to ask before using model output for decision support what is the model s purpose how is the model organised is there evidence the model works we address specifically the latter that these authors precise by what patterns can the model reproduce can the model make independent predictions and under what conditions we add also at what cost in what follows we suppose that the two first questions are firmly set a general framework linking statistical inference to the decision theory was however set comprehensively by williams and hooten 2016 the case of forecasting models deserves a special consideration petchey et al 2015 introduce the concept of ecological forecast horizon as the dimensional distance in space or time for which useful forecasts can be made they also distinguish several important other concepts accuracy precision uncertainty and forecast proficiency accuracy is the difference between an observed and a predicted value the actual criterion that we consider here high accuracy implies good prediction and low accuracy poor prediction accuracy is an important component of forecast proficiency we do not consider here neither their concept of precision nor that closely linked of uncertainty because both are associated to the lack of knowledge about the processes modelled in the study actually we take the forecasting model as it is judging only its performances on the decision process their definition of forecast proficiency is more fuzzy but leads to another useful concept the forecast proficiency threshold defined as the value of forecast proficiency above which forecasts are useful and below which forecasts are not useful all these concepts are of uttermost importance but do not address clearly the relationship between accuracy decision errors and cost of the errors what we try to do here chicco et al 2021 adds another question that of the definition of the cutoff threshold by maximising the quality of the confusion matrix itself here we suppose that the cut off threshold is defined by external expert considerations notably of cost we do not discuss the merits of this threshold which is supposed to be set outside the modelling process the confusion matrix central for the decision theory is the object named confusion matrix table 1 on this basis fielding and bell 1997 discuss the nature of prediction errors and subsequently evaluates a range of techniques that may be used to assess and compare prediction success their work focuses on the particular case of presence absence of a species in an area and defines as in clinical research two types of errors the false positive fp the species is decided present while it is not and the false negative fn the species is decided absent while it exists in the area of interest they note that the ecological literature seems to have paid little attention to how the partitioning method can influence the error rates so they address the question of the partitioning model accuracy in fig 2 of their work they address a problem very similar to our the influence of the cut point threshold of the three error rates false positive rate false negative rate and total misclassification rate they also evoke the concept of cost matrices given those definitions and limitations we analyse the consequences of the accuracy of the model on the quality of decision along with the associated costs this will be done on the bases of the confusion matrix as the major criterion of the decision quality 2 the problem let us suppose that we have at hand a predictive model which was validated by observations realised in the true life its quality can be evaluated by a statistical relation between predicted and observed data we suppose in what follows that the relation is linear unbiassed slope 1 and without intercept no intercept bias let us note x the bivector x y where x is the set of predicted values and y the set of observed values one expects often that the vector x follows a bivariate normal distribution whose probability density function is 1 φ x 1 2 π σ e 1 2 x t σ 1 x where x is the z score transform of the vector x x y x t is its transpose row vector σ the determinant of σ equals σ x σ y 1 ρ 2 of course x is calculated on each case before the realisation of the phenomenon and y is observed later for each value of x some possible generalisations other bivariate distributions may be considered in place of the normal one most of continuous variables may be approximatively normalised by transformations logarithmic square root arc sine of square root etc others can be used directly beta weibull if predicted and observed values are counts a bivariate poisson distribution with or without overdispersion karlis and ntzoufras 2005 can be used in the case where the variable is a ratio of counts the bivariate binomial distribution biswas and hwang 2002 is adequate we will not detail all the possible cases here but many bivariate distributions are now available in the statistical literature decision the threshold a define two states of nature the variable to predict will be either really lower to a or really greater or equal to a table 1 one has to decide an action a when the predicted value is greater or equal to the a the decision scheme is 2 x a a x a a a standing for not a the correct decisions are taken in the two following cases 3 x a y a a x a y a a and two erroneous decisions can occur when 4 x a y a a x a y a a the first equation case refeq4 is the equivalent of a false positive in clinical research this results in the application of the m a t h c a l a action while m a t h c a l a is useless the second equation case refeq4 is the equivalent of a false negative it results in not applying m a t h c a l a while m a t h c a l a was needed except when high costs are involved in applying the m a t h c a l a action see section 3 the second case is generally considered more damaging than the first a reason why we will call the case 1 critical error the set of decisions taken with reference to a model organises as a special case of the so called confusion matrix well known in the decision theory agosta 2020 table 1 fig 1 illustrates the four possible outcomes as the overall integral of the bivariate normal distribution sums to 1 the integrals of φ respectively in the red and blue hatched areas give directly the probabilities of both type of errors and the sum of the two gives the total probability of a decision error more precisely 5 p 1 p a a a a φ x y d y d x p 2 p a a a a φ x y d y d x p e r r p 1 p 2 let us note that by symmetry we should have p 1 p 2 and thus p e r r 2 p 1 2 p 2 as the cumulative probability functions of the normal distribution have no close form expression the two double integrals corresponding to red and blue hatched areas of fig 1 require to be calculated numerically quite a lot of numerical integrators are currently available online here we used the function ndpdf of the package binomial of r r core team 2022 these expressions are therefore suitable to plot the errors rates which occur for a set of thresholds a and a set of correlation coefficients ρ or of determination coefficients r 2 representing better the overall statistical quality of the model this is shown in fig 2 in the case of counts and of bivariate discrete distribution considering φ not as a probability density but as a discrete probability function φ m n eq 5 holds by replacing integrals by discrete sums and the left border by 0 3 rates of error as a function of the threshold of decision and model quality eq 5 allow to calculate the rate of decision errors obtained for a given quality ρ of the model and a given threshold of decision a we restrict our analysis to the case where ρ 0 because it is the normal situation for the regression of observed versus estimated values in a model we also restrict our analysis to thresholds of decision greater than the mean because it is unlikely to work with very low threshold of decisions fig 2 shows four representations of the surface obtained by varying both ρ and a the figure shows that the rate of decision error is very sensitive to the chosen threshold when the threshold is near the mean a very high statistical quality of the model is required to get an acceptable rate of decision error at the contrary for high thresholds greater then 2 5 standard deviations the probability of decision error is very low regardless of the model quality which has few influence of course when the model is little informative i e ρ 0 and when the threshold is close to the mean of predicted values the rate of decision error is close to 50 4 consequences on the risk and losses here we follow the definition of loss and risk adopted by williams and hooten 2016 suppose that one decision has to be made let us define c 1 the cost of an intervention or harmfulness threshold c 2 the cost of the damages in case of false negative furthermore we suppose that c 2 is an increasing function of the realised phenomenon y for sake of simplicity let us set c 2 c 1 α y c 1 is natural as a basis because it is generally admitted that the threshold should be set at the point where the cost of the damages suffered equals the cost of the intervention called the harmfulness threshold in the case of plants pests and plant diseases and other fields of research see inter alia bossis 2020 colbach and cordeau 2018 rusu 2010 maslennikov et al 2018 wielkopolan et al 2018 we have to add to eq 5 the probability of taking the correct decision of an intervention 6 p 3 p a a a a φ x y d y d x in terms of loss the risk becomes dissymmetric and can be set as 7 e c p 1 c 1 a a φ x y c 1 α y d y d x p 1 and p 3 as defined by eqs 5 and 6 the last integral is the convolution of p 2 and of the loss induced by each possible y actually greater then a this is the cost and needs also to be integrated numerically fig 3 this holds for the bivariate normal distribution in the case of counts and of bivariate discrete distribution eqs 6 and 7 hold by replacing integrals by discrete sums and the left border by 0 fig 3 shows some results obtained with c 1 10 conventional units and α 10 these maps are a priori maps for the model and shows the cost expected loss of the decisions it implies for low thresholds a the risk of decisions decrease very slowly with the quality of the models showing that the lower the threshold the better should be the statistical quality of the model 5 conclusion we present here a framework to judge the decisional quality of forecasting models from their statistical quality also called accuracy it can be seen as an adaptation to ecology and agronomy of the quality tests used in clinical research scannell and bosley 2016 while adding cost considerations which are of outstanding importance in environmental researches the quality of decision making depends strongly of two parameters and not of a single one excepted for a very high statistical quality of the model a decision threshold close to the mean of the phenomenon under study induces a large rate of decision error and a high frequentist risk rate see fig 2a the problem is that the decision threshold does not depend at all of the model but only of the costs and benefits associated with its use as an example in crop protection procedures the threshold required to decide an intervention e g insecticide spraying or biocontrol is generally defined as a defined population density of a pest or as a defined prevalence of the disease such that the costs of the damages suffered by the crop overcome the cost of the intervention harmfulness threshold more and more the mere financial estimation of the damages and of the interventions must be combined with the ecological impact of them our calculations show that the decision taken will be all the more relevant as the threshold of decision is higher compared to the average situation in other words when the damages are rare the decision support system and the model building are easier and more relevant than in situations where damages are of high probability the closer of the mean is the intervention threshold the more accurate must be the model all these considerations are of little help in the model building process but could give precious indications on the interest to apply it its proficiency petchey et al 2015 let us note that using the model or not is itself a decision problem that we do not treat here but for which the realisation of the maps of fig 3 may be a help credit authorship contribution statement jean sébastien pierre conceptualization methodology calculations writing original draft writing review editing

24176,we consider here forecasting models in ecology or in agronomy aiming at decision making based upon exceeding a quantitative threshold we address specifically how to link the intrinsic quality of the model its accuracy with its decisional quality ie its capacity to avoid false decisions and their associated costs the accuracy of the model can be evaluated by the ρ of the regression of observed values versus estimated ones or by the determination coefficient r 2 we show that the decisional quality depends not only of this accuracy but also of the threshold retained to make the decision as well as on the state of nature the two kinds of decisional errors consists either in deciding no action while an action is required false negatives or to act while it is useless false positives we

24177,models of complex systems are built and used to gain understanding of target system properties and dynamics and to mediate between linked theories and observations models are particularly useful for earth systems including ecological processes which have complex properties such as feedbacks path dependence downward causation and tipping points that are not meaningful from the perspective of classic linear causal relationships in composing such models how do modellers carve nature at its joints that is decompose their complex multilevel systems into processes interactions components and their organization two examples illustrate two strategies the first is to limit the range of spatiotemporal scales by parameterising the smaller scale processes and by imposing the larger scale processes in the initial and boundary conditions the second is to separate physical biological and other levels this allows control on the causes processes their interactions and organization in order to explore explain and predict their effects keywords complex system nearly decomposable system biogeomorphology philosophy of science in practice data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction what is it we do when we build complex models of earth systems with ecological processes what do we accomplish with such models these are deceptively simple questions about the practice of ecology and earth science it is important to ask them in order to be able to reflect critically on the scope of modelling results the claims of causation explanation and prediction it is also important to address these questions in the education of new generations of modellers this requires that we have the philosophical skills and concepts to address them frigg and hartmann 2020 here i look at models through a particularly useful lens for educational purposes kleinhans 2021 the conceptual apparatus of complex systems that we decompose in order to comprehend parts of the world this will shed light on what parts of the world modellers include and how they deal with what is kept outside the model 2 what is a complex system a system is more than systematically ordered knowledge or a system of mathematical equations it has behaviour and it produces phenomena a complex system is an ensemble of many elements which are interacting in a disordered way resulting in robust organization and memory von bertalanffy 1950 ladyman et al 2013 the persistent activity of a system creates a robust or resilient order out of the disorder of the environment its emergent properties and dynamics cannot directly be inferred from the properties and dynamics of its components but the order at a certain spatial and temporal scale is what makes it possible to distinguish such a system easily from the jumble of the world wimsatt 1994 without organization and the order emerging from disorder a system may be merely complicated such as a gas at equilibrium which can be studied by statistical mechanics and thermodynamics complex systems are open in the sense that matter energy or information is exchanged with its environment having a model allows a degree of control over putative causes and components that cannot be achieved in nature which allows epistemic access to the cause effect relationships and dynamics at a higher level of organization without having to model all the small scale processes green and batterman 2017 as such models mediate between observable phenomena and theories such as the navier stokes equations for fluid flow which produces phenomena that are not accessible without the brute computational force that the models have frig and hartmann 2020 how to compose a model is to ask what part of the world is to be included in models in biology a living organism is a natural spatial scale for which to conceptualise a system but there is not such an obvious organisation in levels of scale in earth systems or ecosystems while most present day earth systems would not exist without interactions with lifeforms earth systems do not accomplish homoeostasis like organisms but are more obviously driven or forced by outside influences or initial and boundary conditions schumm and lichty 1965 identifying appropriate boundaries for an earth system and its relevant levels of organisation is part of model building practice a useful concept for describing such model practices is that of near decomposability proposed by simon 1962 further developed by wimsatt 1994 and bechtel and abrahamsen 2010 decomposition is the breaking down of a system into its working parts which also clarifies the system s organization in a nearly decomposable system the interactions amongst the sub systems are weaker than within but not negligible they are weak hence nearly decomposable in the sense that the short term behaviour of each of the component sub systems is approximately independent of the short term behaviour of the other components this argues against a bottom up physical reductionist approach where interactions are weaker nature can be carved at it seams see kyker snowman et al 2022 for a workflow that fits this notion with decomposition modellers achieve control by setting a complex system apart from the rest of the world and subdividing the system in parts that produce the phenomena of interest wu and david 2002 bechtel and richardson 2010 in terms of graph theory parts can be seen as groupings of linked nodes in a network structure of causal interactions within and between system components wimsatt 1994 bechtel 2017 the parts of the network with fewer links are the seams of nature where scientists can fruitfully carve out a system and decompose it into parts further but how earth scientists do this in practice if the levels of scale are not obvious is not clear katzav and parker 2018 here i will show by two typical examples that modellers decide what to include in complex models by at least two decomposition strategies the first is to focus on a window of spatiotemporal scales and exclude the smaller and the larger this strategy is often made explicit the second is by disciplinary division between physical biological economical and other processes this strategy often remains implicit and is fraught with the issues of physical reductionism the example will also make explicit how modellers deal with what is excluded and what they can accomplish with their models 3 ecological processes coupled to an earth system model the meandering river system model of van oorschot et al 2022 couples an existing physical model delft3d to a new model for eco engineering species that interact with the physical processes as such the system is composed by coupling of physical and ecological levels fig 1 this model exhibits complex pattern formation and dynamics and has been used to explain why observed meandering patterns hardly emerge without riparian vegetation the physics based model solves the equations of shallow flow on a grid to calculate the flux of sand caused by the flow and to change the morphology by erosion and sedimentation from the mass balance in each grid cell the changed morphology modifies the flow pattern in a feedback loop the model was run for a few centuries with typical time steps of minutes local morphology changes noticeably over days during flood conditions but formation of bars and cut off of meander bends takes decades in this river small scale processes of turbulence on flow friction and of sediment movement are deemed unnecessary and computationally expensive details at the level of the emergent meanders and are parameterized which avoids the problems of micro reductionism kleinhans et al 2005 green and batterman 2017 ascertaining that such details are indeed unnecessary requires other research initial and boundary conditions such as the valley slope and river discharge peaks were loosely based on measurements in a real river and on characteristic dam operation regimes imposing these conditions avoids having to include the larger scale hinterland processes human interference including restoration the longer term tectonics and valley formation from the model components and the rest of the planet schumm and lichty 1965 bokulich 2021 in a separate code functional tree species with eco engineering properties are modelled ecosystem engineering species create and maintain habitats by modulating the availability of resources to their own and other species jones et al 1994 corenblit et al 2007 settling growth and mortality are affected by physical processes such as inundation duration over the past month settling is modelled in spring on surface area where flood water and assumed propagules reached plant life stage dependant mortality depends on the flow and on excavation or burial of the roots and senescence the ecological model is coupled back to the physical model through flow friction determined by tree cover fraction and size flow resistance caused by sub grid turbulent flow separation and blockage on stems is parameterized as drag per life stage and added up as parallel resistors in each grid cell as such ecology is not reduced to physics but only physical effects of trees are fed back to the physical model thus the river model has two interacting feedback loops the hydromorphic loop and the eco engineering species loop van oorschot et al 2022 collectively this organisation leads to complex dynamics and alternative river pattern states with eco engineered habitats depending on model settings and the chosen boundary conditions an analogous but much more complicated analysis can be done for the community land model 5 clm5 component of the community earth system model cesm lawrence et al 2018 cesm is used for example to hindcast and forecast coupling between plant communities fertilisation and climate change fisher et al 2019 the clm5 is composed of twenty eight complex sub sub systems with physical chemical biological or human aspects for example the sub sub system of terrestrial ecosystems was composed separately as the functionally assembled terrestrial ecosystem simulator fates lawrence et al 2018 section 29 1 fates simulates the general vegetation type structure and dynamics not at the level of species but in a generalized form sufficient to produce the physical effects that are then fed back to other model components such generalization allows a global application despite all the smaller scale differences between vegetation types 4 conclusion the examples illustrate the two strategies in practice the large and small spatiotemporal scales are put outside the scale window of interest and the physical and ecological levels are separated and further decomposed the first strategy is often explicitly recognized but the second is usually implicit thus a part of the world conceptualised as a complex system is isolated in a model such that it includes the most relevant causal interactions and components for their purpose studying the target phenomena and dynamics all models are made with a certain purpose in mind but they are iteratively improved after comparisons with data experiments and other models and conceptually or even numerically connected to or nested in models at other scales many models also have some redundancy of components and interactions which allows for exploration and discovery of unsuspected effects and application to somewhat different target systems in the world the strategies allow for separate control on processes imposed in the model components and their interactions on parameterised subgrid processes on causes specified in the boundary conditions the choice of species and other model interventions that are hardly possible in the real world modellers then use this kind of models in various exploratory explanatory and predictive ways in the model example above questions were addressed how riparian vegetation or dam removal possibly affects river systems how global vegetation possibly interacted with atmospheric chemistry and climate change the conceptual apparatus of near decomposability reviewed here can be modified to other kinds of models and will help to teach communicate and debate views on what models are what is imposed as cause and what is explained what we

24177,models of complex systems are built and used to gain understanding of target system properties and dynamics and to mediate between linked theories and observations models are particularly useful for earth systems including ecological processes which have complex properties such as feedbacks path dependence downward causation and tipping points that are not meaningful from the perspective of classic linear causal relationships in composing such models how do modellers carve nature at its joints that is decompose their complex multilevel systems into processes interactions components and their organization two examples illustrate two strategies the first is to limit the range of spatiotemporal scales by parameterising the smaller scale processes and by imposing the larger scale processes in the initial and boundary conditions the second is to separate physical biological and other levels this allows control on the causes processes their interactions and organization in order to explore explain and predict their effects keywords complex system nearly decomposable system biogeomorphology philosophy of science in practice data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction what is it we do when we build complex models of earth systems with ecological processes what do we accomplish with such models these are deceptively simple questions about the practice of ecology and earth science it is important to ask them in order to be able to reflect critically on the scope of modelling results the claims of causation explanation and prediction it is also important to address these questions in the education of new generations of modellers this requires that we have the philosophical skills and concepts to address them frigg and hartmann 2020 here i look at models through a particularly useful lens for educational purposes kleinhans 2021 the conceptual apparatus of complex systems that we decompose in order to comprehend parts of the world this will shed light on what parts of the world modellers include and how they deal with what is kept outside the model 2 what is a complex system a system is more than systematically ordered knowledge or a system of mathematical equations it has behaviour and it produces phenomena a complex system is an ensemble of many elements which are interacting in a disordered way resulting in robust organization and memory von bertalanffy 1950 ladyman et al 2013 the persistent activity of a system creates a robust or resilient order out of the disorder of the environment its emergent properties and dynamics cannot directly be inferred from the properties and dynamics of its components but the order at a certain spatial and temporal scale is what makes it possible to distinguish such a system easily from the jumble of the world wimsatt 1994 without organization and the order emerging from disorder a system may be merely complicated such as a gas at equilibrium which can be studied by statistical mechanics and thermodynamics complex systems are open in the sense that matter energy or information is exchanged with its environment having a model allows a degree of control over putative causes and components that cannot be achieved in nature which allows epistemic access to the cause effect relationships and dynamics at a higher level of organization without having to model all the small scale processes green and batterman 2017 as such models mediate between observable phenomena and theories such as the navier stokes equations for fluid flow which produces phenomena that are not accessible without the brute computational force that the models have frig and hartmann 2020 how to compose a model is to ask what part of the world is to be included in models in biology a living organism is a natural spatial scale for which to conceptualise a system but there is not such an obvious organisation in levels of scale in earth systems or ecosystems while most present day earth systems would not exist without interactions with lifeforms earth systems do not accomplish homoeostasis like organisms but are more obviously driven or forced by outside influences or initial and boundary conditions schumm and lichty 1965 identifying appropriate boundaries for an earth system and its relevant levels of organisation is part of model building practice a useful concept for describing such model practices is that of near decomposability proposed by simon 1962 further developed by wimsatt 1994 and bechtel and abrahamsen 2010 decomposition is the breaking down of a system into its working parts which also clarifies the system s organization in a nearly decomposable system the interactions amongst the sub systems are weaker than within but not negligible they are weak hence nearly decomposable in the sense that the short term behaviour of each of the component sub systems is approximately independent of the short term behaviour of the other components this argues against a bottom up physical reductionist approach where interactions are weaker nature can be carved at it seams see kyker snowman et al 2022 for a workflow that fits this notion with decomposition modellers achieve control by setting a complex system apart from the rest of the world and subdividing the system in parts that produce the phenomena of interest wu and david 2002 bechtel and richardson 2010 in terms of graph theory parts can be seen as groupings of linked nodes in a network structure of causal interactions within and between system components wimsatt 1994 bechtel 2017 the parts of the network with fewer links are the seams of nature where scientists can fruitfully carve out a system and decompose it into parts further but how earth scientists do this in practice if the levels of scale are not obvious is not clear katzav and parker 2018 here i will show by two typical examples that modellers decide what to include in complex models by at least two decomposition strategies the first is to focus on a window of spatiotemporal scales and exclude the smaller and the larger this strategy is often made explicit the second is by disciplinary division between physical biological economical and other processes this strategy often remains implicit and is fraught with the issues of physical reductionism the example will also make explicit how modellers deal with what is excluded and what they can accomplish with their models 3 ecological processes coupled to an earth system model the meandering river system model of van oorschot et al 2022

24178,the belt and road initiative bri has boosted global trade and economic development carbon inequality embodied in global trade may occur across bri countries and regions in the world how to quantify this inequality is the key to achieving the green development of the belt and road in this study we constructed a methodological framework to analyze carbon inequality across bri countries and regions under the global trade network results showed that nearly half of bri countries and regions exported net embodied carbon emissions while obtaining net economic benefits the most severe bilateral trade carbon inequality existed between china and bri west asia whose bilateral trade carbon inequality index bci reached 2 76 except for indonesia saudi arabia and bri west asia bri countries and regions were negatively affected by global trade carbon inequality with china and india suffering the most whose global trade carbon inequality indices gci were 2 06 and 1 26 respectively this methodological framework can be applied to analyze the inequality of other kinds of ecological impacts embodied in trade on any scale furthermore this study can provide policy implications for the green development of the belt and road keywords multi regional input output model carbon inequality the belt and road initative bilateral trade carbon inequality index global trade carbon inequality index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the belt and road initiative bri was proposed by china as an effort to support the trade and economic development of the world in 2013 currently the bri has boosted trade and economic growth among participating countries and regions hafeez et al 2019 qian et al 2022 which cover more than 60 of the global population and 30 of the global gdp huang 2016 recently the bri prioritizes environmental preservation while fostering economies horvat and gong 2019 cheng and ge 2020 yang and ni 2022 which is in line with the objectives of sustainable development goals sdgs huang and li 2020 coenen et al 2021 when countries and regions with different production levels and trade structures engage in trade feng et al 2013 yu et al 2014 weitzel and ma 2014 a potential unequal exchange of carbon emissions and economic benefits may occur which is called carbon inequality prell and sun 2015 prell and feng 2016 zhang et al 2018 as bri countries and regions become increasingly active in the global trade network hafeez et al 2018 muhammad et al 2020 chen et al 2021 carbon inequality might occur across bri countries and regions and negatively influence their development specifically some bri countries and regions may undertake net carbon emissions from other countries and regions while bearing net economic losses contradicting the sdgs designed for climate change mitigation and inequality reduction and posing a challenge to the green development of the belt and road tahir et al 2022 therefore it is essential to investigate the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions under the global trade network to explore the path to achieving the green development of the belt and road some researchers have started to analyze carbon inequality across bri countries and regions han et al 2020 used the theil index to analyze the differences in per capita carbon emissions among bri countries and regions wang et al 2022a constructed the pollution terms of trade ptt index to investigate the unequal exchange of carbon emissions and economic benefits embodied in trade between bri countries and regions and china however these indices have certain limitations the theil index disregards the carbon inequality embodied in bilateral trade while the ptt index ignores the overall status of a country or region in terms of carbon inequality under the global trade network in summary existing studies on carbon inequality across bri countries and regions lack a systematic methodological framework for analysing carbon inequality under the global trade network to fill these gaps we construct a methodological framework to unravel the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions specifically we evaluate the inter regional flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added based on multi regional input output mrio model on this basis a carbon inequality ci index combination is proposed to quantify the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions under the global trade network additionally we identify the detailed production and consumption sectors embodied in carbon inequality moreover this study provides insights into policy implications for achieving the green development of the belt and road 2 materials and methods 2 1 multi regional input output mrio model the mrio model can systematically analyze the environmental impacts embodied in the inter regional flow of goods at the regional and sector levels this model is widely used for exploring the transfer of environmental impacts in trade arce et al 2016 meng et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2021 the mrio model includes m regions and n sectors and its basic equation can be written as follows 1 x i a 1 f in eq 1 x x 11 x 1 m x m 1 x mm is the total output matrix in which x r s x 11 rs x 1 n rs x n 1 rs x nn rs is the output of region r for the final use of region s a a 11 a 1 m a m

leontief inverse matrix f f 11 f 1 m f m 1 f mm is the diagonalized final demand matrix where submatrix f rs f 1 rs 0 0 f n rs is the diagonalized final demand matrix of region s versus region r and f

two dimensions of bilateral trade and global trade the index combination consists of the bilateral trade carbon inequality index bci and the global trade carbon inequality index gci the former is used for quantifying the carbon inequality in bilateral trade between bri countries and regions and the latter is used for quantifying the overall global trade carbon inequality status of each bri country or region according to eq 2 the net flow of embodied carbon emissions between region r and region s e r s is expressed as follows 5 e r s e r s e s r the matrix of the net flow of embodied carbon

v m 1 1 v m 1 2 0 v m 1 m v m 1 v m 2 v m m 1 0 defining the following function for data normalization the following equation is obtained 9 f b b b min b max b min b b m m the bilateral trade carbon

and region s in the calculation of b c i r s there are two situations i when e n rs 0 v rs 0 and 0 b c i r s 1 it indicates that region r undertakes net carbon emissions while obtaining net economic benefits from region s presenting a relatively fair bilateral trade ii when e n rs 0 v rs 0 and b c i r s 1 it implies that region r undertakes net carbon emissions while bearing net economic losses from region s suggesting a carbon inequality in trade generally the greater the bci index is the more unequal the carbon exchange in bilateral trade is the total carbon emissions and value added obtained by region r are defined as e r and v r respectively 11 e r s r m e r s 12 v r s r m v r s the global trade carbon inequality index of region r g c i r is proposed by referring to the research

situations i when e r 0 v r 0 and gc i r 1 it indicates that region r bears net economic losses while undertaking net carbon emissions and suffers the most from global trade carbon inequality ii when e r 0 v r 0 and 1 gc i r 0 it indicates that region r obtains net economic benefits at the expense of undertaking net carbon emissions iii when e r 0 v r 0 and 0 gc i r 1 it indicates that region r outsources its carbon emissions and bears net economic losses from other regions and iv when e r 0 v r 0 and gc i r 1 region r obtains net economic benefits while outsourcing its carbon emissions in addition to being a beneficiary from both environmental and economic perspectives 2 3 data sources the global mrio table and co2 emission inventory data were obtained from the global trade analysis project gtap 10 database which represented the world economy in 2014 and included 141 countries and regions regarding the classification of bri countries and regions the bri countries and regions covered in this study were those that have signed the cooperation document on jointly building the bri the belt and road portal 2022 notably india was included in this study due to its geographical location and vital role in trade with bri countries and regions although it has not yet signed the corresponding cooperation documents therefore this study focused on 8 countries china south korea indonesia india italy russia saudi arabia and south africa while the remaining 94 gtap bri countries and regions were integrated into 7 bri regions bri southeast asia bri south asia bri europe bri central asia bri west asia bri africa and bri others the corresponding map and detailed information for these 7 bri regions were shown in fig 1 and appendix a then we took the remaining countries and regions as a whole non bri countries and regions regarding the sector classification method this study classified 65 sectors into 8 categories agriculture mining quarrying food beverages tobacco manufacturing electricity gas water supply construction transportation and service detailed information on these 8 sector categories is shown in appendix b additionally the carbon emissions data provided by this database are distinguished by fuel for each country or region 3 results 3 1 amounts and sectoral structures of carbon emissions and value added in 2014 the production based and consumption based carbon emissions of all bri countries and regions were 16 954 42 mt and 15 720 16 mt accounting for 65 and 61 of the global total 25 966 23 mt respectively on the other hand the production based and consumption based value added of all bri countries and regions were 27 371 33 billion dollars and 26 855 85 billion dollars accounting for 41 and 40 of the global total 66 971 43 billion dollars respectively fig 2 indicates the amounts and sectoral structures of production based and consumption based carbon emissions and value added for carbon emissions china was the largest producer and consumer 7445 92 mt and 6541 94 mt accounting for 44 and 42 of the total for all bri countries and regions respectively followed by india 1762 25 mt and 1636 19 mt and bri west asia 1239 42 mt and 1291 69 mt for most bri countries and regions the production based carbon emissions were caused mainly by manufacturing electricity gas water supply and transportation accounting for 73 95 appendix c consumption based carbon emissions were mainly the result of manufacturing electricity gas water supply construction and service accounting for 69 89 appendix c regarding value added china was also the largest producer and consumer 8103 47 billion dollars and 8138 38 billion dollars accounting for 30 of the total among all bri countries and regions followed by bri europe 2351 68 billion dollars and 2325 78 billion dollars and bri west asia 2392 83 billion dollars and 2242 23 billion dollars service contributed the most in every bri country or region for production based value added accounting for 24 68 appendix c consumption based value added was mainly contributed by manufacturing construction and service accounting for 58 89 appendix c by comparing production based and consumption based carbon emissions the net emissions corresponding to the attributes of bri countries and regions can be seen the net flow includes 2 types net export and net import and the former is greater than 0 while the latter is less than 0 more than half of bri countries and regions were net exporters of embodied carbon emissions and their production based carbon emissions were greater than their consumption based carbon emissions causing these areas to undertake net carbon emissions from other countries and regions similar to the results of han et al 2018 among these countries china was the largest net exporter of embodied carbon emissions with net exports reaching 903 98 mt accounting for 56 of the total for all net exporters appendix d in addition india 126 06 mt and south africa 139 49 mt were also important net exporters of embodied carbon emissions in contrast indonesia italy saudi arabia bri south asia bri west asia and bri africa were net importers of embodied carbon emissions with greater consumption based carbon emissions than production based carbon emissions thus outsourcing their carbon emissions to other countries and regions and benefiting from an environmental perspective bri africa was the largest net importer of embodied carbon emissions outsourcing 145 82 mt embodied carbon emissions to outside areas accounting for 40 of the total for all net importers appendix d among these sectors electricity gas water supply was the largest net exporter of embodied carbon emissions for all bri countries and regions while transportation s impact was also important appendix d in contrast service was usually the largest net importer of embodied carbon emissions appendix d from the value added aspect more than half of bri countries and regions were net exporters of embodied value added obtained net economic benefits and were beneficiaries from an economic perspective on the other hand the largest net importer of embodied value added was india 48 27 billion dollars followed by china 34 91 billion dollars and bri south asia 34 17 billion dollars appendix d regarding the structure of the net imports of embodied value added food beverages tobacco and construction were the leading net importers appendix d fig 3 classifies bri countries and regions based on the net flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added nearly half of bri countries and regions are in the first quadrant indicating that these countries and regions obtained net economic benefits at the expense of undertaking net carbon emissions in contrast italy south africa and bri africa are in the third quadrant these countries and regions outsourced net carbon emissions and bore net economic benefits from other bri countries and regions indonesia saudi arabia and bri west asia are in the fourth quadrant they obtained net economic benefits while outsourcing net carbon emissions thus benefiting from both the environmental and economic perspectives although saudi arabia and bri west asia did not outsource much carbon emissions 13 63 mt and 52 27 mt respectively they obtained the most net economic benefits 167 14 billion dollars and 152 60 billion dollars respectively in contrast china and india bore net economic losses while undertaking net carbon emissions and suffered the most from global trade carbon inequality china did not bear extensive net economic losses 34 91 billion dollars but undertook many net carbon emissions 903 98 mt even more than 6 times that of south africa india did not undertake the most net carbon emissions 126 06 mt but bore the most net economic benefits 48 27 billion dollars this phenomenon preliminarily reflects the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions 3 2 inter regional net flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added overall bri countries and regions totally exported embodied carbon emissions to non bri countries and regions consistent with the research results of hou et al 2020 lu et al 2020 and fang et al 2021 the net export of embodied carbon emissions of all bri countries and regions was 1234 25 mt mainly from china 621 01 mt india 95 71 mt russia 88 13 mt bri southeast asia 105 89 mt and bri europe 108 12 mt appendix e at the same time bri countries and regions obtained 515 48 billion dollars net economic benefits appendix e the main inter regional net flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added across bri countries and regions are depicted in fig 4 a and b bri africa was the largest net importer of embodied carbon emissions among all bri countries and regions with a net import of 146 54 mt from other bri countries and regions appendix e bri africa imported 55 64 mt and 27 89 mt net embodied carbon emissions from china and south africa respectively accounting for 38 and 19 of the total respectively moreover bri africa bore 24 42 billion dollars net economic losses from other bri countries and regions appendix e in addition italy bri south asia and bri west asia were also the leading net importers of embodied carbon emissions they imported 76 95 mt 52 22 mt and 96 34 mt net embodied carbon emissions from other bri countries and regions respectively appendix e italy and bri south asia bore 40 45 billion dollars and 49 06 billion dollars net economic losses from other bri countries and regions while bri west asia obtained 102 01 billion dollars net economic benefits from other bri countries and regions appendix e china was the largest net exporter of embodied carbon emissions as was also confirmed in the study of wang et al 2022b china exported 282 97 mt to other bri countries and regions appendix e specifically china exported net embodied carbon emissions to other bri countries and regions except for south africa and bri central asia wang et al 2022a confirmed that approximately 80 of bri countries were net importers of embodied carbon emissions in trade with china similar to our results china exported net embodied carbon emissions mainly to bri southeast asia 46 02 mt bri west asia 42 20 mt and bri africa 55 64 mt accounting for 16 15 and 20 of the total respectively the net export embodied carbon emissions from china were caused mainly by china s manufacturing and electricity gas water supply while the main sectors responsible for imported emissions were the manufacturing construction and service of bri countries and regions details on the example of china and bri west asia can be seen in appendix f at the same time china bore 109 96 billion dollars net economic losses in trade with bri countries and regions appendix e mainly from south korea 32 04 billion dollars saudi arabia 27 19 billion dollars and bri west asia 57 90 billion dollars in addition south africa india and russia were also the main net exporters of embodied carbon emissions exporting 79 14 mt 30 35 mt and 37 25 mt net embodied carbon emissions to other bri countries and regions respectively russia and south africa obtained 34 74 billion dollars and 2 97 billion dollars net economic benefits from other bri countries and regions while india bore 86 79 billion dollars net economic losses from other bri countries and regions all these numbers show the unbalanced pattern of the inter regional flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added leading to carbon inequality among bri countries and regions 3 3 carbon inequality in bilateral and global trade fig 5 a displays the bci indices among bri countries and regions italy was beneficiary in bilateral trade with all other bri countries and regions and the bci index only between italy and bri west asia was higher than 1 1 09 indonesia exerted a burden of carbon inequality on many bri countries and regions the bci index between indonesia and china reached 1 39 and the bci indices between indonesia and south korea 1 09 india 1 23 south africa 1 02 bri southeast asia 1 13 and bri europe 1 02 were all higher than 1 saudi arabia imposed severe carbon inequality on many bri countries and regions the bci index between saudi arabia and china was 1 67 and the bci indices between saudi arabia and south korea 1 20 india 1 41 south africa 1 08 bri west asia 1 01 and bri others 1 04 were all higher than 1 in addition bri south asia bri west asia and bri africa were also beneficiaries of bilateral trade with several bri countries and regions the bci indices between bri west asia and india and between bri africa and india were 1 91 and 1 45 respectively china was negatively affected by carbon inequality in bilateral trade with all other bri countries and regions except south africa and bri central asia the most severe carbon inequality existed in bilateral trade between china and bri west asia with a bci index of 2 76 take this pairing as a case study we identify the detailed production and consumption sectors embodied in this carbon inequality overall during trade china undertook 42 20 mt net carbon emissions while bearing 57 90 billion dollars net economic losses specifically china s electricity gas water supply undertook 24 77 mt net carbon emissions from bri west asia s manufacturing accounting for 59 of the total however china obtained only 1 09 billion dollars net economic benefits meanwhile china s manufacturing and construction outsourced 2 76 mt and 2 06 mt net carbon emissions to bri west asia s mining quarrying but bore 38 29 billion dollars and 27 85 billion dollars net economic losses accounting for 66 and 48 of the total respectively more details can be seen in appendix f as a result china was negatively affected both environmentally and economically when trading with bri west asia in addition severe carbon inequality appeared in the bilateral trade between china and bri southeast asia 2 18 overall during trade china undertook 46 02 mt net carbon emissions while bearing 20 70 billion dollars net economic losses specifically china s electricity gas water supply undertook 29 58 mt 10 86 mt and 10 16 mt net carbon emissions from bri southeast asia s manufacturing construction and service however china obtained only 0 92 billion dollars 0 58 billion dollars and 0 28 billion dollars net economic benefits meanwhile china s manufacturing outsourced 4 18 mt and 0 17 mt net carbon emissions to bri southeast asia s manufacturing and service respectively but bore 9 56 billion dollars and 6 41 billion dollars net economic losses respectively more details can be seen in appendix f additionally compared to south korea 1 69 indonesia 1 39 saudi arabia 1 67 and bri others 1 56 china was also negatively affected by severe carbon inequality india was also negatively affected by carbon inequality in bilateral trade with many bri countries and regions and the bci indices with indonesia 1 23 saudi arabia 1 41 bri southeast asia 1 14 bri west asia 1 91 and bri africa 1 45 were all higher than 1 fig 5 b indicates the gci indices of bri countries and regions reflecting their overall status in global trade carbon inequality the results show that the gci indices of indonesia saudi arabia and bri west asia were 1 51 2 13 and 2 02 respectively indicating that these areas were the primary beneficiaries of inequality associated with the global carbon trade taking saudi arabia as an example its electricity gas water supply undertook 91 79 mt net carbon emissions whereas its construction and service outsourced 62 74 mt and 57 00 mt net carbon emissions respectively in general saudi arabia outsourced net carbon emissions at the same time although other sectors bore net economic losses mining quarrying in saudi arabia obtained net economic benefits of 332 29 billion dollars thus the region obtained a large amount of net economic benefits therefore saudi arabia benefited from global trade from economic and environmental perspectives for bri west asia and indonesia the details are described in appendix d the gci index values of most bri countries and regions are lower than 0 indicating that these areas were negatively affected by global trade carbon inequality the gci indices of china and india were 2 06 and 1 26 respectively suggesting that these areas suffered the most from carbon inequality in global trade in china the manufacturing electricity gas water supply and transportation undertook 457 10 mt 3374 44 mt and 372 55 mt net carbon emissions accounting for 51 373 and 41 respectively at the same time although other sectors obtained net economic benefits china s food beverage tobacco and construction bore net economic losses of 433 86 billion dollars and 1405 69 billion dollars respectively resulting in china s overall net economic losses therefore china bore both additional carbon emissions and economic losses in global trade and suffered the most from global trade carbon inequality for india the details are described in appendix d 4 discussion and conclusion in this study we constructed a methodological framework to analyze the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions under the global trade network flow analyses of embodied carbon emissions and value added were conducted based on the mrio model on this basis a ci index combination was proposed to quantify the carbon inequality among bri countries and regions from the two dimensions of bilateral trade and global trade moreover we identified the detailed production and consumption sectors embodied in carbon inequality this framework can be used to analyze the exchanges of other kinds of ecological impacts e g land use water consumption and energy use and economic benefits in trade on any scale e g china s inter provincial trade and other country s inter regional trade on the basis of the flow analysis of embodied carbon emissions and value added we found that nearly half of bri countries and regions were net exporters of both embodied carbon emissions and value added meaning that despite achieving net economic benefits and economic growth they also undertook net carbon emissions from other countries and regions at the sectoral level the electricity gas water supply and transportation were the main contributors to production based carbon emissions and net export embodied carbon emissions in contrast the service contributed the most to production based value added adding to the high net exporters of value added the most severe bilateral trade carbon inequality existed between china and bri west asia bci 2 76 except for indonesia saudi arabia and bri west asia bri countries and regions were negatively affected by global trade carbon inequality with china gci 2 06 and india gci 1 26 suffering the most the above results indicate that carbon inequality embodied in trade exists among bri countries and regions and is detrimental to their growth as green economics based on the results this study provides some policy implications to alleviate carbon inequality and provides methods as well as decision making guidelines for the green development of the belt and road first we suggest changing the trade structures of bri countries and regions from high carbon and low value added to low carbon and high value added at the sectoral level the trade structure being dominated by sectors producing goods with high carbon emissions and low value added e g electricity gas water supply and transportation leads to bri countries and regions undertaking more net carbon emissions while obtaining fewer economic benefits in inter regional trade as confirmed by some previous research zhang and zhang 2018 kim and tromp 2021 lin et al 2021 additionally the excessive involvement of these sectors may contribute to the unequal exchange of carbon emissions and value added embodied in trade an example is the trade between china and bri west asia therefore bri countries and regions need to change their trade structures from high carbon and low value added to low carbon and high value added to reduce carbon emissions obtain more economic benefits and enhance their status in the global supply chain second we advise allocating responsibility for reducing carbon emissions between bri countries and regions from a co responsibility perspective countries and regions e g china and india that are negatively impacted by carbon inequality would not only be responsible for the net economic losses but also be forced to shoulder additional costs to reduce carbon emissions therefore we suggest a co responsibility approach meaning that consumers accountability should be considered and producers and consumers can share the responsibility for carbon emissions this approach has received some scientific support bastianoni et al 2004 lenzen et al 2007 berzosa et al 2014 jakob et al 2021 furthermore those who outsource net carbon emissions are encouraged to reduce the carbon emissions of the undertakers by providing capital technology or other services hotak et al 2020 third we recommend introducing a directory of low carbon goods for bri countries and regions a directory of low carbon goods could help bri countries and regions identify goods whose production and use processes consume less energy and emit fewer emissions to provide guidance for industrial and trade structure transformation from high carbon and low value added to low carbon and high value added for bri countries and regions on the other side a directory of this kind is useful for encouraging customers to modify their consumption habits and choose to purchase low carbon goods in order to decrease the demand for high carbon goods much like carbon labeling vandenbergh et al 2011 upham et al 2011 thus a directory of low carbon goods would be beneficial in allowing bri countries and regions to reduce their carbon emissions and outsourcing while promoting economic growth during trade thereby promoting the equal exchange of carbon emissions and economic benefits in trade among bri countries and regions fourth we propose establishing a tariff standard on low carbon goods for trade across bri countries and regions the trade of low carbon goods is beneficial for reducing carbon emissions and outsourcing while promoting economic growth frey 2016 ahmed et al 2022 thereby alleviating the unequal exchange of carbon emissions and economic benefits in the trade of bri countries and regions to promote the trade of low carbon goods a tariff standard which sets the upper limit of the tariff rate is needed to limit tariffs on low carbon goods trading between bri countries and regions as supported by some prior research hill 2016 janssens et al 2020 ding et al 2022 with low tariffs on low carbongoods trades bri countries and regions would be more willing to produce and trade low carbon goods thus further promoting the trade of low carbon goods and alleviating carbon inequality across bri countries and regions regarding the trade of some low carbon goods that are conducive to promoting the green transformation of bri countries and regions such as renewable energy and clean production equipment the tariff can be reduced to 0 this study has two limitations first the mrio table used in this study is from 2014 because it was the most recent data available when we conducted this research however since the globalized world is changing rapidly the data used in this study may be too old to make diagnoses and suggest governmental measures second we integrated 94 gtap bri countries and regions into 7 bri regions which means that the adverse effects of carbon inequality on some bri countries and regions may not have been identified regarding further research directions the regional and sector divisions considered herein should be down scaled to allow more detailed results furthermore exchanges of other kinds of ecological impacts and economic benefits in trade among bri countries and regions should be investigated credit authorship contribution statement zekun lin conceptualization modelling investigation data curation

24178,the belt and road initiative bri has boosted global trade and economic development carbon inequality embodied in global trade may occur across bri countries and regions in the world how to quantify this inequality is the key to achieving the green development of the belt and road in this study we constructed a methodological framework to analyze carbon inequality across bri countries and regions under the global trade network results showed that nearly half of bri countries and regions exported net embodied carbon emissions while obtaining net economic benefits the most severe bilateral trade carbon inequality existed between china and bri west asia whose bilateral trade carbon inequality index bci reached 2 76 except for indonesia saudi arabia and bri west asia bri countries and regions were negatively affected by global trade carbon inequality with china and india suffering the most whose global trade carbon inequality indices gci were 2 06 and 1 26 respectively this methodological framework can be applied to analyze the inequality of other kinds of ecological impacts embodied in trade on any scale furthermore this study can provide policy implications for the green development of the belt and road keywords multi regional input output model carbon inequality the belt and road initative bilateral trade carbon inequality index global trade carbon inequality index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the belt and road initiative bri was proposed by china as an effort to support the trade and economic development of the world in 2013 currently the bri has boosted trade and economic growth among participating countries and regions hafeez et al 2019 qian et al 2022 which cover more than 60 of the global population and 30 of the global gdp huang 2016 recently the bri prioritizes environmental preservation while fostering economies horvat and gong 2019 cheng and ge 2020 yang and ni 2022 which is in line with the objectives of sustainable development goals sdgs huang and li 2020 coenen et al 2021 when countries and regions with different production levels and trade structures engage in trade feng et al 2013 yu et al 2014 weitzel and ma 2014 a potential unequal exchange of carbon emissions and economic benefits may occur which is called carbon inequality prell and sun 2015 prell and feng 2016 zhang et al 2018 as bri countries and regions become increasingly active in the global trade network hafeez et al 2018 muhammad et al 2020 chen et al 2021 carbon inequality might occur across bri countries and regions and negatively influence their development specifically some bri countries and regions may undertake net carbon emissions from other countries and regions while bearing net economic losses contradicting the sdgs designed for climate change mitigation and inequality reduction and posing a challenge to the green development of the belt and road tahir et al 2022 therefore it is essential to investigate the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions under the global trade network to explore the path to achieving the green development of the belt and road some researchers have started to analyze carbon inequality across bri countries and regions han et al 2020 used the theil index to analyze the differences in per capita carbon emissions among bri countries and regions wang et al 2022a constructed the pollution terms of trade ptt index to investigate the unequal exchange of carbon emissions and economic benefits embodied in trade between bri countries and regions and china however these indices have certain limitations the theil index disregards the carbon inequality embodied in bilateral trade while the ptt index ignores the overall status of a country or region in terms of carbon inequality under the global trade network in summary existing studies on carbon inequality across bri countries and regions lack a systematic methodological framework for analysing carbon inequality under the global trade network to fill these gaps we construct a methodological framework to unravel the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions specifically we evaluate the inter regional flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added based on multi regional input output mrio model on this basis a carbon inequality ci index combination is proposed to quantify the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions under the global trade network additionally we identify the detailed production and consumption sectors embodied in carbon inequality moreover this study provides insights into policy implications for achieving the green development of the belt and road 2 materials and methods 2 1 multi regional input output mrio model the mrio model can systematically analyze the environmental impacts embodied in the inter regional flow of goods at the regional and sector levels this model is widely used for exploring the transfer of environmental impacts in trade arce et al 2016 meng et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2021 the mrio model includes m regions and n sectors and its basic equation can be written as follows 1 x i a 1 f in eq 1 x x 11 x 1 m x m 1 x mm is the total output matrix in which x r s x 11 rs x 1 n rs x n 1 rs x nn rs is the output of region r for the final use of region s a a 11 a 1 m a m

intensity matrix of region r and d i r is the carbon intensity of sector i in region r the production based and consumption based carbon emissions of region r e p r and e c r are expressed as follows 3 e p r s 1 m e r s 4 e c r s 1 m e s r 2 2 carbon inequality ci index combination this study proposed a ci index combination to analyze the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions from the two dimensions of bilateral trade and global trade the index combination consists of the bilateral trade carbon inequality index bci and the global trade carbon inequality index gci the former is used for quantifying the carbon inequality in bilateral trade between bri countries and regions and the latter is used for quantifying the overall global trade carbon inequality status of each bri country or region according to eq 2 the net flow of embodied carbon emissions between region r and region s e r s is expressed as follows 5 e r s e r s e s r the matrix of the net flow of embodied carbon emissions among all regions e is expressed as follows 6 e 0 e 12 e 1 m 1 e 1 m e 21 0 e 2 m 1 e 2 m e m 1 1 e m 1 2 0 e m 1 m e m 1 e m 2 e m m 1 0 removing all the negative values in e the following matrix can be written as follows 7 e n e e 2 similarly the matrix of the net flow of embodied value added among all regions v can be expressed as follows 8 v 0 v 12 v 1 m 1 v 1 m v 21 0 v 2 m 1 v 2 m v m 1 1 v m 1 2 0 v m 1 m v m 1 v m 2 v m m 1 0 defining the following function for data normalization the following equation is obtained 9 f b b b min b max b min b b m m the bilateral trade carbon inequality index between the region r and region s b c i r s is built as follows by referring to the research by zhang et al 2018 10 b c i r s f e n r s v r s e n rs 0 a n d v rs 0 f e n r s f v r s 1 e n rs 0 a n d v rs 0 in eq 10 e n r s is the net flow of embodied carbon emissions between region r and region s v r s is the absolute value of the net flow of embodied value added between region r and region s in the calculation of b c i r s there are two situations i when e n rs 0 v rs 0 and 0 b c i r s 1 it indicates that region r undertakes net carbon emissions while obtaining net economic benefits from region s presenting a relatively fair bilateral trade ii when e n rs 0 v rs 0 and b c i r s 1 it implies that region r undertakes net carbon emissions while bearing net economic losses from region s suggesting a carbon inequality in trade generally the greater the bci index is the more unequal the carbon exchange in bilateral trade is the total carbon emissions and value added obtained by region r are defined as e r and v r respectively 11 e r s r m e r s 12 v r s r m v r s the global trade carbon inequality index of region r g c i r is proposed by referring to the research by wang et al 2022b 13 gc i r f e r f v r 1 e r 0 a n d v r 0 f e r v r e r 0 a n d v r 0 f e r v r e r 0 a n d v r 0 f e r f v r 1 e r 0 a n d v r 0 in the calculation of g c i r there are four situations i when e r 0 v r 0 and gc i r 1 it indicates that region r bears net economic losses while undertaking net carbon emissions and suffers the most from global trade carbon inequality ii when e r 0 v r 0 and 1 gc i r 0 it indicates that region r obtains net economic benefits at the expense of undertaking net carbon emissions iii when e r 0 v r 0 and 0 gc i r 1 it indicates that region r outsources its carbon emissions and bears net economic losses from other regions and iv when e r 0 v r 0 and gc i r 1 region r obtains net economic benefits while outsourcing its carbon emissions in addition to being a beneficiary from both environmental and economic perspectives 2 3 data sources the global mrio table and co2 emission inventory data were obtained from the global trade analysis project gtap 10 database which represented the world economy in 2014 and included 141 countries and regions regarding the classification of bri countries and regions the bri countries and regions covered in this study were those that have signed the cooperation document on jointly building the bri the belt and road portal 2022 notably india was included in this study due to its geographical location and vital role in trade with bri countries and regions although it has not yet signed the corresponding cooperation documents therefore this study focused on 8 countries china south korea indonesia india italy russia saudi arabia and south africa while the remaining 94 gtap bri countries and regions were integrated into 7 bri regions bri southeast asia bri south asia bri europe bri central asia bri west asia bri africa and bri others the corresponding map and detailed information for these 7 bri regions were shown in fig 1 and appendix a then we took the remaining countries and regions as a whole non bri countries and regions regarding the sector classification method this study classified 65 sectors into 8 categories agriculture mining quarrying food beverages tobacco manufacturing electricity gas water supply construction transportation and service detailed information on these 8 sector categories is shown in appendix b additionally the carbon emissions data provided by this database are distinguished by fuel for each country or region 3 results 3 1 amounts and sectoral structures of carbon emissions and value added in 2014 the production based and consumption based carbon emissions of all bri countries and regions were 16 954 42 mt and 15 720 16 mt accounting for 65 and 61 of the global total 25 966 23 mt respectively on the other hand the production based and consumption based value added of all bri countries and regions were 27 371 33 billion dollars and 26 855 85 billion dollars accounting for 41 and 40 of the global total 66 971 43 billion dollars respectively fig 2 indicates the amounts and sectoral structures of production based and consumption based carbon emissions and value added for carbon emissions china was the largest producer and consumer 7445 92 mt and 6541 94 mt accounting for 44 and 42 of the total for all bri countries and regions respectively followed by india 1762 25 mt and 1636 19 mt and bri west asia 1239 42 mt and 1291 69 mt for most bri countries and regions the production based carbon emissions were caused mainly by manufacturing electricity gas water supply and transportation accounting for 73 95 appendix c consumption based carbon emissions were mainly the result of manufacturing electricity gas water supply construction and service accounting for 69 89 appendix c regarding value added china was also the largest producer and consumer 8103 47 billion dollars and 8138 38 billion dollars accounting for 30 of the total among all bri countries and regions followed by bri europe 2351 68 billion dollars and 2325 78 billion dollars and bri west asia 2392 83 billion dollars and 2242 23 billion dollars service contributed the most in every bri country or region for production based value added accounting for 24 68 appendix c consumption based value added was mainly contributed by manufacturing construction and service accounting for 58 89 appendix c by comparing production based and consumption based carbon emissions the net emissions corresponding to the attributes of bri countries and regions can be seen the net flow includes 2 types net export and net import and the former is greater than 0 while the latter is less than 0 more than half of bri countries and regions were net exporters of embodied carbon emissions and their production based carbon emissions were greater than their consumption based carbon emissions causing these areas to undertake net carbon emissions from other countries and regions similar to the results of han et al 2018 among these countries china was the largest net exporter of embodied carbon emissions with net exports reaching 903 98 mt accounting for 56 of the total for all net exporters appendix d in addition india 126 06 mt and south africa 139 49 mt were also important net exporters of embodied carbon emissions in contrast indonesia italy saudi arabia bri south asia bri west asia and bri africa were net importers of embodied carbon emissions with greater consumption based carbon emissions than production based carbon emissions thus outsourcing their carbon emissions to other countries and regions and benefiting from an environmental perspective bri africa was the largest net importer of embodied carbon emissions outsourcing 145 82 mt embodied carbon emissions to outside areas accounting for 40 of the total for all net importers appendix d among these sectors electricity gas water supply was the largest net exporter of embodied carbon emissions for all bri countries and regions while transportation s impact was also important appendix d in contrast service was usually the largest net importer of embodied carbon emissions appendix d from the value added aspect more than half of bri countries and regions were net exporters of embodied value added obtained net economic benefits and were beneficiaries from an economic perspective on the other hand the largest net importer of embodied value added was india 48 27 billion dollars followed by china 34 91 billion dollars and bri south asia 34 17 billion dollars appendix d regarding the structure of the net imports of embodied value added food beverages tobacco and construction were the leading net importers appendix d fig 3 classifies bri countries and regions based on the net flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added nearly half of bri countries and regions are in the first quadrant indicating that these countries and regions obtained net economic benefits at the expense of undertaking net carbon emissions in contrast italy south africa and bri africa are in the third quadrant these countries and regions outsourced net carbon emissions and bore net economic benefits from other bri countries and regions indonesia saudi arabia and bri west asia are in the fourth quadrant they obtained net economic benefits while outsourcing net carbon emissions thus benefiting from both the environmental and economic perspectives although saudi arabia and bri west asia did not outsource much carbon emissions 13 63 mt and 52 27 mt respectively they obtained the most net economic benefits 167 14 billion dollars and 152 60 billion dollars respectively in contrast china and india bore net economic losses while undertaking net carbon emissions and suffered the most from global trade carbon inequality china did not bear extensive net economic losses 34 91 billion dollars but undertook many net carbon emissions 903 98 mt even more than 6 times that of south africa india did not undertake the most net carbon emissions 126 06 mt but bore the most net economic benefits 48 27 billion dollars this phenomenon preliminarily reflects the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions 3 2 inter regional net flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added overall bri countries and regions totally exported embodied carbon emissions to non bri countries and regions consistent with the research results of hou et al 2020 lu et al 2020 and fang et al 2021 the net export of embodied carbon emissions of all bri countries and regions was 1234 25 mt mainly from china 621 01 mt india 95 71 mt russia 88 13 mt bri southeast asia 105 89 mt and bri europe 108 12 mt appendix e at the same time bri countries and regions obtained 515 48 billion dollars net economic benefits appendix e the main inter regional net flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added across bri countries and regions are depicted in fig 4 a and b bri africa was the largest net importer of embodied carbon emissions among all bri countries and regions with a net import of 146 54 mt from other bri countries and regions appendix e bri africa imported 55 64 mt and 27 89 mt net embodied carbon emissions from china and south africa respectively accounting for 38 and 19 of the total respectively moreover bri africa bore 24 42 billion dollars net economic losses from other bri countries and regions appendix e in addition italy bri south asia and bri west asia were also the leading net importers of embodied carbon emissions they imported 76 95 mt 52 22 mt and 96 34 mt net embodied carbon emissions from other bri countries and regions respectively appendix e italy and bri south asia bore 40 45 billion dollars and 49 06 billion dollars net economic losses from other bri countries and regions while bri west asia obtained 102 01 billion dollars net economic benefits from other bri countries and regions appendix e china was the largest net exporter of embodied carbon emissions as was also confirmed in the study of wang et al 2022b china exported 282 97 mt to other bri countries and regions appendix e specifically china exported net embodied carbon emissions to other bri countries and regions except for south africa and bri central asia wang et al 2022a confirmed that approximately 80 of bri countries were net importers of embodied carbon emissions in trade with china similar to our results china exported net embodied carbon emissions mainly to bri southeast asia 46 02 mt bri west asia 42 20 mt and bri africa 55 64 mt accounting for 16 15 and 20 of the total respectively the net export embodied carbon emissions from china were caused mainly by china s manufacturing and electricity gas water supply while the main sectors responsible for imported emissions were the manufacturing construction and service of bri countries and regions details on the example of china and bri west asia can be seen in appendix f at the same time china bore 109 96 billion dollars net economic losses in trade with bri countries and regions appendix e mainly from south korea 32 04 billion dollars saudi arabia 27 19 billion dollars and bri west asia 57 90 billion dollars in addition south africa india and russia were also the main net exporters of embodied carbon emissions exporting 79 14 mt 30 35 mt and 37 25 mt net embodied carbon emissions to other bri countries and regions respectively russia and south africa obtained 34 74 billion dollars and 2 97 billion dollars net economic benefits from other bri countries and regions while india bore 86 79 billion dollars net economic losses from other bri countries and regions all these numbers show the unbalanced pattern of the inter regional flow of embodied carbon emissions and value added leading to carbon inequality among bri countries and regions 3 3 carbon inequality in bilateral and global trade fig 5 a displays the bci indices among bri countries and regions italy was beneficiary in bilateral trade with all other bri countries and regions and the bci index only between italy and bri west asia was higher than 1 1 09 indonesia exerted a burden of carbon inequality on many bri countries and regions the bci index between indonesia and china reached 1 39 and the bci indices between indonesia and south korea 1 09 india 1 23 south africa 1 02 bri southeast asia 1 13 and bri europe 1 02 were all higher than 1 saudi arabia imposed severe carbon inequality on many bri countries and regions the bci index between saudi arabia and china was 1 67 and the bci indices between saudi arabia and south korea 1 20 india 1 41 south africa 1 08 bri west asia 1 01 and bri others 1 04 were all higher than 1 in addition bri south asia bri west asia and bri africa were also beneficiaries of bilateral trade with several bri countries and regions the bci indices between bri west asia and india and between bri africa and india were 1 91 and 1 45 respectively china was negatively affected by carbon inequality in bilateral trade with all other bri countries and regions except south africa and bri central asia the most severe carbon inequality existed in bilateral trade between china and bri west asia with a bci index of 2 76 take this pairing as a case study we identify the detailed production and consumption sectors embodied in this carbon inequality overall during trade china undertook 42 20 mt net carbon emissions while bearing 57 90 billion dollars net economic losses specifically china s electricity gas water supply undertook 24 77 mt net carbon emissions from bri west asia s manufacturing accounting for 59 of the total however china obtained only 1 09 billion dollars net economic benefits meanwhile china s manufacturing and construction outsourced 2 76 mt and 2 06 mt net carbon emissions to bri west asia s mining quarrying but bore 38 29 billion dollars and 27 85 billion dollars net economic losses accounting for 66 and 48 of the total respectively more details can be seen in appendix f as a result china was negatively affected both environmentally and economically when trading with bri west asia in addition severe carbon inequality appeared in the bilateral trade between china and bri southeast asia 2 18 overall during trade china undertook 46 02 mt net carbon emissions while bearing 20 70 billion dollars net economic losses specifically china s electricity gas water supply undertook 29 58 mt 10 86 mt and 10 16 mt net carbon emissions from bri southeast asia s manufacturing construction and service however china obtained only 0 92 billion dollars 0 58 billion dollars and 0 28 billion dollars net economic benefits meanwhile china s manufacturing outsourced 4 18 mt and 0 17 mt net carbon emissions to bri southeast asia s manufacturing and service respectively but bore 9 56 billion dollars and 6 41 billion dollars net economic losses respectively more details can be seen in appendix f additionally compared to south korea 1 69 indonesia 1 39 saudi arabia 1 67 and bri others 1 56 china was also negatively affected by severe carbon inequality india was also negatively affected by carbon inequality in bilateral trade with many bri countries and regions and the bci indices with indonesia 1 23 saudi arabia 1 41 bri southeast asia 1 14 bri west asia 1 91 and bri africa 1 45 were all higher than 1 fig 5 b indicates the gci indices of bri countries and regions reflecting their overall status in global trade carbon inequality the results show that the gci indices of indonesia saudi arabia and bri west asia were 1 51 2 13 and 2 02 respectively indicating that these areas were the primary beneficiaries of inequality associated with the global carbon trade taking saudi arabia as an example its electricity gas water supply undertook 91 79 mt net carbon emissions whereas its construction and service outsourced 62 74 mt and 57 00 mt net carbon emissions respectively in general saudi arabia outsourced net carbon emissions at the same time although other sectors bore net economic losses mining quarrying in saudi arabia obtained net economic benefits of 332 29 billion dollars thus the region obtained a large amount of net economic benefits therefore saudi arabia benefited from global trade from economic and environmental perspectives for bri west asia and indonesia the details are described in appendix d the gci index values of most bri countries and regions are lower than 0 indicating that these areas were negatively affected by global trade carbon inequality the gci indices of china and india were 2 06 and 1 26 respectively suggesting that these areas suffered the most from carbon inequality in global trade in china the manufacturing electricity gas water supply and transportation undertook 457 10 mt 3374 44 mt and 372 55 mt net carbon emissions accounting for 51 373 and 41 respectively at the same time although other sectors obtained net economic benefits china s food beverage tobacco and construction bore net economic losses of 433 86 billion dollars and 1405 69 billion dollars respectively resulting in china s overall net economic losses therefore china bore both additional carbon emissions and economic losses in global trade and suffered the most from global trade carbon inequality for india the details are described in appendix d 4 discussion and conclusion in this study we constructed a methodological framework to analyze the carbon inequality across bri countries and regions under the global trade network flow analyses of embodied carbon emissions and value added were conducted based on the mrio model on this basis a ci index combination was proposed to quantify the carbon inequality among bri countries and regions from the two dimensions of bilateral trade and global trade moreover we identified the detailed production and consumption sectors embodied in carbon inequality this framework can be used to analyze the exchanges of other kinds of ecological impacts e g land use water consumption and energy use and economic benefits in trade on any scale e g china s inter provincial trade and other country s inter regional trade on the basis of the flow analysis of embodied carbon emissions and value added we found that nearly half of bri countries and regions were net exporters of both embodied carbon emissions and value added meaning that despite achieving net economic benefits and economic growth they also undertook net carbon emissions from other countries and regions at the sectoral level the electricity gas water supply and transportation were the main contributors to production based carbon emissions and net export embodied carbon emissions in contrast the service contributed the most to production based value added adding to the high net exporters of value added the most severe bilateral trade carbon inequality existed between china and bri west asia bci 2 76 except for indonesia saudi arabia and bri west asia bri countries and regions were negatively affected by global trade carbon inequality with china gci 2 06 and india gci 1 26 suffering the most the above results indicate that carbon inequality embodied in trade exists among bri countries and regions and is detrimental to their growth as green economics based on the results this study provides some policy implications to alleviate carbon inequality and provides methods as well as decision making guidelines for the green development of the belt and road first we suggest changing the trade structures of bri countries and regions from high carbon and low value added to low carbon and high value added at the sectoral level the trade structure being dominated by sectors producing goods with high carbon emissions and low value added e g electricity gas water supply and transportation leads to bri countries and regions undertaking more net carbon emissions while obtaining fewer economic benefits in inter regional trade as confirmed by some previous research zhang and zhang 2018 kim and tromp 2021 lin et al 2021 additionally the excessive involvement of these sectors may contribute to the unequal exchange of carbon emissions and value added embodied in trade an example is the trade between china and bri west asia therefore bri countries and regions need to change their trade structures from high carbon and low value added to low carbon and high value added to reduce carbon emissions obtain more economic benefits and enhance their status in the global supply chain second we advise allocating responsibility for reducing carbon emissions between bri countries and regions from a co responsibility perspective countries and regions e g china and india that are negatively impacted by carbon inequality would not only be responsible for the net economic losses but also be forced to shoulder additional costs to reduce carbon emissions therefore we suggest a co responsibility approach meaning that consumers accountability should be considered and producers and consumers can share the responsibility for carbon emissions this approach has received some scientific support bastianoni et al 2004 lenzen et al 2007 berzosa et al 2014 jakob et al 2021 furthermore those who outsource net carbon emissions are encouraged to reduce the carbon emissions of the undertakers by providing capital technology or other services hotak et al 2020 third we recommend introducing a directory of low carbon goods for bri countries and regions a directory of low carbon goods could help bri countries and regions identify goods whose production and use processes consume less energy and emit fewer emissions to provide guidance for industrial and trade structure transformation from high carbon and low value added to low carbon and high value added for bri countries and regions on the other side a directory of this kind is useful for encouraging customers to modify their consumption habits and choose to purchase low carbon goods in order to decrease the demand for high carbon goods much like carbon labeling vandenbergh et al 2011 upham et al 2011 thus a directory of low carbon goods would be beneficial in allowing bri countries and regions to reduce their carbon emissions and outsourcing while promoting economic growth during trade thereby promoting the equal exchange of carbon emissions and economic benefits in trade among bri countries and regions fourth we propose establishing a tariff standard on low carbon goods for trade across bri countries and regions the trade of low carbon goods is beneficial for reducing carbon emissions and outsourcing while promoting economic growth frey 2016 ahmed et al 2022 thereby alleviating the unequal exchange of carbon emissions and economic benefits in the trade of bri countries and regions to promote the trade of low carbon goods a tariff standard which sets the upper limit of the tariff rate is needed to limit tariffs on low carbon goods trading between bri countries and regions as supported by some prior research hill 2016 janssens et al 2020 ding et al 2022 with low tariffs on low carbongoods trades bri countries and regions would be more willing to produce and trade low carbon goods thus further promoting the trade of low carbon goods and alleviating carbon inequality across bri countries and regions regarding the trade of some low carbon goods that are conducive to promoting the green transformation of bri countries and regions such as renewable energy and clean production equipment the tariff can be reduced to 0 this study has two limitations first the mrio table used in this study is from 2014 because it was the most recent data available when we conducted this research however since the globalized world is changing rapidly the data used in this study may be too old to make diagnoses and suggest governmental measures second we integrated 94 gtap bri countries and regions into 7 bri regions which means that the adverse effects of carbon inequality on some bri countries and regions may not have been identified regarding further research directions the regional and sector divisions considered herein should be down scaled to allow more detailed results furthermore exchanges of other kinds of ecological impacts and economic benefits in trade among bri countries and regions should be investigated credit authorship contribution statement zekun lin conceptualization modelling investigation data curation

24179,background lagos is the largest megacity in africa with numerous lagoons and wetlands due to anthropogenic activities lagos wetlands have undergone significant alterations in the last few decades the un s sustainable development goals sdgs and the campaign programs for carbon neutrality in the city offer a plan of action that recognizes the necessity of managing water related habitats such as wetlands wetlands are essential to accomplishing the sdgs because they provide a solution to many global issues like climate change food insecurity and water scarcity in some ways each of the sdgs is related to wetlands but sdgs 6 and 13 are particularly significant to this study the application of remote sensing and geographic information systems gis is a crucial tactic for monitoring the achievement of these sdgs objectives the study aims to map and simulate the spatial temporal changes in the lagos wetland from 2000 to 2050 for the achievement of a carbon neutral city methods in this study landsat etm 2000 2010 and oli 2020 were used to monitor the spatial temporal changes in lagos wetlands the maximum likelihood classification method was adopted for the supervised classification the simulation analysis was done with the cellular automata markov model results the findings show that the water body increased throughout the study rising from 658 76 km2 in 2000 to 681 60 km2 in 2010 and to 712 0 km2 in 2020 marshy areas have decreased progressively from 39 41 km2 in 2000 to 14 48 km2 in 2010 and 0 078 km2 in 2020 swamps and mangrove wetland classes had changed from 448 24

mangroves will respectively change to 711 99 km2 and 747 11 km2 405 26 km2 and 400 16 km2 0 15 km2 and 0 13 km2 as well as 455 29 km2 and 455 30 km2 in the simulated years 2030 2050 conclusion the study shows that lagos has witnessed spatial temporal changes in its wetland classes within the last two decades the results prove that remote sensing and gis are effective tools for studying water related habitats such as wetlands keywords carbon neutrality ca markov model remote sensing sustainable development goals wetland ecosystem data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wetlands are areas of land that are periodically or continuously saturated with water fagorite et al 2019 ajibola et al 2012 they are either inland or coastal wetlands with a water level less than six meters deep at low tide ayansina and ulrike 2015 eludoyin and akinola 2015 wetlands may exist naturally or artificially wali et al 2019 usepa 2015 artificial wetlands are built for water management these areas often contribute to the emerging topic of water sensitive urban design historically wetlands have been considered wasteland where disease vectors can be found elekwachi et al 2021 innocent and dapa 2018 this belief has always led to extensive draining and conversion of wetland areas for alternative uses without consideration for ecological or socioeconomic purposes case studies have shown that wetlands provide a variety of environmental services essential to human well being nyandwi et al 2016 okonkwo et al 2015 john and jaco 2016 they host a diversity of flora and fauna species and offer a range of recreational activities and services the services provided by the wetlands include water purification flood control climate regulation groundwater recharge reducing peak runoff shoreline protection and sediment sinking wali et al 2018a wali et al 2018b during stormy weather wetlands absorb surplus rainfall reducing flooding in urban areas and averting disasters and their associated expenses wetlands are the largest carbon reserves on earth reducing and adjusting to climate change and ensuring the safety and resilience of cities and settlements olatunde and olalekan 2015 chidumje et al 2017 davidson 2014 wetlands are different from other types of water features due to their unique vegetation this vegetation filters out domestic and industrial waste which helps to elevate the quality of the water jerry et al 2013 mccarthy et al 2015 lin and yu 2018 kumar et al 2021 opoku 2013 wetland habitats continue to face major risks and threats despite their high production and wide range of advantages ankrah 2018 kumi et al 2015 abass et al 2018 afriyie et al 2014 a lack of coordinated and comprehensive policy guidelines anthropogenic activities and climate change are a few of them george 2021 mensah 2014 korah et al 2018 the united nations un member states have publicly created a 2030 agenda with the aim of addressing global concerns un 2015 the 2030 agenda offers 17 sustainable development goals sdgs 169 internationally agreed upon targets and 232 indicators based on the accomplishments of the millennium development goals mdgs fu et al 2017 un 2015 the targets define the objectives and the indicators are measures used to gauge if the targets are accomplished it recognizes that actions performed in one location may have an impact on actions taken in another location the sdgs are a roadmap for all countries to follow in order to achieve a sustainable future by 2030 it is a call to action for all nations whether they be poor middle income or rich according to the world bank to improve the quality of life for their people while eradicating hunger poverty and environmental deterioration united nations and nations 2015 un department of economic and social affairs population division 2018 sdg 6 focuses on clean water and sanitation which aim to ensure that water and sanitation are available and sustainably managed for all it places

sdg 13 exhorts us to take action to mitigate the effects of climate change it comprises five targets and eight indicators that address a variety of climate change related challenges sdg 13 aims to put the un framework convention on climate change into practice by striving to minimize global warming to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels so as to achieve net zero global carbon dioxide co2 emissions by 2050 to achieve this target co2 emissions must decrease by 45 by 2030 and reach zero emissions by 2050 the un european union eu and intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc all agree that the earth must achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 un 2015 there has been extensive research on the many traditional techniques for monitoring marine ecosystems these techniques are expensive harmful and time consuming atubi et al 2018 kim 2016 hassan et al 2016 an alternative to the traditional methods is remote sensing rs technology zhu 2017 lang et al 2015 rs have been found to be effective for mapping and monitoring wetland areas the technology can be used in conjunction with the technique of geographic informatics system gis to monitor wetland areas towards the achievement of sdg indicators enoh et al 2022 wetland inventories and maps contain vital data for managing restoring and conserving wetland areas remote sensing technology has undergone substantial development since the first multispectral satellite data that is landsat mss became available in the 1970s rai et al 2017 singh et al 2017 remotely sensed imagery is fast becoming more widely available with better spectral spatial and temporal resolution the ability to map wetlands and track spatial temporal changes with extraordinary accuracy has been made possible by advances in image analysis and processing techniques zhou et al 2019 pervez et al 2016 the availability of high resolution imageries such as synthetic aperture radar sar light detection and ranging lidar multispectral and hyperspectral data as well as multi scale and sensor data fusion methods all show significant promise for enhancing large scale wetland mapping liping et al 2018 over the past few decades researchers have developed a number of models for analyzing ecosystems some of these models are statistical models hyandye et al 2015 cellular automata models singh et al 2015 markov chain models guan et al 2019 multi agent models ralha et al 2013 hybrid models subedi et al 2013 and expert system models stefanov et al 2001 the markov chain and the cellular automata ca markov model are currently the most widely utilized models in simulation analysis the ca markov is a mixed model that integrates the benefits of prediction analysis into a complex system he et al 2018 recent studies have identified the historical trend of wetland changes in many cities around the globe these studies demonstrate the capabilities of rs and gis to monitor habitats related to water such as wetland areas elekwachi et al 2019 used landsat tm 1984 etm 1999 2003 and oli 2013 data to analyze the land use and land cover changes in the wetlands ecosystem of port harcourt metropolis the data were geo referenced enhanced classified and sub set with arcgis 10 1 erdas imagine 2014 and idris selva software the results showed that between 1984 and 2013 built up area increased by 8242 8 ha while fresh and salty wetlands deceased by 3003 8 ha and 674 73 ha respectively wizor and wali 2020 used landsat etm and oli sensors to geospatially analyze urban wetland loss in the obio akpor local government area of river state nigeria the result shows that there was a sharp decline in wetland area due to urbanization and other anthropogenic activities wali et al 2018 used landsat tm etm and oli to examine the salt and freshwater ecosystem in the port harcourt metropolis nigeria the study found that there was pressure on the wetland due to human settlement and anthropogenic activities obiefuna et al 2013 studied the spatial changes in lagos wetland from 1984 to 2006 the results show that wetland is rapidly depreciating in the area isunju and kemp 2016 used a very high resolution image and landsat sensors to monitor the spatiotemporal changes in a wetland ecosystem in kampala uganda the findings show that between 2002 and 2014 there was a 62 loss of wetland mainly due to crop production similar approaches were used to monitor wetland ecosystems by larocque et al 2020 in southern new brunswick canada yang et al 2021 in suzhou southeastern jiangau province and the central yangtze river delta china and hapsari and permatasari 2020 in pangpang bay banyuwangi all the above mentioned researchers monitor wetlands with rs and gis tools without any effort to relate their studies with the un s sdg plan of action or global warming our research had bridged this gap with its discussion encompassing climate change climate neutrality and the un s sdgs with particular focus on goals 6 and 13 our study also proved that rs and gis can be used as important techniques to monitor the sdg process lagos is an enormous low lying coastal city with lagoons wetlands and river systems sojobi et al 2015 the city is predominated by swamps and mangroves which exist along the drainage systems lagos state government 2020 the major rivers in the city include the lagos lekki kweme ogun osun and yewa rivers soladoye and ajibade 2014 the others are ologe lagoon five vowries omu creeks and badagry these bodies of water contribute to defining the topography of the study area the lagos wetlands have experienced significant invasion in the past few decades lagos state government 2020 a visit to the region reveals a large number of anthropogenic activities that show significant encroachment according to reports direct loss of habitat suspended particles hydrologic alterations and changes in water quality are some of the adverse effects of this encroachment research findings have shown that if encroachment continues at its current rate lagos wetlands will be fully depleted within the next five decades this threat had bothered the lagos state government and in recent times sustainable campaign programs had been launched programs such as awareness campaigns and the zero tolerance policy against encroachment were announced the lagos state climate action plan cap 2020 2050 was also announced in line with the paris agreement on climate change as a program to mitigate carbon emissions in lagos to 1 5 c and to zero by 2050 if lagos is to achieve its goal of becoming a carbon neutral city by 2050 it must restore its deteriorating wetlands deteriorating wetland has been recognized as a significant source of greenhouse gases ghg fig 1 summarizes lagos s carbon reduction goals for the years 2035 2045 and 2050 the goal is to reduce ghg emissions to 20 below the business as usual bau prediction by 2025 to 45 by 2035 and to zero by 2050 table 1 further summarizes the lagos s total ghg emissions in 2015 and its anticipated emissions for 2025 2035 and 2050 it follows that if climate actions are ignored lagos s ghg emissions will triple by 2050 this study aims to investigate the spatial temporal changes that occurred in the lagos wetland from 2000 to 2020 using the post classification comparison method pcc the pcc method involved the use of the land change modeler lcm tool to quantify the net change analysis gains and losses of the study classes their contribution to change and their transitions from one class to the other the study used its final findings to simulate the spatial temporal changes that could occur in its study classes between 2030 10 year planning period and 2050 30 year planning period the overall goal of the study was to create a sustainable and carbon neutral lagos city the study used remotely sensed data such as from landsat etm 2000 etm 2010 and oli 2020 sensors to produce classification maps and tables based on the pcc technique in order to identify the changes that have occurred in the study classes during the 2000 2020 study period the ca markov model was used for the simulation analysis the transition probability matrix and the transition area matrix were used to identify pixels that will likely change from one study class to the other during the simulated periods 2 description of the study area lagos the most populous city in africa is located on the bight of benin s slender coastal flood plain between longitudes 2 42 e and 3 22 e and latitudes 6 22 n and 6 42 n fig 2 the region is bordered on the east and north by nigeria s ogun state the atlantic ocean on the south and the republic of benin on the west sojobi et al 2015 lagos has a shoreline of 180 kms and a land area of 358 862 hectares it is located 15 m above sea level on a low lying coastal plain lagos state government 2013 case studies show that more than 40 of the city s total land area is made up of water bodies and wetlands with creeks and lagoons making up another 22 lagos coastal areas are separated from the sea by a sandbar with a width of 2 to 16 km the entrance through the lagos lagoon is the sole major exit through which the creeks and lagoons empty their water into the sea lagos state government 2013 the major vegetation types in lagos are freshwater and mangrove swamp forests these vegetation types are influenced by double rainfall patterns which transform the area into a wetland area and produce two separate climatic seasons the dry and wet seasons in lagos while the rainy season lasts from april to october the dry seasons are distinguished by cold and dry weather and run from november to march of the following year 3 materials and methods 3 1 data acquisition and its sources the auxiliary and landsat data were the data sources acquired for this study the google earth image and the topography map were grouped as auxiliary data the landsat data were landsat 7 etm enhanced thematic mapper plus for the years 2000 and 2010 and landsat 8 oli operational land imager for the year 2020 these data were retrieved from the earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov of the united states geological survey usgs using paths and rows of 190 55 190 56 191 55 and 191 56 respectively of the worldwide reference system wrs the landsat etm and oli are 30 m resolution optimized datasets appropriate for geospatial applications to reduce seasonal variation the images were acquired in december with zero cloud cover the parameters of the etm and oli data are displayed in table 2 fig 3 outlines the study s methodological flow diagram this diagram is displayed in sequential steps to show the change detection process step 1 shows that the auxiliary and landsat data were the datasets acquired to monitor the spatial temporal changes in the study classes from 2000 to 2020 step 2 shows the pre processed analysis of the data which included atmospheric correction radiometric processing layer stacking mosaicking sub setting and enhancement in step 3 the pre processed data were classified using the maximum likelihood classifier and according to the developed classification scheme in order to produce the classification maps and tables step 4 shows that the pcc technique was used to analyze the spatial temporal change between the study years by inputting two classified maps etm 2000 and oli 2020 into the lcm tools to produce the net change analysis gains and losses transitional analysis and the contribution to change maps and charts step 5 displays the simulation analysis here landsat etm 2000 and oli 2020 were used as input maps in the lcm tool of the idrisi selva program to produce the transition probability matrix transition area matrix and simulated maps 2030 and 2050 the flow diagram is discussed in greater detail in sections 3 1 3 4 3 2 pre processing analysis atmospheric particles frequently alter signals collected by space satellites islam et al 2018 because of these factors the satellite images acquired for the study were preprocessed for atmospheric correction in this study remote sensing procedures such as geo referencing atmospheric correction layer stacking image enhancement and sub setting were observed with arcgis 10 5 and the earth resource development association system erdas imagine 2014 software layer stacking was accomplished by mosaicking the spectral bands of the landsat images into one raster data set before overlaying the shape file of the study region lagos to produce the area of interest aoi and finally sub setting the sub set images were enhanced using histogram equalization the auxiliary data were also sub set to fit the shape of the study area as a result of the failure in the scan line corrector slc in the etm sensor landsat 7 etm images acquired after may 31 2003 frequently display zigzag patterns along the satellite s ground route mohammady et al 2015 this set of landsat series data requires radiometric correction before the classification process thus in this study the landsat toolbox included in the arcgis software was used to do the radiometric correction to get rid of the scan line error of the landsat 7 etm 2010 to analyze the remotely sensed data landsat etm uses an rgb combination of bands 4 representing the nir infrared 5 belonging to red and 3 to green while landsat oli tirs used bands 5 6 and 4 to create the false color composite fcc maps the rgb 564 band combination with landsat oli and the 453 band combination with landsat 7 are the most suitable band combinations for identifying wetland areas hapsari and permatasari 2020 these fcc maps were geometrically corrected to the universal transverse mercator utm zone 32 n datum 1984 of the world geodetic system wgs ellipsoid the erdas imagine software was adopted for supervised classification based on maximum likelihood classification supervised classification entails analyst training areas for each classification scheme bossler 2010 the spectral reflectance signature for the analyzed classes is specified in these training areas the signatures let the classifier group pixels with similar spectral patterns into a single category the analyst chooses training pixel samples by drawing polygons within the respective sites pixels enclosed by polygons are used to store spectral signatures for the classes analyzed from satellite data in this study the pixels were trained on the landsat data as marshes swamps mangroves and water bodies water bodies are areas categorized as rivers permanently open water canals reservoirs lagoons lakes and ponds enoh et al 2022 teferi et al 2013 marshy are wetland areas that are dominant with herbs and grasses obiefuna et al 2013 swamps are inland wetland areas that are predominantly forested whereas mangroves are coastal wetlands with small trees that grow in saline or brackish water obiefuna et al 2013 dwiputra and mustofa 2021 3 3 change detection analysis 3 3 1 post classification comparison pcc method the post classification comparison pcc is a technique that compares two remotely sensed images of the same location but different dates in order to generate pixel by pixel change information during the pcc process tables and maps are constructed to show the changes that have taken place during the classification process singh et al 2015 mondal et al 2015 pcc is a useful method for analyzing change detection as it provides precise change information about a particular area mallupattu and reddy 2013 in recent times several studies have effectively employed the pcc method based on the maximum likelihood classification for change detection analysis toure et al 2018 wang and maduako 2018 in this study the pcc technique was adopted for monitoring spatial temporal changes in the lagos wetland ecosystem here we evaluate the wetland changes on landsat etm 2000 2010 and oli 2020 using the land change modeler lcm lcm is a state of the art tool that is predominantly used in change detection studies to monitor spatial temporal changes and conduct simulation analysis eastman 2006 idrisi 2006 to analyze the spatial temporal change detection in the study two classified maps for each time period 2000 2010 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 were designated as time 1 and time 2 and used as inputs in the lcm tool of idrisi to create change analysis maps and tables the maps and tables allowed us to identify net changes contributors to change and the transition from one wetland class to another 3 3 2 net change gain and loss analysis net changes are differences between the dynamics of gains and losses pontius et al 2004 teferi et al 2013 it is an analysis that can be used to identify the image pixels that have either increased or decreased over time gain is the addition of a study class from time 1 to time 2 losses are the inverse of gains it involves the subtraction of one study class i from the other class j and between the initial time and final time opeyemi et al 2016 3 3 3 contribution of the study classes to net change in this study the land change modeller lcm provided in the idrisi selva software was used to identify the major contributors to the changes in the wetland study classes models such as the lcm aid in our understanding of how land cover systems function and the backing needed for planning and policy development teferi et al 2013 in different situations the lcm can simulate potential changes in land cover such as wetland cover and how it will be used wang and maduako 2018 in our study we discussed the contribution to net change experienced by the study classes during the 2000 2020 study years here we visualize how one study class contributes to the existence of another and vice versa 3 4 statistical analysis 3 4 1 change trend magnitude of change and rate of change analysis the study considered the change trend magnitude of change and the rate of change for the study s classes at various time nodes the change trend k was displayed with a positive sign while the rate of change r was shown with a negative symbol singh et al 2015 toure et al 2018 a negative sign indicates a decrease in the study class whereas a positive sign indicates an increase in the class size the extent of change in each class throughout the time nodes is evaluated using the change rate singh et al 2015 enoh et al 2022 eqs 1 2 are symbols that were used to statistically compute spatial temporal changes such as magnitude of change k and annual rate of change r for each of the classes that constitute the study the magnitude of change k is computed by subtracting the study final date in years from its initial study date in years it is used to calculate the annual rate of change r salaudeen et al 2021 koko et al 2022 1 magnitude of change k a 2 a 1 2 annual rate of change r k m 2 year a 2 a 1 n where a2 and a1 are the study class areas in km2 for the initial and final dates in years respectively and n is the time interval between a2 and a1 in years 3 5 hybrid modeling and simulation analysis 3 5 1 the markov chain mc model the markov model is a discrete state stochastic model that employs probability rather than certainties thomas and laurence 2006 liping et al 2018 it simulates continuous surfaces that change at random through the use of a mathematical equation enoh et al 2022 ma et al 2012 the markov model simulates the future state of land cover classes based on transition probabilities it uses historical transition probabilities to project the future state of land use this is known as the markov property subedi et al 2013 liping et al 2018 and is defined mathematically as 3 mondal et al 2015 3 p ξ t 1 x i t 1 ξ t x i 1 ξ x i t p ξ t 1 x i t 1 ξ t x i t the probability of a markov chain ξ1 ξ2 can be evaluated as shown in eq 4 4 p ξ 1 x i 1 ξ t x i t p ξ 1 x i 1 p ξ 2 x i 2 ξ 1 x i 1 p ξ 1 x i t ξ t 1 x i t 1 the conditional probabilities is shown in 5 liping et al 2018 mondal et al 2015 5 p ξ t 1 x i t 1 ξ t x i t the transformation of land cover types such as wetland is produced by the computation and analysis of the transition probability matrix eq 6 is the transition probability matrix pij p ij is the probability that a specific study class can change from an initial state i to a succeeding state j n depicts the study classes 6 p i j p 11 p 1 n p m 1 p m n 0 p i j 1 and j 1 n p i j 1 i j 1 2 n in environmental research the markov chain model is mostly used to simulate a system with continuous events specifically changes associated with change dynamics studies eq 7 is the method for estimating the land cover change dynamics as used by mohamed and el raey 2019 and zadbagher et al 2018 7 s t 1 p i j s t here s t and s t 1 are the states of the study classes at the initial and final time s t the mc model consists of three primary outputs these outputs are the transition area matrix the transition probability matrix and the transition probability images in the mc model the spatial distribution of the study classes is not taken into consideration due to this the markov chain model cannot accurately simulate the change dynamics in the study classes in order to accurately predict or simulate the study classes another model known as the hybrid or integrated model is required 3 5 2 the cellular automata markov ca markov model a better approach to simulation analysis can be achieved by integrating the methods of cellular automata and markov chains by employing a hybrid model called the ca markov liping et al 2018 ralha et al 2013 the ca markov model simulates changes in different classification classes while considering spatial closeness as a key driver of change analysis it accomplishes this task by utilizing the knowledge of land cover distributions and the structure of spatial contiguity the land cover structure and geographical orientations of change dynamics are taken into account by the integrated ca markov model enoh et al 2022 ma et al 2012 the ca model which is dynamic in nature uses space and time as discrete variables a crucial aspect of ca models is the assessment of local spatial interactions through the influence of neighborhood cells the capacity of a cell to change states from time t to time t 1 depends on its current and neighboring cells the weight factor increases as the space between the central and neighboring cells closes it integrates with transitional probabilities to simulate the status of surrounding grid cells preventing land cover change from being completely random based on their appropriateness and closeness to pixels of the same class pixels were assigned to particular study classes during the simulation procedure the ca markov model which follows the studies of liping et al 2018 singh et al 2017 and mondal et al 2015 is demonstrated in 8 8 s t t 1 f s t n the assumption is that s is a representation of a finite set of cells at a given time t t 1 n is modeled as the area around the cells while f is the local space rule 4 results and interpretation 4 1 spatial temporal analysis 2000 2020 table 3 lists the spatial temporal extent of the study classes and their corresponding proportions which were calculated relative to the total area from 2000 to 2020 it follows that the water body increased gradually from 658 76 km2 42 43 in 2000 to 681 60 km2 43 90 in 2010 and to 712 00 km2 45 86 in 2020 this positive change in the water body class shows that a sizeable portion of the study region is made up of water bodies swamps and mangrove wetland classes also changed from 448 24 km2 28 87 and 406 29 km2 26 17 in 2000 to 317 74 km2 20 46 and 538 87 km2 34 71 respectively in 2010 and to 435 29 km2 28 03 and 405 33 km2 26 10 respectively in 2020 marshy regions had gradually shrunk throughout the classification process from 39 41 km2 2 54 in 2000 to 14 48 km2 0 93 in 2010 and to 0 078 km2 0 01 in 2020 since marshy wetlands are fast disappearing in the study area and have a negligible final value the study supports the findings of obiefuna 2013 and reports from the lagos state government 2020 that swamps and mangroves are the two major types of wetlands that constitute the study area 4 2 the final classification maps for the study fig 4 shows the final classification output maps for the study during the 2000 2020 time periods the maps were derived from landsat etm and oli sensors 4 3 the spatial temporal change dynamics table 4 displays the spatial temporal alterations in the study classes and their corresponding proportions which were computed in relation to the total area from the analysis we see that the water body increased positively by 22 84 km2 1 47 30 40 km2 1 96 and 53 24 km2 3 43 during the 2000 2010 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 study years these positive changes may be a result of heavy rainfall seasonal flooding and the proximity of the atlantic ocean to the study area marshy areas experienced negative changes of 24 92 km2 1 61 14 41 km2 0 92 and 39 33 km2 2 53 between 2000 and 2010 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 respectively continuous sand filling turning marsh regions into built up locations and other anthropogenic activities may have contributed to depreciation negative changes in these wetlands positive and negative alterations were attributed to swamps and mangroves while swamps increased by 117 55 km2 7 57 during the 2010 2020 study period they decreased by 130 50 km2 8 41 and 12 95 km2 0 84 during the 2000 2010 and 2000 2020 study periods respectively mangroves changed positively by 132 58 km2 8 54 during the 2000 2010 and negatively by 133 54 km2 8 61 and 0 96 km2 0 07 during the 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 study periods while intensive rainfall and flooding may have been responsible for the positive changes in swamps and mangrove wetlands other factors such as land encroachment urban expansion climate change and deforestation may also have contributed to their negative changes table 4 further shows the annual rate of change for the study classes during the 2000 2010 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 study periods 4 4 net change gains and losses analysis table 5 shows the net change analysis gains and losses for the study classes during the 1st period 2000 2010 2nd period 2010 2020 and 3rd period 2000 2020 the purple bars on the left side display the increase in kilometers for each of the classes while the green bars on the right side indicate the losses fig 5 during the 1st period the water body swamps marshy and mangrove classes lost 35 0 km2 255 0 km2 8 0 km2 and 240 0 km2 of their previously existing areas while also gaining 70 0 km2 170 0 km2 13 0 km2 and 285 0 km2 their net changes were 35 0 km2 85 0 km2 5 0 km2 and 45 0 km2 respectively in this period swampy wetlands suffered more losses than other classes while also gaining significantly the marshy area experienced the least losses and gains during the 1st period during the 2nd period the water body recorded a net change of 55 0 km2 losing 0 5 km2 of its previous area while also gaining 55 5 km2 during the same period swamps and mangroves lost 130 0 km2 and 205 0 km2 of their former areas while gaining 150 0 km2 and 140 0 km2 from other classes marshy lost 10 0 km2 and recorded no gain during this period the net changes in swamps marshes and mangroves during the 2nd period were 20 0 km2 10 0 km2 and 65 0 km2 respectively during the 3rd period water bodies swamps and mangroves lost 0 5 km2 155 0 km2 and 380 0 km2 of their past existing areas while gaining 75 5 km2 310 0 km2 and 170 0 km2 their net changes were 75 0 km2 155 0 km2 and 210 0 km2 respectively while marshy wetland areas were found to gain nothing during the 3rd period swampy areas gained the most while mangrove areas lost the most swampy marshy and mangrove wetlands suffered losses in the study as part of their previous area may have been submerged by water bodies the submersion of these wetlands may be a result of the city s proximity to the atlantic ocean the wetlands may also have suffered losses because of a high migration rate population growth and other anthropogenic activities fig 5 are charts that highlight the net change gains and losses during the a 2000 2010 b 2010 2020 and c 2000 2020 study periods figs 6 7 are maps that show the gains and losses in the study classes during 2000 2020 4 5 contribution to net change experienced by the study classes figs 8 9 depicts the method of conversion between the study classes fig 8 demonstrates that mangroves were the major contributors to the formation of the water body followed by marshy areas this may be the result of a greater part of the mangrove areas being submerged by water due to seasonal flooding fig 9 a shows that mangroves were the primary contributors to the formation of swamps followed by marshy areas fig 9 b shows that the marshy wetland was the only type of wetland that contributed to the formation of mangroves here swamps and water bodies made no contribution and had remained unchanged in fig 9 c none of the study classes were converted to marshy wetland 4 6 transition analysis in this study the transition analysis during the 2000 2020 study period was performed using the lcm tool in the idrisi selva software using the lcm tool transition maps and tables are produced by using classified maps of the same region but at different times for our research we produced the transition map fig 10 and transition table table 6 by using classified maps of 2000 time 1 and 2020 time 2 as input in the lcm tool of the idrisi selva software the generated transition map and table show significant changes that occurred during the study s transition period 2000 2020 the diagonal of the table displays the classes 641 792 km 0 001 km 252 09 km and 152 426 km that remain un changed during the study totaling 1046 309 km the transition from mangroves to swamps was the highest at 276 501 km and may be as a result of the conversion of a greater part of mangrove to swamp as shown in fig 9 a the transition from water bodies to marsh land was reported to be the least as shown in fig 9 c 4 7 simulation analysis 4 7 1 transition probability matrix tpm table 7 is a transition probability matrix tpm the tpm is a 4 4 matrix that displays the estimated number of cells that are likely to change from one study class to another during the 2030 10 year planning period and 2050 30 year planning period in our research landsat images of 2000 and 2020 were used as input maps in the lcm tools of the idrisi selva software to produce the transition probability matrix the tpm shows the probability of one study class changing to another by 2030 table 7 a and by 2050 table 7 b the rows of the matrix display the older class categories 2000 while the column shows the newer class 2020 the diagonal figures represent the number that remained unchanged while the remaining numbers are transition values represented in percentage following table 7 we see that water bodies are simulated to have a 0 9933 chance of remaining unchanged by 2030 10 year planning period and 0 9820 by 2050 30 year planning period whereas the remaining 0 0000 0 0062 and 0 0004 have a probability to shift to marshy mangroves and swamps respectively in 2030 and 0 0000 0 0133 and 0 0047 in 2050 similarly marshy mangrove and swamp areas have persistence values of 0 0000 0 5572 and 0 3909 in 2030 and 0 0001 0 4699 and 0 3224 in 2050 by observing the analysis we conclude that water bodies have the highest tendency to remain unchanged while swamps have the highest probability of changing into one or more study classes the water bodies may have remained roughly unchanged because part of their area which was lost to other study classes may be replenished by seasonal flooding mainly due to the city s proximity to the atlantic ocean table 8 a b is a 4 4 transition area matrix for the 2030 and 2050 transition years the matrix shows the number of cells that are anticipated to change during the simulation study years 2030 and 2050 4 7 2 final simulation spatial temporal dynamics fig 11 a and b display the study s simulated maps for 2030 and 2050 these maps were produced using the classified maps of 2000 and 2020 as input maps in the lcm tap of the idiris selva program table 9 shows the classification analysis for 2020 2050 with magnitude of changes between 2020 and 2030 and 2020 2050 displayed during the 2030 10 year planning period water bodies swamps marshes and mangroves were 711 99 km2 45 86 405 26 km2 26 10 0 15 km2 0 01 and 435 29 km2 28 03 respectively we also saw that during the 2050 30 year planning period water bodies increased to 747 11 km2 48 12 while swamps marshes and mangroves changed to 400 16 km2 25 77 0 13 km2 0 01 and 405 30 km2 26 10 respectively following the analysis the water body decreased by 0 009 km2 0 00 during 2020 2030 and increased by 35 10 km2 2 26 during the 2020 2050 study year swamp and mangroves changed by 30 02 km2 1 93 and 29 96 km2 1 93 during 2020 2030 and by 35 13 km2 2 26 and 0 027 km2 0 00 during the 2020 2050 study year marshy areas changed by negligible amounts the final output stimulated maps are shown in fig 11 5 discussions the un s sdg 6 offers a plan of action that recognizes the necessity of restoring and managing water related ecosystems like wetlands sdg 13 aims to take drastic action to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change wetlands are crucial to accomplishing the sdgs because they provide a solution to many global issues including those related to water food and climate change the bulk of the proposed sdgs are somehow related to wetlands but this study focused on sdgs 6 and 13 to address issues of climate impact and accessibility to fresh and clean water in lagos city tables 10 11 highlights the different targets and indicators of sdgs 6 and 13 with a background explanation related to lagos city table 3 summarizes the spatial temporal extent of the study classes from 2000 to 2020 according to the analysis the water body class is expanding while the wetlands classes are declining the simulation results also show that the wetland classes are anticipated to reduce further by 2030 2050 to prevent this threat it has become crucial to map conserve and restore degraded lagos wetlands restoring degraded wetlands is a critical step toward meeting sdg 6 by 2030 sdg 6 focuses on clean water and sanitation wetlands have been identified as an ecosystem capable of achieving this goal due to its economic importance it needs to be managed properly if lagos is set to actualize sdg 6 by 2030 wetland conservation and restoration practices can be achieved by continuous surveying either through ground methods or through geospatial technology rs and gis techniques rs and gis have been widely applied over the past four decades to study ecological areas ecological areas such as wetland areas are reservoirs that absorb and filter flood water lagos a coastal city with close proximity to the atlantic ocean has been experiencing flooding problems this floodwater contaminates surface and groundwater and threatens the achievement of sdg 6 in lagos wetlands help overcome these challenges its dense vegetation filters and purifies floodwater and other impurities in lagos fossil fuel emissions have been found to be the primary driver of global warming according to the revised cap transportation energy and waste have been found to pose the greatest threat while transportation has been found to account for 19 6 of the total ghg emissions energy and waste account for 55 1 and 25 3 respectively lagos state government 2020 in line with the un eu and ipcc guidelines to achieve a carbon neutral planet by 2050 as well as the un s sdg 13 by 2030 the cap team devised a number of climate initiatives which include masterminding a strategy to mitigate against ghg emissions wetlands have also been viewed by the lagos state government as part of a strategy plan to cut down on ghg emissions unfortunately the study area s wetlands continue to face significant encroachment according to research done by nigeria s environmental study and action team 2011 approximately 91 of lagos wetlands have been harmed by numerous man made factors this scenario disturbs the lagos state government hence they created a plan for managing conserving and protecting wetlands 6 conclusion recommendations and limitations the study uses remotely sensed tools to study the spatial temporal changes in the lagos wetland with the goal of creating a sustainable and carbon neutral city lagos a coastal megacity is characterized by wetlands which have been altered by urban expansion and other anthropogenic activities in recent decades the un s sdgs offer a plan of action that recognizes the necessity of managing and repairing water related habitats such as wetlands sdg 6 aims to ensure that water and sanitation are available and sustainably managed for all sdg 13 aims to address the problem of climate change and its impact in this study landsat etm 2000 2010 and oli 2020 were employed to map and simulate the spatial temporal changes in lagos wetlands the maximum likelihood classification method was adopted for the mapping process while the ca markov tool was employed for the simulation analysis the spatial temporal analysis reveals that water bodies rose from 658 76 km2 in 2000 to 681 60 km2 in 2010 and to 712 0 km2 in 2020 while marshy areas declined from 39 41 km2 in 2000 to 14 48 km2 in 2010 and to 0 078 km2 in 2020 swamps and mangroves changed from 448 24 km2 and 406 29 km2 in 2000 to 317 74 km2 and 538 87 km2 in 2010 and to 435 29 km2 and 405 33 km2 in 2020 the simulated results show that water bodies swamps marshes and mangroves are expected to change to 711 99 km2 and 747 11 km2 405 26 km2 and 400 16 km2 0 15 km2 and 0 13 km2 as well as 435 29 km2 and 455 30 km2 respectively in the years 2030 2050 according to the study s simulation the lagos wetland continues to alter significantly through 2030 2050 highlighting its depreciation thus if lagos hopes to become carbon neutral by 2050 and achieve the un s sdgs 6 and 13 by 2030 it must adopt sustainable management techniques for its current wetlands our study may have some limitations and drawback one of such setbacks is found in the classification process in the study s classification the classification classes were based only on information categories another setback to this study is that it contains pre established classes credit authorship contribution statement

introduction wetlands are areas of land that are periodically or continuously saturated with water fagorite et al 2019 ajibola et al 2012 they are either inland or coastal wetlands with a water level less than six meters deep at low tide ayansina and ulrike 2015 eludoyin and akinola 2015 wetlands may exist naturally or artificially wali et al 2019 usepa 2015 artificial wetlands are built for water management these areas often contribute to the emerging topic of water sensitive urban design historically wetlands have been considered wasteland where disease vectors can be found elekwachi et al 2021 innocent and dapa 2018 this belief has always led to extensive draining and conversion of wetland areas for alternative uses without consideration for ecological or socioeconomic purposes case studies have shown that wetlands provide a variety of environmental services essential to human well being nyandwi et al 2016 okonkwo et al 2015 john and jaco 2016 they host a diversity of flora and fauna species and offer a range of recreational activities and services the services provided by the wetlands include water purification flood control climate regulation groundwater recharge reducing peak runoff shoreline protection and sediment sinking wali et al 2018a wali et al 2018b during stormy weather wetlands absorb surplus rainfall reducing flooding in urban areas and averting disasters and their associated expenses wetlands are the largest carbon reserves on earth reducing and adjusting to climate change and ensuring the safety and resilience of cities and settlements olatunde and olalekan 2015 chidumje et al 2017 davidson 2014 wetlands are different from other types of water features due to their unique vegetation this vegetation filters out domestic and industrial waste which helps to elevate the quality of the water jerry et al 2013 mccarthy et al 2015 lin and yu 2018 kumar et al 2021 opoku 2013 wetland habitats continue to face major risks and threats despite their high production and wide range of advantages ankrah 2018 kumi et al 2015 abass et al 2018 afriyie et al 2014 a lack of coordinated and comprehensive policy guidelines anthropogenic activities and climate

earth must achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 un 2015 there has been extensive research on the many traditional techniques for monitoring marine ecosystems these techniques are expensive harmful and time consuming atubi et al 2018 kim 2016 hassan et al 2016 an alternative to the traditional methods is remote sensing rs technology zhu 2017 lang et al 2015 rs have been found to be effective for mapping and monitoring wetland areas the technology can be used in conjunction with the technique of geographic informatics system gis to monitor wetland areas towards the achievement of sdg indicators enoh et al 2022 wetland inventories and maps contain vital data for managing restoring and conserving wetland areas remote sensing technology has undergone substantial development since the first multispectral satellite data that is landsat mss became available in the 1970s rai et al 2017 singh et al 2017 remotely sensed imagery is fast becoming more widely available with better spectral spatial and temporal resolution the ability to map wetlands and track spatial temporal changes with extraordinary accuracy has been made possible by advances in image analysis and processing techniques zhou et al 2019 pervez et al 2016 the availability of high resolution imageries such as synthetic aperture radar sar light detection and ranging lidar multispectral and hyperspectral data as well as multi scale and sensor data fusion methods all show significant promise for enhancing large scale wetland mapping liping et al 2018 over the past few decades researchers have developed a number of models for analyzing ecosystems some of these models are statistical models hyandye et al 2015 cellular automata models singh et al 2015 markov chain models guan et al 2019 multi agent models ralha et al 2013 hybrid models subedi et al 2013 and expert system models stefanov et al 2001 the markov chain and the cellular automata ca markov model are currently the most widely utilized models in simulation analysis the ca markov is a mixed model that integrates the benefits of prediction analysis into a complex system he et al 2018 recent studies have identified the historical trend of wetland changes in many cities around the globe these studies demonstrate the capabilities of rs and gis to monitor habitats related to water such as wetland areas elekwachi et al 2019 used landsat tm 1984 etm 1999 2003 and oli 2013 data to analyze the land use and land cover changes in the wetlands ecosystem of port harcourt metropolis the data were geo referenced enhanced classified and sub set with arcgis 10 1 erdas imagine 2014 and idris selva software the results showed that between 1984 and 2013 built up area increased by 8242 8 ha while fresh and salty wetlands deceased by 3003 8 ha and 674 73 ha respectively wizor and wali 2020 used landsat etm and oli sensors to geospatially analyze urban wetland loss in the obio akpor local government area of river state nigeria the result shows that there was a sharp decline in wetland area due to urbanization and other anthropogenic activities wali et al 2018 used landsat tm etm and oli to examine the salt and freshwater ecosystem in the port harcourt metropolis nigeria the study found that there was pressure on the wetland due to human settlement and anthropogenic activities obiefuna et al 2013 studied the spatial changes in lagos wetland from 1984 to 2006 the results show that wetland is rapidly depreciating in the area isunju and kemp 2016 used a very high resolution image and landsat sensors to monitor the spatiotemporal changes in a wetland ecosystem in kampala uganda the findings show that between 2002 and 2014 there was a 62 loss of wetland mainly due to crop production similar approaches were used to monitor wetland ecosystems by larocque et al 2020 in southern new brunswick canada yang et al 2021 in suzhou southeastern jiangau province and the central yangtze river delta china and hapsari and permatasari 2020 in pangpang bay banyuwangi all the above mentioned researchers monitor wetlands with rs and gis tools without any effort to relate their studies with the un s sdg plan of action or global warming our research had bridged this gap with its discussion encompassing climate change climate neutrality and the un s sdgs with particular focus on goals 6 and 13 our study also proved that rs and gis can be used as important techniques to monitor the sdg process lagos is an enormous low lying coastal city with lagoons wetlands and river systems sojobi et al 2015 the city is predominated by swamps and mangroves which exist along the drainage systems lagos state government 2020 the major rivers in the city include the lagos lekki kweme ogun osun and yewa rivers soladoye and ajibade 2014 the others are ologe lagoon five vowries omu creeks and badagry these bodies of water contribute to defining the topography of the study area the lagos wetlands have experienced significant invasion in the past few decades lagos state government 2020 a visit to the region reveals a large number of anthropogenic activities that show significant encroachment according to reports direct loss of habitat suspended particles hydrologic alterations and changes in water quality are some of the adverse effects of this encroachment research findings have shown that if encroachment continues at its current rate lagos wetlands will be fully depleted within the next five decades this threat had bothered the lagos state government and in recent times sustainable campaign programs had been launched programs such as awareness campaigns and the zero tolerance policy against encroachment were announced the lagos state climate action plan cap 2020 2050 was also announced in line with the paris agreement on climate change as a program to mitigate carbon emissions in lagos to 1 5 c and to zero by 2050 if lagos is to achieve its goal of becoming a carbon neutral city by 2050 it must restore its deteriorating wetlands deteriorating wetland has been recognized as a significant source of greenhouse gases ghg fig 1 summarizes lagos s carbon reduction goals for the years 2035 2045 and 2050 the goal is to reduce ghg emissions to 20 below the business as usual bau prediction by 2025 to 45 by 2035 and to zero by 2050 table 1 further summarizes the lagos s total ghg emissions in 2015 and its anticipated emissions for 2025 2035 and 2050 it follows that if climate actions are ignored lagos s ghg emissions will triple by 2050 this study aims to investigate the spatial temporal changes that occurred in the lagos wetland from 2000 to 2020 using the post classification comparison method pcc the pcc method involved the use of the land change modeler lcm tool to quantify the net change analysis gains and losses of the study classes their contribution to change and their transitions from one class to the other the study used its final findings to simulate the spatial temporal changes that could occur in its study classes between 2030 10 year planning period and 2050 30 year planning period the overall goal of the study was to create a sustainable and carbon neutral lagos city the study used remotely sensed data such as from landsat etm 2000 etm 2010 and oli 2020 sensors to produce classification maps and tables based on the pcc technique in order to identify the changes that have occurred in the study classes during the 2000 2020 study period the ca markov model was used for the simulation analysis the transition probability matrix and the transition area matrix were used to identify pixels that will likely change from one study class to the other during the simulated periods 2 description of the study area lagos the most populous city in africa is located on the bight of benin s slender coastal flood plain between longitudes 2 42 e and 3 22 e and latitudes 6 22 n and 6 42 n fig 2 the region is bordered on the east and north by nigeria s ogun state the atlantic ocean on the south and the republic of benin on the west sojobi et al 2015 lagos has a shoreline of 180 kms and a land area of 358 862 hectares it is located 15 m above sea level on a low lying coastal plain lagos state government 2013 case studies show that more than 40 of the city s total land area is made up of water bodies and wetlands with creeks and lagoons making up another 22 lagos coastal areas are separated from the sea by a sandbar with a width of 2 to 16 km the entrance through the lagos lagoon is the sole major exit through which the creeks and lagoons empty their water into the sea lagos state government 2013 the major vegetation types in lagos are freshwater and mangrove swamp forests these vegetation types are influenced by double rainfall patterns which transform the area into a wetland area and produce two separate climatic seasons the dry and wet seasons in lagos while the rainy season lasts from april to october the dry seasons are distinguished by cold and dry weather and run from november to march of the following year 3 materials and methods 3 1 data acquisition and its sources the auxiliary and landsat data were the data sources acquired for this study the google earth image and the topography map were grouped as auxiliary data the landsat data were landsat 7 etm enhanced thematic mapper plus for the years 2000 and 2010 and landsat 8 oli operational land imager for the year 2020 these data were retrieved from the earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov of the united states geological survey usgs using paths and rows of 190 55 190 56 191 55 and 191 56 respectively of the worldwide reference system wrs the landsat etm and oli are 30 m resolution optimized datasets appropriate for geospatial applications to reduce seasonal variation the images were acquired in december with zero cloud cover the parameters of the etm and oli data are displayed in table 2 fig 3 outlines the study s methodological flow diagram this diagram is displayed in sequential steps to show the change detection process step 1 shows that the auxiliary and landsat data were the datasets acquired to monitor the spatial temporal changes in the study classes from 2000 to 2020 step 2 shows the pre processed analysis of the data which included atmospheric correction radiometric processing layer stacking mosaicking sub setting and enhancement in step 3 the pre processed data were classified using the maximum likelihood classifier and according to the developed classification scheme in order to produce the classification maps and tables step 4 shows that the pcc technique was used to analyze the spatial temporal change between the study years by inputting two classified maps etm 2000 and oli 2020 into the lcm tools to produce the net change analysis gains and losses transitional analysis and the contribution to change maps and charts step 5 displays the simulation analysis here landsat etm 2000 and oli 2020 were used as input maps in the lcm tool of the idrisi selva program to produce the transition probability matrix transition area matrix and simulated maps 2030 and 2050 the flow diagram is discussed in greater detail in sections 3 1 3 4 3 2 pre processing analysis atmospheric particles frequently alter signals collected by space satellites islam et al 2018 because of these factors the satellite images acquired for the study were preprocessed for atmospheric correction in this study remote sensing procedures such as geo referencing atmospheric correction layer stacking image enhancement and sub setting were observed with arcgis 10 5 and the earth resource development association system erdas imagine 2014 software layer stacking was accomplished by mosaicking the spectral bands of the landsat images into one raster data set before overlaying the shape file of the study region lagos to produce the area of interest aoi and finally sub setting the sub set images were enhanced using histogram equalization the auxiliary data were also sub set to fit the shape of the study area as a result of the failure in the scan line corrector slc in the etm sensor landsat 7 etm images acquired after may 31 2003 frequently display zigzag patterns along the satellite s ground route mohammady et al 2015 this set of landsat series data requires radiometric correction before the classification process thus in this study the landsat toolbox included in the arcgis software was used to do the radiometric correction to get rid of the scan line error of the landsat 7 etm 2010 to analyze the remotely sensed data landsat etm uses an rgb combination of bands 4 representing the nir infrared 5 belonging to red and 3 to green while landsat oli tirs used bands 5 6 and 4 to create the false color composite fcc maps the rgb 564 band combination with landsat oli and the 453 band combination with landsat 7 are the most suitable band combinations for identifying wetland areas hapsari and permatasari 2020 these fcc maps were geometrically corrected to the universal transverse mercator utm zone 32 n datum 1984 of the world geodetic system wgs ellipsoid the erdas imagine software was adopted for supervised classification based on maximum likelihood classification supervised classification entails analyst training areas for each classification scheme bossler 2010 the spectral reflectance signature for the analyzed classes is specified in these training areas the signatures let the classifier group pixels with similar spectral patterns into a single category the analyst chooses training pixel samples by drawing polygons within the respective sites pixels enclosed by polygons are used to store spectral signatures for the classes analyzed from satellite data in this study the pixels were trained on the landsat data as marshes swamps mangroves and water bodies water bodies are areas categorized as rivers permanently open water canals reservoirs lagoons lakes and ponds enoh et al 2022 teferi et al 2013 marshy are wetland areas that are dominant with herbs and grasses obiefuna et al 2013 swamps are inland wetland areas that are predominantly forested whereas mangroves are coastal wetlands with small trees that grow in saline or brackish water obiefuna et al 2013 dwiputra and mustofa 2021 3 3 change detection analysis 3 3 1 post classification comparison pcc method the post classification comparison pcc is a technique that compares two remotely sensed images of the same location but different dates in order to generate pixel by pixel change information during the pcc process tables and maps are constructed to show the changes that have taken place during the classification process singh et al 2015 mondal et al 2015 pcc is a useful method for analyzing change detection as it provides precise change information about a particular area mallupattu and reddy 2013 in recent times several studies have effectively employed the pcc method based on the maximum likelihood classification for change detection analysis toure et al 2018 wang and maduako 2018 in this study the pcc technique was adopted for monitoring spatial temporal changes in the lagos wetland ecosystem here we evaluate the wetland changes on landsat etm 2000 2010 and oli 2020 using the land change modeler lcm lcm is a state of the art tool that is predominantly used in change detection studies to monitor spatial temporal changes and conduct simulation analysis eastman 2006 idrisi 2006 to analyze the spatial temporal change detection in the study two classified maps for each time period 2000 2010 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 were designated as time 1 and time 2 and used as inputs in the lcm tool of idrisi to create change analysis maps and tables the maps and tables allowed us to identify net changes contributors to change and the transition from one wetland class to another 3 3 2 net change gain and loss analysis net changes are differences between the dynamics of gains and losses pontius et al 2004 teferi et al 2013 it is an analysis that can be used to identify the image pixels that have either increased or decreased over time gain is the addition of a study class from time 1 to time 2 losses are the inverse of gains it involves the subtraction of one study class i from the other class j and between the initial time and final time opeyemi et al 2016 3 3 3 contribution of the study classes to net change in this study the land change modeller lcm provided in the idrisi selva software was used to identify the major contributors to the changes in the wetland study classes models such as the lcm aid in our understanding of how land cover systems function and the backing needed for planning and policy development teferi et al 2013 in different situations the lcm can simulate potential changes in land cover such as wetland cover and how it will be used wang and maduako 2018 in our study we discussed the contribution to net change experienced by the study classes during the 2000 2020 study years here we visualize how one study class contributes to the existence of another and vice versa 3 4 statistical analysis 3 4 1 change trend magnitude of change and rate of change analysis the study considered the change trend magnitude of change and the rate of change for the study s classes at various time nodes the change trend k was displayed with a positive sign while the rate of change r was shown with a negative symbol singh et al 2015 toure et al 2018 a negative sign indicates a decrease in the study class whereas a positive sign indicates an increase in the class size the extent of change in each class throughout the time nodes is evaluated using the change rate singh et al 2015 enoh et al 2022 eqs 1 2 are symbols that were used to statistically compute spatial temporal changes such as magnitude of change k and annual rate of change r for each of the classes that constitute the study the magnitude of change k is computed by subtracting the study final date in years from its initial study date in years it is used to calculate the annual rate of change r salaudeen et al 2021 koko et al 2022 1 magnitude of change k a 2 a 1 2 annual rate of change r k m 2 year a 2 a 1 n where a2 and a1 are the study class areas in km2 for the initial and final dates in years respectively and n is the time interval between a2 and a1 in years 3 5 hybrid modeling and simulation analysis 3 5 1 the markov chain mc model the markov model is a discrete state stochastic model that employs probability rather than certainties thomas and laurence 2006 liping et al 2018 it simulates continuous surfaces that change at random through the use of a mathematical equation enoh et al 2022 ma et al 2012 the markov model simulates the future state of land cover classes based on transition probabilities it uses historical transition probabilities to project the future state of land use this is known as the markov property subedi et al 2013 liping et al 2018 and is defined mathematically as 3 mondal et al 2015 3 p ξ t 1 x i t 1 ξ t x i 1 ξ x i t p ξ t 1 x i t 1 ξ t x i t the probability of a markov chain ξ1 ξ2 can be evaluated as shown in eq 4 4 p ξ 1 x i 1 ξ t x i t p ξ 1 x i 1 p ξ 2 x i 2 ξ 1 x i 1 p ξ 1 x i t ξ t 1 x i t 1 the conditional probabilities is shown in 5 liping et al 2018 mondal et al 2015 5 p ξ t 1 x i t 1 ξ t x i t the transformation of land cover types such as wetland is produced by the computation and analysis of the transition probability matrix eq 6 is the transition probability matrix pij p ij is the probability that a specific study class can change from an initial state i to a succeeding state j n depicts the study classes 6 p i j p 11 p 1 n p m 1 p m n 0 p i j 1 and j 1 n p i j 1 i j 1 2 n in environmental research the markov chain model is mostly used to simulate a system with continuous events specifically changes associated with change dynamics studies eq 7 is the method for estimating the land cover change dynamics as used by mohamed and el raey 2019 and zadbagher et al 2018 7 s t 1 p i j s t here s t and s t 1 are the states of the study classes at the initial and final time s t the mc model consists of three primary outputs these outputs are the transition area matrix the transition probability matrix and the transition probability images in the mc model the spatial distribution of the study classes is not taken into consideration due to this the markov chain model cannot accurately simulate the change dynamics in the study classes in order to accurately predict or simulate the study classes another model known as the hybrid or integrated model is required 3 5 2 the cellular automata markov ca markov model a better approach to simulation analysis can be achieved by integrating the methods of cellular automata and markov chains by employing a hybrid model called the ca markov liping et al 2018 ralha et al 2013 the ca markov model simulates changes in different classification classes while considering spatial closeness as a key driver of change analysis it accomplishes this task by utilizing the knowledge of land cover distributions and the structure of spatial contiguity the land cover structure and geographical orientations of change dynamics are taken into account by the integrated ca markov model enoh et al 2022 ma et al 2012 the ca model which is dynamic in nature uses space and time as discrete variables a crucial aspect of ca models is the assessment of local spatial interactions through the influence of neighborhood cells the capacity of a cell to change states from time t to time t 1 depends on its current and neighboring cells the weight factor increases as the space between the central and neighboring cells closes it integrates with transitional probabilities to simulate the status of surrounding grid cells preventing land cover change from being completely random based on their appropriateness and closeness to pixels of the same class pixels were assigned to particular study classes during the simulation procedure the ca markov model which follows the studies of liping et al 2018 singh et al 2017 and mondal et al 2015 is demonstrated in 8 8 s t t 1 f s t n the assumption is that s is a representation of a finite set of cells at a given time t t 1 n is modeled as the area around the cells while f is the local space rule 4 results and interpretation 4 1 spatial temporal analysis 2000 2020 table 3 lists the spatial temporal extent of the study classes and their corresponding proportions which were calculated relative to the total area from 2000 to 2020 it follows that the water body increased gradually from 658 76 km2 42 43 in 2000 to 681 60 km2 43 90 in 2010 and to 712 00 km2 45 86 in 2020 this positive change in the water body class shows that a sizeable portion of the study region is made up of water bodies swamps and mangrove wetland classes also changed from 448 24 km2 28 87 and 406 29 km2 26 17 in 2000 to 317 74 km2 20 46 and 538 87 km2 34 71 respectively in 2010 and to 435 29 km2 28 03 and 405 33 km2 26 10 respectively in 2020 marshy regions had gradually shrunk throughout the classification process from 39 41 km2 2 54 in 2000 to 14 48 km2 0 93 in 2010 and to 0 078 km2 0 01 in 2020 since marshy wetlands are fast disappearing in the study area and have a negligible final value the study supports the findings of obiefuna 2013 and reports from the lagos state government 2020 that swamps and mangroves are the two major types of wetlands that constitute the study area 4 2 the final classification maps for the study fig 4 shows the final classification output maps for the study during the 2000 2020 time periods the maps were derived from landsat etm and oli sensors 4 3 the spatial temporal change dynamics table 4 displays the spatial temporal alterations in the study classes and their corresponding proportions which were computed in relation to the total area from the analysis we see that the water body increased positively by 22 84 km2 1 47 30 40 km2 1 96 and 53 24 km2 3 43 during the 2000 2010 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 study years these positive changes may be a result of heavy rainfall seasonal flooding and the proximity of the atlantic ocean to the study area marshy areas experienced negative changes of 24 92 km2 1 61 14 41 km2 0 92 and 39 33 km2 2 53 between 2000 and 2010 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 respectively continuous sand filling turning marsh regions into built up locations and other anthropogenic activities may have contributed to depreciation negative changes in these wetlands positive and negative alterations were attributed to swamps and mangroves while swamps increased by 117 55 km2 7 57 during the 2010 2020 study period they decreased by 130 50 km2 8 41 and 12 95 km2 0 84 during the 2000 2010 and 2000 2020 study periods respectively mangroves changed positively by 132 58 km2 8 54 during the 2000 2010 and negatively by 133 54 km2 8 61 and 0 96 km2 0 07 during the 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 study periods while intensive rainfall and flooding may have been responsible for the positive changes in swamps and mangrove wetlands other factors such as land encroachment urban expansion climate change and deforestation may also have contributed to their negative changes table 4 further shows the annual rate of change for the study classes during the 2000 2010 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 study periods 4 4 net change gains and losses analysis table 5 shows the net change analysis gains and losses for the study classes during the 1st period 2000 2010 2nd period 2010 2020 and 3rd period 2000 2020 the purple bars on the left side display the increase in kilometers for each of the classes while the green bars on the right side indicate the losses fig 5 during the 1st period the water body swamps marshy and mangrove classes lost 35 0 km2 255 0 km2 8 0 km2 and 240 0 km2 of their previously existing areas while also gaining 70 0 km2 170 0 km2 13 0 km2 and 285 0 km2 their net changes were 35 0 km2 85 0 km2 5 0 km2 and 45 0 km2 respectively in this period swampy wetlands suffered more losses than other classes while also gaining significantly the marshy area experienced the least losses and gains during the 1st period during the 2nd period the water body recorded a net change of 55 0 km2 losing 0 5 km2 of its previous area while also gaining 55 5 km2 during the same period swamps and mangroves lost 130 0 km2 and 205 0 km2 of their former areas while gaining 150 0 km2 and 140 0 km2 from other classes marshy lost 10 0 km2 and recorded no gain during this period the net changes in swamps marshes and mangroves during the 2nd period were 20 0 km2 10 0 km2 and 65 0 km2 respectively during the 3rd period water bodies swamps and mangroves lost 0 5 km2 155 0 km2 and 380 0 km2 of their past existing areas while gaining 75 5 km2 310 0 km2 and 170 0 km2 their net changes were 75 0 km2 155 0 km2 and 210 0 km2 respectively while marshy wetland areas were found to gain nothing during the 3rd period swampy areas gained the most while mangrove areas lost the most swampy marshy and mangrove wetlands suffered losses in the study as part of their previous area may have been submerged by water bodies the submersion of these wetlands may be a result of the city s proximity to the atlantic ocean the wetlands may also have suffered losses because of a high migration rate population growth and other anthropogenic activities fig 5 are charts that highlight the net change gains and losses during the a 2000 2010 b 2010 2020 and c 2000 2020 study periods figs 6 7 are maps that show the gains and losses in the study classes during 2000 2020 4 5 contribution to net change experienced by the study classes figs 8 9 depicts the method of conversion between the study classes fig 8 demonstrates that mangroves were the major contributors to the formation of the water body followed by marshy areas this may be the result of a greater part of the mangrove areas being submerged by water due to seasonal flooding fig 9 a shows that mangroves were the primary contributors to the formation of swamps followed by marshy areas fig 9 b shows that the marshy wetland was the only type of wetland that contributed to the formation of mangroves here swamps and water bodies made no contribution and had remained unchanged in fig 9 c none of the study classes were converted to marshy wetland 4 6 transition analysis in this study the transition analysis during the 2000 2020 study period was performed using the lcm tool in the idrisi selva software using the lcm tool transition maps and tables are produced by using classified maps of the same region but at different times for our research we produced the transition map fig 10 and transition table table 6 by using classified maps of 2000 time 1 and 2020 time 2 as input in the lcm tool of the idrisi selva software the generated transition map and table show significant changes that occurred during the study s transition period 2000 2020 the diagonal of the table displays the classes 641 792 km 0 001 km 252 09 km and 152 426 km that remain un changed during the study totaling 1046 309 km the transition from mangroves to swamps was the highest at 276 501 km and may be as a result of the conversion of a greater part of mangrove to swamp as shown in fig 9 a the transition from water bodies to marsh land was reported to be the least as shown in fig 9 c 4 7 simulation analysis 4 7 1 transition probability matrix tpm table 7 is a transition probability matrix tpm the tpm is a 4 4 matrix that displays the estimated number of cells that are likely to change from one study class to another during the 2030 10 year planning period and 2050 30 year planning period in our research landsat images of 2000 and 2020 were used as input maps in the lcm tools of the idrisi selva software to produce the transition probability matrix the tpm shows the probability of one study class changing to another by 2030 table 7 a and by 2050 table 7 b the rows of the matrix display the older class categories 2000 while the column shows the newer class 2020 the diagonal figures represent the number that remained unchanged while the remaining numbers are transition values represented in percentage following table 7 we see that water bodies are simulated to have a 0 9933 chance of remaining unchanged by 2030 10 year planning period and 0 9820 by 2050 30 year planning period whereas the remaining 0 0000 0 0062 and 0 0004 have a probability to shift to marshy mangroves and swamps respectively in 2030 and 0 0000 0 0133 and 0 0047 in 2050 similarly marshy mangrove and swamp areas have persistence values of 0 0000 0 5572 and 0 3909 in 2030 and 0 0001 0 4699 and 0 3224 in 2050 by observing the analysis we conclude that water bodies have the highest tendency to remain unchanged while swamps have the highest probability of changing into one or more study classes the water bodies may have remained roughly unchanged because part of their area which was lost to other study classes may be replenished by seasonal flooding mainly due to the city s proximity to the atlantic ocean table 8 a b is a 4 4 transition area matrix for the 2030 and 2050 transition years the matrix shows the number of cells that are anticipated to change during the simulation study years 2030 and 2050 4 7 2 final simulation spatial temporal dynamics fig 11 a and b display the study s simulated maps for 2030 and 2050 these maps were produced using the classified maps of 2000 and 2020 as input maps in the lcm tap of the idiris selva program table 9 shows the classification analysis for 2020 2050 with magnitude of changes between 2020 and 2030 and 2020 2050 displayed during the 2030 10 year planning period water bodies swamps marshes and mangroves were 711 99 km2 45 86 405 26 km2 26 10 0 15 km2 0 01 and 435 29 km2 28 03 respectively we also saw that during the 2050 30 year planning period water bodies increased to 747 11 km2 48 12 while swamps marshes and mangroves changed to 400 16 km2 25 77 0 13 km2 0 01 and 405 30 km2 26 10 respectively following the analysis the water body decreased by 0 009 km2 0 00 during 2020 2030 and increased by 35 10 km2 2 26 during the 2020 2050 study year swamp and mangroves changed by 30 02 km2 1 93 and 29 96 km2 1 93 during 2020 2030 and by 35 13 km2 2 26 and 0 027 km2 0 00 during the 2020 2050 study year marshy areas changed by negligible amounts the final output stimulated maps are shown in fig 11 5 discussions the un s sdg 6 offers a plan of action that recognizes the necessity of restoring and managing water related ecosystems like wetlands sdg 13 aims to take drastic action to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change wetlands are crucial to accomplishing the sdgs because they provide a solution to many global issues including those related to water food and climate change the bulk of the proposed sdgs are somehow related to wetlands but this study focused on sdgs 6 and 13 to address issues of climate impact and accessibility to fresh and clean water in lagos city tables 10 11 highlights the different targets and indicators of sdgs 6 and 13 with a background explanation related to lagos city table 3 summarizes the spatial temporal extent of the study classes from 2000 to 2020 according to the analysis the water body class is expanding while the wetlands classes are declining the simulation results also show that the wetland classes are anticipated to reduce further by 2030 2050 to prevent this threat it has become crucial to map conserve and restore degraded lagos wetlands restoring degraded wetlands is a critical step toward meeting sdg 6 by 2030 sdg 6 focuses on clean water and sanitation wetlands have been identified as an ecosystem capable of achieving this goal due to its economic importance it needs to be managed properly if lagos is set to actualize sdg 6 by 2030 wetland conservation and restoration practices can be achieved by continuous surveying either through ground methods or through geospatial technology rs and gis techniques rs and gis have been widely applied over the past four decades to study ecological areas ecological areas such as wetland areas are reservoirs that absorb and filter flood water lagos a coastal city with close proximity to the atlantic ocean has been experiencing flooding problems this floodwater contaminates surface and groundwater and threatens the achievement of sdg 6 in lagos wetlands help overcome these challenges its dense vegetation filters and purifies floodwater and other impurities in lagos fossil fuel emissions have been found to be the primary driver of global warming according to the revised cap transportation energy and waste have been found to pose the greatest threat while transportation has been found to account for 19 6 of the total ghg emissions energy and waste account for 55 1 and 25 3 respectively lagos state government 2020 in line with the un eu and ipcc guidelines to achieve a carbon neutral planet by 2050 as well as the un s sdg 13 by 2030 the cap team devised a number of climate initiatives which include masterminding a strategy to mitigate against ghg emissions wetlands have also been viewed by the lagos state government as part of a strategy plan to cut down on ghg emissions unfortunately the study area s wetlands continue to face significant encroachment according to research done by nigeria s environmental study and action team 2011 approximately 91 of lagos wetlands have been harmed by numerous man made factors this scenario disturbs the lagos state government hence they created a plan for managing conserving and protecting wetlands 6 conclusion recommendations and limitations the study uses remotely sensed tools to study the spatial temporal changes in the lagos wetland with the goal of creating a sustainable and carbon neutral city lagos a coastal megacity is characterized by wetlands which have been altered by urban expansion and other anthropogenic activities in recent decades the un s sdgs offer a plan of action that recognizes the necessity of managing and repairing water related habitats such as wetlands sdg 6 aims to ensure that water and sanitation are available and sustainably managed for all sdg 13 aims to address the problem of climate change and its impact in this study landsat etm 2000 2010 and oli 2020 were employed to map and simulate the spatial temporal changes in lagos wetlands the maximum likelihood classification method was adopted for the mapping process while the ca markov tool was employed for the simulation analysis the spatial temporal analysis reveals that water bodies rose from 658 76 km2 in 2000 to 681 60 km2 in 2010 and to 712 0 km2 in 2020 while marshy areas declined from 39 41 km2 in 2000 to 14 48 km2 in 2010 and to 0 078 km2 in 2020 swamps and mangroves changed from 448 24 km2 and 406 29 km2 in 2000 to 317 74 km2 and 538 87 km2 in 2010 and to 435 29 km2 and 405 33 km2 in 2020 the simulated results show that water bodies swamps marshes and mangroves are expected to change to 711 99 km2 and 747 11 km2 405 26 km2 and 400 16 km2 0 15 km2 and 0 13 km2 as well as 435 29 km2 and 455 30 km2 respectively in the years 2030 2050 according to the study s simulation the lagos wetland continues to alter significantly through 2030 2050 highlighting its depreciation thus if lagos hopes to become carbon neutral by 2050 and achieve the un s sdgs 6 and 13 by 2030 it must adopt sustainable management techniques for its current wetlands our study may have some limitations and drawback one of such setbacks is found in the classification process in the study s classification the classification classes were based only on information categories another setback to this study is that it contains pre established classes credit authorship contribution statement
