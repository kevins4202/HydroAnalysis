21505,a conventional pid controller for the dps has limitations due to fixed gains and dependence on manual adjustment for its gains therefore several previous studies developed a fuzzy based adaptive pid controller for the dps which tunes the gains based on the fuzzy logic however the fuzzy logic has its disadvantages due to a manual definition of fuzzy rules and fuzzy variables to overcome those limitations a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to learn the efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy without human intuition behind since it does not require any prior knowledge about the dynamics of a ship or dps finally it is shown that the proposed system can result in better station keeping performance without deterioration in its control efficiency keywords dynamic positioning system dps proportional integral derivative pid fine tuning deep reinforcement learning drl deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg 1 introduction dynamic positioning of a vessel refers to a process of automatically controlling a vessel s thrusters to maintain the vessel at a fixed position and heading conventionally dynamic positioning system dps uses a proportional integral derivative pid controller harbonn 1971 jeon et al 2017 nguyen et al 2007 van t veer and gachet 2011 however there are two main limitations in a conventional pid controller first a pid controller has p i and d gains in its structure and they need to be adjusted as parameters those gains are usually tuned manually by trial and error however such manual gain tuning may not result in optimal values for the gains since the gain tuning is based on trial and error and human intuition to automate the pid gain tuning process many studies have been conducted the most common and easiest pid tuning method is a ziegler nichols zn method ziegler and nichols 1942 and this zn method was adopted in many previous studies for the dps jeon et al 2017 koschorrek et al 2015 van t veer and gachet 2011 aside from the zn method other pid gain tuning methods such as davison method davison 1976 penttinen method penttinen and koivo 1980 and maciejowski method maciejowski 1989 were analyzed for the pid gain tuning for the dps in martin and katebi 2005 however no matter how the pid gains are tuned with the tuning methods introduced above the tuned gains remain fixed it is well known that performance of a conventional pid controller is somewhat limited when there is a time varying load teoh and yee 1991 which is the second main limitation of a conventional pid controller in case of the dps since it needs to maintain a vessel s position at the open sea it faces environmental loads such as wind wave and current loads which vary over time thus a pid controller with the fixed gains cannot yield efficient station keeping performance for the dps to cope with the time varying loads an adaptive pid controller was introduced teoh and yee 1991 the main advantage of an adaptive pid controller is that it adaptively tunes the gains to cope with the varying loads for the dps many adaptive pid controllers were developed based on fuzzy logic jeon et al 2017 xu et al 2019 yamamoto and morooka 2005 in the previous studies of the fuzzy based adaptive pid controller for the dps the controller adaptively tuned the gains considering a position and velocity of a ship at every timestep and it achieved better station keeping performance but since this fuzzy based adaptive pid controller used fuzzy logic it had intrinsic limitations of manual definition of fuzzy rules and fuzzy variables of the system both of which require human expertise in the application domain and can result in different performance by different individuals also the fuzzy based adaptive pid controller s fuzzy rule was designed to increase the p and d gains when a ship starts to drift or is far away from a target position this gain tuning strategy certainly increases the station keeping performance but it comes with the cost of aggressive thrust control xu et al 2019 which is undesirable in terms of control efficiency jon and breivik 2009 in this paper a concept of an adaptive pid controller is used and its gains are tuned by an adaptive fine tuning system proposed in this study instead of the fuzzy logic the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is based on the following two notions 1 it should not be dependent of human intuition based adaptive gain tuning strategy 2 it should be able to achieve the better station keeping performance without further dp thrust consumption or a higher rate of the thrust change which represent the control efficiency to achieve the first notion one of the deep reinforcement learning drl algorithms deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg lillicrap et al 2016 is utilized since it does not require any prior knowledge about the dynamics of a ship or dps to learn an efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy by interacting with a given environment to achieve the second notion the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is restricted for its available gain range to 0 k base where k base represents a base gain the base gain is a pre tuned gain by pid gain tuning methods such as manual tuning method zn method or any pid gain tuning method because the available gain range is restricted the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is restricted in simply overusing the dp thrust to increase the station keeping performance with the two notions the adaptive fine tuning system is forced to learn how to efficiently tune the adaptive gains to increase the station keeping performance while its choice for the gain is restricted not to overuse the thrust the term fine tuning in the proposed system comes from the fine tuning for a convolutional neural network in deep learning guo et al 2019 as to the application of the drl to an adaptive pid controller there have been many studies conducted for robots carlucho et al 2020 2019 gloye et al 2005 in carlucho et al 2020 2019 and gloye et al 2005 the robots with the drl successfully learned to achieve a fast reference tracking with the fast convergence by adaptively tuning the gains the main differences between those previous works and the work in this paper are the application and the environment in this work unlike carlucho et al 2020 2019 and gloye et al 2005 a 285m fpso floating production storage and offloading ship is used as a target of the application which has a much slower response to a control signal than a small robot and the environmental load is far greater which causes a high magnitude of drifting motions van t veer and gachet 2011 for the proposed adaptive fine tuning system the main goal is the same as the fast convergence to the tracking reference but instead of converging to a varying reference quickly it needs to converge to a constant reference position quickly after the ship is drifted by the environmental load in the following sections a reinforcement learning theory a target ship and the dps and the proposed adaptive fine tuning system are presented then simulation results and discussion are followed 2 reinforcement learning theory in standard reinforcement learning rl sutton and barto 2018 there is an agent and an environment that that the agent interacts with in discrete time steps at every timestep the agent receives a state s t and takes action a t and obtains a reward r t forming a sequential transition s t a t r t s t 1 a t 1 r t 1 throughout an episode the action a t is determined by a policy π which maps the state s t to probabilistic values of each action p a t because the policy usually takes the action with an action noise which is used to ensure exploration in the state and action space the learning process of the agent can be defined mathematically using a markov decision process mdp a generic flowchart of the process is shown in fig 1 in the figure as the agent continues to interact with the environment the policy π can learn a better and better policy by maximizing the reward that the agent receives in many rl algorithms an action value function the so called q function is used in the learning process the q function describes the expected return value g t which is expressed as eq 1 1 g t i t t γ i t r s i a i γ 0 1 where γ is a discounting factor to consider influence of uncertainties towards the future after taking action a t in a state s t and thereafter following policy π the q function can be written in a recursive form by using the bellman equation bellman 1954 2 q π s t a t e r t s t 1 e r s t a t γ e a t 1 π q π s t 1 a t 1 3 r t r s t a t if a deterministic policy μ that maps a state s t to deterministic values of each action a t is used eq 2 can be rewritten as eq 4 4 q μ s t a t e r t s t 1 e r s t a t γ q μ s t 1 μ s t 1 where q μ can be learned by an off policy learning algorithm called q learning proposed by watkins and dayan 1992 with transitions of s t a t r t s t 1 a t 1 r t 1 generated from a potentially different stochastic behavior policy β and the q learning can use a greedy policy μ s a r g m a x a q s a as a deterministic policy the goal of the q learning is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected q function however q learning is likely to have difficulties in learning if the state action space or a reward function is complex therefore it is common to use a neural network as a function approximator for the q function this approximator is parameterized by θ q which can be optimized by minimizing the following loss function l θ q 5 l θ q e s t ρ β a t β r t e q s t a t θ q y t 2 6 y t r s t a t γ q s t 1 μ s t 1 θ q where ρ β denotes a state visitation distribution by β however applying the q learning to continuous action spaces is not possible because finding the greedy policy requires optimization of a t at every timestep instead the policy can be updated in the direction of the gradient of q by using the dpg algorithm silver et al 2014 with an actor critic approach where the action is approximated by a neural network called actor and q is approximated by another neural network called critic in the actor critic the actor and critic are parameterized by θ μ and θ q respectively and a policy is represented by the actor the actor is learned through the application of eq 7 where j is maximized and the critic is learned by the bellman equation as in the q learning 7 θ μ j e s t ρ β θ μ q s a θ q s s t a μ s t θ μ yet this actor critic approach has difficulties in convergence and the learning is unstable if the observation space is very high dimensional to solve this problem lillicrap et al 2016 proposed the ddpg which is basically a combination of the dpg based actor critic and the deep q network dqn proposed by mnih et al 2013 the two main features from the dqn for the ddpg are a replay buffer and target networks the replay buffer is a storage for transitions of s t a t r t s t 1 and the target networks are duplicated actor and critic whose weights are gradually updated by fractional weights of the actor and critic it was shown that the application of the replay buffer and target networks could stabilize and improve the learning process significantly 3 target ship and dps 3 1 properties of target ship and dps the target ship and dps introduced here are the ship and dps used for the simulations in the result section properties of the target ship and dps are presented in detail principal dimension of the target ship and its coordinate system are shown in table 1 and fig 2 respectively in fig 2 n and b are the origins of global and local coordinate systems respectively ψ is a heading angle of the ship in degrees the global and local positions of the ship are in meters and denoted as x y and x ʹ y ʹ respectively the target ship is equipped with six azimuth thrusters their arrangement and details are shown in fig 3 and table 2 respectively 3 2 pid control in dps a control law of a single pid controller is shown in eq 8 where u t is the low level controller output at time t e t is an error which is defined as a reference position subtracted by a current position k p k i and k d are the proportional integral and derivative gains of the pid controller respectively 8 u t k p e t k i 0 t e t d t k d d e t d t in case of the pid controller in the dps since there are three directional motions surge sway and yaw that need to be maintained by the dps three pid controllers are used in the dp s pid control system the structure of the pid control system in the dps is shown in fig 4 in this figure x ref is a vector of reference ship positions in the surge sway and yaw directions e t is a vector of the errors in the surge sway and yaw directions at time t t t is a required thrust in each direction where the direction is denoted in the superscript parenthesis and each t t denotes the same as u t t t is a vector of the allocated thrusts for each thruster and x t 1 is a vector of current ship positions in the surge sway and yaw directions at time t 1 the details of x ref e t t t and x t 1 are shown in eqs 9 12 in t t the number next to t represents a thrust number for x t 1 it should be noted that the ship positions are the positions filtered by a kalman filter which is used to remove the ship motion components induced by the 1st order wave load fossen and perez 2009 in fig 4 the flow of the control system is as follows first e t is calculated based on x ref and x t and it is fed into each of the three pid controllers according to their directions then each pid controller outputs t t and it is fed into the thrust allocation algorithm to output t t for the thrust allocation algorithm for the dp thrust a lagrange multiplier method is used de wit 2009 3 3 hydrodynamics associated with a drifting motion of a ship this section is present to provide an understanding of the environmental loads that contribute to the ship s drifting motion and how the dp thrust counteract the environmental loads the mathematical model of the ship motion can be expressed as eq 13 fossen and perez 2009 13 m p a c p v k p f p v t where m p a is the system inertia load c p v is the system damping load k p is the system stiffness load f p v t is the external load p v and a are the position velocity and acceleration respectively and t is time for the dps the external load f p v t is equal to eq 14 14 f p v t τ wind τ current τ wave τ thrusters where τ represents external loads and subscripts represent sources of the external loads there are three types of environmental loads contributing to the drifting motion of a ship such as wind current and wave drift loads the environmental loads contributing to the drifting motion are presented in fig 5 the wave load is divided into the 1st order and 2nd order wave loads the difference between these two loads is shown by ship motions affected by these two loads in fig 6 hassani and pascoal 2015 for the dps to compensate for the drifting motion caused by the wind current and wave drift loads the dp thrusters need to counteract the environmental loads this relation can be expressed as eq 15 in which the dps basically maintains a ship s position by trying to satisfy this equation 15 τ wind τ current τ wave drift τ thrusters 0 the wind and current loads can be expressed as eqs 16 19 fossen and perez 2009 and the wave drift load can be expressed as eq 20 orcina 2019 16 τ wind 1 2 ρ air v r 2 c surge a surge c sway a sway c yaw a yaw 17 a yaw l b p a s w a y 18 τ current 1 2 ρ water v r 2 c surge a

obtained from a diffraction analysis in the frequency domain on the target ship β is the direction of the regular wave component relative to the ship s heading t a ω φ are the wave period amplitude frequency and phase lag of the regular wave component eq 20 shows that qtf wave drift is applied to each pair of the regular wave components to yield each pair s contribution to the wave drift load 4 proposed adaptive fine tuning system for pid gains in dps an overall structure of the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is shown in fig 7 for intuitive understanding fig 7 is drawn on the top of fig 4 in this figure the state s t is an input vector for the actor and critic k t is a vector of the adaptive pid gains and g t is an update gate for the integral of the errors a configuration of s t is shown in eq 21 the previous motion time histories are used in s t to consider a memory effect in which a fluid load is determined in part by previous motions at any instant yeung 1983 the integrals of the errors are also included in s t since they are influential terms for the mean station keeping position and also needed to provide enough information to output the update gate for the integral of the errors g t during the training of the actor and critic a normalized s t is used to ensure the training stability lee et al 2020 for the normalization of s t the error terms in s t are normalized by eq 22 where s is all the states stored in the replay buffer and the std stands for standard deviation and the integral of the error terms in s t are normalized by dividing them by 100 to make them small enough for the stable neural network training the integral of the error terms are differently normalized because these terms usually increase and gradually decrease over time unlike the error terms which go around their mean values with certain standard deviations since the ship position goes around its reference position by the dps 21 s t e t 9 x ʹ e t 8 x ʹ e t x ʹ e t 9 y ʹ e

gains for the surge sway and yaw directions the details of k t is shown in eq 23 where each k t consist of the adaptive p i and d gains in each direction as shown in eq 24 k base is a vector of the base gains determined based on the zn method and a t is the output vector from the actor s output layer in this paper the actor uses a sigmoid activation function in its output layer the sigmoid activation function is shown in eq 25 therefore ranges of each component in a t and k t are 0 1 and 0 k base respectively with k t the pid controller with the adaptive gains is expressed as eq 26 where the direction is denoted in the superscript parenthesis 23 k t k t x ʹ k t y ʹ k t ψ a t k base 24 k t k p t k i t k d t 25 φ z 1 1 e z 26 t t k p t e t k i t 0 t e t d t k d t d e t d t the update gate for integral of the errors g t determines how much error to update for the integral of the errors which is in the integral terms in the pid controllers the update equation of the integral of errors by g t is shown in eq 27 where g t 0 1 the concept of g t was inspired by gated recurrent units gru chung et al 2014 27 0 t e t d t 0 t 1 e t d t g t e t 28 g t g t x ʹ g t y ʹ g t ψ g t is designed to prevent a large rebound motion of a ship when a sea state is severe a ship experiences large drifting motions on a drifting side mostly due to aggressive wave drift loads an illustration of the drifting side and an example of the wave drift load time history are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively while a ship is drifted greatly due to the very large wave drift load the integral of the error increases drastically as well due to the drastically increased integral of the error over many drifting motions the large rebound ship motions are caused the large rebound ship motions caused by the increased integral of the error are illustrated in fig 10 as to the adaptive gains from the actor the i gain is fixed when a ship is on the drifting side while the p and d gains are adaptively selected by the actor the i gain is fixed on the drifting side to ensure the convergence of the station keeping on the other side of the drifting side the i gain is adaptively selected the drifting side can easily be identified by the integral of the error architectures of the actor and critic are shown in fig 11 where the hl stands for a hidden layer the bn stands for batch normalization bn proposed by ioffe and szegedy 2015 and the numbers below the hl refer to the size of the hl unlike the original ddpg implementation from lillicrap et al 2016 that uses the bn in both the actor and critic the bn is used in the critic only for the proposed adaptive fine tuning system the choice of application of the bn to the actor and critic was made based on the station keeping performance assessment in simulations given the study by bhatt et al 2019 it is natural that application of the bn does not always increase the rl learning performance but the performance may increase or decrease depending on application domains the reward function that is needed to train the actor and critic is defined as eq 29 it should be noted that the station keeping in the yaw direction is implicitly designed since the good station keeping of the surge and sway motions requires the good station keeping of the yaw motion to further stabilize the rl learning r t is clipped to 0 2 and r t is normalized as eq 30 where r denotes all the rewards stored in the replay buffer for the action noise a gaussian action noise with the std of 0 1 is used finally the other hyper parameters for the ddpg are set the same as in the original ddpg implementation lillicrap et al 2016 29 r t e t x 2 e t y 2 30 r t r t mean r std r 5 simulation results in the simulations the equation of ship motion is solved by using a marine dynamic simulation software orcaflex developed by orcina as to the sea states because the station keeping performance by the gain change does not vary much in calm or moderate sea states due to small drifting motions the simulations were conducted in very rough high and very high sea states according to table 3 nguyen et al 2007 for the station keeping its reference positions surge x ʹ sway y ʹ yaw ψ are set to 0 0 0 5 1 effectiveness of the proposed adaptive fine tuning system in the simulations in this subsection the sea state is set to very rough the details of the environmental condition of the sea state are shown in table 4 where t z v w and v c denote a zero crossing period mean current speed and mean wind speed respectively the specific values for the environmental condition are determined by a imca standard imca 2000 first the effects of the use of the adaptive p d gains are presented with ship motion and the gain time histories in fig 12 where a pid controller with the base gain fixed and a pid controller with the proposed adaptive fine tuning system are compared for the adaptive fine tuning system in fig 12 one adaptive fine tuning system is not allowed to tune the pd gains but the i gain only and the other is allowed to tune all the pid gains for the gain histories since a significant difference lies in the sway motion in fig 12 the gain histories regarding the sway direction are presented only and the gain histories are normalized by division by k base for the training of the adaptive fine tuning systems they are trained for 12 h timesteps in the simulation in fig 12 the fixed base gain represents the pid controller with the fixed base gain the adaptive pd gain not used represents the pid controller with the adaptive fine tuning system that tunes the i gain only and the adaptive pd gain used represents the pid controller with the adaptive fine tuning system that tunes all the pid gains in fig 12 the distinct difference between adaptive pd gain not used and adaptive pd gain used is the convergence speed in case of the adaptive pd gain used it tends to approach the reference position faster than adaptive pd gain not used and it has smaller rebound motions especially in the sway direction as observed in fig 12 c d in case of the adaptive pd gain used when the ship is drifted the pd gains are increased to prevent the drifting motion and while the ship approaches the reference position the p gain is drastically decreased and the d gain is slightly decreased which makes the fast convergence possible because the drastic reduction of the p gain contributes to the prevention for the rebound motion while the d gain which is relatively lower than the base gain by ranging from 0 4 to 0 6 of the base gain allows the fast approach to the reference position second the effects of the adaptive i gain and the update gate for the integral of the errors g t are analyzed in fig 13 where k i t represents the adaptive i gain in fig 13 the ship motion time histories are presented on the left side and the time histories of the adaptive gains and g t are presented on the right side same as in fig 12 the gain histories are normalized by division by k base and the training of the adaptive fine tuning systems is conducted for 12 h timesteps in the simulation in fig 13 a it is clearly seen that the rebound motion is reduced when k i t and g t are used in fig 13 c and g the pattern of k i y ʹ can be observed in which k i y ʹ are tuned to around 0 5 while the ship experiences the rebound motion this is a reasonable control for k i y because the drifting side is in the positive direction in the sway motion then its integral of the error is negative thus the small k i y ʹ helps the ship to reach the reference position faster while the ship is in the rebound side negative by reducing the negative thrust contributed by the integral of the error fig 13 e shows that the adaptive fine tuning system does not learn the adaptive gain tuning strategy well when k i t is not used and g t are used 5 2 overall performance assessment the overall performance of the adaptive fine tuning system is presented with respect to the station keeping performance and the control efficiency the higher control efficiency means the lower thrust consumption and a lower rate of the thrust change the sea states considered here are very rough high and very high the details of the environmental conditions are shown in table 5 for the environmental directions the maximum environmental directions in each sea state are determined based on a watch circle with its radius of 10m weingarth 2006 the performance assessment is conducted with respect to each environmental condition considering the sea states and environmental directions to examine the proposed system s learning capability on each environmental condition then a total number of the environmental conditions for the performance assessment is 13 5 4 4 for the training of the adaptive fine tuning system the training is conducted for 12 h timesteps in each environmental condition individually the overall performance assessment of the adaptive fine tuning system compared to the pid controller with the fixed base gain is presented in fig 14 the station keeping performance assessment is presented with the line graphs with the iae performance index the iae stands for the integral absolute error and it is a traditional performance index jon and breivik 2009 the control efficiency assessment is presented with violin graphs to present the distributions of the thrust and a rate of thrust change in fig 14 the fixed base gain and adaptive gain refer to the pid controller with the fixed base gain and the pid controller with the adaptive fine tuning system respectively iae x ʹ y ʹ is equal to iae x ʹ 2 y ʹ 2 t and d t d t denote a mean absolute value of t from eq 11 and a time derivative of t respectively the performances indices iae x ʹ y ʹ iae ψ t and d t d t indicate the station keeping performance in the surge and sway directions the station keeping performance in the yaw direction the dp thrust consumption and a rate of the thrust change respectively the results in fig 14 are obtained from five 1h simulations with different seeds finally in the line graphs for the iae the dots denote the mean values and shaded area denotes a 95 confidence interval there are two distinct characteristics in the results in fig 14 first when the environmental direction is below around 15 there is almost no performance difference between the fixed base gain and adaptive gain this is because when the environmental direction to the ship is small the ship experiences the relatively small wave drift loads than when the environmental direction to the ship is large and the small wave drift loads result in the small drifting motions the small drifting motions are equal to the small error therefore no matter how the gains are tuned by the adaptive fine tuning system the output dp thrust does not change much which corresponds to the no performance change for the intuitive understanding of the wave drift load with respect to the environmental directions the wave drift loads with respect to the environmental directions in the ship s equilibrium position in the high sea state are presented in fig 15 where f x ʹ f y ʹ and m ψ denote the load in the surge direction the load in the sway direction and the load in the yaw direction respectively second when the environmental direction is over around 15 the difference in the station keeping performance becomes apparent overall when the environmental direction is over around 15 deg the adaptive fine tuning system results in the better station keeping performance in the surge and sway directions and the equal station keeping performance in the yaw direction with the similar thrust consumption distribution and the similar rate of the thrust change since the goal of the proposed system is to learn the efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy to increase the station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency the proposed system achieves its goal source code for implementation of the proposed system is available in github 1 6 discussion the proposed adaptive fine tuning system achieves its goal of learning the efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy to increase the station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency however while the station keeping performance increases in the surge and sway directions the performance in the yaw direction remains almost the same we originally thought that it is because the reward function does not have explicit information on the station keeping for the yaw motion therefore we tried adding a penalty term for the yaw motion error in the existing reward function however it only made the yaw motion somewhat aggressively oscillating which made the station keeping in the surge and sway directions unstable as well to solve that issue we needed to add time derivates of the surge sway and yaw motion errors and additional efforts for the weight tuning for each term at that point the reward function became too complicated therefore we kept the reward function as simple as possible as presented in this paper the proposed adaptive fine tuning system allows the ship to converge to the reference position quickly after drifted however the magnitudes of the peaky drifting motions remain the same these peaky drifting motions are caused when the wave drift load is suddenly strong as shown in fig 9 to reduce the magnitude of the peak drifting motions we tried adopting a machine learning based anomaly detection algorithm to detect the moment when the peaky drifting motion is about to happen and when detected the base gain multiplied by a multiplying factor of 10 was set to be used to reduce the magnitude of the peaky drifting motion as a part of the adaptive fine tuning system although the anomaly detection algorithm worked well for the detection when the wave drift loads were suddenly strong this approach did not help much we suppose that utilization of a feed forward system would be much more effective to reduce the magnitude of the peaky drifting motion the proposed adaptive fine tuning system utilizes a pid controller and thrust allocation algorithm to yield the dp thrusts from the six azimuth thrusters which is designed to cope with the varying environmental loads more efficiently than using the fixed gains then one might have this question what if the deep reinforcement learning algorithm learns to control the dp thrusts directly so that the ship can cope with the varying environmental loads efficiently as an end to end learning system we had this exact idea and experimented it in simulations however the end to end learning did not perform well here are the reasons why we suppose did not go well 1 in the end to end learning a number of actor s output increases in proportion to a number of thrusters in other words one thruster needs to be controlled by a magnitude of thrust and thruster angle therefore six thrusters require 12 actions but if we impose the pid structure a number of the output is fixed to nine three gains for the surge motion three gains for the sway motion and three gains for the yaw motion this gives the end to end learning a higher dimension in the action space 2 when a pid structure is used with a thrust allocation algorithm the thrust allocation algorithm can take care of the change rates of thrust and angle of each thruster however in case of the end to end learning the deep reinforcement learning algorithm needs to learn not to drastically change the thrust and an angle of each thruster or the change rate limit can be imposed on the action of the actor but this would discourage the exploration process 3 when a pid structure is used with a thrust allocation algorithm the allocation algorithm can ensure that a target total thrust is well distributed over the available thrusters not to give one thruster a lot of load and let other thrusters to be idle however in case of the end to end learning the deep reinforcement learning algorithm needs to learn the thrust allocation from scratch which adds the complexity in learning 4 with a pid structure the directionality in the control system for the thrust is simpler as shown in fig 16 and eqs 31 and 32 where the red star denotes a reference position and pid represents a pid controller it should be noted that only p gain is considered in the sway direction for the example s simplicity in fig 16 in case of the pid controller the same thrust with its proper direction can be output with the same gain as shown in eq 31 but in case of the end to end learning the deep reinforcement learning algorithm needs to learn the directionality of the thrust which adds the additional complexity in learning as shown in eq 32 finally this study shows that the adaptive fine tuning system can learn the effective adaptive gain tuning strategy in each environmental condition therefore it is important that the proposed system should be further developed to perform well in various environmental conditions we suggest the following two feasible approaches 1 training the proposed system on all the environmental conditions at once 2 utilizing a switching control system the first approach might be possible but since there can be a lot of environmental conditions depending on a sea site the training might be difficult the second approach was proposed by nguyen et al 2007 in the scheme with the second approach multiple adaptive fine tuning systems with respect to the sea states are trained first then they are integrated by using the switching control system which determines which adaptive fine tuning system to use in a current state since the learning complexity can be distributed over several adaptive fine tuning systems with the second approach the second approach seems more feasible than the first one 7 conclusion in this paper an adaptive pid controller for the dps is developed with the proposed adaptive fine tuning system for the pid gains the main goal of the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is to learn an efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy to increase the station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency to achieve the goal one of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg was adopted the main characteristics of the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is as follows first a target of the application is a 285m fpso ship and the environment is the open sea where the sea state can become severe ships respond much more slowly to control changes than the previously studied small robots and the environmental loads a ship undergoes when the sea state is severe are far greater than wind disturbance that small robots experience second the input is previous ship motions and the output is the adaptive pid gains and the update gate for the integral of the errors for the input previous ship motions are used instead of a ship motion at a current timestep to help the neural networks understand the ship dynamics better by considering the memory effect the adaptive pid gains allow the pid controller to cope with the varying environmental loads better and the update gate for the integral of the errors allows to prevent the unconditional accumulation for the integral of the errors which leads to the smaller rebound ship motions third the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is likely to learn an adaptive gain tuning strategy that simply increases the gains to increase the station keeping performance if there is no restriction in the available adaptive gain range however this strategy is inefficient because it comes with the cost of higher thrust consumption and aggressive thrust control to encourage the proposed system to learn the adaptive gain tuning strategy that results in the better station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency its available adaptive gain range is set to 0 k base where k base refers to the base gain pre tuned by a pid gain tuning method in the simulation results it was shown that the proposed adaptive fine tuning system could learn the efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy which results in the better station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency in the

21505,a conventional pid controller for the dps has limitations due to fixed gains and dependence on manual adjustment for its gains therefore several previous studies developed a fuzzy based adaptive pid controller for the dps which tunes the gains based on the fuzzy logic however the fuzzy logic has its disadvantages due to a manual definition of fuzzy rules and fuzzy variables to overcome those limitations a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to learn the efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy without human intuition behind since it does not require any prior knowledge about the dynamics of a ship or dps finally it is shown that the proposed system can result in better station keeping performance without deterioration in its control efficiency keywords dynamic positioning system dps proportional integral derivative pid fine tuning deep reinforcement learning drl deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg 1 introduction dynamic positioning of a vessel refers to a process of automatically controlling a vessel s thrusters to maintain the vessel at a fixed position and heading conventionally dynamic positioning system dps uses a proportional integral derivative pid controller harbonn 1971 jeon et al 2017 nguyen et al 2007 van t veer and gachet 2011 however there are two main limitations in a conventional pid controller first a pid controller has p i and d gains in its structure and they need to be adjusted as parameters those gains are usually tuned manually by trial and error however such manual gain tuning may not result in optimal values for the gains since the gain tuning is based on trial and error and human intuition to automate the pid gain tuning process many studies have been conducted the most common and easiest pid tuning method is a ziegler nichols zn method ziegler and nichols 1942 and this zn method was adopted in many previous studies for the dps jeon et al 2017 koschorrek et al 2015 van t veer and gachet 2011 aside from the zn method other pid gain tuning methods such as davison method davison 1976 penttinen method penttinen and koivo 1980 and maciejowski method maciejowski 1989 were analyzed for the pid gain tuning for the dps in martin and katebi 2005 however no matter how the pid gains are tuned with the tuning methods introduced above the tuned gains remain fixed it is well known that performance of a conventional pid controller is somewhat limited when there is a time varying load teoh and yee 1991 which is the second main limitation of a conventional pid controller in case of the dps since it needs to maintain a vessel s position at the open sea it faces environmental loads such as wind wave and current loads which vary over time thus a pid controller with the fixed gains cannot yield efficient station keeping performance for the dps to cope with the time varying loads an adaptive pid controller was introduced teoh and yee 1991 the main advantage of an adaptive pid controller is that it adaptively tunes the gains to cope with the varying loads for the dps many adaptive pid controllers were developed based on fuzzy logic jeon et al 2017 xu et al 2019 yamamoto and morooka 2005 in the previous studies of the fuzzy based adaptive pid controller for the dps the controller adaptively tuned the gains considering a position and velocity of a ship at every timestep and it achieved better station keeping performance but since this fuzzy based adaptive pid controller used fuzzy logic it had intrinsic limitations of manual definition of fuzzy rules and fuzzy variables of the system both of which require human expertise in the application domain and can result in different performance by different individuals also the fuzzy based adaptive pid controller s fuzzy rule was designed to increase the p and d gains when a ship starts to drift or is far away from a target position this gain tuning strategy certainly increases the station keeping performance but it comes with the cost of aggressive thrust control xu et al 2019 which is undesirable in terms of control efficiency jon and breivik 2009 in this paper a concept of an adaptive pid controller is used and its gains are tuned by an adaptive fine tuning system proposed in this study instead of the fuzzy logic the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is based on the following two notions 1 it should not be dependent of human intuition based adaptive gain tuning strategy 2 it should be able to achieve the better station keeping performance without further dp thrust consumption or a higher rate of the thrust change which represent the control efficiency to achieve the first notion one of the deep reinforcement learning drl algorithms deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg lillicrap et al 2016 is utilized since it does not require any prior knowledge about the dynamics of a ship or dps to learn an efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy by interacting with a given environment to achieve the second notion the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is restricted for its available gain range to 0 k base where k base represents a base gain the base gain is a pre tuned gain by pid gain tuning methods such as manual tuning method zn method or any pid gain tuning method because the available gain range is restricted the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is restricted in simply overusing the dp thrust to increase the station keeping performance with the two notions the adaptive fine tuning system is forced to learn how to efficiently tune the adaptive gains to increase the station keeping performance while its choice for the gain is restricted not to overuse the thrust the term fine tuning in the proposed system comes from the fine tuning for a convolutional neural network in deep learning guo et al 2019 as to the application of the drl to an adaptive pid controller there have been many studies conducted for robots carlucho et al 2020 2019 gloye et al 2005 in carlucho et al 2020 2019 and gloye et al 2005 the robots with the drl successfully learned to achieve a fast reference tracking with the fast convergence by adaptively tuning the gains the main differences between those previous works and the work in this paper are the application and the environment in this work unlike carlucho et al 2020 2019 and gloye et al 2005 a 285m fpso floating production storage and offloading ship is used as a target of the application which has a much slower response to a control signal than a small robot and the environmental load is far greater which causes a high magnitude of drifting motions van t veer and gachet 2011 for the proposed adaptive fine tuning system the main goal is the same as the fast convergence to the tracking reference but instead of converging to a varying reference quickly it needs to converge to a constant reference position quickly after the ship is drifted by the environmental load in the following sections a reinforcement learning theory a target ship and the dps and the proposed adaptive fine tuning system are presented then simulation results and discussion are followed 2 reinforcement learning theory in standard reinforcement learning rl sutton and barto 2018 there is an agent and an environment that that the agent interacts with in discrete time steps at every timestep the agent receives a state s t and takes action a t and obtains a reward r t forming a sequential transition s t a t r t s t 1 a t 1 r t 1 throughout an episode the action a t is determined by a policy π which maps the state s t to probabilistic values of each action p a t because the policy usually takes the action with an action noise which is used to ensure exploration in the state and action space the learning process of the agent can be defined mathematically using a markov decision process mdp a generic flowchart of the process is shown in fig 1 in the figure as the agent continues to interact with the environment the policy π can learn a better and better policy by maximizing the reward that the agent receives in many rl algorithms an action value function the so called q function is used in the learning process the q function describes the expected return value g t which is expressed as eq 1 1 g t i t t γ i t r s i a i γ 0 1 where γ is a discounting factor to consider influence of uncertainties towards the future after taking action a t in a state s t and thereafter following policy π the q function can be written in a recursive form by using the bellman equation bellman 1954 2 q π s t a t e r t s t 1 e r s t a t γ e a t 1 π q π s t 1 a t 1 3 r t r s t a t if a deterministic policy μ that maps a state s t to deterministic values of each action a t is used eq 2 can be rewritten as eq 4 4 q μ s t a t e r t s t 1 e r s t a t γ q μ s t 1 μ s t 1 where q μ can be learned by an off policy learning algorithm called q learning proposed by watkins and dayan 1992 with transitions of s t a t r t s t 1 a t 1 r t 1 generated from a potentially different stochastic behavior policy β and the q learning can use a greedy policy μ s a r g m a x a q s a as a deterministic policy the goal of the q learning is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected q function however q learning is likely to have difficulties in learning if the state action space or a reward function is complex therefore it is common to use a neural network as a function approximator for the q function this approximator is parameterized by θ q which can be optimized by minimizing the following loss function l θ q 5 l θ q e s t ρ β a t β r t e q s t a t θ q y t 2 6 y t r s t a t γ q s t 1 μ s t 1 θ q where ρ β denotes a state visitation distribution by β however applying the q learning to continuous action spaces is not possible because finding the greedy policy requires optimization of a t at every timestep instead the policy can be updated in the direction of the gradient of q by using the dpg algorithm silver et al 2014 with an actor critic approach where the action is approximated by a neural network called actor and q is approximated by another neural network called critic in the actor critic the actor and critic are parameterized by θ μ and θ q respectively and a policy is represented by the actor the actor is learned through the application of eq 7 where j is maximized and the critic is learned by the bellman equation as in the q learning 7 θ μ j e s t ρ β θ μ q s a θ q s s t a μ s t θ μ yet this actor critic approach has difficulties in convergence and the learning is unstable if the observation space is very high dimensional to solve this problem lillicrap et al 2016 proposed the ddpg which is basically a combination of the dpg based actor critic and the deep q network dqn proposed by mnih et al 2013 the two main features from the dqn for the ddpg are a replay buffer and target networks the replay buffer is a storage for transitions of s t a t r t s t 1 and the target networks are duplicated actor and critic whose weights are gradually updated by fractional weights of the actor and critic it was shown that the application of the replay buffer and target networks could stabilize and improve the learning process significantly 3 target ship and dps 3 1 properties of target ship and dps the target ship and dps introduced here are the ship and dps used for the simulations in the result section properties of the target ship and dps are presented in detail principal dimension of the target ship and its coordinate system are shown in table 1 and fig 2 respectively in fig 2 n and b are the origins of global and local coordinate systems respectively ψ is a heading angle of the ship in degrees the global and local positions of the ship are in meters and denoted as x y and x ʹ y ʹ respectively the target ship is equipped with six azimuth thrusters their arrangement and details are shown in fig 3 and table 2 respectively 3 2 pid control in dps a control law of a single pid controller is shown in eq 8 where u t is the low level controller output at time t e t is an error which is defined as a reference position subtracted by a current position k p k i and k d are the proportional integral and derivative gains of the pid controller respectively 8 u t k p e t k i 0 t e t d t k d d e t d t in case of the pid controller in the dps since there are three directional motions surge sway and yaw that need to be maintained by the dps three pid controllers are used in the dp s pid control system the structure of the pid control system in the dps is shown in fig 4 in this figure x ref is a vector of reference ship positions in the surge sway and yaw directions e t is a vector of the errors in the surge sway and yaw directions at time t t t is a required thrust in each direction where the direction is denoted in the superscript parenthesis and each t t denotes the same as u t t t is a vector of the allocated thrusts for each thruster and x t 1 is a vector of current ship positions in the surge sway and yaw directions at time t 1 the details of x ref e t t t and x t 1 are shown in eqs 9 12 in t t the number next to t represents a thrust number for x t 1 it should be noted that the ship positions are the positions filtered by a kalman filter which is used to remove the ship motion components induced by the 1st order wave load fossen and perez 2009 in fig 4 the flow of the control system is as follows first e t is calculated based on x ref and x t and it is fed into each of the three pid controllers according to their directions then each pid controller outputs t t and it is fed into the thrust allocation algorithm to output t t for the thrust allocation algorithm for the dp thrust a lagrange multiplier method is used de wit 2009 3 3 hydrodynamics associated with a drifting motion of a ship this section is present to provide an understanding of the environmental loads that contribute to the ship s drifting motion and how the dp thrust counteract the environmental loads the mathematical model of the ship motion can be expressed as eq 13 fossen and perez 2009 13 m p a c p v k p f p v t where m p a is the system inertia load c p v is the system damping load k p is the system stiffness load f p v t is the external load p v and a are the position velocity and acceleration respectively and t is time for the dps the external load f p v t is equal to eq 14 14 f p v t τ wind τ current τ wave τ thrusters where τ represents external loads and subscripts represent sources of the external loads there are three types of environmental loads contributing to the drifting motion of a ship such as wind current and wave drift loads the environmental loads contributing to the drifting motion are presented in fig 5 the wave load is divided into the 1st order and 2nd order wave loads the difference between these two loads is shown by ship motions affected by these two loads in fig 6 hassani and pascoal 2015 for the dps to compensate for the drifting motion caused by the wind current and wave drift loads the dp thrusters need to counteract the environmental loads this relation can be expressed as eq 15 in which the dps basically maintains a ship s position by trying to satisfy this equation 15 τ wind τ current τ wave drift τ thrusters 0 the wind and current loads can be expressed as eqs 16 19 fossen and perez 2009 and the wave drift load can be expressed as eq 20 orcina 2019 16 τ wind 1 2 ρ air v r 2 c surge a surge c sway a sway c yaw a yaw 17 a yaw l b p a s w a y 18 τ current 1 2 ρ water v r 2 c surge a

frequency and phase lag of the regular wave component eq 20 shows that qtf wave drift is applied to each pair of the regular wave components to yield each pair s contribution to the wave drift load 4 proposed adaptive fine tuning system for pid gains in dps an overall structure of the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is shown in fig 7 for intuitive understanding fig 7 is drawn on the top of fig 4 in this figure the state s t is an input vector for the actor and critic k t is a vector of the adaptive pid gains and g t is an update gate for the integral of the errors a configuration of s t is shown in eq 21 the previous motion time histories are used in s t to consider a memory effect in which a fluid load is determined in part by previous motions at any instant yeung 1983 the integrals of the errors are also included in s t since they are influential terms for the mean station keeping position and also needed to provide enough information to output the update gate for the integral of the errors g t during the training of the actor and critic a normalized s t is used to ensure the training stability lee et al 2020 for the normalization of s t the error terms in s t are normalized by eq 22 where s is all the states stored in the replay buffer and the std stands for standard deviation and the integral of the error terms in s t are normalized by dividing them by 100 to make them small enough for the stable neural network training the integral of the error terms are differently normalized because these terms usually increase and gradually decrease over time unlike the error terms which go around their mean values with certain standard deviations since the ship position goes around its reference position by the dps 21 s t e t 9 x ʹ e t 8 x ʹ e t x ʹ e t 9 y ʹ e

gains for the surge sway and yaw directions the details of k t is shown in eq 23 where each k t consist of the adaptive p i and d gains in each direction as shown in eq 24 k base is a vector of the base gains determined based on the zn method and a t is the output vector from the actor s output layer in this paper the actor uses a sigmoid activation function in its output layer the sigmoid activation function is shown in eq 25 therefore ranges of each component in a t and k t are 0 1 and 0 k base respectively with k t the pid controller with the adaptive gains is expressed as eq 26 where the direction is denoted in the superscript parenthesis 23 k t k t x ʹ k t y ʹ k t ψ a t k base 24 k t k p t k i t k d t 25 φ z 1 1 e z 26 t t k p t e t k i t 0 t e t d t k d t d e t d t the update gate for integral of the errors g t determines how much error to update for the integral of the errors which is in the integral terms in the pid controllers the update equation of the integral of errors by g t is shown in eq 27 where g t 0 1 the concept of g t was inspired by gated recurrent units gru chung et al 2014 27 0 t e t d t 0 t 1 e t d t g t e t 28 g t g t x ʹ g t y ʹ g t ψ g t is designed to prevent a large rebound motion of a ship when a sea state is severe a ship experiences large drifting motions on a drifting side mostly due to aggressive wave drift loads an illustration of the drifting side and an example of the wave drift load time history are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively while a ship is drifted greatly due to the very large wave drift load the integral of the error increases drastically as well due to the drastically increased integral of the error over many drifting motions the large rebound ship motions are caused the large rebound ship motions caused by the increased integral of the error are illustrated in fig 10 as to the adaptive gains from the actor the i gain is fixed when a ship is on the drifting side while the p and d gains are adaptively selected by the actor the i gain is fixed on the drifting side to ensure the convergence of the station keeping on the other side of the drifting side the i gain is adaptively selected the drifting side can easily be identified by the integral of the error architectures of the actor and critic are shown in fig 11 where the hl stands for a hidden layer the bn stands for batch normalization bn proposed by ioffe and szegedy 2015 and the numbers below the hl refer to the size of the hl unlike the original ddpg implementation from lillicrap et al 2016 that uses the bn in both the actor and critic the bn is used in the critic only for the proposed adaptive fine tuning system the choice of application of the bn to the actor and critic was made based on the station keeping performance assessment in simulations given the study by bhatt et al 2019 it is natural that application of the bn does not always increase the rl learning performance but the performance may increase or decrease depending on application domains the reward function that is needed to train the actor and critic is defined as eq 29 it should be noted that the station keeping in the yaw direction is implicitly designed since the good station keeping of the surge and sway motions requires the good station keeping of the yaw motion to further stabilize the rl learning r t is clipped to 0 2 and r t is normalized as eq 30 where r denotes all the rewards stored in the replay buffer for the action noise a gaussian action noise with the std of 0 1 is used finally the other hyper parameters for the ddpg are set the same as in the original ddpg implementation lillicrap et al 2016 29 r t e t x 2 e t y 2 30 r t r t mean r std r 5 simulation results in the simulations the equation of ship motion is solved by using a marine dynamic simulation software orcaflex developed by orcina as to the sea states because the station keeping performance by the gain change does not vary much in calm or moderate sea states due to small drifting motions the simulations were conducted in very rough high and very high sea states according to table 3 nguyen et al 2007 for the station keeping its reference positions surge x ʹ sway y ʹ yaw ψ are set to 0 0 0 5 1 effectiveness of the proposed adaptive fine tuning system in the simulations in this subsection the sea state is set to very rough the details of the environmental condition of the sea state are shown in table 4 where t z v w and v c denote a zero crossing period mean current speed and mean wind speed respectively the specific values for the environmental condition are determined by a imca standard imca 2000 first the effects of the use of the adaptive p d gains are presented with ship motion and the gain time histories in fig 12 where a pid controller with the base gain fixed and a pid controller with the proposed adaptive fine tuning system are compared for the adaptive fine tuning system in fig 12 one adaptive fine tuning system is not allowed to tune the pd gains but the i gain only and the other is allowed to tune all the pid gains for the gain histories since a significant difference lies in the sway motion in fig 12 the gain histories regarding the sway direction are presented only and the gain histories are normalized by division by k base for the training of the adaptive fine tuning systems they are trained for 12 h timesteps in the simulation in fig 12 the fixed base gain represents the pid controller with the fixed base gain the adaptive pd gain not used represents the pid controller with the adaptive fine tuning system that tunes the i gain only and the adaptive pd gain used represents the pid controller with the adaptive fine tuning system that tunes all the pid gains in fig 12 the distinct difference between adaptive pd gain not used and adaptive pd gain used is the convergence speed in case of the adaptive pd gain used it tends to approach the reference position faster than adaptive pd gain not used and it has smaller rebound motions especially in the sway direction as observed in fig 12 c d in case of the adaptive pd gain used when the ship is drifted the pd gains are increased to prevent the drifting motion and while the ship approaches the reference position the p gain is drastically decreased and the d gain is slightly decreased which makes the fast convergence possible because the drastic reduction of the p gain contributes to the prevention for the rebound motion while the d gain which is relatively lower than the base gain by ranging from 0 4 to 0 6 of the base gain allows the fast approach to the reference position second the effects of the adaptive i gain and the update gate for the integral of the errors g t are analyzed in fig 13 where k i t represents the adaptive i gain in fig 13 the ship motion time histories are presented on the left side and the time histories of the adaptive gains and g t are presented on the right side same as in fig 12 the gain histories are normalized by division by k base and the training of the adaptive fine tuning systems is conducted for 12 h timesteps in the simulation in fig 13 a it is clearly seen that the rebound motion is reduced when k i t and g t are used in fig 13 c and g the pattern of k i y ʹ can be observed in which k i y ʹ are tuned to around 0 5 while the ship experiences the rebound motion this is a reasonable control for k i y because the drifting side is in the positive direction in the sway motion then its integral of the error is negative thus the small k i y ʹ helps the ship to reach the reference position faster while the ship is in the rebound side negative by reducing the negative thrust contributed by the integral of the error fig 13 e shows that the adaptive fine tuning system does not learn the adaptive gain tuning strategy well when k i t is not used and g t are used 5 2 overall performance assessment the overall performance of the adaptive fine tuning system is presented with respect to the station keeping performance and the control efficiency the higher control efficiency means the lower thrust consumption and a lower rate of the thrust change the sea states considered here are very rough high and very high the details of the environmental conditions are shown in table 5 for the environmental directions the maximum environmental directions in each sea state are determined based on a watch circle with its radius of 10m weingarth 2006 the performance assessment is conducted with respect to each environmental condition considering the sea states and environmental directions to examine the proposed system s learning capability on each environmental condition then a total number of the environmental conditions for the performance assessment is 13 5 4 4 for the training of the adaptive fine tuning system the training is conducted for 12 h timesteps in each environmental condition individually the overall performance assessment of the adaptive fine tuning system compared to the pid controller with the fixed base gain is presented in fig 14 the station keeping performance assessment is presented with the line graphs with the iae performance index the iae stands for the integral absolute error and it is a traditional performance index jon and breivik 2009 the control efficiency assessment is presented with violin graphs to present the distributions of the thrust and a rate of thrust change in fig 14 the fixed base gain and adaptive gain refer to the pid controller with the fixed base gain and the pid controller with the adaptive fine tuning system respectively iae x ʹ y ʹ is equal to iae x ʹ 2 y ʹ 2 t and d t d t denote a mean absolute value of t from eq 11 and a time derivative of t respectively the performances indices iae x ʹ y ʹ iae ψ t and d t d t indicate the station keeping performance in the surge and sway directions the station keeping performance in the yaw direction the dp thrust consumption and a rate of the thrust change respectively the results in fig 14 are obtained from five 1h simulations with different seeds finally in the line graphs for the iae the dots denote the mean values and shaded area denotes a 95 confidence interval there are two distinct characteristics in the results in fig 14 first when the environmental direction is below around 15 there is almost no performance difference between the fixed base gain and adaptive gain this is because when the environmental direction to the ship is small the ship experiences the relatively small wave drift loads than when the environmental direction to the ship is large and the small wave drift loads result in the small drifting motions the small drifting motions are equal to the small error therefore no matter how the gains are tuned by the adaptive fine tuning system the output dp thrust does not change much which corresponds to the no performance change for the intuitive understanding of the wave drift load with respect to the environmental directions the wave drift loads with respect to the environmental directions in the ship s equilibrium position in the high sea state are presented in fig 15 where f x ʹ f y ʹ and m ψ denote the load in the surge direction the load in the sway direction and the load in the yaw direction respectively second when the environmental direction is over around 15 the difference in the station keeping performance becomes apparent overall when the environmental direction is over around 15 deg the adaptive fine tuning system results in the better station keeping performance in the surge and sway directions and the equal station keeping performance in the yaw direction with the similar thrust consumption distribution and the similar rate of the thrust change since the goal of the proposed system is to learn the efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy to increase the station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency the proposed system achieves its goal source code for implementation of the proposed system is available in github 1 6 discussion the proposed adaptive fine tuning system achieves its goal of learning the efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy to increase the station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency however while the station keeping performance increases in the surge and sway directions the performance in the yaw direction remains almost the same we originally thought that it is because the reward function does not have explicit information on the station keeping for the yaw motion therefore we tried adding a penalty term for the yaw motion error in the existing reward function however it only made the yaw motion somewhat aggressively oscillating which made the station keeping in the surge and sway directions unstable as well to solve that issue we needed to add time derivates of the surge sway and yaw motion errors and additional efforts for the weight tuning for each term at that point the reward function became too complicated therefore we kept the reward function as simple as possible as presented in this paper the proposed adaptive fine tuning system allows the ship to converge to the reference position quickly after drifted however the magnitudes of the peaky drifting motions remain the same these peaky drifting motions are caused when the wave drift load is suddenly strong as shown in fig 9 to reduce the magnitude of the peak drifting motions we tried adopting a machine learning based anomaly detection algorithm to detect the moment when the peaky drifting motion is about to happen and when detected the base gain multiplied by a multiplying factor of 10 was set to be used to reduce the magnitude of the peaky drifting motion as a part of the adaptive fine tuning system although the anomaly detection algorithm worked well for the detection when the wave drift loads were suddenly strong this approach did not help much we suppose that utilization of a feed forward system would be much more effective to reduce the magnitude of the peaky drifting motion the proposed adaptive fine tuning system utilizes a pid controller and thrust allocation algorithm to yield the dp thrusts from the six azimuth thrusters which is designed to cope with the varying environmental loads more efficiently than using the fixed gains then one might have this question what if the deep reinforcement learning algorithm learns to control the dp thrusts directly so that the ship can cope with the varying environmental loads efficiently as an end to end learning system we had this exact idea and experimented it in simulations however the end to end learning did not perform well here are the reasons why we suppose did not go well 1 in the end to end learning a number of actor s output increases in proportion to a number of thrusters in other words one thruster needs to be controlled by a magnitude of thrust and thruster angle therefore six thrusters require 12 actions but if we impose the pid structure a number of the output is fixed to nine three gains for the surge motion three gains for the sway motion and three gains for the yaw motion this gives the end to end learning a higher dimension in the action space 2 when a pid structure is used with a thrust allocation algorithm the thrust allocation algorithm can take care of the change rates of thrust and angle of each thruster however in case of the end to end learning the deep reinforcement learning algorithm needs to learn not to drastically change the thrust and an angle of each thruster or the change rate limit can be imposed on the action of the actor but this would discourage the exploration process 3 when a pid structure is used with a thrust allocation algorithm the allocation algorithm can ensure that a target total thrust is well distributed over the available thrusters not to give one thruster a lot of load and let other thrusters to be idle however in case of the end to end learning the deep reinforcement learning algorithm needs to learn the thrust allocation from scratch which adds the complexity in learning 4 with a pid structure the directionality in the control system for the thrust is simpler as shown in fig 16 and eqs 31 and 32 where the red star denotes a reference position and pid represents a pid controller it should be noted that only p gain is considered in the sway direction for the example s simplicity in fig 16 in case of the pid controller the same thrust with its proper direction can be output with the same gain as shown in eq 31 but in case of the end to end learning the deep reinforcement learning algorithm needs to learn the directionality of the thrust which adds the additional complexity in learning as shown in eq 32 finally this study shows that the adaptive fine tuning system can learn the effective adaptive gain tuning strategy in each environmental condition therefore it is important that the proposed system should be further developed to perform well in various environmental conditions we suggest the following two feasible approaches 1 training the proposed system on all the environmental conditions at once 2 utilizing a switching control system the first approach might be possible but since there can be a lot of environmental conditions depending on a sea site the training might be difficult the second approach was proposed by nguyen et al 2007 in the scheme with the second approach multiple adaptive fine tuning systems with respect to the sea states are trained first then they are integrated by using the switching control system which determines which adaptive fine tuning system to use in a current state since the learning complexity can be distributed over several adaptive fine tuning systems with the second approach the second approach seems more feasible than the first one 7 conclusion in this paper an adaptive pid controller for the dps is developed with the proposed adaptive fine tuning system for the pid gains the main goal of the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is to learn an efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy to increase the station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency to achieve the goal one of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg was adopted the main characteristics of the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is as follows first a target of the application is a 285m fpso ship and the environment is the open sea where the sea state can become severe ships respond much more slowly to control changes than the previously studied small robots and the environmental loads a ship undergoes when the sea state is severe are far greater than wind disturbance that small robots experience second the input is previous ship motions and the output is the adaptive pid gains and the update gate for the integral of the errors for the input previous ship motions are used instead of a ship motion at a current timestep to help the neural networks understand the ship dynamics better by considering the memory effect the adaptive pid gains allow the pid controller to cope with the varying environmental loads better and the update gate for the integral of the errors allows to prevent the unconditional accumulation for the integral of the errors which leads to the smaller rebound ship motions third the proposed adaptive fine tuning system is likely to learn an adaptive gain tuning strategy that simply increases the gains to increase the station keeping performance if there is no restriction in the available adaptive gain range however this strategy is inefficient because it comes with the cost of higher thrust consumption and aggressive thrust control to encourage the proposed system to learn the adaptive gain tuning strategy that results in the better station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency its available adaptive gain range is set to 0 k base where k base refers to the base gain pre tuned by a pid gain tuning method in the simulation results it was shown that the proposed adaptive fine tuning system could learn the efficient adaptive gain tuning strategy which results in the better station keeping performance without deterioration in the control efficiency in the

21506,airfoil is the basic structure in the field of fluid machinery and is widely used in aerospace petrochemical and hydraulic machinery in this study three nonbionic airfoils sdown slevel and sup in the side direction of sturgeon and three bionic airfoils stop1 stop2 and stop3 in the top direction of sturgeon were established via the b spline curve fitting technique different schemes were simulated by applying large eddy simulation the simulation results are consistent with the experimental results the lift coefficient of an asymmetric bionic airfoil is significantly greater than that of a symmetric airfoil with sdown scheme having the largest lift coefficient the vortex region is related to velocity fluctuation and reynolds stress distribution when the vortex region is close to the tail edge it has a minimal effect on the mainstream the leading edge of the asymmetric bionic airfoil is prone to vortices and the vortex area is associated with the upwarping angle of the leading edge the leading edge of the symmetric bionic airfoil tends to form a stable vortex structure as the stable vortex area expands the lift coefficient increases correspondingly these findings can

known as wing section refers to the cross sectional shape of wing rotor propeller turbine and other structures it is widely used in aerospace petrochemical municipal engineering and underwater machinery in the early days the design of airfoil was primarily based on the wings of birds and was applied in aviation russian scientist zhukovsky established the relationship between the lift and circulation of aircraft wings which is known as the theoretical basis for wing design munk derived the theory of thin wings miklosovic et al 2004 through conformal transformation and obtained the expressions for zero lift angle of attack and moment with the development of research and the complexity of flight conditions the dynamic performance of traditional wings is no longer able to meet the requirements various airfoil databases have been established by aviation authorities worldwide among them the airfoil data series developed by the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca is the most extensively utilized it has been extended to other general fluid machinery fields e g fans and axial flow pumps li et al 2020 bionic design ranges from rough outer contour mapping to refined high precision 3d reverse engineering design mohaghegh et al 2007 the design of airfoil bone line has evolved from simple to complex multisegment curve fitting brakhage and lamby 2008 research methods have also gradually developed from basic theoretical calculation to the visualization analysis of hydrodynamics based on computational fluid dynamics sato et al 2017 li et al 2018 moreover experimental research approaches have been broadened from a single study of external characteristics to test research of internal fluid flow based on particle image velocimetry stolt et al 2019 however most of these series airfoils were built on an aerodynamic basis the flow state of a fluid can change due to the difference in physical properties such as the density and viscosity of air and water affecting the performance of hydraulic machinery especially in the chemical processes zhou et al 2020a b therefore the study of hydrodynamics based bionic airfoil design and its hydrodynamic properties is crucial for the development of airfoil applications in hydraulic machinery bionics is a comprehensive interdisciplinary subject that applies the laws and mechanisms found in biology to solve problems in engineering applications it mainly combines biological physiological functions or life processes with engineering practice and its related research is gradually becoming the focus of academic research for example inspired by the flight process of birds in nature researchers have obtained the wing shapes of owls wolf and konrath 2015 ren 2009 butterflies srygley and thomas 2002 moths hedrick and daniel 2006 bats muijres et al 2008 and flies fry et al 2005 during the fluttering process with the help of modern hydrodynamic techniques they described the kinematics and start up performance of wing spanwise variation and established several microaircrafts with superior performance many species of fish in the ocean have physical characteristics with excellent hydraulic performance fish et al fish and lauder 2006 fish and battle 1995 believed that the nodular structure at the anterior edge of the fins limbs of humpback whales can reduce swimming resistance research on underwater robot thrusters with turtle forelimbs as the subject has also received much attention xu et al 2010 and the results showed that this propulsion method has excellent performance with low noise and high efficiency font et al 2011 in the process of bionic airfoil design the selection of bionic objects and data acquisition are only the preliminary basic steps and the key step is the curve fitting based on known data typical airfoil parameterization methods mainly include the hicks henne shape function method with strong airfoil shape control capability hicks and henne 1978 the parsec parameterization method with excellent robustness vecchia et al 2014 the cst airfoil parameterization method with strong shape control and large design space description kulfan 2008 and the spline parameterization method with uniform or nonuniform rational b spline curve airfoil description masters et al 2017 these methods provide the theoretical basis for the parametric design of a bionic airfoil in this study computational fluid dynamics has developed rapidly and it has achieved remarkable results in the analysis of airfoil hydrodynamics especially in terms of airfoil turbulence and vortex evolution based on the large eddy simulation les model ji et al 2017 huang et al 2014 in this study sturgeons which are widely found in marine and fresh water were selected as the study subjects their body surface structure has good hydrodynamic properties the design of a bionic airfoil and its hydrodynamic characteristics were studied using a combination of theory and model tests the physical model construction method of the bionic airfoil was mainly introduced and the lift drag characteristics and fluid flow law of the airfoil under different conditions were analyzed this study revealed the evolutionary process of vortex shedding and the flow law around airfoils a bionic airfoil with superior performance was obtained which might lay the airfoil foundation for the blade design of hydraulic machinery 2 bionic airfoil design and experimental construction 2 1 bionic airfoil design 2 1 1 3d reverse engineering although sturgeons vary in size their shape curve is virtually identical thus the requirement of geometric similarity is met as shown in fig 1 a three sturgeons of different sizes were selected for this study and they were reverse engineered to reduce errors the reverse engineering modeling on the functional surfaces of the three different sturgeon body surfaces was conducted using a high precision 0 025 mm noncontact 3d scanner handyscan 3d provided by creaform first the sturgeon was ensured free to stretch and the pasters for data collection were placed around each paster was a locating point and the surface data of the sturgeon were exactly the same after multiple laser scans the point cloud data of the surface characteristic of the sturgeon were obtained by evenly scanning the sturgeon surface with a noncontact 3d laser scanner then the point cloud data were reversely processed with geomagic design x software to produce an editable 3d physical model of the sturgeon and facilitate subsequent extraction of control point data for the bone line of the bionic airfoil lastly after the data for the bone line of the bionic airfoil were acquired the bionic airfoil was designed through a rectangular coordinate system established by projecting the side and top views of the sturgeon as illustrated in fig 1 c two dimensionless parameters namely χ and ψ were defined where χ x i l ψ f u i f l i δ max l is the chord length of the bionic airfoil f u i is the distance from the upper bone line of the airfoil at x i point to the chord length of the airfoil and f l i is the distance from the lower bone line of the airfoil at x i point to the chord length of the airfoil when airfoil is applied in hydraulic machinery the values adopted are χ 0 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 1 0 guan 2011 on the basis of χ values the three sturgeon data were averaged to build the physical model as presented in fig 1 b 2 1 2 subsection treatment and bionic airfoil optimization the physical model of sturgeon should be segmented into sections to generate a smooth bionic airfoil the physical side view model of sturgeon includes the dotted line ab cd and ef sections with fins the head fins and tail of the bionic fish body were modified for modeling and numerical calculations the sturgeon tail structure was fan shaped to provide thrust due to the limitation of physiological conditions in terms of modification the tail was replaced with an arc with a diameter of 0 2 mm in consideration of the requirements of processing accuracy for example the curve modification of fish body and fin could be illustrated by ef segment processing the intersections e and f of the fin and the wing shaped bone line were extended to e and f points on both sides along the direction of the bone line the ratio of the extension distance to the chord length l is 0 05 the four points e e f and f were used as a basis for fitting with a curve and the data of the intersections g h and j of the fitting curve and the vertical lines with i of 0 8 0 85 and 0 9 respectively were recorded the same method could be used to obtain the curve data of ab and cd segments dashed lines in fig 1 the upward structure of the sturgeon s head is for physiological functions such as foraging which does not contribute to the sturgeon s hydrodynamic performance therefore it needs to be corrected in the data processing the top of the fish mouth was replaced with an arc with a diameter of 0 2 mm and the arc was drawn with a radius of 0 1 from the top χ meanwhile the midpoints of the fish mouth arc and the tail were on the same horizontal line following the above steps we could attain a rough bionic airfoil after knowing the control point coordinates the bionic airfoil needed to be further refined the third order b spline parametric method was used to smooth and refine the bionic airfoil c t equation of the third order b spline curve is as follows 1 q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 the knot vector of the b spline basis function is 2 u 0 0 0 0 u 1 u 2 u 3 1 1 1 1 u 1 u 2 and u 3 in the knot vector were determined via the cumulative chord length parameterization of data points in accordance with the multiknot property of the b spline curve the two ends of curve c t were interpolated at the control vertices d0 and d6 that is d0 is the data point at the end of the upper half of the airfoil and d6 is the data point at the end of the lower half of the airfoil subsequently the coordinates of the remaining five control vertices d1 d5 were determined the objective function is 3 min f x i 0 n c t i p i 2 λ c t i n i 2 vector x is the design parameter which is composed of control vertices p i x p i y p i i 0 n is the airfoil data point to be fitted c t i is the tangent vector of the derivative of the curve to parameter t i and n i is the unit normal vector of data point p i in this study a method for the normal estimation of data points proposed by jüttler and felis 2002 were opted to estimate the unit normal vector of each data point λ is the weight coefficient which was regarded as 0 13 in the experiment the cumulative chord length method was selected to estimate the parameters t i i 0 n of each data point p i i 0 n and the parameters were then reset through error estimation the minimum value of the objective function could be changed to a linear equation group by defining the b spline curve avoiding the time consuming difficulty of using nonlinear problems the bionic airfoil under different conditions could be obtained through the two methods of rough and fine repairs this study designed the bionic airfoil of sturgeon in two directions namely side and top views to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics of the bionic airfoil comprehensively when the bionic airfoil was built in the side view direction three schemes were provided and marked as schemes sup slevel and sdown as shown in fig 1 bi these schemes considered the influence of the change in sturgeon mouth structure on its hydrodynamic characteristics when the bionic airfoil was constructed in the top view direction the geometrical structure of the bionic airfoil in different sections was divergent hence this study was divided into three parts to build the physical model of the bionic airfoil the model was based on the plane where the chord length of the airfoil was located as depicted in fig 1 bii 0 1 3 1 3 δ max and 2 3 2 3 δ max sections of the total height of the side view model of the bionic airfoil were selected and marked as schemes stop1 stop2 and stop3 respectively 2 2 numerical simulation 2 2 1 calculation domain and boundary conditions les method was used to calculate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the bionic airfoil the governing equations were discretized using the finite volume method and the diffusion term of the equations was the central difference scheme the separation semi implicit pressure coupling algorithm was used to solve the equations zhou et al 2020a b the calculation area is illustrated in fig 2 a where the chord length of the airfoil is l 70 mm the length of the calculation area is 10 l the widths are 2 7l and 0 5 l and the distance from the airfoil to the inlet is 4 l the boundary conditions are as follows the inlet is set as the velocity inlet the inlet velocity is 10 m s the outlet is set as the static pressure outlet the outlet pressure is 100 kpa the airfoil surface and the upper and lower surfaces of the computational domain are set as non sliding walls the two sides of the airfoil are a pair of symmetrical surfaces the time step is 0 1 ms and the calculation step is 6000 steps yang et al 2020 2 2 2 mesh generation stop2 scheme has an airfoil attack angle of 8 and other schemes adopt the same mesh generation method icem software was used to perform structured meshing of the calculation area and encrypt the mesh around the airfoil as presented in fig 2 b in general the flow field can better reflect the real flow field when the number of grids is large however larger number of grids corresponds to longer time consumption and higher performance requirements of the computer therefore this study takes stop2 scheme as an example to verify the grid independence the relation between the number of grids and lift coefficient c l the number of grids and time consumption are shown in table 1 the table shows that when the number of grids is 1 896 653 the distance between the nodes of the first layer grid and the wall is y 1 the grid size near the airfoil bone line is less than or equal to 1 9e 4 m in the flow direction 1 9e 4 m in the wall normal direction and 2e 5 m in the spanwise direction the increment in lift coefficient c l is 3 the hyperbolic tangent function for the mesh generation is applied as follows 4a y j tanh δ 1 2 j n 2 tanh δ j 0 n 2 where n 2 is the number of grid points in the direction normal to the wall and d is a mesh stretching parameter kim and lee 2015 in the present work a stretching parameter of 1 15 is applied the residual is 10 4 for the continuity equation the momentum equations and the mass transport equation the maximum internal iteration steps for the unsteady flow in each time step is 20 the calculation is conducted in a computer of 128 g memory and 32 core parallel the calculation has approximately 10 000 time steps and takes about 1 week when the number of grids increases to 2224684 other conditions can meet the grid requirements of les but with a longer time therefore grid 3 is selected as the standard for calculation and the change in flow field in the calculation area is negligible 3 result analysis 3 1 validation of the present method the bionic airfoil including asymmetric airfoil schemes sdown slevel and sup and symmetric wing schemes stop1 stop2 and stop3 and a classical airfoil including asymmetric wing clark y and symmetric wing naca0015 were simulated under the same boundary conditions to verify the accuracy of the current numerical simulation method the average lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d were calculated as c l f l 0 5 ρ u 0 2 l s and c d f d 0 5 ρ u 0 2 l s respectively where l is the chord length and s is the spanwise length the results are elucidated in table 2 compared with experiment data roohi et al 2013 the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d of the classical asymmetric airfoil clark y are consistent with the experimental results with errors of 3 95 and 8 33 respectively in comparison with the experimental results the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d of naca0015 are in good agreement with the result saito et al 2007 with errors of 4 62 and 6 25 respectively therefore the current research methods can accurately predict the flow field in the region c l values of sdown and slevel are higher than those of clark y and their drag coefficients c d are smaller than those of clark y c l value of sup is slightly smaller than that of clark y the same calculation area and boundary conditions as in saito s results were chosen when the lift and drag characteristics of the symmetric airfoil were compared c l value of biomimetic symmetric airfoil stop2 is higher than that of naca0015 airfoil whereas c d values of stop1 and stop3 are significantly lower than that of naca4410 airfoil compared with the resistance coefficient c d value c d value of different schemes is dramatically lower than that of naca4410 airfoil we compare the lift coefficient c l value and drag coefficient c d value of asymmetric bionic airfoil with those of clark y airfoil obtained by the same calculation method the results show that the c l value of sdown and slevel is higher than that of clark y airfoil moreover the lift coefficient of sdown is the largest and is slightly larger than that of clark y airfoil and the relative error is 0 02 the drag coefficient c d of sdown is smaller than that of clark y airfoil and the c d value of slevel and sup is greater than that of clark y airfoil the c l and c d values of symmetric airfoil are compared with those of naca0015 airfoil obtained by the same calculation method the results show that the c l value of stop2 is higher than that of naca0015 airfoil whilst the c d value of stop1 and stop3 schemes is obviously lower than that of naca4410 airfoil comparing the resistance coefficient c d value shows that the c d value of different schemes is lower than that of naca4410 airfoil therefore the asymmetric bionic airfoil sdown has the optimal lift drag characteristics and the symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 is the optimal scheme fig 3 shows the transient curves of lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d with time under different schemes as shown from the left side of fig 3 the curves of c l and c d fluctuate periodically over time for asymmetric airfoils clark sdown slevel and sup maximum and minimum values appear on the c l and c d curves the c l and c d values of clark airfoil are the largest the average values of c l and c d in table 2 also show that the c l curve of sdown is at the top with the maximum mean value of 0 8 and the mean value of c d is also the minimum with 0 043 clark sleve and sup airfoils have similar variation rules which fluctuate around their respective c l and c d mean values however the fluctuation amplitude of c l and c d in clark is significantly higher than that in other schemes compared with the c l value of asymmetric airfoils that of symmetrical airfoils in each scheme fluctuates between 0 55 and 0 7 the c l value of stop2 is at the top as shown in table 1 the mean value of c l is also the largest and fluctuates around the value of 0 661 and c d at the bottom and fluctuates around the value of 0 095 from the wave amplitude the amplitude of c l and c d of naca0015 airfoil is the smallest therefore sdown and stop2 are the optimal schemes in asymmetric and symmetric airfoils respectively in terms of either lift or drag coefficient the pressure coefficient c p in a single period of the optimal schemes sdown and stop2 of asymmetric and symmetric bionic airfoils is selected for analysis the expression is c p p 0 5 ρ u 0 2 and p represents the pressure value in the space coordinates in fig 3 the upper surface is the pressure surface and the lower surface is the suction surface the figure shows that the pressure coefficient c p on the pressure surface of the sdown scheme is significantly higher than that on the suction surface and the pressure difference between them is the fundamental cause of the lift from the details c p on the pressure surface is relatively stable by contrast the c p value on the suction surface changes periodically especially after the maximum thickness this variation is consistent with the periodic change of lift coefficient c l and resistance coefficient c d curve on the left compared with the sdown scheme the symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 can form a stable low pressure region near the leading edge of the suction surface however the range of the low pressure area of the latter is obviously smaller than that of the former which is also the reason for the smaller lift coefficient of the symmetrical bionic airfoil zhang et al 2020b 2020a in addition an unstable region exists near the trailing edge of the airfoil and the unstable region changes periodically 3 2 mean velocity and turbulence characteristics around bionic airfoils fig 4 shows some profiles of the stream wise component of the mean velocity and velocity streamlines excess over the bulk flow velocity u u 0 u 0 for bionic airfoils at α 8 the bulk flow velocity is 10 m s each figure in each case e g fig 4 ai and 4 aii corresponds to velocity streamlines among them the ordinate represents the ratio y l where y is the vertical distance from the space position to the bone line of the bionic airfoil and l is the chord length of the airfoil the upper abscissa represents the ratio x l where x is the distance from any point on the chord length to the starting point of the airfoil as illustrated in fig 4 aii the lower abscissa indicates the extent to which the mean velocity exceeds the bulk flow velocity u u 0 u 0 u is the fluid velocity at any point in the region and u 0 is the initial velocity of the fluid from the figure the velocity fluctuation of the symmetric bionic airfoil is relatively smaller than that of the asymmetric airfoil as the airfoil section moves upward the vortex moves backward while the range of influence gradually increases as shown in fig 4 dii 4 eii and 4 fii however the change in velocity streamline is relatively smooth after the flow is shed from the bionic airfoil compared with u u 0 u 0 value of the symmetric airfoil the change in the leading edge of the bionic airfoil is more uniform by contrast this value near the bone line of the bionic airfoil increases gradually with fluid flow and it changes greatly when influenced by eddy current in stop1 scheme the velocity fluctuation at the trailing edge is evidently increased and the velocity variation along the along the y axis direction is also greatly affected especially when x l 1 which is extremely uneven in stop3 scheme the vorticity region is relatively small but mainly occurs near the leading edge which disturbs the flow of subsequent fluid and increases the range of velocity fluctuation in the along the y axis direction the figure shows that when the fluid reaches the leading edge of the bionic airfoil the velocity increases due to the influence of the geometry of the bionic airfoil and the velocity is great when close to the position of the airfoil bone line the change of velocity is similar for the asymmetric bionic airfoil and local backflow occurs near the leading edge of the airfoil approximately x l 0 1 as reflected in fig 4 aii 4 bii and 4 cii where the backflow position of sdown scheme is 0 015 as the leading edge of the airfoil is adjusted upward the recirculation area gradually increases and the fluid flow direction in sup scheme affects the position of x l 0 25 from the perspective of flow velocity the fluid has different degrees of velocity pulsation along the direction of the velocity flow the pulsation is highly intense near the airfoil bone line and becomes relatively weak when it is far away from the bone line as the fluid flows u u 0 u 0 reaches the maximum position and then extends in a vertical direction the position at which u u 0 u 0 reaches its maximum is also subject to change under the influence of velocity fluctuation at the leading edge especially near the trailing edge for example the maximum value appears twice in sdown scheme and the velocity fluctuation is strong fig 5 reflects the changes in reynolds stress under different schemes of the bionic airfoil the coordinates are expressed in the same way as in fig 4 except that the lower abscissa is u v u 0 2 where u is the average value of the velocity increment along the x axis and v is the average value of the velocity increment along the y axis the reynolds stress of fluid u v which is dimensionless by dividing it by the square of u0 it can reflect the change in internal stress of fluid during flow from fig 5 the distribution of the primary reynolds shear stress u v for the different cases follows the bionic airfoil pattern fig 5 a b and 5 c illustrate that the main reynolds stress of three types of asymmetric bionic airfoils changes slightly at the leading edge of the airfoils and mainly appears on the left side of the coordinate axis with fluid flow however when the fluid reaches the main reynolds stress of x l 0 5 it oscillates around the coordinate axis when y l 0 02 on the left side of sdown scheme the maximum value is 0 037 u 0 2 when y l 0 0 on the right side of slevel scheme the maximum value is 0 018 u 0 2 the primary reynolds shear stress of sup scheme alternates from left to right and the maximum value is 0 033 u 0 2 when y l 0 03 on the right with the continuous flow of the fluid the main reynolds stress near the trailing edge of the bionic airfoil changes extremely and the maximum appears alternately around the 0 line main axis the amplitude of the value of u v in sdown scheme is relatively weak compared with those in other asymmetric airfoils compared with three types of symmetric bionic airfoils the upper airfoil section of sturgeon in stop1 scheme has a main reynolds stress oscillation near the leading edge of the airfoil but the amplitude of the oscillation is relatively small within the range of plus or minus 0 002 u 0 2 nevertheless the amplitude of the main reynolds stress oscillation increases rapidly near the trailing edge when x l 0 75 the maximum value is 0 02 u 0 2 on the right side of the 0 main axis which is 10 times the maximum amplitude of the leading edge the maximum value is greater than 0 02 u 0 2 when x l 1 and y l 0 23 along the development direction the main reynolds stress model of stop2 scheme changes relatively slowly compared with that of stop1 scheme and the distribution is reasonable no evident fluctuation occurs and the maximum position is near the airfoil bone line the maximum value at the leading edge of the airfoil mainly appears on the right side of the zero main axis and that near the airfoil trailing edge appears on the left side of the zero main axis the maximum value is less than minus 0 04 u 0 2 for stop3 scheme the wave amplitude near the leading edge of airfoil is relatively small when x l 0 25 the fluctuation amplitude increases obviously which is in the range of 0 02 u 0 2 when x l 0 5 the closer to the trailing edge of the airfoil x l 1 the larger the amplitude fluctuation is and the fluctuation range extends to y l 0 25 along the y direction compared with stop1 and stop3 the change in main reynolds stress model of stop2 scheme is relatively slow the distribution is relatively reasonable no obvious vibration is observed and the maximum position appears near the airfoil bone line at the leading edge of airfoil the maximum value mainly appears on the right side of main axis 0 in the meantime the maximum value appears on the left side of main axis 0 near the trailing edge of airfoil and the maximum values are less than 0 04 u 0 2 3 3 vorticity distributions the highly unsteady flow has a strong relationship with the complicated vortex structures thus the vorticity transport equation was used to reveal the interaction between the unsteady flow and the vortex the vorticity transport equation was utilized as follows 4b d ω d t ω v ω v ρ m p ρ m 2 v m v t 2 ω formula 4 contains four terms the vortex stretching term ω v reveals the stretching and tilting of a vortex due to velocity gradients the vortex dilatation term ω v is influenced by volumetric expansion contraction ρ m p ρ m 2 is the vortex baroclinic term which describes the effect of the baroclinic moment on the vorticity due to the nonparallel pressure gradient and density gradient v m v t 2 ω is the vortex viscosity term which describes the change in vorticity caused by viscous dissipation the v m v t 2 ω value of different bionic airfoils slightly changes the discrimination is also not very obvious and is thus generally ignored q criterion is a common method to identify vortex structure and it is defined as q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 where ω is the vorticity tensor and s is the rate of the strain tensor fig 6 shows the distribution of vortex structures q 0 1 along the y axis vortices and dilatation vortices of six bionic airfoil schemes comparison of the motion laws of vortex structure of the asymmetric bionic airfoil presents that the unstable vortex shedding near the leading edge of the airfoil is affected by the vortices of the leading edge and the geometry of the bionic airfoil after the fluid passes through the maximum thickness of the airfoil the vortex structure has a great influence which is mainly distributed near the trailing edge of the airfoil in sdown scheme the vortices are relatively concentrated at x l 0 7 1 0 in slevel scheme the vortices are relatively large and dispersed it is mainly distributed near the trailing edge in sup scheme the vortices are remarkably small and mainly affect the region far from the airfoil in the along the y axis direction comparison of the stretching and expanding vortices under the three schemes demonstrates that the former is the mainstream vortex motion and the latter is relatively small in terms of dilatation vortex the unstable diffusion range of sdown scheme is significantly smaller than those of slevel and sup the vortex structure of the symmetric bionic airfoil presents different rules from that of the asymmetric bionic airfoil the difference shows a stable distribution of attached vortices at the leading edge of the bionic airfoil and the range is relatively different fig 6 a shows a stable attached vortex distribution on the leading edge of the symmetric bionic airfoil the attachment vortex area of stop2 scheme is significantly larger than that of stop1 and stop3 schemes and that of stop2 scheme is the smallest in general the attached vortex is beneficial to increase the lift coefficient c l comparing fig 6 b and 6 c shows that the vortex stretching and division terms of stop2 scheme mainly appear near the trailing edge of airfoil and the influence range of stop2 scheme is obviously smaller than that of stop1 and stop3 schemes therefore stop2 scheme is better than stop1 and stop3 schemes in terms of q criterion judgment and spanwise and expansion vortex distribution 3 4 application of bionic airfoil in this section the optimal asymmetric bionic airfoil sdown scheme and symmetric bionic airfoil stop2 scheme are applied to the blade thickening of water jet propulsion pump between them the operating parameters of the water jet pump are as follows the flow rate q des 456 m³ h design head h 3 5 m and the speed is 1500 r min the key geometric parameters of impeller are as follows impeller outer diameter d 200 mm and hub diameter d h 80 mm under the condition that other parameters are the same the airfoil of impeller blade is thickened the hydraulic performance curve as shown in fig 7 is obtained through numerical simulation it includes the flow head curves q q des h and flow efficiency curves q q des η fig 7 shows that after the airfoil corresponding to higher life coefficient c l and smaller drag coefficient c d is applied to the water jet pump the head is larger and the efficiency is higher in detail the head of water jet pump s impeller obtained by the thickening principle of asymmetric airfoil sdown and clark in fig 7 a is significantly higher than that of the impeller of water jet pump obtained by the thickening principle of symmetric airfoil stop2 and naca0015 the head h sdown 3 54 m of the pump with asymmetric bionic airfoil sdown is slightly higher than that of clark airfoil h clark 3 52 m at the design flow rate the head increases by 0 56 the head of the pump with symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 h stop2 2 99 m is higher than that of naca0015 airfoil h naca 2 92 m and the head increases by 2 4 at the design flow rate on the q q des η curve shown in fig 7 b the efficiency of the pump η with asymmetric bionic airfoil sdown scheme η sdown 82 26 is the highest which is 1 49 percentage points higher than that of clark airfoil η clark 80 77 the efficiency of the pump with symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 η stop2 79 92 is the highest which is 1 8 percentage points higher than that of naca0015 airfoil η naca 78 12 the efficiency value of pump under asymmetric airfoil is obviously larger and the high efficiency zone is wider than those under symmetric airfoil peng et al 2020 even under the condition of 1 2q q des better hydraulic efficiency can be obtained therefore the application of bionic airfoil in hydraulic machinery water jet pump blade thickening whether on q q des h or q q des η can show better hydraulic efficiency 4 conclusion in this study physical models of three asymmetric bionic airfoils and three symmetric bionic airfoils were established via 3d reverse engineering and b spline curve fitting techniques with sturgeon as study subjects six schemes were simulated using les method the lift and drag coefficients velocity distribution and vortex structure were analyzed in detail the conclusions are as follows 1 the lift drag characteristic of asymmetric bionic airfoil is obviously better than that of symmetric bionic airfoil in asymmetric and symmetric bionic airfoils the sdown and stop2 schemes have the largest and smallest drag coefficients respectively 2 the distribution of vortices is closely related to the velocity fluctuation stronger vortex intensity corresponds to greater velocity fluctuation for the asymmetric bionic airfoil the vortex in the leading edge of sdown scheme is the smallest and the influence on the mainstream is the least for symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 scheme can obtain better velocity distribution 3 stable attachment vortices are easily formed near the leading edge of the airfoil the stable vortex range formed by stop2 scheme is the largest and the vortex stretching and dilation terms have the smallest influence range 4 compared with the classical asymmetric airfoil clark y and symmetric airfoil naca0015 symmetrical and asymmetric bionic airfoils can result in better

21506,airfoil is the basic structure in the field of fluid machinery and is widely used in aerospace petrochemical and hydraulic machinery in this study three nonbionic airfoils sdown slevel and sup in the side direction of sturgeon and three bionic airfoils stop1 stop2 and stop3 in the top direction of sturgeon were established via the b spline curve fitting technique different schemes were simulated by applying large eddy simulation the simulation results are consistent with the experimental results the lift coefficient of an asymmetric bionic airfoil is significantly greater than that of a symmetric airfoil with sdown scheme having the largest lift coefficient the vortex region is related to velocity fluctuation and reynolds stress distribution when the vortex region is close to the tail edge it has a minimal effect on the mainstream the leading edge of the asymmetric bionic airfoil is prone to vortices and the vortex area is associated with the upwarping angle of the leading edge the leading edge of the symmetric bionic airfoil tends to form a stable vortex structure as the stable vortex area expands the lift coefficient increases correspondingly these findings can

known as wing section refers to the cross sectional shape of wing rotor propeller turbine and other structures it is widely used in aerospace petrochemical municipal engineering and underwater machinery in the early days the design of airfoil was primarily based on the wings of birds and was applied in aviation russian scientist zhukovsky established the relationship between the lift and circulation of aircraft wings which is known as the theoretical basis for wing design munk derived the theory of thin wings miklosovic et al 2004 through conformal transformation and obtained the expressions for zero lift angle of attack and moment with the development of research and the complexity of flight conditions the dynamic performance of traditional wings is no longer able to meet the requirements various airfoil databases have been established by aviation authorities worldwide among them the airfoil data series developed by the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca is the most extensively utilized it has been extended to other general fluid machinery fields e g fans and axial flow pumps li et al 2020 bionic design ranges from rough outer contour mapping to refined high precision 3d reverse engineering design mohaghegh et al 2007 the design of airfoil bone line has evolved from simple to complex multisegment curve fitting brakhage and lamby 2008 research methods have also gradually developed from basic theoretical calculation to the visualization analysis of hydrodynamics based on computational fluid dynamics sato et al 2017 li et al 2018 moreover experimental research approaches have been broadened from a single study of external characteristics to test research of internal fluid flow based on particle image velocimetry stolt et al 2019 however most of these series airfoils were built on an aerodynamic basis the flow state of a fluid can change due to the difference in physical properties such as the density and viscosity of air and water affecting the performance of hydraulic machinery especially in the chemical processes zhou et al 2020a b therefore the study of hydrodynamics based bionic airfoil design and its hydrodynamic properties is crucial for the development of airfoil applications in hydraulic machinery bionics is a comprehensive interdisciplinary subject that applies the laws and mechanisms found in biology to solve problems in engineering applications it mainly combines biological physiological functions or life processes with engineering practice and its related research is gradually becoming the focus of academic research for example inspired by the flight process of birds in nature researchers have obtained the wing shapes of owls wolf and konrath 2015 ren 2009 butterflies srygley and thomas 2002 moths hedrick and daniel 2006 bats muijres et al 2008 and flies fry et al 2005 during the fluttering process with the help of modern hydrodynamic techniques they described the kinematics and start up performance of wing spanwise variation and established several microaircrafts with superior performance many species of fish in the ocean have physical characteristics with excellent hydraulic performance fish et al fish and lauder 2006 fish and battle 1995 believed that the nodular structure at the anterior edge of the fins limbs of humpback whales can reduce swimming resistance research on underwater robot thrusters with turtle forelimbs as the subject has also received much attention xu et al 2010 and the results showed that this propulsion method has excellent performance with low noise and high efficiency font et al 2011 in the process of bionic airfoil design the selection of bionic objects and data acquisition are only the preliminary basic steps and the key step is the curve fitting based on known data typical airfoil parameterization methods mainly include the hicks henne shape function method with strong airfoil shape control capability hicks and henne 1978 the parsec parameterization method with excellent robustness vecchia et al 2014 the cst airfoil parameterization method with strong shape control and large design space description kulfan 2008 and the spline parameterization method with uniform or nonuniform rational b spline curve airfoil description masters et al 2017 these methods provide the theoretical basis for the parametric design of a bionic airfoil in this study computational fluid dynamics has developed rapidly and it has achieved remarkable results in the analysis of airfoil hydrodynamics especially in terms of airfoil turbulence and vortex evolution based on the large eddy simulation les model ji et al 2017 huang et al 2014 in this study sturgeons which are widely found in marine and fresh water were selected as the study subjects their body surface structure has good hydrodynamic properties the design of a bionic airfoil and its hydrodynamic characteristics were studied using a combination of theory and model tests the physical model construction method of the bionic airfoil was mainly introduced and the lift drag characteristics and fluid flow law of the airfoil under different conditions were analyzed this study revealed the evolutionary process of vortex shedding and the flow law around airfoils a bionic airfoil with superior performance was obtained which might lay the airfoil foundation for the blade design of hydraulic machinery 2 bionic airfoil design and experimental construction 2 1 bionic airfoil design 2 1 1 3d reverse engineering although sturgeons vary in size their shape curve is virtually identical thus the requirement of geometric similarity is met as shown in fig 1 a three sturgeons of different sizes were selected for this study and they were reverse engineered to reduce errors the reverse engineering modeling on the functional surfaces of the three different sturgeon body surfaces was conducted using a high precision 0 025 mm noncontact 3d scanner handyscan 3d provided by creaform first the sturgeon was ensured free to stretch and the pasters for data collection were placed around each paster was a locating point and the surface data of the sturgeon were exactly the same after multiple laser scans the point cloud data of the surface characteristic of the sturgeon were obtained by evenly scanning the sturgeon surface with a noncontact 3d laser scanner then the point cloud data were reversely processed with geomagic design x software to produce an editable 3d physical model of the sturgeon and facilitate subsequent extraction of control point data for the bone line of the bionic airfoil lastly after the data for the bone line of the bionic airfoil were acquired the bionic airfoil was designed through a rectangular coordinate system established by projecting the side and top views of the sturgeon as illustrated in fig 1 c two dimensionless parameters namely χ and ψ were defined where χ x i l ψ f u i f l i δ max l is the chord length of the bionic airfoil f u i is the distance from the upper bone line of the airfoil at x i point to the chord length of the airfoil and f l i is the distance from the lower bone line of the airfoil at x i point to the chord length of the airfoil when airfoil is applied in hydraulic machinery the values adopted are χ 0 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 95 1 0 guan 2011 on the basis of χ values the three sturgeon data were averaged to build the physical model as presented in fig 1 b 2 1 2 subsection treatment and bionic airfoil optimization the physical model of sturgeon should be segmented into sections to generate a smooth bionic airfoil the physical side view model of sturgeon includes the dotted line ab cd and ef sections with fins the head fins and tail of the bionic fish body were modified for modeling and numerical calculations the sturgeon tail structure was fan shaped to provide thrust due to the limitation of physiological conditions in terms of modification the tail was replaced with an arc with a diameter of 0 2 mm in consideration of the requirements of processing accuracy for example the curve modification of fish body and fin could be illustrated by ef segment processing the intersections e and f of the fin and the wing shaped bone line were extended to e and f points on both sides along the direction of the bone line the ratio of the extension distance to the chord length l is 0 05 the four points e e f and f were used as a basis for fitting with a curve and the data of the intersections g h and j of the fitting curve and the vertical lines with i of 0 8 0 85 and 0 9 respectively were recorded the same method could be used to obtain the curve data of ab and cd segments dashed lines in fig 1 the upward structure of the sturgeon s head is for physiological functions such as foraging which does not contribute to the sturgeon s hydrodynamic performance therefore it needs to be corrected in the data processing the top of the fish mouth was replaced with an arc with a diameter of 0 2 mm and the arc was drawn with a radius of 0 1 from the top χ meanwhile the midpoints of the fish mouth arc and the tail were on the same horizontal line following the above steps we could attain a rough bionic airfoil after knowing the control point coordinates the bionic airfoil needed to be further refined the third order b spline parametric method was used to smooth and refine the bionic airfoil c t equation of the third order b spline curve is as follows 1 q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 the knot vector of the b spline basis function is 2 u 0 0 0 0 u 1 u 2 u 3 1 1 1 1 u 1 u 2 and u 3 in the knot vector were determined via the cumulative chord length parameterization of data points in accordance with the multiknot property of the b spline curve the two ends of curve c t were interpolated at the control vertices d0 and d6 that is d0 is the data point at the end of the upper half of the airfoil and d6 is the data point at the end of the lower half of the airfoil subsequently the coordinates of the remaining five control vertices d1 d5 were determined the objective function is 3 min f x i 0 n c t i p i 2 λ c t i n i 2 vector x is the design parameter which is composed of control vertices p i x p i y p i i 0 n is the airfoil data point to be fitted c t i is the tangent vector of the derivative of the curve to parameter t i and n i is the unit normal vector of data point p i in this study a method for the normal estimation of data points proposed by jüttler and felis 2002 were opted to estimate the unit normal vector of each data point λ is the weight coefficient which was regarded as 0 13 in the experiment the cumulative chord length method was selected to estimate the parameters t i i 0 n of each data point p i i 0 n and the parameters were then reset through error estimation the minimum value of the objective function could be changed to a linear equation group by defining the b spline curve avoiding the time consuming difficulty of using nonlinear problems the bionic airfoil under different conditions could be obtained through the two methods of rough and fine repairs this study designed the bionic airfoil of sturgeon in two directions namely side and top views to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics of the bionic airfoil comprehensively when the bionic airfoil was built in the side view direction three schemes were provided and marked as schemes sup slevel and sdown as shown in fig 1 bi these schemes considered the influence of the change in sturgeon mouth structure on its hydrodynamic characteristics when the bionic airfoil was constructed in the top view direction the geometrical structure of the bionic airfoil in different sections was divergent hence this study was divided into three parts to build the physical model of the bionic airfoil the model was based on the plane where the chord length of the airfoil was located as depicted in fig 1 bii 0 1 3 1 3 δ max and 2 3 2 3 δ max sections of the total height of the side view model of the bionic airfoil were selected and marked as schemes stop1 stop2 and stop3 respectively 2 2 numerical simulation 2 2 1 calculation domain and boundary conditions les method was used to calculate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the bionic airfoil the governing equations were discretized using the finite volume method and the diffusion term of the equations was the central difference scheme the separation semi implicit pressure coupling algorithm was used to solve the equations zhou et al 2020a b the calculation area is illustrated in fig 2 a where the chord length of the airfoil is l 70 mm the length of the calculation area is 10 l the widths are 2 7l and 0 5 l and the distance from the airfoil to the inlet is 4 l the boundary conditions are as follows the inlet is set as the velocity inlet the inlet velocity is 10 m s the outlet is set as the static pressure outlet the outlet pressure is 100 kpa the airfoil surface and the upper and lower surfaces of the computational domain are set as non sliding walls the two sides of the airfoil are a pair of symmetrical surfaces the time step is 0 1 ms and the calculation step is 6000 steps yang et al 2020 2 2 2 mesh generation stop2 scheme has an airfoil attack angle of 8 and other schemes adopt the same mesh generation method icem software was used to perform structured meshing of the calculation area and encrypt the mesh around the airfoil as presented in fig 2 b in general the flow field can better reflect the real flow field when the number of grids is large however larger number of grids corresponds to longer time consumption and higher performance requirements of the computer therefore this study takes stop2 scheme as an example to verify the grid independence the relation between the number of grids and lift coefficient c l the number of grids and time consumption are shown in table 1 the table shows that when the number of grids is 1 896 653 the distance between the nodes of the first layer grid and the wall is y 1 the grid size near the airfoil bone line is less than or equal to 1 9e 4 m in the flow direction 1 9e 4 m in the wall normal direction and 2e 5 m in the spanwise direction the increment in lift coefficient c l is 3 the hyperbolic tangent function for the mesh generation is applied as follows 4a y j tanh δ 1 2 j n 2 tanh δ j 0 n 2 where n 2 is the number of grid points in the direction normal to the wall and d is a mesh stretching parameter kim and lee 2015 in the present work a stretching parameter of 1 15 is applied the residual is 10 4 for the continuity equation the momentum equations and the mass transport equation the maximum internal iteration steps for the unsteady flow in each time step is 20 the calculation is conducted in a computer of 128 g memory and 32 core parallel the calculation has approximately 10 000 time steps and takes about 1 week when the number of grids increases to 2224684 other conditions can meet the grid requirements of les but with a longer time therefore grid 3 is selected as the standard for calculation and the change in flow field in the calculation area is negligible 3 result analysis 3 1 validation of the present method the bionic airfoil including asymmetric airfoil schemes sdown slevel and sup and symmetric wing schemes stop1 stop2 and stop3 and a classical airfoil including asymmetric wing clark y and symmetric wing naca0015 were simulated under the same boundary conditions to verify the accuracy of the current numerical simulation method the average lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d were calculated as c l f l 0 5 ρ u 0 2 l s and c d f d 0 5 ρ u 0 2 l s respectively where l is the chord length and s is the spanwise length the results are elucidated in table 2 compared with experiment data roohi et al 2013 the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d of the classical asymmetric airfoil clark y are consistent with the experimental results with errors of 3 95 and 8 33 respectively in comparison with the experimental results the lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d of naca0015 are in good agreement with the result saito et al 2007 with errors of 4 62 and 6 25 respectively therefore the current research methods can accurately predict the flow field in the region c l values of sdown and slevel are higher than those of clark y and their drag coefficients c d are smaller than those of clark y c l value of sup is slightly smaller than that of clark y the same calculation area and boundary conditions as in saito s results were chosen when the lift and drag characteristics of the symmetric airfoil were compared c l value of biomimetic symmetric airfoil stop2 is higher than that of naca0015 airfoil whereas c d values of stop1 and stop3 are significantly lower than that of naca4410 airfoil compared with the resistance coefficient c d value c d value of different schemes is dramatically lower than that of naca4410 airfoil we compare the lift coefficient c l value and drag coefficient c d value of asymmetric bionic airfoil with those of clark y airfoil obtained by the same calculation method the results show that the c l value of sdown and slevel is higher than that of clark y airfoil moreover the lift coefficient of sdown is the largest and is slightly larger than that of clark y airfoil and the relative error is 0 02 the drag coefficient c d of sdown is smaller than that of clark y airfoil and the c d value of slevel and sup is greater than that of clark y airfoil the c l and c d values of symmetric airfoil are compared with those of naca0015 airfoil obtained by the same calculation method the results show that the c l value of stop2 is higher than that of naca0015 airfoil whilst the c d value of stop1 and stop3 schemes is obviously lower than that of naca4410 airfoil comparing the resistance coefficient c d value shows that the c d value of different schemes is lower than that of naca4410 airfoil therefore the asymmetric bionic airfoil sdown has the optimal lift drag characteristics and the symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 is the optimal scheme fig 3 shows the transient curves of lift coefficient c l and drag coefficient c d with time under different schemes as shown from the left side of fig 3 the curves of c l and c d fluctuate periodically over time for asymmetric airfoils clark sdown slevel and sup maximum and minimum values appear on the c l and c d curves the c l and c d values of clark airfoil are the largest the average values of c l and c d in table 2 also show that the c l curve of sdown is at the top with the maximum mean value of 0 8 and the mean value of c d is also the minimum with 0 043 clark sleve and sup airfoils have similar variation rules which fluctuate around their respective c l and c d mean values however the fluctuation amplitude of c l and c d in clark is significantly higher than that in other schemes compared with the c l value of asymmetric airfoils that of symmetrical airfoils in each scheme fluctuates between 0 55 and 0 7 the c l value of stop2 is at the top as shown in table 1 the mean value of c l is also the largest and fluctuates around the value of 0 661 and c d at the bottom and fluctuates around the value of 0 095 from the wave amplitude the amplitude of c l and c d of naca0015 airfoil is the smallest therefore sdown and stop2 are the optimal schemes in asymmetric and symmetric airfoils respectively in terms of either lift or drag coefficient the pressure coefficient c p in a single period of the optimal schemes sdown and stop2 of asymmetric and symmetric bionic airfoils is selected for analysis the expression is c p p 0 5 ρ u 0 2 and p represents the pressure value in the space coordinates in fig 3 the upper surface is the pressure surface and the lower surface is the suction surface the figure shows that the pressure coefficient c p on the pressure surface of the sdown scheme is significantly higher than that on the suction surface and the pressure difference between them is the fundamental cause of the lift from the details c p on the pressure surface is relatively stable by contrast the c p value on the suction surface changes periodically especially after the maximum thickness this variation is consistent with the periodic change of lift coefficient c l and resistance coefficient c d curve on the left compared with the sdown scheme the symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 can form a stable low pressure region near the leading edge of the suction surface however the range of the low pressure area of the latter is obviously smaller than that of the former which is also the reason for the smaller lift coefficient of the symmetrical bionic airfoil zhang et al 2020b 2020a in addition an unstable region exists near the trailing edge of the airfoil and the unstable region changes periodically 3 2 mean velocity and turbulence characteristics around bionic airfoils fig 4 shows some profiles of the stream wise component of the mean velocity and velocity streamlines excess over the bulk flow velocity u u 0 u 0 for bionic airfoils at α 8 the bulk flow velocity is 10 m s each figure in each case e g fig 4 ai and 4 aii corresponds to velocity streamlines among them the ordinate represents the ratio y l where y is the vertical distance from the space position to the bone line of the bionic airfoil and l is the chord length of the airfoil the upper abscissa represents the ratio x l where x is the distance from any point on the chord length to the starting point of the airfoil as illustrated in fig 4 aii the lower abscissa indicates the extent to which the mean velocity exceeds the bulk flow velocity u u 0 u 0 u is the fluid velocity at any point in the region and u 0 is the initial velocity of the fluid from the figure the velocity fluctuation of the symmetric bionic airfoil is relatively smaller than that of the asymmetric airfoil as the airfoil section moves upward the vortex moves backward while the range of influence gradually increases as shown in fig 4 dii 4 eii and 4 fii however the change in velocity streamline is relatively smooth after the flow is shed from the bionic airfoil compared with u u 0 u 0 value of the symmetric airfoil the change in the leading edge of the bionic airfoil is more uniform by contrast this value near the bone line of the bionic airfoil increases gradually with fluid flow and it changes greatly when influenced by eddy current in stop1 scheme the velocity fluctuation at the trailing edge is evidently increased and the velocity variation along the along the y axis direction is also greatly affected especially when x l 1 which is extremely uneven in stop3 scheme the vorticity region is relatively small but mainly occurs near the leading edge which disturbs the flow of subsequent fluid and increases the range of velocity fluctuation in the along the y axis direction the figure shows that when the fluid reaches the leading edge of the bionic airfoil the velocity increases due to the influence of the geometry of the bionic airfoil and the velocity is great when close to the position of the airfoil bone line the change of velocity is similar for the asymmetric bionic airfoil and local backflow occurs near the leading edge of the airfoil approximately x l 0 1 as reflected in fig 4 aii 4 bii and 4 cii where the backflow position of sdown scheme is 0 015 as the leading edge of the airfoil is adjusted upward the recirculation area gradually increases and the fluid flow direction in sup scheme affects the position of x l 0 25 from the perspective of flow velocity the fluid has different degrees of velocity pulsation along the direction of the velocity flow the pulsation is highly intense near the airfoil bone line and becomes relatively weak when it is far away from the bone line as the fluid flows u u 0 u 0 reaches the maximum position and then extends in a vertical direction the position at which u u 0 u 0 reaches its maximum is also subject to change under the influence of velocity fluctuation at the leading edge especially near the trailing edge for example the maximum value appears twice in sdown scheme and the velocity fluctuation is strong fig 5 reflects the changes in reynolds stress under different schemes of the bionic airfoil the coordinates are expressed in the same way as in fig 4 except that the lower abscissa is u v u 0 2 where u is the average value of the velocity increment along the x axis and v is the average value of the velocity increment along the y axis the reynolds stress of fluid u v which is dimensionless by dividing it by the square of u0 it can reflect the change in internal stress of fluid during flow from fig 5 the distribution of the primary reynolds shear stress u v for the different cases follows the bionic airfoil pattern fig 5 a b and 5 c illustrate that the main reynolds stress of three types of asymmetric bionic airfoils changes slightly at the leading edge of the airfoils and mainly appears on the left side of the coordinate axis with fluid flow however when the fluid reaches the main reynolds stress of x l 0 5 it oscillates around the coordinate axis when y l 0 02 on the left side of sdown scheme the maximum value is 0 037 u 0 2 when y l 0 0 on the right side of slevel scheme the maximum value is 0 018 u 0 2 the primary reynolds shear stress of sup scheme alternates from left to right and the maximum value is 0 033 u 0 2 when y l 0 03 on the right with the continuous flow of the fluid the main reynolds stress near the trailing edge of the bionic airfoil changes extremely and the maximum appears alternately around the 0 line main axis the amplitude of the value of u v in sdown scheme is relatively weak compared with those in other asymmetric airfoils compared with three types of symmetric bionic airfoils the upper airfoil section of sturgeon in stop1 scheme has a main reynolds stress oscillation near the leading edge of the airfoil but the amplitude of the oscillation is relatively small within the range of plus or minus 0 002 u 0 2 nevertheless the amplitude of the main reynolds stress oscillation increases rapidly near the trailing edge when x l 0 75 the maximum value is 0 02 u 0 2 on the right side of the 0 main axis which is 10 times the maximum amplitude of the leading edge the maximum value is greater than 0 02 u 0 2 when x l 1 and y l 0 23 along the development direction the main reynolds stress model of stop2 scheme changes relatively slowly compared with that of stop1 scheme and the distribution is reasonable no evident fluctuation occurs and the maximum position is near the airfoil bone line the maximum value at the leading edge of the airfoil mainly appears on the right side of the zero main axis and that near the airfoil trailing edge appears on the left side of the zero main axis the maximum value is less than minus 0 04 u 0 2 for stop3 scheme the wave amplitude near the leading edge of airfoil is relatively small when x l 0 25 the fluctuation amplitude increases obviously which is in the range of 0 02 u 0 2 when x l 0 5 the closer to the trailing edge of the airfoil x l 1 the larger the amplitude fluctuation is and the fluctuation range extends to y l 0 25 along the y direction compared with stop1 and stop3 the change in main reynolds stress model of stop2 scheme is relatively slow the distribution is relatively reasonable no obvious vibration is observed and the maximum position appears near the airfoil bone line at the leading edge of airfoil the maximum value mainly appears on the right side of main axis 0 in the meantime the maximum value appears on the left side of main axis 0 near the trailing edge of airfoil and the maximum values are less than 0 04 u 0 2 3 3 vorticity distributions the highly unsteady flow has a strong relationship with the complicated vortex structures thus the vorticity transport equation was used to reveal the interaction between the unsteady flow and the vortex the vorticity transport equation was utilized as follows 4b d ω d t ω v ω v ρ m p ρ m 2 v m v t 2 ω formula 4 contains four terms the vortex stretching term ω v reveals the stretching and tilting of a vortex due to velocity gradients the vortex dilatation term ω v is influenced by volumetric expansion contraction ρ m p ρ m 2 is the vortex baroclinic term which describes the effect of the baroclinic moment on the vorticity due to the nonparallel pressure gradient and density gradient v m v t 2 ω is the vortex viscosity term which describes the change in vorticity caused by viscous dissipation the v m v t 2 ω value of different bionic airfoils slightly changes the discrimination is also not very obvious and is thus generally ignored q criterion is a common method to identify vortex structure and it is defined as q 0 5 ω 2 s 2 where ω is the vorticity tensor and s is the rate of the strain tensor fig 6 shows the distribution of vortex structures q 0 1 along the y axis vortices and dilatation vortices of six bionic airfoil schemes comparison of the motion laws of vortex structure of the asymmetric bionic airfoil presents that the unstable vortex shedding near the leading edge of the airfoil is affected by the vortices of the leading edge and the geometry of the bionic airfoil after the fluid passes through the maximum thickness of the airfoil the vortex structure has a great influence which is mainly distributed near the trailing edge of the airfoil in sdown scheme the vortices are relatively concentrated at x l 0 7 1 0 in slevel scheme the vortices are relatively large and dispersed it is mainly distributed near the trailing edge in sup scheme the vortices are remarkably small and mainly affect the region far from the airfoil in the along the y axis direction comparison of the stretching and expanding vortices under the three schemes demonstrates that the former is the mainstream vortex motion and the latter is relatively small in terms of dilatation vortex the unstable diffusion range of sdown scheme is significantly smaller than those of slevel and sup the vortex structure of the symmetric bionic airfoil presents different rules from that of the asymmetric bionic airfoil the difference shows a stable distribution of attached vortices at the leading edge of the bionic airfoil and the range is relatively different fig 6 a shows a stable attached vortex distribution on the leading edge of the symmetric bionic airfoil the attachment vortex area of stop2 scheme is significantly larger than that of stop1 and stop3 schemes and that of stop2 scheme is the smallest in general the attached vortex is beneficial to increase the lift coefficient c l comparing fig 6 b and 6 c shows that the vortex stretching and division terms of stop2 scheme mainly appear near the trailing edge of airfoil and the influence range of stop2 scheme is obviously smaller than that of stop1 and stop3 schemes therefore stop2 scheme is better than stop1 and stop3 schemes in terms of q criterion judgment and spanwise and expansion vortex distribution 3 4 application of bionic airfoil in this section the optimal asymmetric bionic airfoil sdown scheme and symmetric bionic airfoil stop2 scheme are applied to the blade thickening of water jet propulsion pump between them the operating parameters of the water jet pump are as follows the flow rate q des 456 m³ h design head h 3 5 m and the speed is 1500 r min the key geometric parameters of impeller are as follows impeller outer diameter d 200 mm and hub diameter d h 80 mm under the condition that other parameters are the same the airfoil of impeller blade is thickened the hydraulic performance curve as shown in fig 7 is obtained through numerical simulation it includes the flow head curves q q des h and flow efficiency curves q q des η fig 7 shows that after the airfoil corresponding to higher life coefficient c l and smaller drag coefficient c d is applied to the water jet pump the head is larger and the efficiency is higher in detail the head of water jet pump s impeller obtained by the thickening principle of asymmetric airfoil sdown and clark in fig 7 a is significantly higher than that of the impeller of water jet pump obtained by the thickening principle of symmetric airfoil stop2 and naca0015 the head h sdown 3 54 m of the pump with asymmetric bionic airfoil sdown is slightly higher than that of clark airfoil h clark 3 52 m at the design flow rate the head increases by 0 56 the head of the pump with symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 h stop2 2 99 m is higher than that of naca0015 airfoil h naca 2 92 m and the head increases by 2 4 at the design flow rate on the q q des η curve shown in fig 7 b the efficiency of the pump η with asymmetric bionic airfoil sdown scheme η sdown 82 26 is the highest which is 1 49 percentage points higher than that of clark airfoil η clark 80 77 the efficiency of the pump with symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 η stop2 79 92 is the highest which is 1 8 percentage points higher than that of naca0015 airfoil η naca 78 12 the efficiency value of pump under asymmetric airfoil is obviously larger and the high efficiency zone is wider than those under symmetric airfoil peng et al 2020 even under the condition of 1 2q q des better hydraulic efficiency can be obtained therefore the application of bionic airfoil in hydraulic machinery water jet pump blade thickening whether on q q des h or q q des η can show better hydraulic efficiency 4 conclusion in this study physical models of three asymmetric bionic airfoils and three symmetric bionic airfoils were established via 3d reverse engineering and b spline curve fitting techniques with sturgeon as study subjects six schemes were simulated using les method the lift and drag coefficients velocity distribution and vortex structure were analyzed in detail the conclusions are as follows 1 the lift drag characteristic of asymmetric bionic airfoil is obviously better than that of symmetric bionic airfoil in asymmetric and symmetric bionic airfoils the sdown and stop2 schemes have the largest and smallest drag coefficients respectively 2 the distribution of vortices is closely related to the velocity fluctuation stronger vortex intensity corresponds to greater velocity fluctuation for the asymmetric bionic airfoil the vortex in the leading edge of sdown scheme is the smallest and the influence on the mainstream is the least for symmetrical bionic airfoil stop2 scheme can obtain better velocity distribution 3 stable attachment vortices are easily formed near the leading edge of the airfoil the stable vortex range formed by stop2 scheme is the largest and the vortex stretching and dilation terms have the smallest influence range 4 compared with the classical asymmetric airfoil clark y and symmetric airfoil naca0015 symmetrical and asymmetric bionic airfoils can result in better

21507,the thirty year non stationary historical trends in the wave energy climate for united states coastal waters between 1980 and 2009 are investigated using spectral partitioned wave data generated from a wavewatch iii version 5 05 hindcast in addition to historical trends in the omni directional wave power frequency and directionally resolved wave power frequency and directional spreading and seasonal variability are examined for the first time including their geographical distribution these historical wave energy climate trends are linked to changes to the dominant wave systems and commensurate trends in the historical wind climate total wave power trends are consistent with other studies but the present study identifies regions and specific frequency and direction bands where significant wave energy climate changes have occurred for some regions changes to wave climate parameters exceeded one percent annually more than thirty percent over the study period non stationary trends of this magnitude have significant implications for ocean and coastal engineering projects designed assuming wave climates are stationary and warrant their consideration in design practices

its pre commercial phase cruz 2008 mørk et al 2010 scruggs and jacob 2009 as the types and percentage of renewable energy contributions to the global and us energy portfolios continue to expand over the next thirty years hand et al 2012 it is important to investigate non stationary historical trends in the us wave energy climate how are these historical trends in the wave energy climate linked to commensurate changes in wind climates due to climate change intergovernmental panel on climate change 2000 as wecs generally need to resonate with a frequency similar to the peak frequency of the incident waves to efficiently generate energy dallman and neary 2015 korde 1999 energy absorption can be constrained to a narrow wave period band containing only a portion of the total wave power note

power to our knowledge none have assessed the trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power to better understand the source of the observed wave energy climate trends and none have investigated historical trends in frequency spreading directional spreading and seasonal variability several studies investigated wave climate trends including significant wave height and total wave power changes using various data sources obtained from voluntary observing ship data satellite altimetry buoy measurements and numerical model hindcasts for global or regional scale for us coastal waters while the previous research generally found positive trends increasing wave height and total wave power in the wave climate for the northwest atlantic ocean and the gulf of mexico negative trends were observed for the northeast pacific ocean as the wave power is proportional to the significant wave height squared trends of the significant wave height are correlated well with those for wave power table 1 lists the primary studies on wave climate trends in the northeast pacific ocean and the different trends observed along the west coast depending on the period of record por these studies show that the total wave power and significant wave height increased up to the 1980s and then decreased comparison of non stationary trends given in past studies is difficult due to the application of different data sources methods resolutions and periods of record however these studies suggest a reversal in the wave climate trend wave height and total wave power along the west coast between 1980 and 1990 the trend reversed from positive rates of change bromirski et al 2013 gulev and grigorieva 2006 reguero et al 2015 semedo et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 to negative rates gemmrich et al 2011 reguero et al 2019 2015 wu et al 2018 young et al 2011 this reversal occurs around 1990 based on buoy measurements gemmrich et al 2011 and us geodetic satellite geosat data young et al 2011 the negative trendline in wave height over this period is corroborated with the same trendline for the total wave power using other data sources reguero et al 2015 wu et al 2018 unlike the northeast pacific ocean similar studies on non stationary trends for the gulf of mexico and the east coast generally showed positive trends for wave height and total wave power regardless of the por young et al 2011 found that the mean significant wave height increased 0 2 year along the east coast over the same por zheng et al 2013 found positive wave height trends for the gulf of mexico and the east coast with 0 005 m year reguero et al 2015 and reguero et al 2019 showed the total wave power increased approximately 0 5 kw m year and 1 year for the gulf of mexico and the east coast wu et al 2018 showed the total wave power increased for the east coast by 0 2 kw m year a notable limitation of the hindcast data sources summarized in table 1 is that they do not resolve wave physics in shallow nearshore regions further the highest spatial resolution of these data sources is limited to one degree ultra high resolution 32 year model hindcast data sources developed to assess the wave energy resource of the us with spatial resolutions of 200 300 m in nearshore regions e g allahdadi et al 2019 yang et al 2020 will enable more accurate assessment of non stationary trends in wave climates and the wave energy resource that includes shallow nearshore regions these hindcast data are expected to be available for the entire us in two to three years the objectives of the present study are 1 to assess historical non stationary trends in wave energy climates for the us coastal waters between 1980 and 2009 namely total wave power frequency resolved wave power directionally resolved wave power frequency and directional spreading and seasonal variability 2 to link historical wave climate trends with commensurate trends in the wind climate to the authors knowledge this is the first study to resolve historical trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power as well as important wave energy resource attributes frequency and directional spreading and seasonal variability analysis of the frequency and directionally resolved resource as well as its seasonal variability also allows a more detailed examination of the trends in wave climate dynamics and provides additional insights on the historical drivers of the observed wave energy climate trends the modeled hindcast data and wave energy resource parameters used in this study are described in section 2 results are discussed in section 3 including historical trends in the total omnidirectional wave power section 3 1 historical trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power in section 3 2 and historical trends in energy spreading characteristics e g peak period spreading and directional spreading in section 3 3 results are summarized in section 4 highlighting the observed historical regional trends in the dominant wave systems the linkages between wave and wind climates underlying these trends and implications for wec energy projects 2 method 2 1 wave data partitioned bulk wave parameters outputted from the validated phase ii 30 year 1980 2009 hindcast of the 3rd generation 3g spectral wave model wavewatch iii wwiii version 5 05 are used to compute all wave power parameters herein this hindcast was validated with wave measurements at twenty six buoy stations national data buoy center within us coastal waters where the data generally satisfies minimum validation requirements for a reconnaissance level study recommended by the international electrotechnical commission iec ahn et al 2019 iec 2015 in addition the present study compares historic non stationary trends based on this modeled hindcast data at four national data buoy center ndbc stations shown in fig 1 a where fourteen years 1996 2009 of spectral wave measurements are available ndbc spectral measurements which are required to compute the accurate wave power transmitted by irregular waves are only available starting in 1996 while the spatial resolution of this model is 4 arc minutes chawla et al 2013 hourly spectral partitioned bulk wave parameters were limited to 77 346 grid points uniformly distributed within us coastal waters between the shoreline and the economic exclusion zone eez these partitioned data were derived using an algorithm initially developed for watershed identiﬁcation hanson and jensen 2004 vincent and soille 1991 where the frequency directional wave spectrum is divided into partitions representing energy from sub peaks within the spectrum wwiii provides quantitative spectral partitioned parameters e g partitioned wave height partitioned peak period partitioned mean direction and partitioned wind sea fraction chawla et al 2013 tolman 2009 2 2 wave power calculation as the distribution of the wave power by frequency and direction affects the amount of wave power that a wave energy converter wec can absorb the inter annual mean wave power is resolved in terms of the peak period and direction to assess not only the trends of the total omnidirectional wave power itself but also the trends of the frequency resolved wave power and directionally resolved wave power which are portions of the total wave power within discrete peak period and direction bins to calculate the wave power in kw m transmitted by irregular waves using the partitioned wave parameters an approximation considered by the iec standard iec 2015 is used as 1 j n ρ g 16 h s n 2 c g n where j n h s n and c g n is the wave power significant wave height and group velocity of a partition n ρ is the sea water density 1025 k g m 3 and g is the gravity acceleration 9 81 m s 2 the group velocity c g n is defined as 2 c g n 2 π k n 1 2 k n h sinh 2 k n h 1 t e n where the partitioned wave number k n partitioned energy period t e n and water depth h are related through the dispersion equation as 3 2 π t e n 2 g k n t a n h k n h in most previous studies t e has been approximated using a relation t e c t p which is derived from a particular theoretical spectrum when the frequency wave spectrum is unknown the present study uses c 0 86 for wind sea and c 1 0 for swell which is equivalent to pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 and gaussian spectrum ahn et al 2019 the resolved wave power j n is sorted in terms of the partitioned peak period bin t b resolution of 1 s for example t b 1 means 0 s t p 1 s partitioned mean wave direction bin θ b resolution of 10 clockwise from the north and month m for example θ b 1 means 0 θ 10 based on their partitioned peak period t p n and mean direction θ n the resolved inter annual mean wave power j m t b θ b m t is computed as the summation of j n pairs in the cell t b θ b m t divided by the number of hours t y e a r in the corresponding year t as 4 j m t b θ b m t 1 n j n t y e a r where n is the number of j n pairs in the cell t b θ b m t ahn et al 2020a introduced the 4 d wave power matrix in terms of the partitioned peak period direction month and year to characterize the wave energy and calculate the parameters e g peak period and directional spreading seasonal and inter annual variability note that the frequency resolved inter annual mean wave power j m t b t is taken as the summation over the direction and month bins the inter annual mean total omnidirectional wave power j m t is simply a sum of all components in the peak period and direction bins the 30 year mean total wave power j m is simply the mean of the j m t 2 3 energy spreading indices as wecs and wec arrays need to resonate at the frequency of the incident waves and to align normal to the predominant wave direction to maximize energy absorption the characteristics and trends of the energy spreading in both the peak period and direction need to be assessed therefore we compute the peak period spreading and directionality coefficient of the inter annual mean total wave power as well as the spreading indices of the 30 year mean total wave power these indices were introduced by ahn et al 2020a as summary metrics for these wave energy resource attributes 2 3 1 peak period spreading ε j the spectral width as a measure of the relative frequency spreading of the energy spectrum recommended by the iec standard iec 2015 is parameterized in this study as the relative spread of the inter annual mean total wave power over the peak period and computed as 5 ε j t t b j m t b t t b t b 2 j m t b t t b t b j m t b t 2 1 where t b and θ b is the peak period bins and direction bins as defined above and ε j t is the peak period spreading of the j m t in a particular year t the peak period spreading of the 30 year mean total wave power ε is computed by applying j m t b to eq 5 a small value indicates the wave energy exhibits a narrow peak period spreading typical values for wave energy climates in us coastal waters vary from 0 1 to 0 4 2 3 2 directionality coefficient d j the directionality coefficient as a measure of the characteristic direction of the wave iec 2015 is parameterized in this study as the spreading of the inter annual mean total wave power over the wave direction the directionally resolved j m t j m t α passing through a vertical plane with the normal vector in direction α is computed by adding each component of the j m θ b t resolved in the direction α as 6 j m t α θ b j m θ b t c o s α θ b δ the parameter α has a resolution of 10 ranging from 0 to 360 clockwise from the north the δ is 1 c o s α θ b 0 or 0 c o s α θ b 0 to ensure that only positive valued component contribute to j m t α these parameters adopt definitions recommended by the iec standard iec 2015 the directionality coefficient of the inter annual mean total wave power ratio of the maximum value of j m t α to the j m t is computed as 7 d j t m a x j m t α j m t the directionality coefficient of the 30 year mean total wave power d j is computed by applying j m θ b and j m α to eqs 6 and 7 a large value indicates the wave energy exhibits a narrow directional spreading typical values for wave climates in us coastal waters vary from 0 5 to 0 9 2 3 3 seasonal variability m v j the seasonal variability of the wave power is parameterized as a ratio of the maximum range of monthly mean wave power to the annual mean value cornett 2008 as 8 m v j t m a x j m m t t y e a r t m m i n j m m t t y e a r t m j m t where m is the month and t m is the length of the data for each month the seasonal variability of the 30 year mean total wave power m v j is computed by applying j m m to eq 8 a large value indicates the wave power exhibits a large seasonal variability typical values for wave climates in us coastal waters vary from 1 0 to 2 0 2 4 linear trend parameters to access the trends of these wave climate parameters j m t b t j m θ b t ε j t d j t and m v j t the 30 year nonstationary trends are calculated using a linear function x a t b ε where x is inter annual variables a is a slope of the trend b is the intercept and ε is a disturbance term we assess the trend of the inter annual parameters j m t b t j m θ b t j m t ε j t d j t and m v j t as the respective slopes a j t b a j θ b a j in kw m year and a ε a d a m v in 1 year for example a j 7 s is the trend of the frequency resolved inter annual mean wave power within t b 7 s 6 s t p 7 s the percent changes of these inter annual parameters p j t b p j θ b p j p ε p d p m v in year are computed and mapped as the slope a normalized by the 30 year mean value for example p j 7 s is a j 7 s j m 7 s 100 in section 3 the historical wave energy climate trends and spreading and seasonal variability characteristics that are statistically significant at the 95 level are presented as the linear increase or decrease in the inter annual mean relative to the 30 year mean values as the percent change p in year the resource parameters evaluated in the present study are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 total omnidirectional wave power trends the geographical distribution of the 30 year mean total wave power j m is shown in fig 1 a in general the offshore wave power is more energetic than nearshore due to the increase in wave energy dissipation shoreward the largest energy with j m exceeding 40 kw m is found along the west coast aleutian trench and the gulf of alaska the california coast has moderate wave energy compared to those along the pacific northwest coast the hawaiian coast has slightly lower j m compared to those along the west coast on the order of 20 kw m the j m along the east coast and atlantic ocean side of puerto rico are generally below 10 kw m the lowest wave energy excluding arctic alaska is found in the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea side of puerto rico with j m below 5 kw m the inter annual mean total wave power j m t at sample buoy stations 46026 west coast 51001 hawaiian islands 42040 gulf of mexico and 44025 east coast are presented in fig 1 a values of j m t computed from the buoy spectral measurements over 14 years allow comparison with those computed from the wwiii model these are the only ndbc stations within the eez with spectral measurements over an extensive period spanning fourteen years 1996 2009 within the study period for the alaska and puerto rico coastal regions no spectral measurements with similar attributes are available as the model did not generate outputs at station 51001 hawaii output at the grid point closest to station 51001 is used the linear trendlines for j m t show the average rate of change of j m t over the por but significant oscillations about the trendlines are observed especially at the gulf of mexico buoy location where the subtropical jet stream generated during typical enso events impacted coastal waters in the southeast us kennedy et al 2007 bromirski et al 2013 reported that the oscillations observed at the pacific ocean were caused by warm and cool phases of pacific decadal oscillations pdo the oscillations normalized by their mean wave power are less significant at stations 46026 and 51001 compared to those for station 42040 linear correlation coefficients are 0 90 at 42026 0 93 at 51001 0 80 at 42040 and 0 88 at 44025 the j m t gradually decreased at stations 42026 and 51001 over the 30 year por the trend at station 42026 indicates a j 0 13 kw m year p j 0 67 year which is close to the decrease in mean significant wave heights approximately 0 5 year found by young et al 2011 at stations 42040 and 44025 the j m t increased with a j 0 04 kw m year and 0 02 kw m year p j 1 3 year and 0 5 year which are consistent with approximately 1 2 year and 0 5 year trends for the total wave power found by reguero et al 2019 for these locations to describe regional variations of the trends of the inter annual mean total omnidirectional wave power geographic distributions p j in year which are statistically significant at the 95 level are presented in fig 1 c this analysis shows that the inter annual mean total wave power changed gradually over the 30 year por decreased by 0 5 to 1 0 year for the majority of coastal waters in the pacific ocean more pronounced rates of change are observed in northern segments along the alaska coast the southern coast of california and the southern coastline segments of puerto rico and hawaii where the total wave power decreased by over 0 5 year and the waters in northern segments along alaska and the central gulf of mexico coasts where it increased by 1 0 year the trends for most regions of the east coast were not significant except for waters near station 44025 detailed mechanisms of the overall trends shown in fig 1 are described in section 3 2 as seen in table 1 the previous studies tend to show opposite trends for coastal waters in the pacific ocean depending on the duration of the sample data used in the studies por dependencies of the trends computed using the wwiii hindcast at four buoy stations are illustrated in fig 2 trends of the inter annual mean total omnidirectional wave power a j in kw m year are shown in terms of a start year y axis and the number of years or por x axis for example for each plot the top left bin indicates the a j from 2000 to 2009 and the bottom right bin indicates the a j from 1980 to 2009 while relatively short durations e g por less than twenty years have temporal variabilities in the total wave power trends longer por exceeding twenty years tend to have consistent trends at four buoy stations the negative trends at stations 46026 a and 51001 b and the positive trends at stations 42040 c and 44025 d these observations show that results in the present study are independent of por and the start date because they exceed twenty years of data 3 2 trends in the frequency resolved and directionally resolved wave power at these four buoy stations analysis of the 30 year historical trend rates of the inter annual mean frequency and direction resolved wave power modeled a j t b and a j θ b reveal specific wave systems responsible for these observed trends as shown in fig 3 the negative trends temporal rate of change of the total omnidirectional wave power a j at stations 46026 and 51001 shown in fig 1 were due to decreases in the wave power at these locations by long period swells ranging from 12 to 15 s traveling from the west 240 270 at station 46026 and the northwest 290 320 at station 51001 the wave power within short period swells ranging from 7 to 9 s from the east 90 110 at station 51001 increased but the wave power contributions of wave systems in this frequency direction range were relatively insignificant the positive total wave power trends a j at stations 42040 and 44025 shown in fig 1 were due to increasing wave power by long period swells 12 14 s between 130 and 150 at station 42040 and increasing wave power by short period swells 8 10 s between 160 and 180 at station 44025 to investigate regional historic trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power i e the wave power resolved by peak period and directional bands and to identify wave energy climates exhibiting pronounced changes four peak period bands t b a n d s t p 6 s 6 s t p 9 s 9 s t p 12 s 12 s t p and four direction bands θ b a n d s 0 θ 90 90 θ 180 180 θ 270 270 θ 360 are defined based on the distinct regional trends shown in fig 3 the resolved inter annual mean wave power for each of the bands are calculated by summing the wave power components within each band the geographic distribution of the resolved 30 year mean wave power for each of the four peak period bands j m t b a n d s in kw m is shown in fig 4 a d along with the historic trend rate p j t b a n d s in year in fig 4 e h in fig 5 similar maps show the geographic distribution of the resolved wave power in these four direction bands j m θ b a n d s along with the historic trend rates p j θ b a n d s using the j m t b a n d s and j m θ b a n d s the dominant resource bands contributing the largest portions of energy to the total omnidirectional wave power are identified for six coastal regions including alaska the west hawaii the gulf of mexico the east coast and puerto rico historical trends for the wave systems in these dominant resource bands which reflect the wave climate are evaluated in the context of commensurate wind climate trends for alaska most of the wave power in the bering sea is distributed within two frequency bands in the 6 12 s range fig 4 b and c and three direction bands in the 0 270 range fig 5 a c among these resources wave power decreased in the 6 9 s band between 0 and 90 approximately 1 0 year fig 4 f and fig 5 e for the aleutian islands and the gulf of alaska most of the wave power is within the 9 15 s band fig 4 c and d between 90 and 270 fig 5 b and c along the northeast pacific ocean side among these resources the wave power in swells generated by north pacific westerlies and the aleutian low pressure system ahn 2019 decreased in the 9 15 s band between 90 and 180 approximately 1 5 year fig 4 g and h and fig 5 f according to reguero et al 2019 total omnidirectional wave power from 1985 to 2008 decreased approximately 1 year in the north pacific due to reduced contributions from swells emanating from other ocean sub basins the oceanic warming in the different basins increased global mean wave power due to the inﬂuence of sea surface temperature on wind climates except for the north pacific reguero et al 2019 2015 young et al 2011 the swells generated by the aleutian low pressure system during winter reduced as the north pacific high pressure system was blocked by the intensified pacific jet stream and moved closer to hawaii vitousek et al 2009 reductions in ice due to global warming increased wave power in the arctic by over 2 0 year by short period waves fig 4 e the wave power along the west coast is within the 9 15 s swells fig 4 c and d between 180 and 360 fig 5 c and d the wave power of swells generated by the north pacific westerlies ahn 2019 during winter decreased in the 12 15 s band between 180 and 270 approximately 1 5 year fig 4 h and fig 5 g reguero et al 2015 found that a southward shifted and intensified pacific jet stream generates waves from east to west within the north pacific and decreased the swells that reach the west coast for hawaii the wave power is broadly distributed in all period bands except for the waves shorter than 6 s fig 3 b d ahn 2019 reported that the wave energy resource for this region originates from two dominant wave systems 8 10 s swells between 40 and 100 generated by the trade winds and 13 15 s swells between 300 and 360 generated by the north pacific storms like the west coast the wave power in the north pacific swells decreased approximately 1 0 year fig 4 g and h and fig 5 h the wave power in the trade wind swells however increased approximately 0 5 year fig 4 f and fig 5 f as the north pacific high pressure system which was shifted towards the equator intensified the trade winds near hawaii vitousek et al 2009 in the gulf of mexico the 6 9 s waves between 90 and 180 contain the most wave energy for this region ahn 2019 and exhibited no significant energy trends fig 4 f although the 12 15 s swells generated by atlantic basin cyclones have less wave power fig 4 d wave power increased more than 3 0 year fig 4 h according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the occurrence of the atlantic basin cyclones increased by 100 during the same 30 year por national hurricane center 2020 for the east coast the wave power is broadly distributed between 0 and 270 fig 5 a c ahn 2019 reported that the wave power in this region consists of two dominant wave systems 9 11 s swells between 40 and 100 generated by nor easters and 8 10 s swells between 80 and 140 generated by trade winds or bermuda high pressure system the wave power in nor easter swells decreased approximately 1 0 year fig 5 a because the frequency of occurrence and wave height of storms generated by the nor easters decreased from 1988 to 2009 as the waters cool late in fall and early winter u va dept of environmental sciences 2010 the wave power in trade wind swells increased approximately 1 0 year due to the overall increase in the intensity of the north atlantic trade winds young et al 2011 these opposite trends offset each other and balance the energy trends for the east coast except for the mid atlantic coast where positive trends in trade wind swells dominate over negative trends in nor easter swells for puerto rico most of the wave power is between 6 and 12 s fig 4 b and c and between 0 and 180 fig 5 a and b three wave systems contribute to the total omnidirectional wave power for this region 10 12 s swells between 340 and 40 generated by nor easters 7 9 s swells between 20 and 80 generated by trade winds 5 7 s waves between 80 and 140 generated by atlantic tropical storms ahn 2019 like the east coast the wave power of nor easter swells decreased 0 5 year approximated by fig 4 h and fig 5 h and trade wind swells increased 0 5 year figs 4 f and fig 5 e at the atlantic ocean side coast as the bermuda high pressure system moved eastward by 0 511 year from 1990 to 2014 wang et al 2016 tropical storms migrated northward and the number of storms passing through puerto rico reduced leading to decreases in wave power of approximately 1 0 year fig 4 e and fig 5 f the wave power along the atlantic side of puerto rico consists of nor easter swells and trade wind swells where opposite energy trends offset each other because the wave power along the caribbean sea side of puerto rico is predominated by the waves generated by tropical storms whose power decreased the total omnidirectional wave power decreased in this region 3 3 trends in energy spreading indices as shown in section 3 2 historical trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power vary geographically with some regions experiencing greater rates of change than others and some regions experiencing little or no significant change in this section historical trends in the spreading characteristics of energy are examined these spreading characteristics can be assessed with the simple summary indices peak period spreading ε j directionality coefficient d j and seasonal variability m v j of the 30 year mean total wave power the mean values for these indices are mapped in fig 6 a c historical trends in the peak period spreading directionality coefficient and seasonal variability of the inter annual mean total wave power are assessed by estimating and mapping the rate that these spreading indices change over time with p ε p d and p m v values in year fig 6 d f the historic mean peak period spreading ε j ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 for all us wave climates the lowest values indicating a narrow banded peak period spread for the total wave power are observed for the gulf of alaska and pacific northwest coast with ε j 0 2 fig 6 a relatively large values are observed for all remaining regions including ε j 0 3 for hawaii and the east coast the largest peak period spreading ε j 0 3 is observed along the central coast of the gulf of mexico for hawaii the energy distributions are bi modal with two separate frequency peaks but for each peak the period spreading index is the same ahn et al 2020a the historical trends linear or average rate of change in the peak period spreading p ε vary geographically ranging from 1 0 to 0 8 year as shown in fig 6 d peak period spreading generally increased for all regions except for the arctic region of alaska where it decreased approximately 1 0 year and the east coast where it remained constant the largest increases were found along the central gulf of mexico coast approximately 0 8 year the hawaiian coast approximately 0 6 year and along the gulf of alaska and pacific northwest coast approximately 0 4 year in the north pacific ocean the peakedness of the energy distribution over the frequency was reduced as the energy contribution by long period north pacific swells the dominant wave systems decreased for hawaii the peakedness was further reduced as the energy contribution of the secondary wave system shorter period trade wind swells increased for the central coast of the gulf of mexico increased contributions from tropical storm swells caused another frequency peak to form at the long period range which significantly increased the peak period spreading for the arctic region of alaska increased contributions from short period waves which contribute the largest energy to the total omnidirectional wave power for this region increased the peakedness of the frequency spectrum and resulted in a decrease in the peak period spreading the historic mean directionality coefficient d j ranged from 0 4 to 0 95 for all us wave climates in general the total wave power in coastal regions offshore exhibits small directionality coefficients large directional spreading compared to nearshore regions ahn et al 2020b as shown in fig 6 b the total wave power along the west coast and caribbean sea side of puerto rico exhibits the largest directionality coefficient narrowest directional spreading among us coastal waters with d j 0 9 the energy distributions for the east coast and hawaiian coast which are bi modal with two separate directional peaks exhibit relatively small directionality coefficients with d j 0 6 compared to the west coast the historical trends in the directionality coefficient p d vary geographically ranging from 0 8 to 0 6 year as shown in fig 6 e the directionality coefficient generally remained constant except for hawaii and the east coast for hawaii decreased north pacific swells and increased trade wind swells caused counteracting trends for directional spreading in the northern sub region 0 6 year and southern region 0 6 year north pacific swells contained larger energy than trade wind swells for the northern subregion at the beginning of the 30 year por on the other hand these two wave systems contributed equally to the total omnidirectional wave power in the southern sub region over the same period for the east coast opposite trends in the two dominant wave systems caused different trends in directional spreading in the northern subregion 0 6 year and southern subregion 0 8 year nor easter swells decreased while trade wind or bermuda high pressure system swells increased the historical mean seasonal variability m v j ranged from 1 0 to 2 0 the lowest values indicating a low seasonal variability for the total wave power are observed for the california coast and east coast with m v j 1 0 fig 6 c relatively large values are observed for hawaii and the pacific northwest coast with m v j 1 5 the largest seasonal variability m v j 2 0 is observed along the northern alaskan coast the historical trends in the seasonal variability p m v vary geographically ranging from 2 0 to 2 0 year as shown in fig 6 f the seasonal variability increased for southern alaska approximately 1 5 year the pacific northwest coast approximately 1 0 year the central gulf of mexico approximately 2 0 year and the caribbean sea side of puerto rico approximately 1 0 year the seasonal variability decreased for arctic alaska approximately 1 5 year the eastern and western gulf of mexico approximately 2 0 year and subregions of the east coast approximately 1 0 year in the north pacific ocean the wave power was more focused in the winter than summer ahn et al 2020a where the decreased summer wave power by the north pacific high pressure system increases the seasonal variability for this region the wave power in the central gulf of mexico was more focused in the summer ahn et al 2020a than the winter where the increased summer wave power supplied by the tropical storm swells caused an increase in the seasonal variability the wave power along the caribbean sea side of puerto rico was evenly distributed year round ahn et al 2020a where the decreased winter wave power supplied by nor easters caused an increase in the seasonal variability the reductions in ice in arctic alaska caused a decrease in the seasonal variability unlike the central gulf of mexico the wave power along the eastern and western coasts of the gulf was more focused in the winter than the summer ahn et al 2020a where the increased summer wave power supplied by the tropical storm swells caused a decrease in the seasonal variability in the coastline promontory subregions of the east coast e g cape cod ny and cape hatteras nc the wave power was more focused in the winter than the summer ahn et al 2020a where the decreased winter wave power supplied by nor easters caused a decrease in the seasonal variability 4 summary and discussion except for the east coast the observed trends in the total omnidirectional wave power observed herein are generally consistent with the trends found by reguero et al 2015 who used a 28 year similar por global hindcast from wwiii with a spatial resolution of 1 5 by 1 0 although the present study found that the total wave power for the east coast increased like reguero et al 2015 this trend was not significant at the 95 level the observed trends in the wave energy climates for regions in the north pacific ocean were due in part to the alteration of the pacific jet stream caused by climate change kennedy et al 2007 reguero et al 2015 vitousek et al 2009 this alteration diminished the total omnidirectional wave power by approximately 0 5 to 1 0 year for these regions the southward shifted and intensified pacific jet stream moved the north pacific high pressure system and aleutian low pressure system southward resulting in many of the observed changes to the dominant wave systems supplying most of the energy to these regions decreased swells 1 0 year generated by the aleutian low pressure system reaching the aleutian trench and the gulf of alaska decreased swells from westerlies 1 5 year that reach the west coast by blocking swells emanating from other ocean sub basins decreased the north pacific swells 1 0 year and increased swells from trade winds 0 5 year that reach the hawaiian coast the observed trends in wave energy climates for the east coast puerto rico and the gulf of mexico were due in part to changes in nor easters and the bermuda high pressure system caused by climate change u va dept of environmental sciences 2010 wang et al 2016 these changes result in positive trends in the total omnidirectional wave power for the gulf of mexico 1 3 year and the negative trends for the caribbean sea side of puerto rico 0 5 year as the waters cool late in fall and early winter the frequency of occurrence and the wave heights of storms generated by nor easters decreased this change decreased the wave energy in the nor easter swells 0 5 year for the east coast and the atlantic side of puerto rico as the bermuda high moved eastward by 0 511 year from 1990 to 2014 the wave energy in the trade wind swells that reach the east coast and the atlantic side of puerto rico increased 0 5 year these opposite trends offset each other in these regions due in part to the shifted bermuda high the atlantic tropical storms migrated northward and the number of storms passing through puerto rico decreased while those passing through the gulf of mexico increased these changes decreased the wave energy in the short period waves 1 0 year for the caribbean sea side of puerto rico and increased the wave energy in the long period swells 3 0 year for the gulf of mexico the peak period spreading of the total wave power increased along the west coast 0 4 year pacific ocean side of the aleutian trench 0 4 year hawaiian coast 0 6 year and central gulf of mexico coast 0 8 year while the directionality coefficient of the total wave power decreased for the northern region of the hawaiian coast 0 6 year and the southern region of the east coast 0 6 year it increased for the southern region of the hawaiian coast 0 6 year and the northern region of the east coast 0 8 year the seasonal variability of the total wave power increased for southern alaska 1 5 year the pacific northwest 1 0 year the central gulf of mexico 2 0 year and the caribbean sea side of puerto rico 1 0 year while it decreased for the eastern and western gulf of mexico 2 0 year and some subregions of east coast 1 0 year e g cape cod ny and cape hatteras nc assuming these trends observed herein continue in the future wecs targeting long period swells for energy generation along the pacific ocean coasts would experience diminishing energy resources due to relatively high seasonal variability and its increasing trend along the pacific northwest coast an energy project in this region may experience reduced capacity factor a ratio of the actual energy production to its rated full power over an operational time period in the future in the same scenario wecs targeting short period swells along the hawaiian coast may benefit from increasing wave energy resources although no significant changes in the total omnidirectional wave power are expected for coastal waters along the north atlantic ocean based on this scenario directionally dependent wecs targeting resources within particular directions may consider the positive energy trends in trade wind or bermuda high pressure system swells and negative energy trends in nor easter swells to orient the device note that energy projects along the northern east coast would experience fewer directional constraints for energy generation compared to the southern east coast based on this scenario long period swells in the gulf of mexico which contribute relatively little energy for this region will increase potentially leading to an increase in costs for operation and maintenance o m and for survival of wecs tuned to short period waves the methodology presented in the present study can be applied in future efforts to investigate these same non stationary wave energy climate trends for shallow nearshore regions using the ultra high resolution wave hindcasts e g allahdadi et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which have been shown to significantly reduce model error compared to the relatively coarse resolution model hindcast data sources that have thus far been used for these investigations 5 conclusions using the partitioned wave parameters obtained from the wavewatch iii wwiii version 5 05 30 year 1980 2009 hindcast the 30 year nonstationary trends of the total omnidirectional wave power frequency resolved wave power directionally resolved wave power frequency and directional spreading and seasonal variability indices are investigated for coastal waters in the us the historical trends in the total and resolved wave power for different coastal regions are investigated in the context of the dominant wave systems of the energy resource and trends in wind climates historical trends in important wave climate attributes including peak period spreading directional spreading and seasonal variability of the wave power are also examined total wave power trends are consistent with other studies but the present study identifies regions and specific frequency and direction bands where significant changes have occurred and therefore warrant reconsideration of design practices for ocean and coastal engineering projects that assume wave climates are stationary for some regions changes to wave climate parameters exceeded one percent annually a 1 year increase or decrease results in approximately 30 change over the historical record which is significant future wave climate and energy resource trends may be discerned by examining global climate model forecasts that predict the following non stationary processes e g the pacific jet stream intensity and migration the bermuda high migration and temperature changes in the north atlantic ocean under various carbon reduction

21507,the thirty year non stationary historical trends in the wave energy climate for united states coastal waters between 1980 and 2009 are investigated using spectral partitioned wave data generated from a wavewatch iii version 5 05 hindcast in addition to historical trends in the omni directional wave power frequency and directionally resolved wave power frequency and directional spreading and seasonal variability are examined for the first time including their geographical distribution these historical wave energy climate trends are linked to changes to the dominant wave systems and commensurate trends in the historical wind climate total wave power trends are consistent with other studies but the present study identifies regions and specific frequency and direction bands where significant wave energy climate changes have occurred for some regions changes to wave climate parameters exceeded one percent annually more than thirty percent over the study period non stationary

power to our knowledge none have assessed the trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power to better understand the source of the observed wave energy climate trends and none have investigated historical trends in frequency spreading directional spreading and seasonal variability several studies investigated wave climate trends including significant wave height and total wave power changes using various data sources obtained from voluntary observing ship data satellite altimetry buoy measurements and numerical model hindcasts for global or regional scale for us coastal waters while the previous research generally found positive trends increasing wave height and total wave power in the wave climate for the northwest atlantic ocean and the gulf of mexico negative trends were observed for the northeast pacific ocean as the wave power is proportional to the significant wave height squared trends of the significant wave height are correlated well with those for wave power table 1 lists the primary studies on wave climate trends in the northeast pacific ocean and the different trends observed along the west coast depending on the period of record por these studies show that the total wave power and significant wave height increased up to the 1980s and then decreased comparison of non stationary trends given in past studies is difficult due to the application of different data sources methods resolutions and periods of record however these studies suggest a reversal in the wave climate trend wave height and total wave power along the west coast between 1980 and 1990 the trend reversed from positive rates of change bromirski et al 2013 gulev and grigorieva 2006 reguero et al 2015 semedo et al 2011 zheng et al 2013 to negative rates gemmrich

the negative trendline in wave height over this period is corroborated with the same trendline for the total wave power using other data sources reguero et al 2015 wu et al 2018 unlike the northeast

the total wave power increased for the east coast by 0 2 kw m year a notable limitation of the hindcast data sources summarized in table 1 is that they do not resolve wave physics in shallow nearshore regions further the highest spatial resolution of these data sources is limited to one degree ultra high resolution 32 year model hindcast data sources developed to assess the wave energy resource of the us with spatial resolutions of 200 300 m in nearshore regions e g allahdadi et al 2019 yang et al 2020 will enable more accurate assessment of non stationary trends in wave climates and the wave energy resource that includes shallow nearshore regions these hindcast data are expected to be available for the entire us in two to three years the objectives of the present study are 1 to assess historical non stationary trends in wave energy climates for the us coastal waters between 1980 and 2009 namely total wave power frequency resolved wave power directionally resolved wave power

resolve historical trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power as well as important wave energy resource attributes frequency and directional spreading and seasonal variability analysis of the frequency and directionally resolved resource as well as its seasonal variability also allows a more detailed examination of the trends in wave climate dynamics and provides additional

herein this hindcast was validated with wave measurements at twenty six buoy stations national data buoy center within us coastal waters where the data generally satisfies minimum validation requirements for a reconnaissance level study recommended by the international electrotechnical commission iec ahn et al 2019 iec 2015 in addition the present study compares historic non stationary trends based on this modeled hindcast data at four national data buoy center ndbc stations shown in fig 1 a where fourteen years 1996 2009 of spectral wave measurements are available ndbc spectral measurements which are required to compute the accurate wave power transmitted by irregular waves are only available starting in 1996 while the spatial resolution of this model is 4 arc minutes chawla et al 2013 hourly spectral partitioned bulk wave parameters were limited to 77 346 grid points uniformly distributed within us coastal waters between the shoreline and the economic exclusion zone eez these partitioned data were derived using an algorithm initially developed for watershed identiﬁcation hanson and jensen 2004 vincent and soille 1991 where the frequency directional wave spectrum is divided into partitions representing energy from sub peaks within the spectrum wwiii provides quantitative spectral partitioned parameters e g partitioned wave height partitioned peak period partitioned mean direction and partitioned wind sea fraction chawla et al 2013 tolman 2009 2 2 wave power calculation as the distribution of the wave power by frequency and direction affects the amount of wave power that a wave energy converter wec can absorb the inter annual mean wave power is resolved in terms of the peak period and direction to assess not only the trends of the total omnidirectional wave power itself but also the trends of the frequency resolved wave power and directionally resolved wave power which are portions of the total wave power within discrete peak period and direction bins to calculate the wave power in kw m transmitted by irregular waves using the partitioned wave parameters an approximation considered by the iec standard iec 2015 is used as 1 j n ρ g 16 h s n 2 c g n where j n h s n and c g n is the wave power significant wave height and group velocity of a partition n ρ is the sea water density 1025 k g m 3 and g is the gravity acceleration 9 81 m s 2 the group velocity c g n is defined as 2 c g n 2 π k n 1 2 k n h sinh 2 k n h 1 t e n where the partitioned wave number k n partitioned energy period t e n and water depth h are related through the dispersion equation as 3 2 π t e n 2 g k n t a n h k n h in most previous studies t e has been approximated using a relation t e c t p which is derived from a particular theoretical spectrum when the frequency wave spectrum is unknown the present study uses c 0 86 for wind sea and c 1 0 for swell which is equivalent to pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 and gaussian spectrum ahn et al 2019 the resolved wave power j n is sorted in terms of the partitioned peak period bin t b resolution of 1 s for example t b 1 means 0 s t p 1 s partitioned mean wave direction bin θ b resolution of 10 clockwise from the north and month m for example θ b 1 means 0 θ 10 based on their partitioned peak period t p n and mean direction θ n the resolved inter annual mean wave power j m t b θ b m t is computed as the summation of j n pairs in the cell t b θ b m t divided by the number of hours t y e a r in the corresponding year t as 4 j m t b θ b m t 1 n j n t y e a r where n is the number of j n pairs in the cell t b θ b m t ahn et al 2020a introduced the 4 d wave power matrix in terms of the partitioned peak period direction month and year to characterize the wave energy and calculate the parameters e g peak period and directional spreading seasonal and inter annual variability note that the frequency resolved inter annual mean wave power j m t b t is taken as the summation over the direction and month bins the inter annual mean total omnidirectional wave power j m t is simply a sum of all components in the peak period and direction bins the 30 year mean total wave power j m is simply the mean of the j m t 2 3 energy spreading indices as wecs and wec arrays need to resonate at the frequency of the incident waves and to align normal to the predominant wave direction to maximize energy absorption the characteristics and trends of the energy spreading in both the peak period and direction need to be assessed therefore we compute the peak period spreading and directionality coefficient of the inter annual mean total wave power as well as the spreading indices of the 30 year mean total wave power these indices were introduced by ahn et al 2020a as summary metrics for these wave energy resource attributes 2 3 1 peak period spreading ε j the spectral width as a measure of the relative frequency spreading of the energy spectrum recommended by the iec standard iec 2015 is parameterized in this study as the relative spread of the inter annual mean total wave power over the peak period and computed as 5 ε j t t b j m t b t t b t b 2 j m t b t t b t b j m t b t 2 1 where t b and θ b is the peak period bins and direction bins as defined above and ε j t is the peak period spreading of the j m t in a particular year t the peak period spreading of the 30 year mean total wave power ε is computed by applying j m t b to eq 5 a small value indicates the wave energy exhibits a narrow peak period spreading typical values for wave energy climates in us coastal waters vary from 0 1 to 0 4 2 3 2 directionality coefficient d j the directionality coefficient as a measure of the characteristic direction of the wave iec 2015 is parameterized in this study as the spreading of the inter annual mean total wave power over the wave direction the directionally resolved j m t j m t α passing through a vertical plane with the normal vector in direction α is computed by adding each component of the j m θ b t resolved in the direction α as 6 j m t α θ b j m θ b t c o s α θ b δ the parameter α has a resolution of 10 ranging from 0 to 360 clockwise from the north the δ is 1 c o s α θ b 0 or 0 c o s α θ b 0 to ensure that only positive valued component contribute to j m t α these parameters adopt definitions recommended by the iec standard iec 2015 the directionality coefficient of the inter annual mean total wave power ratio of the maximum value of j m t α to the j m t is computed as 7 d j t m a x j m t α j m t the directionality coefficient of the 30 year mean total wave power d j is computed by applying j m θ b and j m α to eqs 6 and 7 a large value indicates the wave energy exhibits a narrow directional spreading typical values for wave climates in us coastal waters vary from 0 5 to 0 9 2 3 3 seasonal variability m v j the seasonal variability of the wave power is parameterized as a ratio of the maximum range of monthly mean wave power to the annual mean value cornett 2008 as 8 m v j t m a x j m m t t y e a r t m m i n j m m t t y e a r t m j m t where m is the month and t m is the length of the data for each month the seasonal variability of the 30 year mean total wave power m v j is computed by applying j m m to eq 8 a large value indicates the wave power exhibits a large seasonal variability typical values for wave climates in us coastal waters vary from 1 0 to 2 0 2 4 linear trend parameters to access the trends of these wave climate parameters j m t b t j m θ b t ε j t d j t and m v j t the 30 year nonstationary trends are calculated using a linear function x a t b ε where x is inter annual variables a is a slope of the trend b is the intercept and ε is a disturbance term we assess the trend of the inter annual parameters j m t b t j m θ b t j m t ε j t d j t and m v j t as the respective slopes a j t b a j θ b a j in kw m year and a ε a d a m v in 1 year for example a j 7 s is the trend of the frequency resolved inter annual mean wave power within t b 7 s 6 s t p 7 s the percent changes of these inter annual parameters p j t b p j θ b p j p ε p d p m v in year are computed and mapped as the slope a normalized by the 30 year mean value for example p j 7 s is a j 7 s j m 7 s 100 in section 3 the historical wave energy climate trends and spreading and seasonal variability characteristics that are statistically significant at the 95 level are presented as the linear increase or decrease in the inter annual mean relative to the 30 year mean values as the percent change p in year the resource parameters evaluated in the present study are listed in table 2 3 results 3 1 total omnidirectional wave power trends the geographical distribution of the 30 year mean total wave power j m is shown in fig 1 a in general the offshore wave power is more energetic than nearshore due to the increase in wave energy dissipation shoreward the largest energy with j m exceeding 40 kw m is found along the west coast aleutian trench and the gulf of alaska the california coast has moderate wave energy compared to those along the pacific northwest coast the hawaiian coast has slightly lower j m compared to those along the west coast on the order of 20 kw m the j m along the east coast and atlantic ocean side of puerto rico are generally below 10 kw m the lowest wave energy excluding arctic alaska is found in the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea side of puerto rico with j m below 5 kw m the inter annual mean total wave power j m t at sample buoy stations 46026 west coast 51001 hawaiian islands 42040 gulf of mexico and 44025 east coast are presented in fig 1 a values of j m t computed from the buoy spectral measurements over 14 years allow comparison with those computed from the wwiii model these are the only ndbc stations within the eez with spectral measurements over an extensive period spanning fourteen years 1996 2009 within the study period for the alaska and puerto rico coastal regions no spectral measurements with similar attributes are available as the model did not generate outputs at station 51001 hawaii output at the grid point closest to station 51001 is used the linear trendlines for j m t show the average rate of change of j m t over the por but significant oscillations about the trendlines are observed especially at the gulf of mexico buoy location where the subtropical jet stream generated during typical enso events impacted coastal waters in the southeast us kennedy et al 2007 bromirski et al 2013 reported that the oscillations observed at the pacific ocean were caused by warm and cool phases of pacific decadal oscillations pdo the oscillations normalized by their mean wave power are less significant at stations 46026 and 51001 compared to those for station 42040 linear correlation coefficients are 0 90 at 42026 0 93 at 51001 0 80 at 42040 and 0 88 at 44025 the j m t gradually decreased at stations 42026 and 51001 over the 30 year por the trend at station 42026 indicates a j 0 13 kw m year p j 0 67 year which is close to the decrease in mean significant wave heights approximately 0 5 year found by young et al 2011 at stations 42040 and 44025 the j m t increased with a j 0 04 kw m year and 0 02 kw m year p j 1 3 year and 0 5 year which are consistent with approximately 1 2 year and 0 5 year trends for the total wave power found by reguero et al 2019 for these locations to describe regional variations of the trends of the inter annual mean total omnidirectional wave power geographic distributions p j in year which are statistically significant at the 95 level are presented in fig 1 c this analysis shows that the inter annual mean total wave power changed gradually over the 30 year por decreased by 0 5 to 1 0 year for the majority of coastal waters in the pacific ocean more pronounced rates of change are observed in northern segments along the alaska coast the southern coast of california and the southern coastline segments of puerto rico and hawaii where the total wave power decreased by over 0 5 year and the waters in northern segments along alaska and the central gulf of mexico coasts where it increased by 1 0 year the trends for most regions of the east coast were not significant except for waters near station 44025 detailed mechanisms of the overall trends shown in fig 1 are described in section 3 2 as seen in table 1 the previous studies tend to show opposite trends for coastal waters in the pacific ocean depending on the duration of the sample data used in the studies por dependencies of the trends computed using the wwiii hindcast at four buoy stations are illustrated in fig 2 trends of the inter annual mean total omnidirectional wave power a j in kw m year are shown in terms of a start year y axis and the number of years or por x axis for example for each plot the top left bin indicates the a j from 2000 to 2009 and the bottom right bin indicates the a j from 1980 to 2009 while relatively short durations e g por less than twenty years have temporal variabilities in the total wave power trends longer por exceeding twenty years tend to have consistent trends at four buoy stations the negative trends at stations 46026 a and 51001 b and the positive trends at stations 42040 c and 44025 d these observations show that results in the present study are independent of por and the start date because they exceed twenty years of data 3 2 trends in the frequency resolved and directionally resolved wave power at these four buoy stations analysis of the 30 year historical trend rates of the inter annual mean frequency and direction resolved wave power modeled a j t b and a j θ b reveal specific wave systems responsible for these observed trends as shown in fig 3 the negative trends temporal rate of change of the total omnidirectional wave power a j at stations 46026 and 51001 shown in fig 1 were due to decreases in the wave power at these locations by long period swells ranging from 12 to 15 s traveling from the west 240 270 at station 46026 and the northwest 290 320 at station 51001 the wave power within short period swells ranging from 7 to 9 s from the east 90 110 at station 51001 increased but the wave power contributions of wave systems in this frequency direction range were relatively insignificant the positive total wave power trends a j at stations 42040 and 44025 shown in fig 1 were due to increasing wave power by long period swells 12 14 s between 130 and 150 at station 42040 and increasing wave power by short period swells 8 10 s between 160 and 180 at station 44025 to investigate regional historic trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power i e the wave power resolved by peak period and directional

180 180 θ 270 270 θ 360 are defined based on the distinct regional trends shown in fig 3 the resolved inter annual mean wave power for each of the bands are calculated by summing the wave power components within each band the geographic distribution of the resolved 30 year mean wave power for each of the four peak period bands j m t b a n d s in kw m is shown in fig 4 a d along with the historic trend rate p j t b a n d s in year in fig 4 e h in fig 5 similar maps show the geographic distribution of the resolved wave power in these four direction bands j m θ b a n d s along with the historic trend rates p j θ b a n d s using the j m t b a n d s and j m θ b a n d s the dominant resource bands contributing the largest portions of energy to the total omnidirectional wave power are identified for six coastal regions including alaska the west hawaii the gulf of mexico the east coast and puerto rico historical trends for the wave systems in these dominant resource bands which reflect the wave climate are evaluated in the context of commensurate wind climate trends for alaska most of the wave power in the bering sea is distributed within two frequency bands in the 6 12 s range fig 4 b and c and three direction bands in the 0 270 range fig 5 a c among these resources wave power decreased in the 6 9 s band between 0 and 90 approximately 1 0 year fig 4 f and fig 5 e for the aleutian islands and the gulf of alaska most of the wave power is within the 9 15 s band fig 4 c and d between 90 and 270 fig 5 b and c along the northeast pacific ocean side among these resources the wave power in swells generated by north pacific westerlies and the aleutian low pressure system ahn 2019 decreased in the 9 15 s band between 90 and 180 approximately 1 5 year fig 4 g and h and fig 5 f according to reguero et al 2019 total omnidirectional wave power from 1985 to 2008 decreased approximately 1 year in the north pacific due to reduced contributions from swells emanating from other ocean sub basins the oceanic warming in the different basins increased global mean wave power due to the inﬂuence of sea surface temperature on wind climates except for the north pacific reguero et al 2019 2015 young et al 2011 the swells generated by the aleutian low pressure system during winter reduced as the north pacific high pressure system was blocked by the intensified pacific jet stream and moved closer to hawaii vitousek et al 2009 reductions in ice due to global warming increased wave power in the arctic by over 2 0 year by short period waves fig 4 e the wave power along the west coast is within the 9 15 s swells fig 4 c and d between 180 and 360 fig 5 c and d the wave power of swells generated by the north pacific westerlies ahn 2019 during winter decreased in the 12 15 s band between 180 and 270 approximately 1 5 year fig 4 h and fig 5 g reguero et al 2015 found that a southward shifted and intensified pacific jet stream generates waves from east to west within the north pacific and decreased the swells that reach the west coast for hawaii the wave power is broadly distributed in all period bands except for the waves shorter than 6 s fig 3 b d ahn 2019 reported that the wave energy resource for this region originates from two dominant wave systems 8 10 s swells between 40 and 100 generated by the trade winds and 13 15 s swells between 300 and 360 generated by the north pacific storms like the west coast the wave power in the north pacific swells decreased approximately 1 0 year fig 4 g and h and fig 5 h the wave power in the trade wind swells however increased approximately 0 5 year fig 4 f and fig 5 f as the north pacific high pressure system which was shifted towards the equator intensified the trade winds near hawaii vitousek et al 2009 in the gulf of mexico the 6 9 s waves between 90 and 180 contain the most wave energy for this region ahn 2019 and exhibited no significant energy trends fig 4 f although the 12 15 s swells generated by atlantic basin cyclones have less wave power fig 4 d wave power increased more than 3 0 year fig 4 h according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the occurrence of the atlantic basin cyclones increased by 100 during the same 30 year por national hurricane center 2020 for the east coast the wave power is broadly distributed between 0 and 270 fig 5 a c ahn 2019 reported that the wave power in this region consists of two dominant wave systems 9 11 s swells between 40 and 100 generated by nor easters and 8 10 s swells between 80 and 140 generated by trade winds or bermuda high pressure system the wave power in nor easter swells decreased approximately 1 0 year fig 5 a because the frequency of occurrence and wave height of storms generated by the nor easters decreased from 1988 to 2009 as the waters cool late in fall and early winter u va dept of environmental sciences 2010 the wave power in trade wind swells increased approximately 1 0 year due to the overall increase in the intensity of the north atlantic trade winds young et al 2011 these opposite trends offset each other and balance the energy trends for the east coast except for the mid atlantic coast where positive trends in trade wind swells dominate over negative trends in nor easter swells for puerto rico most of the wave power is between 6 and 12 s fig 4 b and c and between 0 and 180 fig 5 a and b three wave systems contribute to the total omnidirectional wave power for this region 10 12 s swells between 340 and 40 generated by nor easters 7 9 s swells between 20 and 80 generated by trade winds 5 7 s waves between 80 and 140 generated by atlantic tropical storms ahn 2019 like the east coast the wave power of nor easter swells decreased 0 5 year approximated by fig 4 h and fig 5 h and trade wind swells increased 0 5 year figs 4 f and fig 5 e at the atlantic ocean side coast as the bermuda high pressure system moved eastward by 0 511 year from 1990 to 2014 wang et al 2016 tropical storms migrated northward and the number of storms passing through puerto rico reduced leading to decreases in wave power of approximately 1 0 year fig 4 e and fig 5 f the wave power along the atlantic side of puerto rico consists of nor easter swells and trade wind swells where opposite energy trends offset each other because the wave power along the caribbean sea side of puerto rico is predominated by the waves generated by tropical storms whose power decreased the total omnidirectional wave power decreased in this region 3 3 trends in energy spreading indices as shown in section 3 2 historical trends in the frequency and directionally resolved wave power vary geographically with some regions experiencing greater rates of change than others and some regions experiencing little or no significant change in this section historical trends in the spreading characteristics of energy are examined these spreading characteristics can be assessed with the simple summary indices peak period spreading ε j directionality coefficient d j and seasonal variability m v j of the 30 year mean total wave power the mean values for these indices are mapped in fig 6 a c historical trends in the peak period spreading directionality coefficient and seasonal variability of the inter annual mean total wave power are assessed by estimating and mapping the rate that these spreading indices change over time with p ε p d and p m v values in year fig 6 d f the historic mean peak period spreading ε j ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 for all us wave climates the lowest values indicating a narrow banded peak period spread for the total wave power are observed for the gulf of alaska and pacific northwest coast with ε j 0 2 fig 6 a relatively large values are observed for all remaining regions including ε j 0 3 for hawaii and the east coast the largest peak period spreading ε j 0 3 is observed along the central coast of the gulf of mexico for hawaii the energy distributions are bi modal with two separate frequency peaks but for each peak the period spreading index is the same ahn et al 2020a the historical trends linear or average rate of change in the peak period spreading p ε vary geographically ranging from 1 0 to 0 8 year as shown in fig 6 d peak period spreading generally increased for all regions except for the arctic region of alaska where it decreased approximately 1 0 year and the east coast where it remained constant the largest increases were found along the central gulf of mexico coast approximately 0 8 year the hawaiian coast approximately 0 6 year and along the gulf of alaska and pacific northwest coast approximately 0 4 year in the north pacific ocean the peakedness of the energy distribution over the frequency was reduced as the energy contribution by long period north pacific swells the dominant wave systems decreased for hawaii the peakedness was further reduced as the energy contribution of the secondary wave system shorter period trade wind swells increased for the central coast of the gulf of mexico increased contributions from tropical storm swells caused another frequency peak to form at the long period range which significantly increased the peak period spreading for the arctic region of alaska increased contributions from short period waves which contribute the largest energy to the total omnidirectional wave power for this region increased the peakedness of the frequency spectrum and resulted in a decrease in the peak period spreading the historic mean directionality coefficient d j ranged from 0 4 to 0 95 for all us wave climates in general the total wave power in coastal regions offshore exhibits small directionality coefficients large directional spreading compared to nearshore regions ahn et al 2020b as shown in fig 6 b the total wave power along the west coast and caribbean sea side of puerto rico exhibits the largest directionality coefficient narrowest directional spreading among us coastal waters with d j 0 9 the energy distributions for the east coast and hawaiian coast which are bi modal with two separate directional peaks exhibit relatively small directionality coefficients with d j 0 6 compared to the west coast the historical trends in the directionality coefficient p d vary geographically ranging from 0 8 to 0 6 year as shown in fig 6 e the directionality coefficient generally remained constant except for hawaii and the east coast for hawaii decreased north pacific swells and increased trade wind swells caused counteracting trends for directional spreading in the northern sub region 0 6 year and southern region 0 6 year north pacific swells contained larger energy than trade wind swells for the northern subregion at the beginning of the 30 year por on the other hand these two wave systems contributed equally to the total omnidirectional wave power in the southern sub region over the same period for the east coast opposite trends in the two dominant wave systems caused different trends in directional spreading in the northern subregion 0 6 year and southern subregion 0 8 year nor easter swells decreased while trade wind or bermuda high pressure system swells increased the historical mean seasonal variability m v j ranged from 1 0 to 2 0 the lowest values indicating a low seasonal variability for the total wave power are observed for the california coast and east coast with m v j 1 0 fig 6 c relatively large values are observed for hawaii and the pacific northwest coast with m v j 1 5 the largest seasonal variability m v j 2 0 is observed along the northern alaskan coast the historical trends in the seasonal variability p m v vary geographically ranging from 2 0 to 2 0 year as shown in fig 6 f the seasonal variability increased for southern alaska approximately 1 5 year the pacific northwest coast approximately 1 0 year the central gulf of mexico approximately 2 0 year and the caribbean sea side of puerto rico approximately 1 0 year the seasonal variability decreased for arctic alaska approximately 1 5 year the eastern and western gulf of mexico approximately 2 0 year and subregions of the east coast approximately 1 0 year in the north pacific ocean the wave power was more focused in the winter than summer ahn et al 2020a where the decreased summer wave power by the north pacific high pressure system increases the seasonal variability for this region the wave power in the central gulf of mexico was more focused in the summer ahn et al 2020a than the winter where the increased summer wave power supplied by the tropical storm swells caused an increase in the seasonal variability the wave power along the caribbean sea side of puerto rico was evenly distributed year round ahn et al 2020a where the decreased winter wave power supplied by nor easters caused an increase in the seasonal variability the reductions in ice in arctic alaska caused a decrease in the seasonal variability unlike the central gulf of mexico the wave power along the eastern and western coasts of the gulf was more focused in the winter than the summer ahn et al 2020a where the increased summer wave power supplied by the tropical storm swells caused a decrease in the seasonal variability in the coastline promontory subregions of the east coast e g cape cod ny and cape hatteras nc the wave power was more focused in the winter than the summer ahn et al 2020a where the decreased winter wave power supplied by nor easters caused a decrease in the seasonal variability 4 summary and discussion except for the east coast the observed trends in the total omnidirectional wave power observed herein are generally consistent with the trends found by reguero et al 2015 who used a 28 year similar por global hindcast from wwiii with a spatial resolution of 1 5 by 1 0 although the present study found that the total wave power for the east coast increased like reguero et al 2015 this trend was not significant at the 95 level the observed trends in the wave energy climates for regions in the north pacific ocean were due in part to the alteration of the pacific jet stream caused by climate change kennedy et al 2007 reguero et al 2015 vitousek et al 2009 this alteration diminished the total omnidirectional wave power by approximately 0 5 to 1 0 year for these regions the southward shifted and intensified pacific jet stream moved the north pacific high pressure system and aleutian low pressure system southward resulting in many of the observed changes to the dominant wave systems supplying most of the energy to these regions decreased swells 1 0 year generated by the aleutian low pressure system reaching the aleutian trench and the gulf of alaska decreased swells from westerlies 1 5 year that reach the west coast by blocking swells emanating from other ocean sub basins decreased the north pacific swells 1 0 year and increased swells from trade winds 0 5 year that reach the hawaiian coast the observed trends in wave energy climates for the east coast puerto rico and the gulf of mexico were due in part to changes in nor easters and the bermuda high pressure system caused by climate change u va dept of environmental sciences 2010 wang et al 2016 these changes result in positive trends in the total omnidirectional wave power for the gulf of mexico 1 3 year and the negative trends for the caribbean sea side of puerto rico 0 5 year as the waters cool late in fall and early winter the frequency of occurrence and the wave heights of storms generated by nor easters decreased this change decreased the wave energy in the nor easter swells 0 5 year for the east coast and the atlantic side of puerto rico as the bermuda high moved eastward by 0 511 year from 1990 to 2014 the wave energy in the trade wind swells that reach the east coast and the atlantic side of puerto rico increased 0 5 year these opposite trends offset each other in these regions due in part to the shifted bermuda high the atlantic tropical storms migrated northward and the number of storms passing through puerto rico decreased while those passing through the gulf of mexico increased these changes decreased the wave energy in the short period waves 1 0 year for the caribbean sea side of puerto rico and increased the wave energy in the long period swells 3 0 year for the gulf of mexico the peak period spreading of the total wave power increased along the west coast 0 4 year pacific ocean side of the aleutian trench 0 4 year hawaiian coast 0 6 year and central gulf of mexico coast 0 8 year while the directionality coefficient of the total wave power decreased for the northern region of the hawaiian coast 0 6 year and the southern region of the east coast 0 6 year it increased for the southern region of the hawaiian coast 0 6 year and the northern region of the east coast 0 8 year the seasonal variability of the total wave power increased for southern alaska 1 5 year the pacific northwest 1 0 year the central gulf of mexico 2 0 year and the caribbean sea side of puerto rico 1 0 year while it decreased for the eastern and western gulf of mexico 2 0 year and some subregions of east coast 1 0 year e g cape cod ny and cape hatteras nc assuming these trends observed herein continue in the future wecs targeting long period swells for energy generation along the pacific ocean coasts would experience diminishing energy resources due to relatively high seasonal variability and its increasing trend along the pacific northwest coast an energy project in this region may experience reduced capacity factor a ratio of the actual energy production to its rated full power over an operational time period in the future in the same scenario wecs targeting short period swells along the hawaiian coast may benefit from increasing wave energy resources although no significant changes in the total omnidirectional wave power are expected for coastal waters along the north atlantic ocean based on this scenario directionally dependent wecs targeting resources within particular directions may consider the positive energy trends in trade wind or bermuda high pressure system swells and negative energy trends in nor easter swells to orient the device note that energy projects along the northern east coast would experience fewer directional constraints for energy generation compared to the southern east coast based on this scenario long period swells in the gulf of mexico which contribute relatively little energy for this region will increase potentially leading to an increase in costs for operation and maintenance o m and for survival of wecs tuned to short period waves the methodology presented in the present study can be applied in future efforts to investigate these same non stationary wave energy climate trends for shallow nearshore regions using the ultra high resolution wave hindcasts e g allahdadi et al 2019 yang et al 2020 which have been shown to significantly reduce model error compared to the relatively coarse resolution model hindcast data sources that have thus far been used for these investigations 5 conclusions using the partitioned wave parameters obtained from the wavewatch iii wwiii version 5 05 30 year 1980 2009 hindcast the 30 year nonstationary trends of the total omnidirectional wave power frequency resolved wave power directionally resolved wave power frequency and directional spreading and seasonal variability indices are investigated for coastal waters in the us the historical trends in the total and resolved wave power for different coastal regions are investigated in the context of the dominant wave systems of the energy resource and trends in wind climates historical trends in important wave climate attributes including peak period spreading directional spreading and seasonal variability of the wave power are also examined total wave power trends are consistent with other studies but the present study identifies regions and specific frequency and direction bands where significant changes have occurred and therefore warrant reconsideration of design practices for ocean and coastal engineering projects that assume wave climates are stationary for some regions changes to wave climate parameters exceeded one percent annually a 1 year increase or decrease results in approximately 30 change over the historical record which is significant future wave climate and energy resource trends may be discerned by examining global climate model forecasts that predict the following non stationary processes e g the pacific jet stream intensity and migration the bermuda high migration and temperature changes in the north atlantic ocean under various carbon reduction

21508,there have been many articles contributed to the finite element modeling for the dynamic analysis of monopile offshore wind turbine owt systems however the accuracy of the parameter values used in the finite element model has always been a major concern mathematically the design and analysis based on a finite element model is classified as a forward problem while correcting the parameter values of the baseline finite element model based on measured response data is an inverse problem this paper is the first article devoted to the concurrent correction of parameter values of both soil structure interface and damping of a monpile owt based on measured response data while adopting a lumped parameter model lpm which consists of one rotational spring one horizontal spring and one rotational dashpot for the soil structure interface and a rayleigh damping model for the energy loss of the tower substructure this study develops a novel method for simultaneously updating the rayleigh damping coefficients and soil structure interface stiffness damping parameters based on only a few measured natural frequencies and damping ratios in the numerical studies computer simulations with the national renewable energy laboratory 5 mw nrel 5 mw reference turbine are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method keywords offshore wind turbines soil structure interface rayleigh damping model updating data availability the following items are available from the corresponding author by request monopiled offshore wind turbine models built by ansys software codes of model updating of rayleigh damping and soil structure interface and data of the numerical studies 1 introduction monopiled offshore wind turbines owts have been the most popular selection for current offshore wind farms fischer et al 2011 as monopiles transfer lateral loads caused by the wind and wave through bending action into the soil the dynamic analysis of the soil structure interaction is deemed necessary especially in soft soils bazeos et al 2002 however the soil structure interface are particularly difficult to estimate due to the non uniformity of soil its complex nonlinear behavior and the difficulty of obtaining detailed site characterization data fontana et al 2015 negro et al 2014 as building a comprehensive finite element fe model that includes both the soil and the structure within one fe package is difficult a reduced soil structure interface model has often been proposed to account for the foundation influence to the entire owt systems wu et al 2019 zaaijer 2006 in addition the energy loss mechanisms of owt structures are not fully understood rezaei et al 2018 shirzadeh et al 2013 consequently on the modeling of monopiled owts the damping of structure and the soil structure interaction are two major sources of modeling error this study adopts a lumped parameter model lpm proposed by a recent article carswell et al 2015 for the soil structure interface and a rayleigh damping model for the energy loss of the tower substructure this lpm consists of one rotational spring one horizontal spring and one rotational dashpot while determining the parameters of the lpm has relied on using specialized softwares such as infidel hansteen 1999 choosing the rayleigh damping coefficients always followed the best engineering judgment even if these parameters coefficients have been carefully determined the computed dynamic response of the owt model is likely to be significantly different from the corresponding measurement of the true system in order to accurately predict the dynamic response of an existing owt it is highly desired to develop a finite element model updating method on correcting the rayleigh damping coefficients and soil structure interface parameters based on the true response measurements many finite element model updating methods for civil and mechanical systems have been developed friswell and mottershead 2013 those methods can be classified into two major groups direct methods and iterative methods one significant merit of iterative methods is that the physical connectivity of the finite element model can be maintained note that most existing iterative methods have been developed based on the preassumption that both the measured modal frequencies and mode shapes were available while the vast majority of the model updating methods were confined to correcting mass and stiffness matrices only a few articles addressed the damping correction pradhan and modak 2017 available methods for damping update followed two distinct approaches 1 simultaneous updating and 2 two stage updating for a two stage method it updated mass and stiffness matrices in the first stage then updated the damping matrix in the second stage brown et al 1997 lin and zhu 2006 min et al 2014 however a two stage method was only suitable to lightly damped structures for simultaneous updating methods all model parameters were updated simultaneously bé liveau 1976 zárate and caicedo 2008 but available simultaneous updating methods always encountered numerical difficulties due to the fact that the order of the damping matrix elements was much smaller than that of the mass and stiffness matrices elements chen et al 1996 on applying the model updating techniques to the soil structure interface previous studies were restricted to the updating of foundation stiffness where the soil structure interface was commonly modeled as foundation springs while a variety of methods teughels and de roeck 2004 el borgi et al 2005 reynders et al 2010 weber and paultre 2009 taciroglu et al 2017 wang 2014 have been proposed for updating the foundation springs almost all methods assumed that both modal frequencies and mode shapes were measured aoki et al 2008 investigated the scenario which did not have measured mode shapes and it concluded that measured mode shapes were essential to achieve good updating results specifically for the model updating in the field of owts only a few articles have been published and those articles have concentrated on updating the stiffness of either structures schröder et al 2016 or blades schröder et al 2018 in other words the study on updating the damping or soil structure interface of owts has never been conducted before the objective of this paper is to develop a method for updating the model parameters including rayleigh damping coefficients and soil structure interface stiffness damping parameters of monopiled owts under the situation that only a few measured natural frequencies and damping ratios are available an iterative procedure is proposed in each iteration it requires to generate measured mode shapes which would be approximated by using the corresponding analytical mode shapes associated with the fe model in turn using the measured natural frequencies damping ratios and the corresponding approximated measured mode shapes one updates the model parameters and then rebuilds the fe model the iteration will continue until a converged solution is achieved this study will conduct computer simulations to verify the proposed method a schematic diagram for the procedures of the numerical implementation is shown in fig 1 a national renewable energy laboratory 5 mw nrel 5 mw reference turbine jonkman et al 2009 is employed in the numerical studies with the measured natural frequencies and damping ratios being synthesized based on a fe model with target rayleigh damping and soil structure interface coefficients as the target model parameters are known the performance of the proposed method can be evaluated objectively 2 mathematical modeling of owt system a sketch of an offshore wind turbine supported by a monopile is shown in fig 2 and the corresponding finite element model utilized in this study is given in fig 3 a following a standard finite element modeling procedure one formulates the equation of motion for the entire owt system as craig and kurdila 2006 1 m u t c u t k u t p t where m c k r n n are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the entire system respectively u t u t u t are the acceleration velocity and displacement vector respectively and p t is the external force vector the mass matrix m consists of three parts the structural mass matrix m s associated with the tower and substructure the mass matrix m t associated with rotor nacelle assembly rna and the added hydrodynamic mass matrix m a i e 2 m m s m t m a while m s can be built by using a standard finite element procedure m t is treated as a lumped mass placed at the tower top and the added hydrodynamic mass matrix m a is modeled through an added density for the substructure both the stiffness matrix k and damping matrix c are separated into their structure and foundation parts namely 3 k k s k f and 4 c c s c f where subscripts s and f stand for the structure and foundation parts respectively for the structure part k s can be formulated through a finite element procedure and c s is assumed to follow the rayleigh damping model 5 c s a 1 m a 2 k s where a 1 and a 2 are two coefficients which are determined from song and su 2017 6 a 1 a 2 2 ω i ω j ω j 2 ω i 2 ω j ω i 1 ω j 1 ω i ζ i ζ j in which ζ i ζ j represent the damping ratios of two selected vibration modes and ω i ω j are their corresponding natural frequencies for the foundation part chosen in this study is a lumped parameter model lpm shown in fig 3 b which consists of one horizontal spring one rotational spring and one rotational dashpot to account for the soil structure interface this simple interface model originally proposed in carswell et al 2015 was numerically reduced from a sophisticated fem based soil pile model essential tasks for determining the parameters of the lpm include 1 the monopile below the mudline is replaced by a rigid segment with an equivalent length l e q which is entirely determined by analyzing the soil pile fe model 2 both the horizontal spring with coefficient k u and the rotational spring with coefficient k θ are located at the bottom of the rigid segment the values of k u and k θ are iteratively determined by balancing the mudline shear force and moment 3 the viscous rotational dashpot with coefficient c θ is placed at the mudline and c θ is

that the measured mode shapes are approximated by their corresponding analytical mode shapes namely ϕ j ϕ j then the correction factors could be computed by the procedure presented earlier shown in eqs 18 36 afterwards a new fe model can be built based on the newly updated model parameters the same process is repeated until all correction factors have converged mathematically the number of equations measurements must be greater than or equal to the number of unknowns updated parameters to have a solution as three damping and two stiffness parameters are to be updated at least three measured complex frequencies i e 6 independent measurements must be provided for obtaining a unique solution 5 numerical studies the model selected for the numerical investigation is the nrel 5 mw reference turbine its detailed information was reported in jonkman et al 2009 the essential dimensions and properties of the reference turbine are listed in table 1 the following numerical studies include the numerical verification of the proposed method and the solvability under various initial discrepancies throughout the numerical studies the unit system is mks meter kilogram second system for conciseness explicit units for quantities are omitted in the presentation 5 1 analytical baseline model the finite element package ansys stolarski et al 2018 has been utilized to build the owt model which consists of 10 beam elements for the tower and 5 beam elements for the substructure see fig 3 all beam elements are made of elastic material with young s modulus e 2 1 1 0 11 and poisson ratio ν 0 3 the mass density ρ 8500 encompasses the additional mass of paint flanges bolts etc the lumped mass placed at the tower top m t 3 5 1 0 5 accounts for the mass of the blades and rotor nacelle assembly added hydrodynamic mass density ρ a 900 which is determined from a simplified formula developed in goyal and chopra 1989 while considering the hydrodynamic effect of both outside and inside water is incorporated in the owt substructure to represent the hydrodynamic interaction effects for the rayleigh damping of the baseline model a 1 and a 2 are taken to be 0 0168 and 0 0059 respectively these values have been computed based on eq 6 with ω 1 1 6179 ω 2 1 7539 and ζ 1 ζ 2 1 note that ω 1 and ω 2 are the first two modal frequencies of the structure part they are also the first modal frequency in the x and y directions respectively the parameters for the foundation model have followed carswell et al 2015 including l e q 7 6 k u 3 89 1 0 9 k θ 1 14 1 0 11 and c θ 9 34 1 0 8 carrying out the eigenanalysis for the baseline model one would obtain its complex frequencies and the corresponding complex modes as the direction of the foundation horizontal spring is in the x direction only the complex modes dominant in the x direction are sensitive to the variation of the foundation parameters table 2 lists the angular natural frequencies ω j damping ratios ζ j and eigenvalues λ j of the first four analytical modes dominant in the x direction 5 2 synthesized target model and model updating the synthesized target model is built from the same fe model but with different values of k u k θ c θ a 1 and a 2 which are listed in table 3 also listed in table 3 is the relative error between the target and baseline models here the relative error is defined as the target value minus the baseline value then normalized by its baseline value since the baseline model which is from carswell et al 2015 has been built from the best available knowledge the system parameters errors between the baseline and the target models are likely moderate in this study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method large errors for the system parameters are intentionally chosen particularly a very large relative error for c θ is chosen in view of its high uncertainty through the eigenanalysis of the target model the measured angular natural frequencies ω j damping ratios ζ j and eigenvalues λ j of the first four modes dominant in the x direction are computed see table 4 to implement the proposed model updating method one follows the flowchart shown in fig 4 the extraction for k 1 k 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 see eqs 16 and 17 could be easily done numerically from the baseline model using only the first three measured eigenvalues λ j one obtains the correction factors α 1 and α 2 shown in fig 5 and β 1 β 2 and β 3 shown in fig 6 all five correction factors converge to their target values within 600 iterations in other words the estimated k u k θ c θ a 1 and a 2 by the proposed method match perfectly with the preset target values two interesting phenomena are seen in figs 5 and 6 1 the convergence rates vary for the five updating parameters k u k θ c θ a 1 and a 2 for the stiffness correction the convergence of α 2 is much faster than that of α 1 in other words the correction of k θ is faster than that of k u for the damping correction the correction of c θ is faster than that of a 1 but slower than that of a 2 2 the correction of k u and a 1 i e the values of α 1 and β 2 overshoot significantly in the early iterations to explain these phenomena a sensitivity study has been conducted to investigate the influence of these 5 updating parameters on the first natural frequency and damping ratio as shown in table 2 the first eigenvalue of the baseline model is 0 0104 1 6785 i and the corresponding first natural frequency ω 1 b 2 π and damping ratio ζ 1 b are 0 267149 and 0 62 respectively five scenarios are carried out in each scenario the value of one of the five updating parameters increases 50 but keeping the other four parameters unchanged table 5 shows the result of the first natural frequency ω 1 2 π and damping ratio ζ 1 comparing the influence of the two foundation springs k θ and k u on the natural frequency one concludes that k θ is much more influential than k u similarly observing the effect of the damping parameters c θ a 1 and a 2 on the damping ratio one finds that c θ is more influential than a 1 but less influential than a 2 indeed the influential degree among the 5 updating parameters on the modal information matches well with the convergence rate among the corresponding correction factors for the five updating parameters k u and a 1 have the least influence on the measured modal frequency and damping respectively as small changes of k θ c θ and a 2 may result in large adjustments of k u and a 1 overshoot phenomena of k u and a 1 thus occur table 5 also reveals that the change of k θ value would alter not only the fundamental frequency ω 1 but also its corresponding damping ratio ζ 1 likewise the change of c θ value would affect both ω 1 and ζ 1 these revelations agree well with the well documented knowledge that the natural frequencies of systems with a non classical damping matrix are not the same as the corresponding undamped frequencies ewins 2000 therefore one concludes that the stiffness and damping matrices must be updated simultaneously in order to get accurate updating results while at least 3 measured complex frequencies are required in the proposed method using 4 measured complex frequencies can improve the computational efficiency namely reducing the number of iterations when 4 measured complex frequencies are utilized shown in figs 7 and 8 are the iterative results of α 1 α 2 and β 1 β 2 β 3 respectively comparing fig 7 with figs 5 and fig 8 with fig 6 one observes that the number of iterations has reduced from 600 to 120 thus it is recommended to use as many measured complex frequencies as possible while implementing the proposed method 5 3 initial error effect similar to other iterative methods the efficiency of the proposed method would be affected by the initial guess of the unknown parameters to demonstrate the solvability unsolvability of the proposed method under different levels of the initial error a case with higher initial error is considered let the 5 updating parameters of the synthesized target model all increase by 50 from the target model described in section 5 2 listed in table 6 are the baseline and target values of the 5 updating parameters together with the corresponding relative errors for this target model the first four measured angular natural frequencies ω j damping ratios ζ j and eigenvalues λ j of the modes dominant in the x direction are listed in table 7 when the proposed method uses the first three measured complex frequencies it turns out that the solution diverges however when the first four measured complex frequencies are utilized all five updating parameters converge perfectly to their target values with 150 iterations see fig 9 for α 1 and α 2 and fig 10 for β 1 β 2 and β 3 overall larger initial errors could be tolerated when more measured complex frequencies were provided 6 concluding remarks contrary to many articles that have focused on forward problems relevant to analyses and or designs of monopiled offshore wind turbine owt systems this paper was devoted to solving an inverse problem for concurrently correcting the parameter values of both the soil structure interface and damping of a monopile owt system after having adopted a lumped parameter model lpm for characterizing the soil structure interface of a monopiled owt and a rayleigh damping model for the energy loss of the structure this study attempted to correct 5 stiffness damping model parameters including 3 foundation stiffness damping parameters and 2 rayleigh damping coefficients under the assumption that only three or four natural frequencies and damping ratios were measured an iterative method for updating these 5 model parameters simultaneously was developed the excellent performance of the proposed method was demonstrated through computer simulations for updating two stiffness and three damping coefficients at least three measured complex frequencies were necessary when four measured complex frequencies were utilized the performance of proposed method improved in the convergence rate of the iterative procedure as well as in the tolerance to the initial errors credit authorship

21508,there have been many articles contributed to the finite element modeling for the dynamic analysis of monopile offshore wind turbine owt systems however the accuracy of the parameter values used in the finite element model has always been a major concern mathematically the design and analysis based on a finite element model is classified as a forward problem while correcting the parameter values of the baseline finite element model based on measured response data is an inverse problem this paper is the first article devoted to the concurrent correction of parameter values of both soil structure interface and damping of a monpile owt based on measured response data while adopting a lumped parameter model lpm which consists of one rotational spring one horizontal spring and one rotational dashpot for the soil structure interface and a rayleigh damping model for the energy loss of the tower substructure this study develops a novel method for simultaneously updating the rayleigh damping coefficients and soil structure interface stiffness damping parameters based on only a few measured natural frequencies and damping ratios in the numerical studies computer simulations with the national renewable energy laboratory 5 mw nrel 5 mw reference turbine are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method keywords offshore wind turbines soil structure interface rayleigh damping model updating data availability the following items are available from the corresponding author by request monopiled offshore wind turbine models built by ansys software codes of model updating of rayleigh damping and soil structure interface and data of the numerical studies 1 introduction monopiled offshore wind turbines owts have been the most popular selection for current offshore wind farms fischer et al 2011 as monopiles transfer lateral loads caused by the wind and wave through bending action into the soil the dynamic analysis of the soil structure interaction is deemed necessary especially in soft soils bazeos et al 2002 however the soil structure interface are particularly difficult to estimate due to the non uniformity of soil its complex nonlinear behavior and the difficulty of obtaining detailed site characterization data fontana et al 2015 negro et al 2014 as building a comprehensive finite element fe model that includes both the soil and the structure within one fe package is difficult a reduced soil structure interface model has often been proposed to account for the foundation influence to the entire owt systems wu et al 2019 zaaijer 2006 in addition the energy loss mechanisms of owt structures are not fully understood rezaei et al 2018 shirzadeh et al 2013 consequently on the modeling of monopiled owts the damping of structure and the soil structure interaction are two major sources of modeling error this study adopts a lumped parameter model lpm proposed by a recent article carswell et al 2015 for the soil structure interface and a rayleigh damping model for the energy loss of the tower substructure this lpm consists of one rotational spring one horizontal spring and one rotational dashpot while determining the parameters of the lpm has relied on using specialized softwares such as infidel hansteen 1999 choosing the rayleigh damping coefficients always followed the best engineering judgment even if these parameters coefficients have been carefully determined the computed dynamic response of the owt model is likely to be significantly different from the corresponding measurement of the true system in order to accurately predict the dynamic response of an existing owt it is highly desired to develop a finite element model updating method on correcting the rayleigh damping coefficients and soil structure interface parameters based on the true response measurements many finite element model updating methods for civil and mechanical systems have been developed friswell and mottershead 2013 those methods can be classified into two major groups direct methods and iterative methods one significant merit of iterative methods is that the physical connectivity of the finite element model can be maintained note that most existing iterative methods have been developed based on the preassumption that both the measured modal frequencies and mode shapes were available while the vast majority of the model updating methods were confined to correcting mass and stiffness matrices only a few articles addressed the damping correction pradhan and modak 2017 available methods for damping update followed two distinct approaches 1 simultaneous updating and 2 two stage updating for a two stage method it updated mass and stiffness matrices in the first stage then updated the damping matrix in the second stage brown et al 1997 lin and zhu 2006 min et al 2014 however a two stage method was only suitable to lightly damped structures for simultaneous updating methods all model parameters were updated simultaneously bé liveau 1976 zárate and caicedo 2008 but available simultaneous updating methods always encountered numerical difficulties due to the fact that the order of the damping matrix elements was much smaller than that of the mass and stiffness matrices elements chen et al 1996 on applying the model updating techniques to the soil structure interface previous studies were restricted to the updating of foundation stiffness where the soil structure interface was commonly modeled as foundation springs while a variety of methods teughels and de roeck 2004 el borgi et al 2005 reynders et al 2010 weber and paultre 2009 taciroglu et al 2017 wang 2014 have been proposed for updating the foundation springs almost all methods assumed that both modal frequencies and mode shapes were measured aoki et al 2008 investigated the scenario which did not have measured mode shapes and it concluded that measured mode shapes were essential to achieve good updating results specifically for the model updating in the field of owts only a few articles have been published and those articles have concentrated on updating the stiffness of either structures schröder et al 2016 or blades schröder et al 2018 in other words the study on updating the damping or soil structure interface of owts has never been conducted before the objective of this paper is to develop a method for updating the model parameters including rayleigh damping coefficients and soil structure interface stiffness damping parameters of monopiled owts under the situation that only a few measured natural frequencies and damping ratios are available an iterative procedure is proposed in each iteration it requires to generate measured mode shapes which would be approximated by using the corresponding analytical mode shapes associated with the fe model in turn using the measured natural frequencies damping ratios and the corresponding approximated measured mode shapes one updates the model parameters and then rebuilds the fe model the iteration will continue until a converged solution is achieved this study will conduct computer simulations to verify the proposed method a schematic diagram for the procedures of the numerical implementation is shown in fig 1 a national renewable energy laboratory 5 mw nrel 5 mw reference turbine jonkman et al 2009 is employed in the numerical studies with the measured natural frequencies and damping ratios being synthesized based on a fe model with target rayleigh damping and soil structure interface coefficients as the target model parameters are known the performance of the proposed method can be evaluated objectively 2 mathematical modeling of owt system a sketch of an offshore wind turbine supported by a monopile is shown in fig 2 and the corresponding finite element model utilized in this study is given in fig 3 a following a standard finite element modeling procedure one formulates the equation of motion for the entire owt system as craig and kurdila 2006 1 m u t c u t k u t p t where m c k r n n are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the entire system respectively u t u t u t are the acceleration velocity and displacement vector respectively and p t is the external force vector the mass matrix m consists of three parts the structural mass matrix m s associated with the tower and substructure the mass matrix m t associated with rotor nacelle assembly rna and the added hydrodynamic mass matrix m a i e 2 m m s m t m a while m s can be built by using a standard finite element procedure m t is treated as a lumped mass placed at the tower top and the added hydrodynamic mass matrix m a is modeled through an added density for the substructure both the stiffness matrix k and damping matrix c are separated into their structure and foundation parts namely 3 k k s k f and 4 c c s c f where subscripts s and f stand for the structure and foundation parts respectively for the structure part k s can be formulated through a finite element procedure and c s is assumed to follow the rayleigh damping model 5 c s a 1 m a 2 k s where a 1 and a 2 are two coefficients which are determined from song and su 2017 6 a 1 a 2 2 ω i ω j ω j 2 ω i 2 ω j ω i 1 ω j 1 ω i ζ i ζ j in which ζ i ζ j represent the damping ratios of two selected vibration modes and ω i ω j are their corresponding natural frequencies for the foundation part chosen in this study is a lumped parameter model lpm shown in fig 3 b which consists of one horizontal spring one rotational spring and one rotational dashpot to account for the soil structure interface this simple interface model originally proposed in carswell et al 2015 was numerically reduced from a sophisticated fem based soil pile model essential tasks for determining the parameters of the lpm include 1 the monopile below the mudline is replaced by a rigid segment with an equivalent length l e q which is entirely determined by analyzing the soil pile fe model 2 both the horizontal spring with coefficient k u and the rotational spring with coefficient k θ are located at the bottom of the rigid segment the values of k u and k θ are iteratively determined by balancing the mudline shear force and moment 3 the viscous rotational dashpot with coefficient c θ is placed at the mudline and c θ is determined through equating energy dissipation detailed procedure on the simplification is referred to carswell et al 2015 while the boundary conditions in the x direction and the rotational θ direction have been specified by the two springs all other directions at the bottom of the rigid segment are assumed to be fixed for convenience one writes the foundation stiffness matrix k f as 7 k f k u k u k θ k θ where k u and k θ are the corresponding submatrices associated with the springs k u and k θ respectively likewise the foundation damping matrix c f is expressed as 8 c f c θ c θ where c θ is the corresponding submatrix associated with the dashpot c θ 3 complex frequencies and modes of an owt system for performing the eigen analysis of the n degrees of freedom n dof owt system from

ratio ν 0 3 the mass density ρ 8500 encompasses the additional mass of paint flanges bolts etc the lumped mass placed at the tower top m t 3 5 1 0 5 accounts for the mass of the blades and rotor nacelle assembly added hydrodynamic mass density ρ a 900 which is determined from a simplified formula developed in goyal and chopra 1989 while considering the hydrodynamic effect of both outside and inside water is incorporated in the owt substructure to represent the hydrodynamic interaction effects for the rayleigh damping of the baseline model a 1 and a 2 are taken to be 0 0168 and 0 0059 respectively these values have been computed based on eq 6 with ω 1 1 6179 ω 2 1 7539 and ζ 1 ζ 2 1 note that ω 1 and ω 2 are the first two modal frequencies of the structure part they are also the first modal frequency in the x and y directions respectively the parameters for the foundation model have followed carswell et al 2015 including l e q 7 6 k u 3 89 1 0 9 k θ 1 14 1 0 11 and c θ 9 34 1 0 8 carrying out the eigenanalysis for the baseline model one would obtain its complex frequencies and the corresponding complex modes as the direction of the foundation horizontal spring is in the x direction only the complex modes dominant in the x direction are sensitive to the variation of the foundation parameters table 2 lists the angular natural frequencies ω j damping ratios ζ j and eigenvalues λ j of the first four analytical modes dominant in the x direction 5 2 synthesized target model and model updating the synthesized target model is built from the same fe model but with different values of k u k θ c θ a 1 and a 2 which are listed in table 3 also listed in table 3 is the relative error between the target and baseline models here the relative error is defined as the target value minus the baseline value then normalized by its baseline value since the baseline model which is from carswell et al 2015 has been built from the best available knowledge the system parameters errors between the baseline and the target models are likely moderate in this study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method large errors for the system parameters are intentionally chosen particularly a very large relative error for c θ is chosen in view of its high uncertainty through the eigenanalysis of the target model the measured angular natural frequencies ω j damping ratios ζ j and eigenvalues λ j of the first four modes dominant in the x direction are computed see table 4 to implement the proposed model updating method one follows the flowchart shown in fig 4 the extraction for k 1 k 2 c 1 c 2 c 3 see eqs 16 and 17 could be easily done numerically from the baseline model using only the first three measured eigenvalues λ j one obtains the correction factors α 1 and α 2 shown in fig 5 and β 1 β 2 and β 3 shown in fig 6 all five correction factors converge to their target values within 600 iterations in other words the estimated k u k θ c θ a 1 and a 2 by the proposed method match perfectly with the preset target values two interesting phenomena are seen in figs 5 and 6 1 the convergence rates vary for the five updating parameters k u k θ c θ a 1 and a 2 for the stiffness correction the convergence of α 2 is much faster than that of α 1 in other words the correction of k θ is faster than that of k u for the damping correction the correction of c θ is faster than that of a 1 but slower than that of a 2 2 the correction of k u and a 1 i e the values of α 1 and β 2 overshoot significantly in the early iterations to explain these phenomena a sensitivity study has been conducted to investigate the influence of these 5 updating parameters on the first natural frequency and damping ratio as shown in table 2 the first eigenvalue of the baseline model is 0 0104 1 6785 i and the corresponding first natural frequency ω 1 b 2 π and damping ratio ζ 1 b are 0 267149 and 0 62 respectively five scenarios are carried out in each scenario the value of one of the five updating parameters increases 50 but keeping the other four parameters unchanged table 5 shows the result of the first natural frequency ω 1 2 π and damping ratio ζ 1 comparing the influence of the two foundation springs k θ and k u on the natural frequency one concludes that k θ is much more influential than k u similarly observing the effect of the damping parameters c θ a 1 and a 2 on the damping ratio one finds that c θ is more influential than a 1 but less influential than a 2 indeed the influential degree among the 5 updating parameters on the modal information matches well with the convergence rate among the corresponding correction factors for the five updating parameters k u and a 1 have the least influence on the measured modal frequency and damping respectively as small changes of k θ c θ and a 2 may result in large adjustments of k u and a 1 overshoot phenomena of k u and a 1 thus occur table 5 also reveals that the change of k θ value would alter not only the fundamental frequency ω 1 but also its corresponding damping ratio ζ 1 likewise the change of c θ value would affect both ω 1 and ζ 1 these revelations agree well with the well documented knowledge that the natural frequencies of systems with a non classical damping matrix are not the same as the corresponding undamped frequencies ewins 2000 therefore one concludes that the stiffness and damping matrices must be updated simultaneously in order to get accurate updating results while at least 3 measured complex frequencies are required in the proposed method using 4 measured complex frequencies can improve the computational efficiency namely reducing the number of iterations when 4 measured complex frequencies are utilized shown in figs 7 and 8 are the iterative results of α 1 α 2 and β 1 β 2 β 3 respectively comparing fig 7 with figs 5 and fig 8 with fig 6 one observes that the number of iterations has reduced from 600 to 120 thus it is recommended to use as many measured complex frequencies as possible while implementing the proposed method 5 3 initial error effect similar to other iterative methods the efficiency of the proposed method would be affected by the initial guess of the unknown parameters to demonstrate the solvability unsolvability of the proposed method under different levels of the initial error a case with higher initial error is considered let the 5 updating parameters of the synthesized target model all increase by 50 from the target model described in section 5 2 listed in table 6 are the baseline and target values of the 5 updating parameters together with the corresponding relative errors for this target model the first four measured angular natural frequencies ω j damping ratios ζ j and eigenvalues λ j of the modes dominant in the x direction are listed in table 7 when the proposed method uses the first three measured complex frequencies it turns out that the solution diverges however when the first four measured complex frequencies are utilized all five updating parameters converge perfectly to their target values with 150 iterations see fig 9 for α 1 and α 2 and fig 10 for β 1 β 2 and β 3 overall larger initial errors could be tolerated when more measured complex frequencies were provided 6 concluding remarks contrary to many articles that have focused on forward problems relevant to analyses and or designs of monopiled offshore wind turbine owt systems this paper was devoted to solving an inverse problem for concurrently correcting the parameter values of both the soil structure interface and damping of a monopile owt system after having adopted a lumped parameter model lpm for characterizing the soil structure interface of a monopiled owt and a rayleigh damping model for the energy loss of the structure this study attempted to correct 5 stiffness damping model parameters including 3 foundation stiffness damping parameters and 2 rayleigh damping coefficients under the assumption that only three or four natural frequencies and damping ratios were measured an iterative method for updating these 5 model parameters simultaneously was developed the excellent performance of the proposed method was demonstrated through computer simulations for updating two stiffness and three damping coefficients at least three measured complex frequencies were necessary when four measured complex frequencies were utilized the performance of proposed method improved in the convergence rate of the iterative procedure as well as in the tolerance to the initial errors credit authorship

21509,laboratory experiments to estimate solitary wave runup were performed on three different planar beaches with slopes of 1 4 1 7 and 1 10 with varying wave heights and water depths the non dimensionalised vertical runup runup over water depth obtained from present laboratory data and several published sources were plotted against the surf similarity parameter best fitting curves could be obtained for maximum runup on slopes ranging from 1 1 to 1 60 against the surf similarity parameter hence an approximate formula is presented for estimation of maximum solitary wave runup on planar beaches of different slopes regardless of whether the waves are breaking or non breaking the proposed empirical equation predicts the overall dataset mostly within 20 scatter for all the laboratory data thus the empirical formula can be used to obtain a quick estimation of maximum runup height for both breaking and non breaking solitary waves in laboratory experiments for disaster risk evaluation of wave runups and to verify numerical model runup results keywords empirical model laboratory study solitary wave surf similarity parameter wave breaking wave runup 1 introduction the estimation of solitary wave runup on plane beaches has been studied in the study of tsunamis generated by rockfalls landslides snow and ice avalanches caving of glaciers and earthquakes fuchs and hager 2015 li and raichlen 2001 synolakis 1987 the runup is defined as the maximum elevation attained by seawater on along the beach above the still water level and as such defines the extent of wave action solitary wave runup solutions are useful for experimental investigations and calibration of runup modules in numerical models despite being widely used to represent tsunamis madsen et al 2008 showed that both the length and time scales of an actual tsunami could not be tied with solitary waves larsen and fuhrman 2019 demonstrated that undular bores with several shorter waves developed at the front of the tsunami did not influence the overall runup of the tsunamis therefore they concluded that solitary wave runup solutions could not be used to evaluate the tsunami impact in the present study an approximate solution for estimating solitary wave runup is presented covering slopes from 1 1 to 1 60 noting that the bathymetry consists of a constant depth region and a planar beach it is demonstrated that the newly defined empirical equation can estimate the runup heights regardless of whether the waves are breaking or non breaking at first the existing solitary wave runup solutions and their limitations of applicability are discussed additional laboratory experiments for breaking and non breaking solitary waves on 1 4 1 7 and 1 10 slopes were performed to enrich the database of runup height data from previously published works then the relationship between the runup heights of solitary waves and corresponding surf similarity parameters is used to derive a unified empirical formula the proposed empirical method is shown to give similar expressions to existing empirical models in the literature finally the conclusions obtained from this study are shown 2 literature review the solitary waves are nonlinear shallow water waveforms which propagate without change of form on constant water depth a solitary wave is characterised by a single crest of height h with an essentially undefined period t and wavelength l as both are infinite the free surface displacement of a solitary wave η for the horizontal coordinate x and time t is given by 1 η h sech 2 k x c t the wavenumber k and wave celerity c can be expressed 2 k 3 h 4 h 3 a n d c g h h here h and g denote the water depth and gravity acceleration respectively the above expressions correspond to the first order solitary wave solution boussinesq 1872 the solitary wave solutions which relate to higher orders can be referred to in the literature see e g fenton 1972 laitone 1960 the effective wavelength and wave period of a solitary wave are 3 l 2 π k a n d t 2 π k c in the literature there are numerous relationships for solitary wave runup based on physical analytical and numerical studies table 1 summarises the existing formulae to estimate solitary wave runups where s is the slope β is the angle of the sloping beach in degrees and g is the gravity acceleration h h l and t are the wave height water depth wavelength and wave period respectively at the toe of a sloping beach r is the maximum vertical runup as shown in fig 1 previous studies have used either r h runup over water depth or r h runup over wave height as the non dimensional parameter to develop solitary wave runup expressions the empirical relationships for solitary wave runup as a function of wave height wavelength water depth and beach slope have been established in the series of laboratory investigations of hall and watts 1953 kaplan 1955 kishi and saeki 1967 saeki et al 1971 synolakis 1987 hsiao et al 2008 lo et al 2013 fuchs and hager 2015 pujara et al 2015 and wu et al 2018 in the study of hall and watts 1953 the runup on the sloping angles β of 5 10 15 25 and 45 corresponding slope s to 1 11 43 1 5 67 1 3 73 1 2 14 and 1 1 respectively was investigated they found relationship for r h concerning h h in correlation with s as functions for two ranges for 5 to 12 degree slopes 1 11 43 s 1 4 76 and 12 to 45 degree slopes 1 4 76 s 1 1 furthermore they expressed relationships for r h versus h h by finding empirical coefficients k and δ 4 r h k h h δ the values of k are 2 15 3 43 3 75 3 35 and 3 1 and the values of δ are 0 81 1 04 1 12 1 12 and 1 15 for beach slopes of 1 11 43 1 5 67 1 3 73 1 2 14 and 1 1 respectively kaplan 1955 used non dimensionalised runup r h and wave steepness h l to develop the empirical relationships for plane slopes of 1 30 and 1 60 kishi and saeki 1967 and saeki et al 1971 expressed the non dimensionalised runup r h as a function of wave height to water depth ratio h h for the slopes of 1 10 1 15 1 20 1 30 1 50 1 100 and 1 150 including the work of hall and watts 1953 and kaplan 1955 they plotted the empirical coefficients k and δ against the slope s in a graph as illustrated in the figures which can be found in kishi and saeki 1967 and saeki et al 1971 kajiura 1984 correlated the solitary wave runups on the various slopes with a single parameter denoted by σ s where s is the slope and σ is a dimensionless number he defined σ by non dimensionalising with t wave period h constant depth and g gravity acceleration 5 σ 2 π t h g hsiao et al 2008 conducted large scale laboratory experiments for breaking solitary waves they used their experimental data to re examine existing formulae and proposed a different formula by regression analysis to predict the maximum non dimensionalised runup r h on a plane beach with slopes ranging from 1 15 to 1 60 they found that the discrepancies of the runup data correlated with similar wave height to depth ratio h h are not significant based on their experimental work on the slope of 1 60 fuchs and hager 2015 conducted experiments for rather steep beach slopes the proposed empirical formula shows the dependency of runup against the beach slope s is very low and higher correlation with the wave height to depth ratio h h the analytical work of non breaking solitary wave runup has been extensively studied by carrier and greenspan 1958 keller and keller 1964 shuto 1967 synolakis 1987 pelinovsky and mazova 1992 li and raichlen 2001 didenkulova et al 2007 and madsen and schaffer 2010 the theoretical work by synolakis 1987 represents a significant achievement by deriving an analytical runup solution for non breaking solitary waves on a bathymetry consisting of a constant depth region and a plane beach 6 r h 2 831 s 0 5 h h 1 25 various extensions for synolakis 1987 s expression can be found in the literature see e g didenkulova et al 2007 fuentes et al 2013 madsen and fuhrman 2008 madsen and schäffer 2010 pujara et al 2015 sriram et al 2016 li and raichlen 2001 improved the synolakis 1987 runup law by adding a correction term based on nonlinear runup hughes 2004 explored wave runup data for solitary waves on plane slopes and presented a different wave runup equation for both breaking and non breaking types by introducing the maximum depth integrated wave momentum flux parameter he derived an expression for wave momentum flux parameter m f where ρ is the density of water g is the gravity acceleration and h is the wave height at a constant water depth h 7 m f ρ g h 2 m a x 1 2 h h 2 2 h h n s 2 2 m s h h 1 tan m s 2 h h 1 1 3 tan 3 m s 2 h h 1 the empirical coefficients m s and n s are given by 8 m s 0 98 tanh 2 24 h h 0 44 9 n s 0 69 tanh 2 38 h h hughes 2004 therefore illustrated the utility of the wave momentum flux parameter for nonperiodic waves such as solitary waves pedersen et al 2013 compared the theoretical and experimental results of maximum runup and concluded that the difference between the theoretical values and experimental values is because of the boundary layer wu et al 2018 compared the maximum runup results obtained by using different slope material wood aluminum plastic plexiglas perspex and concrete and observed that there is no significant influence from the used slope material instead they explained that the major difference between the experimental results of runup might occur due to the size of wave flume in the small scale experiments the boundary layer flows are likely to be laminar in contrast some of the boundary layer flows in the large scale experiments might be in the transition regime according to sumer et al 2010 significant improvements in the modelling of runup have appeared as a result of advancements in both computational techniques and theoretical understandings see review by kirby 2017 some of them are extended to capture the large roughness effect on runup by forests mangroves coral reefs and buildings they have used either a constant roughness model equivalent roughness model drag and inertia forces using morison type equations or macro scale wavelength equations see e g mei et al 2014 tanaka et al 2018 synolakis 1987 and borthwick et al 2006 found non dimensionalised maximum runup r h follows two different regimes for breaking and non breaking solitary waves synolakis 1987 proposed an empirical formula for estimating breaking wave runup by only using h h for the slope of 1 19 85 which appears different from his analytical equation for non breaking solitary waves 10 r h 1 109 h h 0 582 it is obvious that obtaining a relationship as mentioned in eq 4 for the maximum runup by only considering h h for a given beach slope may provide different values for k and δ as it depends on the data chosen for the estimation for example following eq 4 the results of synolakis 1987 for non breaking wave runup show empirical coefficients k and δ as 12 613 and 1 25 for breaking waves i e relatively highly nonlinear waves show empirical coefficients k and δ as 1 109 and 0 582 for the slope of 1 19 85 it is not feasible to find a theoretical solution for the runup of breaking solitary waves over a plane slope because of its complexity the breaking criterion is useful for distinguishing breaking and non breaking regimes as well as identifying the maximum runup limit grilli et al 1997 madsen and fuhrman 2008 madsen and schäffer 2010 synolakis 1987 synolakis 1987 derived an expression for the breaking criterion of solitary waves which is known as the theoretical breaking point 11 h h 0 818 s 10 9 synolakis 1987 observed that waves which were expected to break according to the theoretical breaking criterion deduced by nonlinear shallow water equation theory did not break during the runup of solitary waves in his laboratory experiments this phenomenon was also observed and different wave breaking criteria were proposed by grilli et al 1997 using fully nonlinear potential flow wave model and by pujara et al 2015 analysing previous experimental works grilli et al 1997 introduced the slope parameter s o 12 s o 1 521 s h h 0 5 grilli et al 1997 s guidelines can be used to distinguish breaking types as spilling breaking s o 0 025 plunging breaking 0 025 s o 0 3 surging breaking 0 3 s o 0 37 and non breaking s o 0 37 pujara et al 2015 suggested that the breaking criterion of grilli et al 1997 s o should be 0 4 to 0 5 by observing higher runups in the vicinity of that range the definitions for the wave breaking criterion used by the previous researchers in history can be found from the reviews by peregrine 1983 and robertson et al 2013 the surf similarity parameter battjes 1974 or the iribarren number iribarren and nogales 1949 ξ ir is defined as the slope s over the square root of wave height to wavelength ratio h l ξ ir have been extensively used to express the relationships of the runup heights for regular and random waves on a sloping beach 13 ξ i r s h l similarly by introducing an effective wave period t or an effective wavelength l of a solitary wave into the iribarren number ξ ir kobayashi and karjadi 1994 fuhrman and madsen 2008 lo et al 2013 and wu et al 2018 proposed different surf similarity parameters and correlated with breaking solitary wave runups fuhrman and madsen 2008 expressed a simplified expression for the surf similarity parameter of solitary waves 14 ξ s h h those mentioned above empirical and analytical formulae provide useful knowledge for practical applications but they are mostly limited to either breaking or non breaking waves or to a relatively small number of slopes the same surf similarity parameter ξ s h h was chosen in both analytical solutions proposed by fuhrman and madsen 2008 for non breaking waves and breaking waves hence the surf similarity parameter ξ was utilised in this study to derive a unified formula for the estimation of solitary wave runup over a wide range of sloping beaches regardless of whether the waves were breaking or non breaking 3 laboratory experiments a series of experiments were conducted in a wave flume at hydraulic research laboratory of saitama university to investigate the solitary wave runup the experiments were performed in the flume of length 25 m width 0 3 m and depth 0 6 m equipped with a piston type wavemaker installed at one end of the flume and testing the plane beach of slopes s of 1 4 1 7 and 1 10 at the other end the one sidewall of the flume was glass and other sidewall and floor were made of smooth painted steel the sloping beach was made of marine plywood painted with water resistant paint a schematic figure of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the solitary waves were generated in the constant water depth region and were incident upon a plane beach of the uniform slope where it created a runup event the target solitary waves were generated by a programmable wavemaker and the algorithm of the generation was calculated using the goring 1979 method the water surface elevation was measured using capacitance type wave gauges with a frequency of 100 hz the calibration of wave gauges was done by the standard method of lowering systematically into the water and recording the output voltage accordingly to establish the desired wave heights h of the incident wave and to estimate the wave reflection a preliminary run without any slope was conducted in the wave flume for all combinations of h and h values considered in this study the reference wave gauge g1 was placed at 6 m from the piston the horizontal distance from the wave gauge g1 to the toe of the beach slope was kept more than 5 m the results ensured that there was no significant peak reduction caused by the sloping beach the input value to the wavemaker and the measured wave heights by reference wave gauge g1 were slightly different for all h values therefore the measured wave heights by wave gauge g1 were used to define the offshore wave heights h additional measurements of the water surface elevation were taken at the toe of the sloping beach and further onshore as shown in fig 2 the water depths h were changed from 0 20 to 0 30 m as shown in table 2 seven different solitary wave heights ranging from 0 03 m to 0 09 m for a water depth of h was used as the input wave height values to the wavemaker program the measured offshore wave heights h ranged between 0 025 m and 0 083 m the wave height to depth ratio h h was varied from 0 1 to 0 4 the surf similarity parameter ξ was altered in the range of 0 252 2 685 the grilli et al 1997 s slope parameter s o was varied between 0 241 and 1 246 the present experimental database includes 73 tests for the estimation of runup changing the settings of h h and s the maximum runup was tracked by an overhead camera based on the marker lines on the runup board with an accuracy of 5 mm the geometric form of the breaking type was observed using the side video camera recordings some tests were randomly repeated and found that the results of maximum runup showed consistency within 5 mm range for an input value of offshore wave height h to the wavemaker program the measured data were employed to analyse the wave breaking and the runup height 4 model derivation the relationship of non dimensionalised runup of r h against the surf similarity parameter ξ for various slopes was investigated using the form of eq 15 for both present experimental results and the published works of hall and watts 1953 synolakis 1987 and hsiao et al 2008 r h was used as the non dimensionalised runup parameter instead of r h in this study to develop the empirical relationship the disadvantage of using r h for small waves particularly is that experimental error can be greatly increased as both runup height r and wave height h are measured values with greater ambiguity compared to the water depth h 15 r h a ξ b here the empirical coefficients a and b can be determined by the linear regression analysis for a given beach slope s the experimental dataset contains the slopes of 1 1 1 2 14 1 3 73 1 4 1 5 67 1 7 1 10 1 11 43 1 19 85 and 1 60 altogether the database which was used to derive the empirical equation consists of 381 observations n 381 it included water depths h ranging from 0 0625 to 2 9 m and wave heights h ranging from 0 002 to 0 406 m resulting in wave height to depth ratios h h from 0 005 to 0 633 and surf similarity parameter ξ from 0 05 to 18 44 the relationship between the bathymetry slope s and the parameters a and b was derived 16 r h f 1 s ξ f 2 s here a and b can be viewed as the functions of a beach slope s as f 1 s and f 2 s respectively the results of the analysis were used to derive a unified formula covering beach slopes from 1 1 to 1 60 5 results and discussion the visual observations made by video camera recordings during the present laboratory experiments verified that the type of solitary wave breaking matched the prediction of grilli et al 1997 s slope parameter s o defined in eq 12 the plunging breaking type could be observed where s o 0 3 the surging breaking type could be seen where 0 3 s o 0 37 the breaking was not observed for s o 0 37 the spilling breaking type could not be seen for the wave conditions tested in this study for each slope empirical coefficients for parameters a and b could be found in the form of eq 15 using regression analysis the correlation coefficient r 2 is over 0 9 for all the cases the obtained results of a and b were plotted against the cotβ 1 s as shown in fig 3 hence the relationships for parameters a and b against s were derived by linear regression analysis as expressed in eq 17 for a which follows a power function and eq 18 for b which follows the logarithmic function giving correlation coefficient r 2 as 0 994 and 0 904 respectively 17 a 2 9049 s 0 931 18 b 0 1931 ln s 1 2704 by substituting expressions for empirical coefficients a and b in eq 15 it gives 19 r h 2 9049 s 0 931 s h h 0 1931 ln s 1 2704 this method is quite similar to hall and watts 1953 s method but the main difference is that we have used ξ s h h instead of h h the technique used in the current study appears to provide a more reasonable basis for a broad range of slopes and wave height to depth ratios h h runup values for different planar beaches from the published works of chang et al 2009 pujara et al 2015 and smith et al 2017 were also employed for validating the present formula as shown in fig 4 a the figure shows that all runup data for both breaking non breaking solitary waves reproduced reasonably well and can be depicted by a single empirical equation eq 19 to compare with expressions for the literature fig 4b shows the runup of solitary waves correspond to setting r h min non breaking expression breaking expression from fuhrman and madsen 2008 can be expressed by changing scaling from h to h 20 r h min 3 9 ξ 0 42 h h 2 831 ξ 0 5 h h 0 75 it could be stated that eq 20 also covers the data reasonably to assess the probable error using eq 19 fig 5 a shows the goodness of fit in terms of runup heights between the measured values by experiments and calculated values from eq 19 in fig 5a the runup data are almost covered within 20 deviations from the perfect agreement the proposed empirical equation predicts remarkably well apart from a few outlying points there are discrepancies between eq 19 and experimental results for small runups r h 0 08 very low wave nonlinearities h h 0 02 and very high nonlinearities h h 0 6 where eq 19 overpredicts and also for the slope s of 1 1 where eq 19 underpredicts the deviations might occur because of the use of the generalised least squares method in the regression analysis with equal weight distribution among data moreover the statistical measures of the mean absolute error mae i 1 n c i m i n the root mean square rmse 1 n i 1 n c i m i 2 the scatter index sci rmse m and correlation coefficient r 2 i 1 n c i c m i m 2 i 1 n c i c 2 i 1 n m i m 2 were calculated c i and m i denote the calculated and the measured data respectively and n is the total number of evaluated data points the results for the present proposed method show that mae 0 037 rmse 0 003 sci 0 007 and r 2 0 966 also an agreement index c r willmott 1981 was used to evaluate the accuracy of the empirical equation which is defined as in eq 21 21 c r 1 i 1 n c i m i 2 i 1 n c i m m i m 2 the value of c r gives as 0 991 implying the proposed empirical solution satisfy well with the collected data points the combined expression of fuhrman and madsen 2008 given by eq 20 was compared with the present runup data as shown in fig 5b the statistical measures of mae rmse sci r 2 and c r for the comparison between the experimental results and eq 20 give 0 055 0 006 0 013 0 937 and 0 983 respectively based on these measures it could be mentioned that eq 20 performs well but eq 19 is superior eq 20 shows some discrepancy with the experimental values for the slope s 1 1 where it underpredicts eq 20 overpredicts by more than 20 for the experimental values of s 1 60 and s o 0 07 eq 19 can be rearranged and expressed as in eq 22 22 r h 2 9049 s 0 1931 ln s 0 3394 h h 0 1931 ln s 1 2704 the present empirical equation eq 19 is also similar to some extent of synolakis 1987 runup law for non breaking waves except the empirical coefficients the new runup relationship was compared with the existing empirical models proposed by hall and watts 1953 pedersen and gjevik 1983 for langsholt 1981 s experiments baldock et al 2012 yao et al 2015 and fuchs and hager 2015 the result of the comparison for their empirical coefficients k and δ by following eq 4 with eq 19 is presented in table 3 it can be seen that most of the data support the trend of eq 19 therefore the present unified formula shows reasonable applicability in predicting maximum runup in a broad range of wave conditions and beach slopes irrespective of breaking criterion the current empirical equation was deduced from laboratory data for a solitary wave in one horizontal dimension 1 hd where the energy dissipation might not scale well due to boundary layer dissipation and wave breaking and the refraction diffraction and resonance are ignored hence the applications of this equation in the field conditions should be implemented cautiously 6 summary and conclusions a total of 73 laboratory experiments were conducted covering three types of breaking as non breaking surging breaking and plunging breaking on three sloping beds a total number of 403 data points were compared in the analysis including the other researchers laboratory solitary wave runup results a simple unified formula for prediction of solitary wave runup is proposed the formula uses the surf similarity parameter as well as additional slope dependent coefficients whose exact functional forms have been derived from the aforementioned experimental data the formula works reasonably well for both breaking and non breaking waves a reasonable agreement was found except for minor discrepancies concerning small runups r h 0 08 low wave nonlinearities h h 0 02 and high nonlinearities h h 0 6 where present empirical model overpredicts it was also observed that the present model predicts lower than experimental values where slope s is 1 1 the tests of the reliability of the proposed equation included the agreement index c r the correlation coefficient r 2 the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse and the scattering index sci gave results of 0 991 0 966 0 037 0 003 and 0 007 respectively based on comparison with other empirical models found in the literature it has been demonstrated that the newly proposed solitary wave runup formula is applicable for plane beach slopes ranging from 1 1 to 1 60 the empirical equation can also be applied for different breaking types such as plunging surging and non breaking waves the equation is deduced from laboratory data where the energy dissipation might not scale well due to boundary layer dissipation and wave breaking the refraction diffraction and resonance effects are ignored in the present experimental conditions it is worthy of mentioning that the longwave runup in the coastal region experiences the effect of larger roughness

21509,laboratory experiments to estimate solitary wave runup were performed on three different planar beaches with slopes of 1 4 1 7 and 1 10 with varying wave heights and water depths the non dimensionalised vertical runup runup over water depth obtained from present laboratory data and several published sources were plotted against the surf similarity parameter best fitting curves could be obtained for maximum runup on slopes ranging from 1 1 to 1 60 against the surf similarity parameter hence an approximate formula is presented for estimation of maximum solitary wave runup on planar beaches of different slopes regardless of whether the waves are breaking or non breaking the proposed empirical equation predicts the overall dataset mostly within 20 scatter for all the laboratory data thus the empirical formula can be used to obtain a quick estimation of maximum runup height for both breaking and non breaking solitary waves in laboratory experiments for disaster risk evaluation of wave runups and to verify numerical model runup results keywords empirical model laboratory study solitary wave surf similarity parameter wave breaking wave runup 1 introduction the estimation of solitary wave runup on plane beaches has been studied in the study of tsunamis generated by rockfalls landslides snow and ice avalanches caving of glaciers and earthquakes fuchs and hager 2015 li and raichlen 2001 synolakis 1987 the runup is defined as the maximum elevation attained by seawater on along the beach above the still water level and as such defines the extent of wave action solitary wave runup solutions are useful for experimental investigations and calibration of runup modules in numerical models despite being widely used to represent tsunamis madsen et al 2008 showed that both the length and time scales of an actual tsunami could not be tied with solitary waves larsen and fuhrman 2019 demonstrated that undular bores with several shorter waves developed at the front of the tsunami did not influence the overall runup of the tsunamis therefore they concluded that solitary wave runup solutions could not be used to evaluate the tsunami impact in the present study an approximate solution for estimating solitary wave runup is presented covering slopes from 1 1 to 1 60 noting that the bathymetry consists of a constant depth region and a planar beach it is demonstrated that the newly defined empirical equation can estimate the runup heights regardless of whether the waves are breaking or non breaking at first the existing solitary wave runup solutions and their limitations of applicability are discussed additional laboratory experiments for breaking and non breaking solitary waves on 1 4 1 7 and 1 10 slopes were performed to enrich the database of runup height data from previously published works then the relationship between the runup heights of solitary waves and corresponding surf similarity parameters is used to derive a unified empirical formula the proposed empirical method is shown to give similar expressions to existing empirical models in the literature finally the conclusions obtained from this study are shown 2 literature review the solitary waves are nonlinear shallow water waveforms which propagate without change of form on constant water depth a solitary wave is characterised by a single crest of height h with an essentially undefined period t and wavelength l as both are infinite the free surface displacement of a solitary wave η for the horizontal coordinate x and time t is given by 1 η h sech 2 k x c t the wavenumber k and wave celerity c can be expressed 2 k 3 h 4 h 3 a n d c g h h here h and g denote the water depth and gravity acceleration respectively the above expressions correspond to the first order solitary wave solution boussinesq 1872 the solitary wave solutions which relate to higher orders can be referred to in the literature see e g fenton 1972 laitone 1960 the effective wavelength and wave period of a solitary wave are 3 l 2 π k a n d t 2 π k c in the literature there are numerous relationships for solitary wave runup based on physical analytical and numerical studies table 1 summarises the existing formulae to estimate solitary wave runups where s is the slope β is the angle of the sloping beach in degrees and g is the gravity acceleration h h l and t are the wave height water depth wavelength and wave period respectively at the toe of a sloping beach r is the maximum vertical runup as shown in fig 1 previous studies have used either r h runup over water depth or r h runup over wave height as the non dimensional parameter to develop solitary wave runup expressions the empirical relationships for solitary wave runup as a function of wave height wavelength water depth and beach slope have been established in the series of laboratory investigations of hall and watts 1953 kaplan 1955 kishi and saeki 1967 saeki et al 1971 synolakis 1987 hsiao et al 2008 lo et al 2013 fuchs and hager 2015 pujara et al 2015 and wu et al 2018 in the study of hall and watts 1953 the runup on the sloping angles β of 5 10 15 25 and 45 corresponding slope s to 1 11 43 1 5 67 1 3 73 1 2 14 and 1 1 respectively was investigated they found relationship for r h concerning h h in correlation with s as functions for two ranges for 5 to 12 degree slopes 1 11 43 s 1 4 76 and 12 to 45 degree slopes 1 4 76 s 1 1 furthermore they expressed relationships for r h versus h h by finding empirical coefficients k and δ 4 r h k h h δ the values of k are 2 15 3 43 3 75 3 35 and 3 1 and the values of δ are 0 81 1 04 1 12 1 12 and 1 15 for beach slopes of 1 11 43 1 5 67 1 3 73 1 2 14 and 1 1 respectively kaplan 1955 used non dimensionalised runup r h and wave steepness h l to develop the empirical relationships for plane slopes of 1 30 and 1 60 kishi and saeki 1967 and saeki et al 1971 expressed the non dimensionalised runup r h as a function of wave height to water depth ratio h h for the slopes of 1 10 1 15 1 20 1 30 1 50 1 100 and 1 150 including the work of hall and watts 1953 and kaplan 1955 they plotted the empirical coefficients k and δ against the slope s in a graph as illustrated in the figures which can be found in kishi and saeki 1967 and saeki et al 1971 kajiura 1984 correlated the solitary wave runups on the various slopes with a single parameter denoted by σ s where s is the slope and σ is a dimensionless number he defined σ by non dimensionalising with t wave period h constant depth and g gravity acceleration 5 σ 2 π t h g hsiao et al 2008 conducted large scale laboratory experiments for breaking solitary waves they used their experimental data to re examine existing formulae and proposed a different formula by regression analysis to predict the maximum non dimensionalised runup r h on a plane beach with slopes ranging from 1 15 to 1 60 they found that the discrepancies of the runup data correlated with similar wave height to depth ratio h h are not significant based on their experimental work on the slope of 1 60 fuchs and hager 2015 conducted experiments for rather steep beach slopes the proposed empirical formula shows the dependency of runup against the beach slope s is very low and higher correlation with the wave height to depth ratio h h the analytical work of non breaking solitary wave runup has been extensively studied by carrier and greenspan 1958 keller and keller 1964 shuto 1967 synolakis 1987 pelinovsky and mazova 1992 li and raichlen 2001 didenkulova et al 2007 and madsen and schaffer 2010 the theoretical work by synolakis 1987 represents a significant achievement by deriving an analytical runup solution for non breaking solitary waves on a bathymetry consisting of a constant depth region and a plane beach 6 r h 2 831 s 0 5 h h 1 25 various extensions for synolakis 1987 s expression can be found in the literature see e g didenkulova et al 2007 fuentes et al 2013 madsen and fuhrman 2008 madsen and schäffer 2010 pujara et al 2015 sriram et al 2016 li and raichlen 2001 improved the synolakis 1987 runup law by adding a correction term based on nonlinear runup hughes 2004 explored wave runup data for solitary waves on plane slopes and presented a different wave runup equation for both breaking and non breaking types by introducing the maximum depth integrated wave momentum flux parameter he derived an expression for wave momentum flux parameter m f where ρ is the density of water g is the gravity acceleration and h is the wave height at a constant water depth h 7 m f ρ g h 2 m a x 1 2 h h 2 2 h h n s 2 2 m s h h 1 tan m s 2 h h 1 1 3 tan 3 m s 2 h h 1 the empirical coefficients m s and n s are given by 8 m s 0 98 tanh 2 24 h h 0 44 9 n s 0 69 tanh 2 38 h h hughes 2004 therefore illustrated the utility of the wave momentum flux parameter for nonperiodic waves such as solitary waves pedersen et al 2013 compared the theoretical and experimental results of maximum runup and concluded that the difference between the theoretical values and experimental values is because of the boundary layer wu et al 2018 compared the maximum runup results obtained by using different slope material wood aluminum plastic plexiglas perspex and concrete and observed that there is no significant influence from the used slope material instead they explained that the major difference between the experimental results of runup might occur due to the size of wave flume in the small scale experiments the boundary layer flows are likely to be laminar in contrast some of the boundary layer flows in the large scale experiments might be in the transition regime according to sumer et al 2010 significant improvements in the modelling of runup have appeared as a result of advancements in both computational techniques and theoretical understandings see review by kirby 2017 some of them are extended to capture the large roughness effect on runup by forests mangroves coral reefs and buildings they have used either a constant roughness model equivalent roughness model drag and inertia forces using morison type equations or macro scale wavelength equations see e g mei et al 2014 tanaka et al 2018 synolakis 1987 and borthwick et al 2006 found non dimensionalised maximum runup r h follows two different regimes for breaking and non breaking solitary waves synolakis 1987 proposed an empirical formula for estimating breaking wave runup by only using h h for the slope of 1 19 85 which appears different from his analytical equation for non breaking solitary waves 10 r h 1 109 h h 0 582 it is obvious that obtaining a relationship as mentioned in eq 4 for the maximum runup by only considering h h for a given beach slope may provide different values for k and δ as it depends on the data chosen for the estimation for example following eq 4 the results of synolakis 1987 for non breaking wave runup show empirical coefficients k and δ as 12 613 and 1 25 for breaking waves i e relatively highly nonlinear waves show empirical coefficients k and δ as 1 109 and 0 582 for the slope of 1 19 85 it is not feasible to find a theoretical solution for the runup of breaking solitary waves over a plane slope because of its complexity the breaking criterion is useful for distinguishing breaking and non breaking regimes as well as identifying the maximum runup limit grilli et al 1997 madsen and fuhrman 2008 madsen and schäffer 2010 synolakis 1987 synolakis 1987 derived an expression for the breaking criterion of solitary waves which is known as the theoretical breaking point 11 h h 0 818 s 10 9 synolakis 1987 observed that waves which were expected to break according to the theoretical breaking criterion deduced by nonlinear shallow water equation theory did not break during the runup of solitary waves in his laboratory experiments this phenomenon was also observed and different wave breaking criteria were proposed by grilli et al 1997 using fully nonlinear potential flow wave model and by pujara et al 2015 analysing previous experimental works grilli et al 1997 introduced the slope parameter s o 12 s o 1 521 s h h 0 5 grilli et al 1997 s guidelines can be used to distinguish breaking types as spilling breaking s o 0 025 plunging breaking 0 025 s o 0 3 surging breaking 0 3 s o 0 37 and non breaking s o 0 37 pujara et al 2015 suggested that the breaking criterion of grilli et al 1997 s o should be 0 4 to 0 5 by observing higher runups in the vicinity of that range the definitions for the wave breaking criterion used by the previous researchers in history can be found from the reviews by peregrine 1983 and robertson et al 2013 the surf similarity parameter battjes 1974 or the iribarren number iribarren and nogales 1949 ξ ir is defined as the slope s over the square root of wave height to wavelength ratio h l ξ ir have been extensively used to express the relationships of the runup heights for regular and random waves on a sloping beach 13 ξ i r s h l similarly by introducing an effective wave period t or an effective wavelength l of a solitary wave into the iribarren number ξ ir kobayashi and karjadi 1994 fuhrman and madsen 2008 lo et al 2013 and wu et al 2018 proposed different surf similarity parameters and correlated with breaking solitary wave runups fuhrman and madsen 2008 expressed a simplified expression for the surf similarity parameter of solitary waves 14 ξ s h h those mentioned above empirical and analytical formulae provide useful knowledge for practical applications but they are mostly limited to either breaking or non breaking waves or to a relatively small number of slopes the same surf similarity parameter ξ s h h was chosen in both analytical solutions proposed by fuhrman and madsen 2008 for non breaking waves and breaking waves hence the surf similarity parameter ξ was utilised in this study to derive a unified formula for the estimation of solitary wave runup over a wide range of sloping beaches regardless of whether the waves were breaking or non breaking 3 laboratory experiments a series of experiments were conducted in a wave flume at hydraulic research laboratory of saitama university to investigate the solitary wave runup the experiments were performed in the flume of length 25 m width 0 3 m and depth 0 6 m equipped with a piston type wavemaker installed at one end of the flume and testing the plane beach of slopes s of 1 4 1 7 and 1 10 at the other end the one sidewall of the flume was glass and other sidewall and floor were made of smooth painted steel the sloping beach was made of marine plywood painted with water resistant paint a schematic figure of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the solitary waves were generated in the constant water depth region and were incident upon a plane beach of the uniform slope where it created a runup event the target solitary waves were generated by a programmable wavemaker and the algorithm of the generation was calculated using the goring 1979 method the water surface elevation was measured using capacitance type wave gauges with a frequency of 100 hz the calibration of wave gauges was done by the standard method of lowering systematically into the water and recording the output voltage accordingly to establish the desired wave heights h of the incident wave and to estimate the wave reflection a preliminary run without any slope was conducted in the wave flume for all combinations of h and h values considered in this study the reference wave gauge g1 was placed at 6 m from the piston the horizontal distance from the wave gauge g1 to the toe of the beach slope was kept more than 5 m the results ensured that there was no significant peak reduction caused by the sloping beach the input value to the wavemaker and the measured wave heights by reference wave gauge g1 were slightly different for all h values therefore the measured wave heights by wave gauge g1 were used to define the offshore wave heights h additional measurements of the water surface elevation were taken at the toe of the sloping beach and further onshore as shown in fig 2 the water depths h were changed from 0 20 to 0 30 m as shown in table 2 seven different solitary wave heights ranging from 0 03 m to 0 09 m for a water depth of h was used as the input wave height values to the wavemaker program the measured offshore wave heights h ranged between 0 025 m and 0 083 m the wave height to depth ratio h h was varied from 0 1 to 0 4 the surf similarity parameter ξ was altered in the range of 0 252 2 685 the grilli et al 1997 s slope parameter s o was varied between 0 241 and 1 246 the present experimental database includes 73 tests for the estimation of runup changing the settings of h h and s the maximum runup was tracked by an overhead camera based on the marker lines on the runup board with an accuracy of 5 mm the geometric form of the breaking type was observed using the side video camera recordings some tests were randomly repeated and found that the results of maximum runup showed consistency within 5 mm range for an input value of offshore wave height h to the wavemaker program the measured data were employed to analyse the wave breaking and the runup height 4 model derivation the relationship of non dimensionalised runup of r h against the surf similarity parameter ξ for various slopes was investigated using the form of eq 15 for both present experimental results and the published works of hall and watts 1953 synolakis 1987 and hsiao et al 2008 r h was used as the non dimensionalised runup parameter instead of r h in this study to develop the empirical relationship the disadvantage of using r h for small waves particularly is that experimental error can be greatly increased as both runup height r and wave height h are measured values with greater ambiguity compared to the water depth h 15 r h a ξ b here the empirical coefficients a and b can be determined by the linear regression analysis for a given beach slope s the experimental dataset contains the slopes of 1 1 1 2 14 1 3 73 1 4 1 5 67 1 7 1 10 1 11 43 1 19 85 and 1 60 altogether the database which was used to derive the empirical equation consists of 381 observations n 381 it included water depths h ranging from 0 0625 to 2 9 m and wave heights h ranging from 0 002 to 0 406 m resulting in wave height to depth ratios h h from 0 005 to 0 633 and surf similarity parameter ξ from 0 05 to 18 44 the relationship between the bathymetry slope s and the parameters a and b was derived 16 r h f 1 s ξ f 2 s here a and b can be viewed as the functions of a beach slope s as f 1 s and f 2 s respectively the results of the analysis were used to derive a unified formula covering beach slopes from 1 1 to 1 60 5 results and discussion the visual observations made by video camera recordings during the present laboratory experiments verified that the type of solitary wave breaking matched the prediction of grilli et al 1997 s slope parameter s o defined in eq 12 the plunging breaking type could be observed where s o 0 3 the surging breaking type could be seen where 0 3 s o 0 37 the breaking was not observed for s o 0 37 the spilling breaking type could not be seen for the wave conditions tested in this study for each slope empirical coefficients for parameters a and b could be found in the form of eq 15 using regression analysis the correlation coefficient r 2 is over 0 9 for all the cases the obtained results of a and b were plotted against the cotβ 1 s as shown in fig 3 hence the relationships for parameters a and b against s were derived by linear regression analysis as expressed in eq 17 for a which follows a power function and eq 18 for b which follows the logarithmic function giving correlation coefficient r 2 as 0 994 and 0 904 respectively 17 a 2 9049 s 0 931 18 b 0 1931 ln s 1 2704 by substituting expressions for empirical coefficients a and b in eq 15 it gives 19 r h 2 9049 s 0 931 s h h 0 1931 ln s 1 2704 this method is quite similar to hall and watts 1953 s method but the main difference is that we have used ξ s h h instead of h h the technique used in the current study appears to provide a more reasonable basis for a broad range of slopes and wave height to depth ratios h h runup values for different planar beaches from the published works of chang et al 2009 pujara et al 2015 and smith et al 2017 were also employed for validating the present formula as shown in fig 4 a the figure shows that all runup data for both breaking non breaking solitary waves reproduced reasonably well and can be depicted by a single empirical equation eq 19 to compare with expressions for the literature fig 4b shows the runup of solitary waves correspond to setting r h min non breaking expression breaking expression from fuhrman and madsen 2008 can be expressed by changing scaling from h to h 20 r h min 3 9 ξ 0 42 h h 2 831 ξ 0 5 h h 0 75 it could be stated that eq 20 also covers the data reasonably to assess the probable error using eq 19 fig 5 a shows the goodness of fit in terms of runup heights between the measured values by experiments and calculated values from eq 19 in fig 5a the runup data are almost covered within 20 deviations from the perfect agreement the proposed empirical equation predicts remarkably well apart from a few outlying points there are discrepancies between eq 19 and experimental results for small runups r h 0 08 very low wave nonlinearities h h 0 02 and very high nonlinearities h h 0 6 where eq 19 overpredicts and also for the slope s of 1 1 where eq 19 underpredicts the deviations might occur because of the use of the generalised least squares method in the regression analysis with equal weight distribution among data moreover the statistical measures of the mean absolute error mae i 1 n c i m i n the root mean square rmse 1 n i 1 n c i m i 2 the scatter index sci rmse m and correlation coefficient r 2 i 1 n c i c m i m 2 i 1 n c i c 2 i 1 n m i m 2 were calculated c i and m i denote the calculated and the measured data respectively and n is the total number of evaluated data points the results for the present proposed method show that mae 0 037 rmse 0 003 sci 0 007 and r 2 0 966 also an agreement index c r willmott 1981 was used to evaluate the accuracy of the empirical equation which is defined as in eq 21 21 c r 1 i 1 n c i m i 2 i 1 n c i m m i m 2 the value of c r gives as 0 991 implying the proposed empirical solution satisfy well with the collected data points the combined expression of fuhrman and madsen 2008 given by eq 20 was compared with the present runup data as shown in fig 5b the statistical measures of mae rmse sci r 2 and c r for the comparison between the experimental results and eq 20 give 0 055 0 006 0 013 0 937 and 0 983 respectively based on these measures it could be mentioned that eq 20 performs well but eq 19 is superior eq 20 shows some discrepancy with the experimental values for the slope s 1 1 where it underpredicts eq 20 overpredicts by more than 20 for the experimental values of s 1 60 and s o 0 07 eq 19 can be rearranged and expressed as in eq 22 22 r h 2 9049 s 0 1931 ln s 0 3394 h h 0 1931 ln s 1 2704 the present empirical equation eq 19 is also similar to some extent of synolakis 1987 runup law for non breaking waves except the empirical coefficients the new runup relationship was compared with the existing empirical models proposed by hall and watts 1953 pedersen and gjevik 1983 for langsholt 1981 s experiments baldock et al 2012 yao et al 2015 and fuchs and hager 2015 the result of the comparison for their empirical coefficients k and δ by following eq 4 with eq 19 is presented in table 3 it can be seen that most of the data support the trend of eq 19 therefore the present unified formula shows reasonable applicability in predicting maximum runup in a broad range of wave conditions and beach slopes irrespective of breaking criterion the current empirical equation was deduced from laboratory data for a solitary wave in one horizontal dimension 1 hd where the energy dissipation might not scale well due to boundary layer dissipation and wave breaking and the refraction diffraction and resonance are ignored hence the applications of this equation in the field conditions should be implemented cautiously 6 summary and conclusions a total of 73 laboratory experiments were conducted covering three types of breaking as non breaking surging breaking and plunging breaking on three sloping beds a total number of 403 data points were compared in the analysis including the other researchers laboratory solitary wave runup results a simple unified formula for prediction of solitary wave runup is proposed the formula uses the surf similarity parameter as well as additional slope dependent coefficients whose exact functional forms have been derived from the aforementioned experimental data the formula works reasonably well for both breaking and non breaking waves a reasonable agreement was found except for minor discrepancies concerning small runups r h 0 08 low wave nonlinearities h h 0 02 and high nonlinearities h h 0 6 where present empirical model overpredicts it was also observed that the present model predicts lower than experimental values where slope s is 1 1 the tests of the reliability of the proposed equation included the agreement index c r the correlation coefficient r 2 the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse and the scattering index sci gave results of 0 991 0 966 0 037 0 003 and 0 007 respectively based on comparison with other empirical models found in the literature it has been demonstrated that the newly proposed solitary wave runup formula is applicable for plane beach slopes ranging from 1 1 to 1 60 the empirical equation can also be applied for different breaking types such as plunging surging and non breaking waves the equation is deduced from laboratory data where the energy dissipation might not scale well due to boundary layer dissipation and wave breaking the refraction diffraction and resonance effects are ignored in the present experimental conditions it is worthy of mentioning that the longwave runup in the coastal region experiences the effect of larger roughness
