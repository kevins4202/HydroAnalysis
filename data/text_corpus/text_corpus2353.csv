platform 1 introduction water is a precious natural resource required for the sustainability of human life about seventy percent of the earth s surface area globe is covered with water but only 2 5 percent of it constitutes freshwater increasing population and rapid urbanizations exert pressure on freshwater resources intensive industrial irrigation practice and rigorous domestic use results depletion and deterioration of water resources and water quality saha et al 2020 taloor et al 2020 water scarcity regions are also increasing rapidly across the world including in india so water availability for various usages is becoming a hard challenge reflecting dependency on little less exploited groundwater sources saha et al 2020 the earth s surface is covered with different morphological features paleochannel is a hydro geomorphological landform in alluvial areas which can be described as preserved geologic remnants of an ancient river or stream channels that have ceased surface flow activity the presence of paleochannels indicates active sources of groundwater and subsurface water conveyance vervoort and annen 2006 mohammed aslam et al 2015 parray et al 2018 paleochannels represent segments of old river and stream courses that are formed due to the shifting of river courses in the geological past paleochannels are geomorphological landforms that indicate the presence of good groundwater resources and are mainly found along river meanders gregory 1977 clift et al 2012 paleochannels are geomorphological records that enable insight into past hydrological processes climatic conditions floodplain activities depositional and sedimentary responses that were influenced by hydrological processes nandini et al 2013 in india paleochannel studies were first started by the ancient study of the harappa civilization on the saraswati river reflecting climate change and tectonic as the main reasons for the shifting of river meandering bhadra et al 2009 clift et al 2012 ghose et al 1979 stein 1942 tripathi et al 2004 valdiya 2013 the earliest work on the shifting of river meandering and morphology was undertaken by schumml 1968 followed by dawson and tilley 1972 hickin and nanson 1975 lewin and weir 1977 wherein they discussed paleochannel formation based on the shifting of river meandering gregory 1977b provided probably the first review in the context of river channel changes by summarizing the results of various studies on paleochannels paleochannel can be demarcated by various other techniques like aerial photography remote sensing geophysical studies isotope studies and hydrogeological studies sinha 1996 has demarcated paleochannels conditions in north bihar plain i e gangetic plain of eastern india by combining surface impression on the satellite image with field investigation nair et al 1999 carried out a study to explore the age and origin of groundwater along with a paleochannel study in the ganganagar and jaisalmer districts of rajasthan jain et al 2021 did study on simulation of groundwater flow under the influence of groundwater abstraction in parts of narmada river basin in gujarat and find large scope of groundwater development in the part of gujarat area broad studies on the paleochannel of the vedic river saraswati have been done from the beginning of the 21st century extensive studies were carried out on the palaeochannels of the vedic river saraswati valdiya 2016 2013 2002 2017 according to valdiya 2013 the geological geomorphological geophysical and remote sensing evidence suggests that saraswati was a large glacier fed river this river is greatly influenced by neotectonic activities as corroborated by the existence of several tectonic lineaments faults and seismic zones saini et al 2009 used optically stimulated luminescence osl for mapping floodplains including buried channels in the northwestern part of haryana sinha et al 2013 employed drill cores to locate paleochannels locations and their connectivity to upstreams in a part of ghaggar plains located in northwestern india technological interventions were used in the delineation of paleochannels for groundwater development in sangrur district in punjab parray et al 2018 showing an increase in the number of paleochannels due to changes in direction of flow of the river in the past and serving as an great potential source of groundwater in the areas where groundwater levels are suddenly declining multi temporal approach spectral decomposition and vegetation dynamic techniques result in a good possibility to locate paleochannels hector et al 2017 in india palaeochannels have been widely studied mainly in alluvial plain areas oldham et al 1874 1893 identified major paleochannels along the dry bed of the gagghar river and other similar paleochannels in the punjab plains the usefulness of remote sensing techniques for the mapping of paleochannels and delineation of groundwater prospect zones for water resources development plans has been demonstrated in the yamuna flood plain in uttar pradesh rao et al 2009 these studies indicated that paleochannels have good prospects of being potential aquifers samadder et al 2011 highlighted paleochannels and their potential for artificial groundwater recharge in the western ganga plains based on the identification of three major paleochannels in unconfined conditions comprising coarse grained sandy material well interconnected with the adjacent alluvial aquifers the hydraulic characteristics of the paleochannel aquifers indicate that these aquifers hold a good source of groundwater recharge the practice of combining satellite imagery and geographic information system gis for identifying and demarcating paleochannels palaeo rivers and relict watercourses in various regions throughout the world is highly adopted blumberg et al 2004 mccauley et al 1982 tapley 1988 walstra et al 2009 yang et al 1999 paleochannels as a major source of groundwater recharge were demonstrated by chaudhary et al 1996 wang et al 2012 some of the ancient research also shows the application of remote sensing in groundwater explorations aslam and balasubramanian 2001 petts 1980 phillip et al 1991 sarma 1993 carried out several studies pointing to the use of the optical and thermal image for identifying and mapping paleochannels and concluded that draping the landsat satellite imagery over a digital elevation model dem provides an inexpensive method of enhancing terrain visualization of paleochannel in alluvial plains artificial groundwater recharge sites have been identified in parts of india by researchers based on gis and remote sensing technology in order to enrich the water stressed alluvial aquifers jasrotia et al 2019 khan et al 2020 risat 1 synthetic aperture radar sar data was used by hrishikesh et al 2017 to detect paleochannels in part of the thar desert india remote sensing technologies have been used for spatial variability of the sources and distribution of fluoride in groundwater of the sanya alluvial plain aquifers in northern tanzania ijumulana et al 2022 2020 these studies have shown the convenience and effectiveness of remotely sensed satellite imagery as a tool for the identification of paleochannels there are scanty literature demonstrating studies on paleochannels over hard rock terrain in india or other parts of the world the demand for groundwater in the hard rocky terrain of jharkhand state witnessing recurrent drought conditions entails delineation of paleochannels along alluvium rich sections in major river basins it is quite challenging to extract paleochannels in hard rock terrain where the water bearing capacity of rocks depends on the development of secondary porosity in the form of interconnected fractures and joints long term climatic variability showed that rising temperatures and reduced rainfall over the koel river basin are increasing the drought events tirkey et al 2018 therefore the present study was conceived with the following specific objectives aslam and balasubramanian 2001 to delineate paleochannels in hard rock terrain areas in parts of the koel river basin by using high spatial resolution optical data and sar data blumberg et al 2004 to assess the suitability of satellite derived ndwi during pre and the post monsoon season for detecting surface wetness over paleochannels and bhadra et al 2009 to study various hydrogeological parameters i e flow direction flow accumulation drainage closed depression area twi using dem data in the present study some major locations of paleochannels were delineated and compared against the satellite derived indices and hydrogeological parameters 2 study area the study area forms a part of the koel river basin lying under plateau terrain in the state of jharkhand where water scarcity is the major challenge in this region the area encompasses five districts namely lohardaga ranchi gumla khunti and chakradharpur in the jharkhand eastern india it is located between 22 48 n and 24 41 n latitude and 83 91 e and 86 12 e longitude covering an area of 7261 km2 and comprising 82 sub watersheds developed over gently sloping undulating topography fig 1 geologically the oldest rocks encountered in these areas are unclassified metamorphics represented by mica schist hornblende schist and amphibolites which form the basement rocks in the koel river basin pandey et al 2017 parveen et al 2012 the overlying chhotanagpur gneissic complex comprising granite gneiss forms the most widespread outcrops in the area laterite metabasic dykes and recent alluvial deposit are other geological formations encountered in the area s f 1 morphology of the upper part of the study area dominant with plateau weathered moderate and plateau weathered shallow with different morphological features as pediment shallow buried valley fills water bodies denudational hills structural hills relict hills inselberg and pediment inselberg complex fig 2 the mean annual precipitation recorded in the area was 1000 mm the data has been taken from indian metrological department based gauge station data for the year 2015 we averaged precipitation values of four stations lying in the study area ranchi lohardagga gumla and paschimi singhbhum to have one cumulative annual precipitation value for the study area the study area is facing recurrent drought conditions and severe water scarcity due to plateau terrain maximum amount of rainfall water drained as run off 59 with very little water available for infiltration and groundwater recharge pandey et al 2017 around 36 34 of rainfall water contributed towards infiltration and groundwater recharge with 4 66 as evapotranspiration typically the total volume of surface water drained into the koel river and karo river two major soil textures as coarse loamy and fine dominant over the koel river basin nbsslup 2020 3 materials and methods the satellite dataset used to delineated paleochannels in parts of the koel river basin includes sentinel 2 and sar data the detailed characteristics of satellite data were given in table 1 3 1 data used 3 1 1 sentinel 2a optical data and sentinel 1 sar data the sentinel 2 optical data was acquired from usgs https earthexploree usgs gov acquired for the month of june and october 2017 sentinel 2 june 05 2017 and october 30 2017 the data acquired in june belong to pre monsoon whereas data obtained in october represents the post monsoon season the spatial resolution of sentinel 2 is 10 m it has 13 spectral bands in visible near infrared and short wave infrared for this study we used blue blumberg et al 2004 green bhadra et al 2009 red barling et al 1994 and nir chaudhary et al 1996 bands to perform a paleochannel study sentinel 1 sar data was downloaded from the alaska science facility https asf alaska edu data sets sar data sets sentinel 1 the c band 5 40 ghz data with vh polarization was acquired for the month of may 2017 pre monsoon for identifying major paleochannels locations during the dry season 3 1 2 2 dem data aster dem gdem v2 data were downloaded from usgs https earthexploree usgs gov with a spatial resolution of 30 m 3 1 3 topographical data toposheet of 1 50 000 scale was acquired from survey of india soi the study area lies in soi toposheet no 73 a 14 73 a 15 73 e 2 and 73 e 3 covering the lohardaga and ranchi districts of jharkhand these data was used for delineating the drainage network and for morphometric analysis in parts of the upper catchment of the study area 3 2 methods the pre processing of satellite data was performed using erdas imagine quantum and saga gis and snap software both sentinel 2 and sentinel 1 data were re projected to a common coordinate system called geographic longitude and latitude with the datum of wgs 1984 using the sentinel 2 ndwi pre and post monsoon was computed major paleochannel locations were delineated by using sentinel 1 sar data using the dem data flow characteristics such as flow accumulation flow direction drainage and depression zones have been computed the topographic wetness index twi was computed the self explanatory flowchart adopted in the present work is presented in fig 3 3 2 1 data processing high resolution optical data sentinel 2 was used to demarcate paleochannels in the study area based on visual image interpretation techniques visual image interpretation of satellite image is mainly done based on seven image interpretation keys i e shape size tone texture pattern association and shadow processing of sentinel data was done by using arc gis 10 2 and erdas imagine 14 software in addition to optical data the major paleochannel locations were also delineated by using sar data sentinel 1 for validating optical based paleochannel locations the pre processing steps applied to sentinel 1 sar data are radiometric calibration speckle filtering and terrain correction in this study we used vh bands for delineating paleochannel locations 3 2 2 satellite based indicators the normalized difference water index ndwi was first introduced by mcfeeters in 1996 that helped to identify or locate surface waters in wetland environments and to allow for the measurement of surface water extent mcfeeters 1996 according to mcfeeters ndwi values greater than zero are likely to represent water surfaces whereas values less than or equal to zero are assumed to be non water zone the values of ndwi were calculated from the sentinel 2 image using equation aslam and balasubramanian 2001 ndwi for pre and post monsoon periods have been computed to demarcate the seasonal waterlogged area or the area where high moisture remains throughout the years 1 n d w i x g r e e n x n i r x g r e e n x n i r where ndwi normalized difference water index x n i r near infrared band x g r e e n green band the ndwi index employs green and nir bands because the maximum reflectance of water is obtained from green bands while high reflectance of vegetation cover and soil features from nir as a result water features have positive values and thus are enhanced while vegetation and soil usually have zero or negative values and therefore are suppressed mcfeeters 1996 3 2 3 hydrological parameters the drainage flow direction and depressed zone maps i e dimensionless factors have been created using the aster dem in arc gis and q gis software the flow direction has been estimated based on the slope direction concerning to its neighboring cell when the direction of the steepest descent has been found the output cell has been coded with the value demonstrating that direction if all neighbors are higher than the current processing cell it is deliberated as noise and is filled using the lowest value of its neighbor s cells getirana et al 2009 jenson and domingue 1988 the flow direction of water is determined by the eight directions pour point model based on the concept i e in a gridded system water can only flow to one of eight adjacent cells getirana et al 2009 the slope is the ultimate factor through which water flows in one or more of its eight adjacent cells the drainage map was prepared by considering the basin map and flow direction maps as input to spatial analysis tools in arc gis the basin flow direction drainage and closed depression maps were derived from dem which helped to analyze curvilinear meandering change and depressed zone areas 3 2 4 topographic wetness index twi topographic wetness index twi has been calculated using dem data using equation blumberg et al 2004 as given by grimm et al 2018 2 twi in a s tan β where a s is the upslope flow accumulation area or drainage area per unit contour length wilson and gallant 2000 2000 and β is the angle of the slope twi has found a wide range of applications in hydrology qin et al 2011 sørensen and seibert 2007 twi index is based on the concept of two grid cells that have similar twi values twi will saturate at the surface under similar basin moisture conditions given their combined contributing areas and local slope gradients it is a dimensionless index that is based on the concept of relative ranking of cells i e when grid cells become saturated then the higher value cell becomes more saturated than the lower values cells and negative twi values are placed in the driest locations in the basin this model uses an algorithm that is used to handle the flat areas reasonably well but results in some striping in the direction of the processing left right then down etc this results from the fact that we sort the elevation values from highest to lowest moving from the top left corner to the bottom right during the short when a large depression or flat area is reached temporally elevated the current cell to force flow into neighbors this is due to the sorting occurring from left to right and down which results in stripping twi can quantify the effect of topography on runoff generation and serves as a physically based index approximating the location of zones of surface saturation and the spatial distribution of soil and water barling et al 1994 and beven et al 1979 3 2 5 morphometric parameters in this study paleochannels in the upper catchment of the study area have been discussed and thereby the morphometric of the upper catchment were generated toposheet of 1 50 000 scale was used only for delineating the drainage network and each drainage has been digitized manually using the visual image interpretation technique morphometric analysis is the study of drainage characteristics and we consider a topographic map for the more accurate results than that of aster dem because in aster dem some of the linear features like rail and road networks were showing up as drainage line features hence we did not use aster dem major morphometric parameters namely stream order stream length drainage density bifurcation ratio elongation ratio and texture ratio have been calculated by using formulas given by horton 1945 and strahler 1964 morphometric analysis has been performed to analyze the quantitative description of basin geometry and to understand inequalities in the rock hardness structural controls geological and geomorphic history of the drainage basin strahler 1964 3 2 6 field data a field visit has been conducted on january 20 2017 that covers five districts of jharkhand in select locations 50 gps points have been collected from the upper catchment of the koel river basin the study emphasis showing major six paleochannels locations the numbers of wells types of wells and depth of wells from the ground surface have been collected during fieldwork furthermore these parameters were obtained from the central groundwater board cgwb field data was used for the validation of results related to locations of paleochannels the depth of water level map was generated using field data over the six paleochannel locations by using the interpolation technique in the arc gis platform over the upper catchment of the koel river basin 4 results 4 1 demarcation of palaeochannels paleochannels in 15 locations were demarcated and out of them only major six paleochannels located in the upper catchment of the koel river basin were highlighted to characterize the paleochannels over hard rock terrain fig 4 a it has been observed that paleochannels were mainly associated with the river bodies the study from sar data results as palaeochannels patches which found along the river boundaries because of the shifting of old river meanders six major paleochannels locations have been highlighted in satellite images that showed the presence of paleochannels along river meandering with more moisture content fig 4 b the reflectance values of these paleochannels locations were lower due to the wetted surface 4 2 satellite based indicators to characterize paleochannels over the part of the koel river basin the ndwi during june pre monsoon and october post monsoon 2017 has been shown in fig 5 and s f 2 the values of ndwi of pre and post monsoons vary between lower 0 05 to higher 0 65 values respectively the negative and lower ndwi indicate a non water zone while the high value indicates a water zone in pre monsoon most of the areas were marked with low ndwi which was indicative of a non water zone however higher ndwi was observed over the major six paleochannels which indicates the availability of water along these zones in post monsoon most of the area covered with high ndwi value including six paleochannel locations that attributed to seasonal waterlogged conditions further it can be noted that the marked six paleochannel locations showed relatively high moisture content than surroundings as indicated by very high ndwi ndwi during pre and post monsoon analysis showed the availability of water along the six major zones and indicates that these locations are good in the rospect of water availability throughout the years and can be considered as paleochannel locations 4 3 hydrological parameters a dendritic drainage pattern has been observed over the upper part of the koel river basin with a total of 26 000 river channel streams for entire catchment areas fig 6 the catchment area was dominated by first order streams and ended with seventh order drainage streams the hydrological analysis showed characteristics of river channels over the major six paleochannel locations curvilinear path of river channels has been identified along major paleochannel zones which indicated the presence of old river channels and one of the good indicators for the storage of surface and groundwater the drainage map showed the formation of river meanders along with the major six locations that are one of the main causes of the shifting of water bodies and the formation of paleochannels from one side to another s f 3 the closed depression zone has been mapped as a hydrological indicator s f 4 and these results showed that low lying areas were associated with paleochannels the depression zone varied from 0 to 42 over the koel river basin whereas a depression zone between 30 and 42 was noticed over the major six paleochannels which is indicative of wetness zone low lying zones displayed more than 30 depression values and were indicative of potential water storage zones so the probability of the presence of water in these low lying zones could be higher compared to other areas of the catchment 4 4 topographic wetted index twi twi was used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes the value of twi was between 2 and 1 3 a higher value showed a high moisture content zone or wetted zone whereas the low value indicated a less moisture content zone fig 7 six major paleochannels locations showed a high value of 1 3 which indicates high moisture content zone or wetted zone and is indicative of the presence of water in these paleochannels locations 4 5 morphometric aspects of sub watershed morphometric analysis has been carried out over the upper part of the koel river basin as per an earlier study the selected watershed has runoff as 59 of total annual precipitation in other words 4 66 evapotranspiration which has been calculated using penmen potential evapotranspiration rao et al 2009 which indicates 36 34 of rainfall water infiltrates and recharges groundwater pandey et al 2017 hence morphometric analysis has been carried out to analyses the quantitative analyze of the drainage network morphometric aspects indicated that the koel basin was characterized by resistant rocks different morphometric parameters have been calculated and shown in table 2 drainage density and stream frequency of the watershed has been calculated as 1 47 km 1 lower drainage density and lower stream frequency showed areas of highly resistant rocks or permeable subsoil material and low relief low drainage density leads to coarse drainage texture drainage texture was between 1 and 4 which is indicative of a very coarse to a coarse texture the elongation ratio re of the watershed is shown as 0 82 indicating the oval shape of the basin a circular or oval basin is more efficient in the discharge of run off than an elongated basin which is prone to erosion the circulatory ratio rc value has been calculated as 0 65 indicating a circular basin the value of rc was between 0 23 and 0 79 and a higher the value represents more circularity in the shape of the basin with a maximum rate of soil erosion as compared to a lower value that showed a square or triangular shape with a lower rate of erosion the length of the overland flow value for the watershed is 0 34 which indicates high relief bifurcation ratio value i e 3 29 showed less structural distortion in upper catchments of the watershed indicating tectonic activities and concomitant adjustment of the drainage network 4 6 groundwater levels as derived from cgwb data the depth of water level from the ground surface was validated with data from rajiv gandhi atlas and central ground water board cgwb 2016 2017 two major types of wells such as dug wells and deep wells were dominated in the upper catchment of the koel basin depth to the water table in the wells varied between 2 and 11 mbgl meter below ground level in the pre monsoon season the catchment area has been divided into five zones i e 2 4 4 6 6 8 8 10 and 10 11 at 2 mbgl intervals with different water depth values s f beven and kirkby 1979 bisson et al 2011 in six paleochannels the depth of water level lies between 2 and 11 mgbl table 3 the water levels were 6 m in other parts of the study area the depth of water level was between 10 and 11 mbgl in the southwestern part of the watershed as compared to the southeastern part of the watershed which showed good groundwater availability with the depth of water level lies between 2 and 6 mbgl it has been noted that the locations of six major paleochannel exhibited the depth of water level between 2 and 11 mbgl as shown in table 3 some of the hydro geological features that were also studied during the field works are described in this study areas of low topography were investigated where the chances of occurrence of groundwater are more the static water level in the existing wells was observed which could give useful information about the depth of the water table and flow direction the general drainage pattern was studied which controls the recharge potential of the groundwater and suggest the existence of fractures and observation of the certain type of vegetation was also seen which are indicative of the occurrence of groundwater since the structural features like dykes and faults play a significant role in the groundwater movement and accumulation we found that such areas along paleochannels sites located in the study areas turned out to be high in terms of groundwater the demarcated paleochannels locations in sentinel 2 optical data were validated using sentinel 1 based sar data fig 8 it can be observed that river meanders which form paleochannels patches can be seen in sar data typically the radar backscatter values were also very low over these six paleochannels and thereby sharp meandering boundaries can be detected 5 discussions in the contemporary period both fresh water and drinking water was scarce because of climate change morrison et al 2009 seckler et al 1999 to meet the current need for water it is imperative to understand the geology chaudhary et al 1996 and hydro geomorphological characteristics of any area the koel river basin belongs to undulating plateau terrain where groundwater exhibits complex deposition pandey and stuti 2017 praveen et al 2012 paleochannels are hydro geomorphological landforms that indicates sources of groundwater gregory 1977 clift et al 2012 in india several studies attempted to delineate palaeochannel in the desert and plain terrain areas and there are a lot of studies that address identifying channels perennial or ephemeral in erosive terrains using optical images or digital elevation models dem but there was literature gap of paleochannel studies in hard rock or plateau terrain areas jharkhand state belongs to a plateau terrain hence no studies have been attempted on paleochannel in the hard rocky terrain of jharkhand this study was undertaken over part of the koel river basin that discussed paleochannel demarcation based on gis and remote sensing technologies we aimed to demarcate paleochannels locations during pre and post monsoon seasons using both optical and sar satellite data our finding suggested that high resolution satellite data was the best and sar data corroborate it satellite based ndwi study during pre and post monsoon helped to locate the areas with high water content zones twi can enhance the wetness areas that indicate good water content zones hydrological analysis such as flow direction drainage map and closed depression areas was also used to indicate paleochannels presence drainage morphometric analysis depicts about physiological characteristics of the study area parveen et al 2012 drainage pattern helps to locate disjointed bodies of channels like ponds meanders and oxbow lakes geogory 1977 schumn 1968 paleochannels were mainly identified along with structural features like faults and lineaments etc the presence of soil moisture over the location of paleochannels is one of the key characteristics which can be identified by using high resolution satellite data nevertheless optical satellite imageries showed the effectiveness of delineating paleochannel across the world bisson et al 2011 orengo and petrie 2017 sinha 1996b among the various hydrological parameters twi has provided a better indication of surface wetness with a high value of 1 9 as shown in fig 7 thus indicates good potential zones of groundwater the embedded field based study helped to validate our work and some of the relevant field photographs were shown s f 7 therefore this unique study could be beneficial for the extraction of groundwater recharge zones by demarcating paleochannels over the upper south koel river basin the methodology adopted in this study can be adopted for any plateau terrain to delineate paleochannels and is beneficial for water resource management 6 conclusions satellite data is an invaluable tool to delineate paleochannels in plateau terrains remote sensing data optical to microwave have provided opportunities for identifying and mapping paleochannels over large spatial extents paleochannel is a hydrogeological landform of alluvial terrain extraction of paleochannel in plateau terrain is quite challenging remote sensing and gis technologies successfully demarcated palaeochannels over plateau terrain in koel basin as they have the potential to demarcate both the abandoned courses as well as recognize curvilinear or meandering segments of dry channels results obtained from the study of demarcation of palaeochannels from high resolution satellite data optical and sar satellite based indictors pre and post ndwi hydrological parameters drainage study and twi morphometric study groundwater level study and field based observations shows six major paleochannels locations along river meandering with low reflectance value and more moisture content dem data with finer resolutions are limited but very useful to compute important parameters as flow accumulation drainage and depression zone water availability along these locations was good throughout the year with dendritic drainage pattern and high depression zone as 30 to 40 along major six paleochannel locations twi value as 1 3 along palaeochannel locations indicates high moisture content zone lower drainage density and lower stream frequency showed areas of highly resistant rocks or permeable subsoil material and low relief it has been noted that the locations of six major paleochannel exhibited the depth of water level between 2 and 11 mbgl the demarcated paleochannels locations was effectively validated with sentinel 1 sar data and field based observation data this study helps to identify and map the spatial extents of paleochannels in the koel basin to enable further detailed studies about their groundwater potential and for improving land and water resource management practices furthermore the sar data proved to be a good indicator to delineate paleochannels that provide an idea about the river channel bars and meander scars because it showed lower radar backscattering associated with the paleochannels field based investigations have been used to corroborate and validate the various aspects of paleochannels the study also revealed the usefulness of geoinformatics for paleochannels delineation in hard rock terrain these findings could potentially contribute to hydrologist environmentalist and policymakers to develop water management strategies in welfare of mankind as well as in sustainable planning and management of water resources for present and upcoming generations declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential

availability for various usages is becoming a hard challenge reflecting dependency on little less exploited groundwater sources saha et al 2020 the earth s surface is covered with different morphological features paleochannel is a hydro geomorphological landform in alluvial areas which can be described as preserved geologic remnants of an ancient river or stream channels that have ceased surface flow activity the presence of paleochannels indicates active sources of groundwater and subsurface water conveyance vervoort and annen 2006 mohammed aslam et al 2015 parray et al 2018 paleochannels represent segments of old river and stream courses that are formed due to the shifting of river courses in the geological past paleochannels are geomorphological landforms that indicate the presence of good groundwater resources and are mainly found along river meanders gregory 1977 clift et al 2012 paleochannels are geomorphological records that enable insight into past hydrological processes climatic conditions floodplain activities depositional and sedimentary responses that were influenced by hydrological processes nandini et al 2013 in india paleochannel studies were first started by the ancient study of the harappa civilization on the saraswati river reflecting climate change and tectonic as the main reasons for the shifting of river meandering bhadra et al 2009 clift et al 2012 ghose et al 1979 stein 1942 tripathi et al 2004 valdiya 2013 the earliest work on the shifting of river meandering and morphology was undertaken by schumml 1968 followed by dawson and tilley 1972 hickin and nanson 1975 lewin and weir 1977 wherein they discussed paleochannel formation based on the shifting of river meandering gregory 1977b provided probably the first review in the context of river channel changes by summarizing the results of various studies on paleochannels paleochannel can be demarcated by various other techniques like aerial photography remote sensing geophysical studies isotope studies and hydrogeological studies sinha 1996 has demarcated paleochannels conditions in north bihar plain i e gangetic plain of eastern india by combining surface impression on the satellite image with field investigation nair et al 1999 carried out a study to explore the age and origin of groundwater along with a paleochannel study in the ganganagar and jaisalmer districts of rajasthan jain et al 2021 did study on simulation of groundwater flow under the influence of groundwater abstraction in parts of narmada river basin in gujarat and find large scope of groundwater development in the part of gujarat area broad studies on the paleochannel of the vedic river saraswati have been done from the beginning of the 21st century extensive studies were carried out on the palaeochannels of the vedic river saraswati valdiya 2016 2013 2002 2017 according to valdiya 2013 the geological geomorphological geophysical and remote sensing evidence suggests that saraswati was a large glacier fed river this river is greatly influenced by neotectonic activities as corroborated by the existence of several tectonic lineaments faults and seismic zones saini et al 2009 used optically stimulated luminescence osl for mapping floodplains including buried channels in the northwestern part of haryana sinha et al 2013 employed drill cores to locate paleochannels locations and their connectivity to upstreams in a part of ghaggar plains located in northwestern india technological interventions were used in the delineation of paleochannels for groundwater development in sangrur district in punjab parray et al 2018 showing an increase in the number of paleochannels due to changes in direction of flow of the river in the past and serving as an great potential source of groundwater in the areas where groundwater levels are suddenly declining multi temporal approach spectral decomposition and vegetation dynamic techniques result in a good possibility to locate paleochannels hector et al 2017 in india palaeochannels have been widely studied mainly in alluvial plain areas oldham et al 1874 1893 identified major paleochannels along the dry bed of the gagghar river and other similar paleochannels in the punjab plains the usefulness of remote sensing techniques for the mapping of paleochannels and delineation of groundwater prospect zones for water resources development plans has been demonstrated in the yamuna flood plain in uttar pradesh rao et al 2009 these studies indicated that paleochannels have good prospects of being potential aquifers samadder et al 2011 highlighted paleochannels and their potential for artificial groundwater recharge in the western ganga plains based on the identification of three major paleochannels in unconfined conditions comprising coarse grained sandy material well interconnected with the adjacent alluvial aquifers the hydraulic characteristics of the paleochannel aquifers indicate that these aquifers hold a good source of groundwater recharge the practice of combining satellite imagery and geographic information system gis for identifying and demarcating paleochannels palaeo rivers and relict watercourses in various regions throughout the world is highly adopted blumberg et al 2004 mccauley et al 1982 tapley 1988 walstra et al 2009 yang et al 1999 paleochannels as a major source of groundwater recharge were demonstrated by chaudhary et al 1996 wang et al 2012 some of the ancient research also shows the application of remote sensing in groundwater explorations aslam and balasubramanian 2001 petts 1980 phillip et al 1991 sarma 1993 carried out several studies pointing to the use of the optical and thermal image for identifying and mapping paleochannels and concluded that draping the landsat satellite imagery over a digital elevation model dem provides an inexpensive method of enhancing terrain visualization of paleochannel in alluvial plains artificial groundwater recharge sites have been identified in parts of india by researchers based on gis and remote sensing technology in order to enrich the water stressed alluvial aquifers jasrotia et al 2019 khan et al 2020 risat 1 synthetic aperture radar sar data was used by hrishikesh et al 2017 to detect paleochannels in part of the thar desert india remote sensing technologies have been used for spatial variability of the sources and distribution of fluoride in groundwater of the sanya alluvial plain aquifers in northern tanzania ijumulana et al 2022 2020 these studies have shown the convenience and effectiveness of remotely sensed satellite imagery as a tool for the identification of paleochannels there are scanty literature demonstrating studies on paleochannels over hard rock terrain in india or other parts of the world the demand for groundwater in the hard rocky terrain of jharkhand state witnessing recurrent drought conditions entails delineation of paleochannels along alluvium rich sections in major river basins it is quite challenging to extract paleochannels in hard rock terrain where the water bearing capacity of rocks depends on the development of secondary porosity in the form of interconnected fractures and joints long term climatic variability showed that rising temperatures and reduced rainfall over the koel river basin are increasing the drought events tirkey et al 2018 therefore the present study was conceived with the following specific objectives aslam and balasubramanian 2001 to delineate paleochannels in hard rock terrain areas in parts of the koel river basin by using high spatial resolution optical data and sar data blumberg et al 2004 to assess the suitability of satellite derived ndwi during pre and the post monsoon season for detecting surface wetness over paleochannels and bhadra et al 2009 to study various hydrogeological parameters i e flow direction flow accumulation drainage closed depression area twi using dem data in the present study some major locations of paleochannels were delineated and compared against the satellite derived indices and hydrogeological parameters 2 study area the study area forms a part of the koel river basin lying under plateau terrain in the state of jharkhand where water scarcity is the major challenge in this region the area encompasses five districts namely lohardaga ranchi gumla khunti and chakradharpur in the jharkhand eastern india it is located between 22 48 n and 24 41 n latitude and 83 91 e and 86 12 e longitude covering an area of 7261 km2 and comprising 82 sub watersheds developed over gently sloping undulating topography fig 1 geologically the oldest rocks encountered in these areas are unclassified metamorphics represented by mica schist hornblende schist and amphibolites which form the basement rocks in the koel river basin pandey et al 2017 parveen et al 2012 the overlying chhotanagpur gneissic complex comprising granite gneiss forms the most widespread outcrops in the area laterite metabasic dykes and recent alluvial deposit are other geological formations encountered in the area s f 1 morphology of the upper part of the study area

relict hills inselberg and pediment inselberg complex fig 2 the mean annual precipitation recorded in the area was 1000 mm the data has been taken from indian metrological department based gauge station data for the year 2015 we averaged precipitation values of four stations lying in the study area ranchi lohardagga gumla and paschimi singhbhum to have one cumulative annual precipitation value for the study area the study area is facing recurrent drought conditions and severe water scarcity due to plateau terrain maximum amount of rainfall water drained as run off 59 with very little water available for infiltration and groundwater recharge pandey et al 2017 around 36 34 of rainfall water contributed towards infiltration and groundwater recharge with 4 66 as evapotranspiration typically the total volume of surface water drained into the koel river and karo river two major soil textures as coarse loamy and fine dominant over the koel river basin nbsslup 2020 3 materials and methods the satellite dataset used to delineated paleochannels in parts of the koel river basin includes sentinel 2 and sar data the detailed characteristics of satellite data were given in table 1 3 1 data used 3 1 1 sentinel 2a optical data and sentinel 1 sar data the sentinel 2 optical data was acquired from usgs https earthexploree usgs gov acquired for the month of june and october 2017 sentinel 2 june 05 2017 and october 30 2017 the data acquired in june belong to pre monsoon whereas data obtained in october represents the post monsoon season the spatial resolution of sentinel 2 is 10 m it has 13 spectral bands in visible near infrared and short wave infrared for this study we used blue blumberg et al 2004 green bhadra et al 2009 red barling et al 1994 and nir chaudhary et al 1996 bands to perform a paleochannel study sentinel 1 sar data was downloaded from the alaska science facility https asf alaska edu data sets sar data sets sentinel 1 the c band 5 40 ghz data with vh polarization was acquired for the month of may 2017 pre monsoon for identifying major paleochannels locations during the dry season 3 1 2 2 dem data aster dem gdem v2 data were downloaded from usgs https earthexploree usgs gov with a spatial resolution of 30 m 3 1 3 topographical data toposheet of 1 50 000 scale was acquired from survey of india soi the study area lies in soi toposheet no 73 a 14 73 a 15 73 e 2 and 73 e 3 covering the lohardaga and ranchi districts of jharkhand these data was used for delineating the drainage network and for morphometric analysis in parts of the upper catchment of the study area 3 2 methods the pre processing of satellite data was performed using erdas imagine quantum and saga gis and snap software both sentinel 2 and sentinel 1 data were re projected to a common coordinate system called geographic longitude and latitude with the datum of wgs 1984 using the sentinel 2 ndwi pre and post monsoon was computed major paleochannel locations were delineated by using sentinel 1 sar data using the dem data flow characteristics such as flow accumulation flow direction drainage and depression zones have been computed the topographic wetness index twi was computed the self explanatory flowchart adopted in the present work is presented in fig 3 3 2 1 data processing high resolution optical data sentinel 2 was used to demarcate paleochannels in the study area based on visual image interpretation techniques visual image interpretation of satellite image is mainly done based on seven image interpretation keys i e shape size tone texture pattern association and shadow processing of sentinel data was done by using arc gis 10 2 and erdas imagine 14 software in addition to optical data the major paleochannel locations were also delineated by using sar data sentinel 1 for validating optical based paleochannel locations the pre processing steps applied to sentinel 1 sar data are radiometric calibration speckle filtering and terrain correction in this study we used vh bands for delineating paleochannel locations 3 2 2 satellite based indicators the normalized difference water index ndwi was first introduced by mcfeeters in 1996 that helped to identify or locate surface waters in wetland environments and to allow for the measurement of surface water extent mcfeeters 1996 according to mcfeeters ndwi values greater than zero are likely to represent water surfaces whereas values less than or equal to zero are assumed to be non water zone the values of ndwi were calculated from the sentinel 2 image using equation aslam and balasubramanian 2001 ndwi for pre and post monsoon periods have been computed to demarcate the seasonal waterlogged area or the area where high moisture remains throughout the years 1 n d w i x g r e e n x n i r x g r e e n x n i r where ndwi normalized difference water index x n i r near infrared band x g r e e n green band the ndwi index employs green and nir bands because the maximum reflectance of water is obtained from green bands while high reflectance of vegetation cover and soil features from nir as a result water features have positive values and thus are enhanced while vegetation and soil usually have zero or negative values and therefore are suppressed mcfeeters 1996 3 2 3 hydrological parameters the drainage flow direction and depressed zone maps i e dimensionless factors have been created using the aster dem in arc gis and q gis software the flow direction has been estimated based on the slope direction concerning to its neighboring cell when the direction of the steepest descent has been found the output cell has been coded with the value demonstrating that direction if all neighbors are higher than the current processing cell it is deliberated as noise and is filled using the lowest value of its neighbor s cells getirana et al 2009 jenson and domingue 1988 the flow direction of water is determined by the eight directions pour point model based on the concept i e in a gridded system water can only flow to one of eight adjacent cells getirana et al 2009 the slope is the ultimate factor through which water flows in one or more of its eight adjacent cells the drainage map was prepared by considering the basin map and flow direction maps as input to spatial analysis tools in arc gis the basin flow direction drainage and closed depression maps were derived from dem which helped to analyze curvilinear meandering change and depressed zone areas 3 2 4 topographic wetness index twi topographic wetness index twi has been calculated using dem data using equation blumberg et al 2004 as given by grimm et al 2018 2 twi in a s tan β where a s is the upslope flow accumulation area or drainage area per unit contour length wilson and gallant 2000 2000 and β is the angle of the slope twi has found a wide range of applications in hydrology qin et al 2011 sørensen and seibert 2007 twi index is based on the concept of two grid cells that have similar twi values twi will saturate at the surface under similar basin moisture conditions given their combined contributing areas and local slope gradients it is a dimensionless index that is based on the concept of relative ranking of cells i e when grid cells become saturated then the higher value cell becomes more saturated than the lower values cells and negative twi values are placed in the driest locations in the basin this model uses an algorithm that is used to handle the flat areas reasonably well but results in some striping in the direction of the processing left right then down etc this results from the fact that we sort the elevation values from highest to lowest moving from the top left corner to the bottom right during the short when a large depression or flat area is reached temporally elevated the current cell to force flow into neighbors this is due to the sorting occurring from left to right and down which results in stripping twi can quantify the effect of topography on runoff generation and serves as a physically based index approximating the location of zones of surface saturation and the spatial distribution of soil and water barling et al 1994 and beven et al 1979 3 2 5 morphometric parameters in this study paleochannels in the upper catchment of the study area have been discussed and thereby the morphometric of the upper catchment were generated toposheet of 1 50 000 scale was used only for delineating the drainage network and each drainage has been digitized manually using the visual image interpretation technique morphometric analysis is the study of drainage characteristics and we consider a topographic map for the more accurate results than that of aster dem because in aster dem some of the linear features like rail and road networks were showing up as drainage line features hence we did not use aster dem major morphometric parameters namely stream order stream length drainage density bifurcation ratio elongation ratio and texture ratio have been calculated by using formulas given by horton 1945 and strahler 1964 morphometric analysis has been performed to analyze the quantitative description of basin geometry and to understand inequalities in the rock hardness structural controls geological and geomorphic history of the drainage basin strahler 1964 3 2 6 field data a field visit has been conducted on january 20 2017 that covers five districts of jharkhand in select locations 50 gps points have been collected from the upper catchment of the koel river basin the study emphasis showing major six paleochannels locations the numbers of wells types of wells and depth of wells from the ground surface have been collected during fieldwork furthermore these parameters were obtained from the central groundwater board cgwb field data was used for the validation of results related to locations of paleochannels the depth of water level map was generated using field data over the six paleochannel locations by using the interpolation technique in the arc gis platform over the upper catchment of the koel river basin 4 results 4 1 demarcation of palaeochannels paleochannels in 15 locations were demarcated and out of them only major six paleochannels located in the upper catchment of the koel river basin were highlighted to characterize the paleochannels over hard rock terrain fig 4 a it has been observed that paleochannels were mainly associated with the river bodies the study from sar data results as palaeochannels patches which found along the river boundaries because of the shifting of old river meanders six major paleochannels locations have been highlighted in satellite images that showed the presence of paleochannels along river meandering with more moisture content fig 4 b the reflectance values of these paleochannels locations were lower due to the wetted surface 4 2 satellite based indicators to characterize paleochannels over the part of the koel river basin the ndwi during june pre monsoon and october post monsoon 2017 has been shown in fig 5 and s f 2 the values of ndwi of pre and post monsoons vary between lower 0 05 to higher 0 65 values respectively the negative and lower ndwi indicate a non water zone while the high value indicates a water zone in pre monsoon most of the areas were marked with low ndwi which was indicative of a non water zone however higher ndwi was observed over the major six paleochannels which indicates the availability of water along these zones in post monsoon most of the area covered with high ndwi value including six paleochannel locations that attributed to seasonal waterlogged conditions further it can be noted that the marked six paleochannel locations showed relatively high moisture content than surroundings as indicated by very high ndwi ndwi during pre and post monsoon analysis showed the availability of water along the six major zones and indicates that these locations are good in the rospect of water availability throughout the years and can be considered as paleochannel locations 4 3 hydrological parameters a dendritic drainage pattern has been observed over the upper part of the koel river basin with a total of 26 000 river channel streams for entire catchment areas fig 6 the catchment area was dominated by first order streams and ended with seventh order drainage streams the hydrological analysis showed characteristics of river channels over the major six paleochannel locations curvilinear path of river channels has been identified along major paleochannel zones which indicated the presence of old river channels and one of the good indicators for the storage of surface and groundwater the drainage map showed the formation of river meanders along with the major six locations that are one of the main causes of the shifting of water bodies and the formation of paleochannels from one side to another s f 3 the closed depression zone has been mapped as a hydrological indicator s f 4 and these results showed that low lying areas were associated with paleochannels the depression zone varied from 0 to 42 over the koel river basin whereas a depression zone between 30 and 42 was noticed over the major six paleochannels which is indicative of wetness zone low lying zones displayed more than 30 depression values and were indicative of potential water storage zones so the probability of the presence of water in these low lying zones could be higher compared to other areas of the catchment 4 4 topographic wetted index twi twi was used to quantify topographic control on hydrological processes the value of twi was between 2 and 1 3 a higher value showed a high moisture content zone or wetted zone whereas the low value indicated a less moisture content zone fig 7 six major paleochannels locations showed a high value of 1 3 which indicates high moisture content zone or wetted zone and is indicative of the presence of water in these paleochannels locations 4 5 morphometric aspects of sub watershed morphometric analysis has been carried out over the upper part of the koel river basin as per an earlier study the selected watershed has runoff as 59 of total annual precipitation in other words 4 66 evapotranspiration which has been calculated using penmen potential evapotranspiration rao et al 2009 which indicates 36 34 of rainfall water infiltrates and recharges groundwater pandey et al 2017 hence morphometric analysis has been carried out to analyses the quantitative analyze of the drainage network morphometric aspects indicated that the koel basin was characterized by resistant rocks different morphometric parameters have been calculated and shown in table 2 drainage density and stream frequency of the watershed has been calculated as 1 47 km 1 lower drainage density and lower stream frequency showed areas of highly resistant rocks or permeable subsoil material and low relief low drainage density leads to coarse drainage texture drainage texture was between 1 and 4 which is indicative of a very coarse to a coarse texture the elongation ratio re of the watershed is shown as 0 82 indicating the oval shape of the basin a circular or oval basin is more efficient in the discharge of run off than an elongated basin which is prone to erosion the circulatory ratio rc value has been calculated as 0 65 indicating a circular basin the value of rc was between 0 23 and 0 79 and a higher the value represents more circularity in the shape of the basin with a maximum rate of soil erosion as compared to a lower value that showed a square or triangular shape with a lower rate of erosion the length of the overland flow value for the watershed is 0 34 which indicates high relief bifurcation ratio value i e 3 29 showed less structural distortion in upper catchments of the watershed indicating tectonic activities and concomitant adjustment of the drainage network 4 6 groundwater levels as derived from cgwb data the depth of water level from the ground surface was validated with data from rajiv gandhi atlas and central ground water board cgwb 2016 2017 two major types of wells such as dug wells and deep wells were dominated in the upper catchment of the koel basin depth to the water table in the wells varied between 2 and 11 mbgl meter below ground level in the pre monsoon season the catchment area has been divided into five zones i e 2 4 4 6 6 8 8 10 and 10 11 at 2 mbgl intervals with different water depth values s f beven and kirkby 1979 bisson et al 2011 in six paleochannels the depth of water level lies between 2 and 11 mgbl table 3 the water levels were 6 m in other parts of the study area the depth of water level was between 10 and 11 mbgl in the southwestern part of the watershed as compared to the southeastern part of the watershed which showed good groundwater availability with the depth of water level lies between 2 and 6 mbgl it has been noted that the locations of six major paleochannel exhibited the depth of water level between 2 and 11 mbgl as shown in table 3 some of the hydro geological features that were also studied during the field works are described in this study areas of low topography were investigated where the chances of occurrence of groundwater are more the static water level in the existing wells was observed which could give useful information about the depth of the water table and flow direction the general drainage pattern was studied which controls the recharge potential of the groundwater and suggest the existence of fractures and observation of the certain type of vegetation was also seen which are indicative of the occurrence of groundwater since the structural features like dykes and faults play a significant role in the groundwater movement and accumulation we found that such areas along paleochannels sites located in the study areas turned out to be high in terms of groundwater the demarcated paleochannels locations in sentinel 2 optical data were validated using sentinel 1 based sar data fig 8 it can be observed that river meanders which form paleochannels patches can be seen in sar data typically the radar backscatter values were also very low over these six paleochannels and thereby sharp meandering boundaries can be detected 5 discussions in the contemporary period both fresh water and drinking water was scarce because of climate change morrison et al 2009 seckler et al 1999 to meet the current need for water it is imperative to understand the geology chaudhary et al 1996 and hydro geomorphological characteristics of any area the koel river basin belongs to undulating plateau terrain where groundwater exhibits complex deposition pandey and stuti 2017 praveen et al 2012 paleochannels are hydro geomorphological landforms that indicates sources of groundwater gregory 1977 clift et al 2012 in india several studies attempted to delineate palaeochannel in the desert and plain terrain areas and there are a lot of studies that address identifying channels perennial or ephemeral in erosive terrains using optical images or digital elevation models dem but there was literature gap of paleochannel studies in hard rock or plateau terrain areas jharkhand state belongs to a plateau terrain hence no studies have been attempted on paleochannel in the hard rocky terrain of jharkhand this study was undertaken over part of the koel river basin that discussed paleochannel demarcation based on gis and remote sensing technologies we aimed to demarcate paleochannels locations during pre and post monsoon seasons using both optical and sar satellite data our finding suggested that high resolution satellite data was the best and sar data corroborate it satellite based ndwi study during pre and post monsoon helped to locate the areas with high water content zones twi can enhance the wetness areas that indicate good water content zones hydrological analysis such as flow direction drainage map and closed depression areas was also used to indicate paleochannels presence drainage morphometric analysis depicts about physiological characteristics of the study area parveen et al 2012 drainage pattern helps to locate disjointed bodies of channels like ponds meanders and oxbow lakes geogory 1977 schumn 1968 paleochannels were mainly identified along with structural features like faults and lineaments etc the presence of soil moisture over the location of paleochannels is one of the key characteristics which can be identified by using high resolution satellite data nevertheless optical satellite imageries showed the effectiveness of delineating paleochannel across the world bisson et al 2011 orengo and petrie 2017 sinha 1996b among the various hydrological parameters twi has provided a better indication of surface wetness with a high value of 1 9 as shown in fig 7 thus indicates good potential zones of groundwater the embedded field based study helped to validate our work and some of the relevant field photographs were shown s f 7 therefore this unique study could be beneficial for the extraction of groundwater recharge zones by demarcating paleochannels over the upper south koel river basin the methodology adopted in this study can be adopted for any plateau terrain to delineate paleochannels and is beneficial for water resource management 6 conclusions satellite data is an invaluable tool to delineate paleochannels in plateau terrains remote sensing data optical to microwave have provided opportunities for identifying and mapping paleochannels over large spatial extents paleochannel is a hydrogeological landform of alluvial terrain extraction of paleochannel in plateau terrain is quite challenging remote sensing and gis technologies successfully demarcated palaeochannels over plateau terrain in koel basin as they have the potential to demarcate both the abandoned courses as well as recognize curvilinear or meandering segments of dry channels results obtained from the study of demarcation of palaeochannels from high resolution satellite data optical and sar satellite based indictors pre and post ndwi hydrological parameters drainage study and twi morphometric study groundwater level study and field based observations shows six major paleochannels locations along river meandering with low reflectance value and more moisture content dem data with finer resolutions are limited but very useful to compute important parameters as flow accumulation drainage and depression zone water availability along these locations was good throughout the year with dendritic drainage pattern and high depression zone as 30 to 40 along major six paleochannel locations twi value as 1 3 along palaeochannel locations indicates high moisture content zone lower drainage density and lower stream frequency showed areas of highly resistant rocks or permeable subsoil material and low relief it has been noted that the locations of six major paleochannel exhibited the depth of water level between 2 and 11 mbgl the demarcated paleochannels locations was effectively validated with sentinel 1 sar data and field based observation data this study helps to identify and map the spatial extents of paleochannels in the koel basin to enable further detailed studies about their groundwater potential and for improving land and water resource management practices furthermore the sar data proved to be a good indicator to delineate paleochannels that provide an idea about the river channel bars and meander scars because it showed lower radar backscattering associated with the paleochannels field based investigations have been used to corroborate and validate the various aspects of paleochannels the study also revealed the usefulness of geoinformatics for paleochannels delineation in hard rock terrain these findings could potentially contribute to hydrologist environmentalist and policymakers to develop water management strategies in welfare of mankind as well as in sustainable planning and management of water

11766,this study spatially characterizes the potential and pressure of the supply of groundwater resources in brazil indicators obtained from ordinary kriging kernel density estimation and multivariate geovisualization techniques using the brazilian groundwater information system siagas were proposed the cartographic results culminated in maps of the potential and pressure of groundwater use in brazil and proved to be promising for the planning and management of water resources sedimentary basins had the highest specific yield 2 16 m3 h m and stabilization yield 11 19 m3 h as well as the greatest total abstraction pressure 1054967 m3 h although they had lower exploitation by aquifer area 0 54 m3 h km2 than carbonate 1 91 m3 h km2 and volcanic aquifers 0 80 m3 h km2 contrastingly crystalline aquifers had the lowest specific yield 0 63 m3 h m and stabilization yield 5 71 m3 h specifically it highlights the potential use of the alter do chão aquifer in northern brazil and the western guarani and bauru caú aquifers while they indicate a concern with the pressure of use on these last two aquifers as well as on the urucuia aquifer and on the metropolitan

caused several problems including the differentiated pressure balance on the subsoil with subsequent cases of land subsidence and even collapse affecting buildings and other infrastructure works freeze and cherry 1979 rebouças 2008 in addition to significant impacts on natural underground and surface flows due to the significant reduction in aquifer levels wicander and monroe 2008 this growing demand for groundwater use reflects economic development tundisi and tundisi 2011 ana 2017a and is a phenomenon which has been observed in several countries coelho and havens 2016 thus with the growing consequences of the increased use of aquifers the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco emphasized the importance of developing indicators for groundwater management vrba and lipponen 2007 in this context vrba and lipponen 2007 proposed the development of indicators for groundwater management based on available and updatable data for each country however the assessment of exploitable resources is challenging due to the geological complexity of reservoirs and underground flow patterns impairing the quality of predictions of the exploitation consequences of these resources feitosa and feitosa 2008 an indicator arises from a simplified model of reality to communicate and support decisions taken by managers in planning monitoring and setting guidelines for environmental management goals transmitting information adapted to each sector and local interest magalhães júnior 2012 in this context they can be useful for the rational and sustainable use of aquifers to promote human development and well being coelho and havens 2016 groundwater indicators studies focusing on recharge potentiality javadi et al 2021 and discharge baseflow based on hydrological gauges stations are a useful approach for groundwater studies olabode 2019 however the spatial scarcity of rainfall and gauging stations in developing countries makes the spatial resolution basins coarser besides adding uncertainty to the interpolated climatological data other studies on groundwater indicators focus on vulnerability to contamination javadi et al 2011 such as the god foster 1987 and drastic aller et al 1987 methods but their resolutions are constrained by the geological and soil maps which also have coarse resolution at national level for developing countries numerical modeling of aquifer dynamics such as the modflow method langevin et al 2017 can be used to extrapolate aquifer properties in space and time as well as simulating scenarios malmir et al 2021 however this approach is better suited mostly for porous aquifers and furthermore requires a reliable three dimensional model of lithological layers which is often absent for many aquifers the use of direct data interpolated directly from the locations of the wells is still a promising but less explored way to increase resolution and show the internal variability within geological domains and it is the main methodological contribution of this paper although this paper deals only with groundwater quantity from data of the wells other relevant and complementary approaches also include groundwater quality pollution sources el osta et al 2022a physicochemical suitability for distinct uses el osta et al 2022b and integration with socioeconomic data vrba and lipponen 2007 in coastal aquifers there is a relevant interplay between all these factors because over exploitation may lead to the advance of saline seawater on continental groundwater sources saatsaz et al 2013 a previous schematic map of specific yield for wells at brazilian scale was provided by rebouças 2008 at a very coarse resolution before the data from the brazilian groundwater information system sistema de informações de águas subterrâneas siagas became available in this context the current paper relevance for groundwater management in brazil is providing spatial information regarding groundwater resources with a level of detail that was not available before the spatial heterogeneity of pressure for groundwater still has not been evaluated at national scale in brazil and is another contribution of this paper groundwater is the main source of water supply to 43 of the brazilian municipalities and 15 of the brazilian population ana 2021 groundwater use has increased through the last decades hirata et al 2009 especially due to droughts that have repeatedly affected the surface water supply systems abas 2015 vasconcelos et al 2017 suggested that the study of the yield and the variation of the piezometric level of tube wells can produce indicators regarding the potential of conjunctive use strategies surface and underground water that obtain a more stable supply with less environmental impact vasconcelos et al 2013 used indicators from the siagas database a base of well characteristics available for the brazilian territory to study patterns of underground water circulation the general objective of this paper is the proposition of indicators for the determination and interpretation of quantitative and qualitative data recognition and management of the use of groundwater in brazil using a national database provided by siagas taking into account the influence of lithological affinities and hydrogeological potential the specific objectives of this paper are contribute to the improvement of discussions on vulnerability feasibility and cost effectiveness of groundwater use produce maps of the proposed indicators to serve as a water resource management tool contribute to discussions about the impacts of underground water extraction in brazil and identify its potentialities and pressures fill through interpolation using geostatistical models the stabilization and specific yield gaps of the original database propose a framework of multivariate geovisualization of groundwater use indicators which can be easily implemented and updated with widely available well s databases at diverse spatial scales in many countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 indicators from the database available from siagas a total of 299 227 wells were obtained 1 data extraction took place between december 2017 and february 2018 siagas is updated almost daily so only data from wells that were registered until february 28 2018 were downloaded 1 for the entire brazilian territory each well containing georeferenced information regarding location yield and quantitative monitoring pumping test among other information to determine the indicators the following variables provided by the system were used yield stabilization yield specific yield static level dynamic level final depth and well situation fig 1 although specific yield is a usual indicator for groundwater management frameworks saatsaz et al 2013 as well as piezometric level drawdown malmir et al 2021 this paper innovates exploring how these indicators and other usually available well data can be integrated for estimating distinct aspects of groundwater potentiality and use pressure according to the dpsir driver pressure state impact response framework oecd 1993 adapted to groundwater indicators as proposed by malmir et al 2021 the current study focused on the pressure for water use the state as potentiality for groundwater use and the impacts on aquifer level possible drivers and responses were discussed for selected aquifers the indicators for the use or conservation preservation of groundwater in brazil were defined as stabilization yield m³ h representation of the measure of the volume of water that is extracted in the well for a given period continuously and stably against the lowering of the piezometric potential being a general indicator of groundwater use for this indicator when there was information in the yield attribute the stabilization yield indicator was filled with it otherwise it would be filled with the value of the stabilization yield attribute from siagas as well fig 2 as there are wells with both empty or zero attributes these were discarded stabilization yield density represents how much groundwater is explored in different regions of the country indicating the pressure of resource use in relation to the surface area the stabilization yield density indicator is the result of a cartographic manipulation through the use of a kernel function applied to the stabilization yield indicator depth m an indicator of viable aquifer exploration potential viable exploration can be understood as the conjunction of physical factors presence of water and performability of rocks combined with economic technological and water demand factors that also vary in each region cost effectiveness m³ h m obtained from the ratio between the stabilization yield of the well and its drilling depth where wells with higher yield and with less depth have the best cost benefit indicators in constructive terms given the volume of water produced per unit of time with the least expenditure invested in construction drawdown m calculated from the difference between the static and dynamic level values obtained from the pumping test it represents an indicator of the aquifer s vulnerability to drawdown during groundwater exploitation the static level is the depth of the water inside the well without pumping while the dynamic level indicates the water level while the well is being pumped and always corresponds to a certain yield stabilization yield obtained during the same pumping test the lowering of the water level increases the velocity and causes a reversal in the direction of groundwater flow thus the drawdown increases the vulnerability of wells regarding the volume of water available over time and their susceptibility to contamination drawdown density indicates the impact of extraction of the groundwater resource in relation to the surface area that is how much groundwater pumping has impacted aquifers in different regions this indicator is the result of a cartographic manipulation through the use of a kernel function applied to the drawdown indicator specific yield m³ h m calculated by dividing the stabilization yield by the drawdown it is indicative of the potential use of groundwater available for exploitation when there was information in the specific yield attribute the specific yield indicator was filled with it otherwise it would be filled with the quotient between the stabilization yield and the drawdown if there were wells with a zero for specific yield value these were discarded fig 3 potentiality multivariate map obtained through the simple average of the standardized indicators of cost benefit drawdown stabilization yield and specific yield with the first two cartographic products obtained from the interpolation performed during this work usage pressure multivariate map obtained from a simple average of the standardized drawdown density and stabilization yield density indicators both using the same kernel radius suitability for groundwater use a set of maps using multivariate geovisualization techniques which summarize the results of the last two indicators mentioned potentiality and usage pressure after calculating the indicators for each well the wells were divided by hydrogeological domain cprm 2007 fig 4 a set of geological units with similar characteristics in terms of groundwater the hydrogeological domains are delimited based on the lithological characteristics of the rocks by their inferred storage conditions porosity flow permeability occurrence conditions length thickness and structure exploitability easy regular difficult and natural recharge rain infiltration mente 2008 rebouças 2008 as depicted in fig 4 the porous cenozoic formation is the most extensive domain in brazil especially in the amazonic northern region often overlaying or interconnected to sedimentary basins the fissural intertwined crystalline and metasedimentary domains also cover most of the other half of the territory except for the extensive volcanic domains in southern brazil nevertheless there is still no systematic spatial information at brazilian national level of hydraulic parameters groundwater recharge and discharge of each hydrogeological domain this lack of information on a national scale highlights the relevance of results of this paper for a general evaluation of groundwater potentiality in brazil 2 2 interpolation by kriging interpolations were performed using the geostatistical method of ordinary kriging with the geostatistical analyst extension for arcgis to estimate the values of the stabilization yield depth cost effectiveness drawdown and specific yield indicators a logarithmic transformation of the data was used to approximate them to a normal distribution each indicator resulted in seven geostatistical models one for each hydrogeological domain with the subsequent combination of them in a mosaic to result in a single map for brazil per indicator fig 5 the kriging parameters were calibrated through internal cross validation of well data for each hydrogeological domain assuring a better match with their distinct hydrogeological spatial dynamics then from the results obtained from the interpolation using the ordinary kriging method for drawdown and stabilization yield the previously discarded data from wells with missing information were filled with the values produced by the adopted geostatistical model resulting in a dataset with these estimated values this new dataset was used for the creation of density maps detailed in the following subsection 2 3 2 3 kernel density estimation using the technique of kernel density estimation kde the stabilization yield density and drawdown density indicators were mapped with these kernel maps it is possible to illustrate the impact of underground water extraction that is the effects of the extraction of this resource in a certain area unit km 2 in this study throughout the national territory the kde parameters were evaluated in two ways a choosing a radius and function that provide the maximum differentiation of the regions on the map carlos et al 2010 kuter et al 2011 equation 1 1 s e a r c h r a d i u s 0 9 min s d 1 i n 2 d m n 0 2 where sd is the standard distance between points dm is the median distance n is the sum of the values of the attribute field for each point esri 2008 b choosing an optimization parameter to perform the point density for prediction the root mean square error rmse by cross validation hart and zandbergen 2014 ruckthongsook et al 2018 sequentially we chose a radius with the best balance between the greater differentiation prescribed by equation 1 and the lesser loss in predictive power smallest average squared error using the elbow rule i e finding in a graph the radius after which the rmse stabilizes at the same time that it is closer to the greater differentiation obtained in equation 1 the geoprocessing tool used was the kernel smoothing of the geostatistical wizard in the arcgis software using the quartic kernel function for the generation of the raster the kernel density tool of spatial analyst for arcgis was used 2 4 groundwater resource demand by hydrogeological domain the water demands in each hydrogeological domain cprm 2007 were investigated yield per area in km2 the stabilization yield data were then separated by their domains and the values of the indicator in question were added zonal statistics were performed separating the features by the hydrogeological domains from the result of the interpolated stabilization yield and specific yield data to obtain their average for each domain for this calculation the point database of the stabilization yield indicator was used considering only the wells whose situation reported by siagas was empty pumping equipped or precarious excluding wells in the situations closed abandoned clogged unusable not installed stopped dry and monitoring well equipped with automatic level gauge 2 5 multivariate geovisualization five multivariate geovisualization maps were developed to interpret in an integrated manner the univariate indicators produced for the use of groundwater as suggested by vasconcelos et al 2017 the first one illustrates the potential use of groundwater and was obtained through the average of the standardized values z score fig 6 between the variables of the indicators obtained by interpolation stabilization yield cost benefit lowering and specific yield the depth indicator was not used for the potentiality map because the greater depth may indicate that there is a greater exploitable volume of aquifers however it may also be a reflection of the need to drill more due to very low specific yield insufficient to meet the demands if the wells are too shallow the second map illustrates regions of the brazilian territory where there is pressure for the use of groundwater fig 6 and was obtained by averaging the standardized values of the kernel maps that is the yield density and drawdown density maps both with a search radius of 40 km from these two multivariate maps potentiality and pressure another three were produced fig 6 the first map of the set is based on the simple average of the aggregated indicators of potentiality and pressure of use the second map is a bivariate composition red and blue color axes of the same two layers used in the previous map pressure and potential based on the theory of additive color mixing grassmann 1854 the last multivariate map is a map using the iso cluster method by iterative migration of means ball and hall 1965 richards 2013 developed by combining indicators of potentiality and pressure of water use indicating where they are combined singularly 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics table 1 contains the results of the medians means and their respective standard deviations for stabilization yield depth cost benefit drawdown and specific yield indicators separated by hydrogeological domains the indicators point out that the hydrogeological domains with the best exploitation characteristics high yield good cost effectiveness and less drawdown are sedimentary basins cenozoic formations and carbonates metacarbonates the volcanic and mixed aquifers porous fissure had intermediate values while the crystalline and metasedimentary metavolcanic aquifers had the worst values a more detailed analysis of descriptive statistics is presented in the appendix table 2 presents the results of zonal statistics on kriged surfaces performed for all domains considering the indicators stabilization yield and specific yield the results follow the same trends as in table 1 although they are calculated by averaging the area pixels rather than the number of individual wells 3 2 stabilization yield depth cost effectiveness drawdown and specific yield maps below in fig 7 two maps of each indicator are always presented the first contains the result of the interpolation by ordinary kriging while the second contains the standard deviation related to the generated model which can be used as an indicator of estimation uncertainty the adjustments performed by the variograms are presented in the appendix regions with more data i e more wells registered in siagas in this case southeast and northeast and which have more even sampling across the surface tend to present fewer uncertainties in the results generated by the interpolation in this respect the respective standard deviation maps of the interpolations have in general the highest values precisely in the northern region of the country that is where there are fewer wells in the database and or have a greater distance between them reflecting the lower demographic density and consequently the demand for the use of this natural resource however other factors such as heterogeneity in the characteristics of nearby wells can also affect the standard deviation finally to provide a complete database the gaps referring to stabilization yield and specific yíeld of the database downloaded from siagas were filled from the interpolation performed and the information regarding the standard deviation was added from the ordinary kriging results these can be accessed through a repository provided by this study 2 2 available at https drive google com drive folders 15ps2tly8qtqkj1yietuc mvskynue2wj 3 3 groundwater demand by hydrogeological domain table 3 shows the results of demand for the water resource showing in which domain more groundwater is being extracted and its relation to the total area of the hydrogeological domains density it should be noted again that the data in table 3 refer to a sampling of existing wells recognizing that there will be several unregistered wells in this context ana 2021 estimated that the wells registered in the siagas database would be approximately 13 of the total number of wells in brazil however based on the simplified assumption that unregistered wells have spatial distribution and characteristics similar to those registered these values serve as indicators for relative comparison between the different domains analyzing the total value of stabilization yield the sedimentary basins and cenozoic formations domains both porous are the ones with the largest underground water extraction in brazil while the porous fissural mixed domain has the lowest production even as it is not the smallest in area considering the total stabilization yield by domain area there is more groundwater being extracted per square kilometer in the carbonates metacarbonates fissure domains followed by the volcanic rocks domain this result indicates the potential for using porous aquifers that are possibly being less explored 3 4 stabilization yield density and drawdown density the maps in fig 8 show the stabilization yield a and drawdown b kernel density maps based on a 40 km kernel radius intermediate between the optimum capacity of forecasting and the optimal capacity of differentiating areas the stabilization yield density map illustrates the aggregated pressure of water use while the drawdown density map indicates the aggregated impact in the aquifer a detailed description of the analysis for the kernel radius is given in the appendix the results demonstrate a greater yield density in the northeast and south regions of the country the metropolitan region of são paulo in southeastern brazil has both high yield density and the highest drawdown density 3 5 integrated indicator maps using multivariate geovisualization the first multivariate map illustrates the potential for using groundwater fig 9 a considering the cost benefit lowering stabilization yield and specific yield indicators the second map illustrates regions of the brazilian territory where there is pressure for the use of groundwater fig 9 b indicating the intensity with which this resource is extracted and used and may bring caution to the expansion of the use of this type of water resource in these locations the map in fig 9 c shows the balance between potential and pressure by the simple average between the maps in fig 9 a and 9 b another geovisualization option is the bivariate map fig 9 d the darker the color i e closer to the upper right corner of the bivariate legend the better the region s water performance as it means greater potential and less pressure on the resource the bluish areas upper left corner of the bivariate legend which have small spots on the map indicate areas where there is a high potential for the use of groundwater but there is already a strong pressure for use the areas in lighter red lower right corner of the legend however which are more prevalent in southern brazil have relatively less potential and less pressure for use in combination the last multivariate map fig 9 e shows the results of the isocluster of indicators of potentiality and pressure of groundwater use the table in the legend indicates which and how much of each indicator influences the four resulting groups regarding a reference mean of zero standard deviations thus group 1 presents a value of 0 14 for potentiality and 1 71 for pressure that is this group emphasizes more strongly the influence of the indicator of greater pressure in the use of water resources than potentiality demonstrating concern about the use of groundwater group 4 has a value of 1 27 for potential and 0 08 for pressure that is this group emphasizes the influence of the indicator of the potential use of the water resource more than the pressure of use on it making this group preferential to expanding the use of aquifers groups 2 and 3 have intermediate values and their results are more tenuous when compared to groups 1 and 4 group 2 presents a value of 0 61 for potentiality and 0 02 for pressure indicating that its pressure on the use of the resource is not so significant but its potential is even less so the northeastern hinterland most of the southeastern and southern states and almost all goiás center of the country are mostly located in group 2 group 3 however presents a value of 0 08 for potentiality and 0 11 for pressure that is the potentiality although not as significant as pointed out in group 4 is still relatively greater than the pressure on the use of groundwater therefore these are areas with some potential yet to be explored 4 discussion spatially the greatest potential for groundwater use occurred in the north of the country amazon basin some points in the state of bahia urucuia and marizal aquifers and parts of the midwest and southeast paraná basin these regions when confronted with the map of hydrogeological domains of brazil fig 4 indicate predominantly porous aquifer outcrops in agreement with the results found in the statistical analysis tables 1 and 2 the main areas of concern are the metropolitan regions especially são paulo in southeastern brazil with low potential and high pressure for the use of groundwater several coastal capitals in northeastern brazil also have low potential and high usage pressure the previous brazilian map of specific yield provided by rebouças 2008 despite its coarser spatial resolution conforms to the general patters with the one provided in fig 8 e with higher values in northern and western brazil however the higher spatial resolution of fig 8 e was able to better identify the characteristics of each aquifer especially the urucuia and marizal fig 9 f which did not appear on the rebouças 2008 map ana 2021 estimated the aquifer recharge in the spatial resolution of the main large watersheds in brazil proposing a sustainable groundwater abstraction limit for these basins the highest recharge rates for example 5553 8 m3 s in tapajós madeira basin as well as sustainable abstraction limits are in the amazon region in the basins that may contribute with regional groundwater flows to alter do chão aquifer in consonance with the findings of this paper the western half of paraná basin also has higher recharge rates approximately 2200 m3 s and sustainable abstraction limits than the eastern half recharge rate of approximately 1000 m3 s adding more relevance to the potential of expansion of groundwater use for this area the coastal aquifers of brazil on the other hand where most of groundwater use pressure of metropolitan regions are located have the lowest recharge rates usually below 75 m3 s and sustainable abstraction limits when compared to the rest of the country this pattern raises more concern regarding over abstraction in coastal areas and the consequent intrusion of saline water in these aquifers a detailed discussion on the selected aquifers that present the greatest potential and pressure on the elaborated indicators fig 6 f is presented in the next subsections 4 1 amazon basin alter do chão the alter do chão aquifer has the greatest potential for use in brazil and is a sedimentary aquifer with low use pressure except in the urbanized area of manaus in riverine communities in the alter do chão aquifer region access to groundwater can provide an alternative for better water quality that is lower water treatment costs when compared to surface waters with a higher content of organic matter and bacteria however as studied by azevedo 2006 because the alter do chão aquifer is located under the floodplain of the amazon river care is needed to avoid contamination of wells during seasonal episodes of river flooding either by choosing a non flooding location before drilling or by an appropriate well protection infrastructure after flooding that may occur over the wells it is also necessary to raise awareness among the local population about the necessary care to disinfect these wells atiles and vendrell 2012 4 2 são francisco basin urucuia and marizal aquifers with productivity considered high the urucuia is a sedimentary aquifer responsible on average for 30 of the estimated availability in the são francisco basin providing between 80 and 90 of river flow in the basin s dry periods ana 2017b barbosa et al 2017 however the intensive use of ground and surface water for irrigation in the urucuia region has compromised groundwater reserves and river flows gonçalves et al 2018 2020a it is important to achieve integrated management of surface and groundwater among these two aquifer systems urucuia and marizal and the são francisco basin especially because the demands for underground and surface water resources in the urucuia region affect the flow of rivers downstream in the são francisco basin intensifying conflicts over the use of water this also causes greater pressure for the use of downstream aquifers such as the sedimentary aquifer marizal this management becomes more relevant and complex because of the water transfer system from the são francisco basin to the semi arid region of northeastern brazil cbhsf 2016 considering the already critical situation of the surface water balance in the são francisco river basin this additional extraction of the aquifers further enhances the impact already felt in the generation of hydroelectric energy in this river and the salinization of the river delta cbhsf 2015 it is also worth noting that although a large part of the urucuia and marizal aquifers are within the são francisco basin part of these aquifers extends outside the basin and their impact within the são francisco basin due to the scarcity of surface water may therefore compromise the availability of groundwater resources in adjacent regions 4 3 paraná basin bauru caiuá and guarani aquifers due to the fact that the bauru caiuá sedimentary aquifer is superimposed on the guarani sedimentary aquifer in large stretches of the paraná river basin one of the limitations of the mapping methodology used in this study is highlighted part of the wells located in the bauru caiuá aquifer could potentially be capturing water from guarani which is below ground thus for this reason these aquifer systems present in the paraná basin are discussed together comparing the indicators in the multivariate geovisualizations fig 6 the high demand and the high pressure of use on the water is evident mainly in the state of são paulo and northern paraná state where several sectors irrigation industry and supply compete and generate conflicts for the use of this resource hirata and foster 2021 the rainfall regime over the basin region is higher than that of the northeast alleviating the use of water resources for irrigation even though it becomes necessary at some times of the year melo 2018 however it is worth mentioning that the basin does not have a precipitation rate as high as the northern region of the country and that the various uses and occupations of the soil end up impacting recharge areas of the bauru caiuá and guarani aquifers lucas and wendland 2016 furthermore pollution and contamination of surface watercourses combined with recent water crises led to a search for groundwater throughout the basin here integrated management becomes essential due to the importance at the national level that the southeastern economy generates for the country although the use is concentrated in the eastern region of the paraná river basin fig 5 a the indicator maps point to similar potential use on the western half of the basin in the state of mato grosso do sul this potential may be relevant in the case of the future expansion of irrigated agriculture in this region furthermore the sag is a transboundary aquifer calling attention to possible impacts at the international level for example overexploitation of the guarani aquifer in brazilian territory may impact the base flow of the paraná river and its tributaries impacting downstream countries argentina uruguay and paraguay gonçalves et al 2020b 4 4 limitations of results the indicators presented in this article have some limitations for example although wells in karst areas performed well in this study their reserves are smaller than those of porous aquifers and their depletion can lead to subsidence and undermining risks therefore ideally the indicators presented should be complemented by more in depth studies however they present a starting point for analysis especially in regions that lack more detailed hydrogeological studies in relation to the results obtained by ordinary kriging their reliability depends on understanding the limitations of the models and the reliability of the data used gorokhovski 2014 as for the main limitation of interpolation it is worth emphasizing the local heterogeneity as it is responsible for directly affecting the hydrogeological processes vasconcelos et al 2017 the local heterogeneity of the characteristics of the wells was smoothed by modeling the nugget effect in the interpolation function montés 1994 separating the interpolation map most likely value prediction if a new well is drilled in a given location from its noise standard deviation map however in areas with fewer observation wells and greater variability of indicator values for nearby wells interpolation is consequently less reliable producing a less consistent picture of the characteristics of the aquifer s vasconcelos et al 2017 and this was visualized in the standard deviation maps the consistency and reliability of the database is a relevant concern because it is a built in common effort of several stakeholders 3 3 only the water management institutions of each state are allowed to register the wells in the system however the information is obtained through data provided both by public institutions by the well drillers and even the users themselves and there may be errors in filling it out reducing the certainty in the estimates unfortunately this factor is beyond the control of this article but it is suggested that siagas should have a constant and effective oversight to provide a more solid basis for decision makers with quality and reliable data another limitation is due to the separation by the gis database of the hydrogeological domain since its limits are only available in two dimensions making it difficult to identify effectively exploited aquifers thus it was assumed that each well geographically located on the surface of the domain is extracting water from it however aquifers can overlap at different depths and therefore the well may not be necessarily extracted from a higher aquifer closer to the surface furthermore the simple separation of wells into hydrogeological domains does not consider the possibility of groundwater flows between them additionally the yield analyzed in this article refers much more to the potential of the well and the pump used than to the actual use of the well the pressure indicator on the use of aquifers ended up not considering the available underground reserve which influences as already discussed the base flow of rivers in relation to kde the criticism that the technique treats discrete events as a continuous surface can be highlighted anderson 2009 and that the choice of parameters especially the radius could lead to cartographic products that are quite different from each other however for graphic and visual interpretation purposes it still proved useful in its purpose in this article 5 conclusions through the geostatistical method of ordinary kriging it was possible to estimate values for the indicators proposed by this work for locations not sampled or not registered in the database provided by siagas any interpolation performed is limited to an uncertainty vasconcelos et al 2017 but due to the choice of kriging modeling it was possible to generate and visualize the standard deviation of the interpolation result furthermore as almost half of the wells had no information on stabilization yield and or specific yield it was possible to fill in with the estimates resulting from geostatistics serving as a basis for consultation and or future studies that may be developed on the theme thus this work proposed the spatial modeling of specific indicators for groundwater use at the national level the use of multivariate maps helped to identify areas with greater or lesser potential to expand the use of groundwater in addition to pointing out where there is already great pressure on this resource recommending caution or even restriction of use in these regions 5 1 suggestions for future work obviously given the scale chosen in this article further studies at different scales are recommended at the desired level of detail for each specific project or objective the maps presented here are just guidelines for the potential and problems regarding the use of groundwater in brazil and the suggestion is to use them as a preliminary basis for discussion for more specific future studies for future studies other indicators could be developed and interpolated from the siagas database using again the same technique used in ordinary kriging for example water quality data from wells were not used which may become a complementary indicator to assist with decisions and guidelines for expanding the use of this resource throughout the territory another possible interpolation approach could be to consider the division by aquifers and not by hydrogeological domains analyzing whether the parameters would be more homogeneous or not for example with a slightly more detailed study in research on local hydrogeological processes repeating the interpolation process with new well data available in siagas after february 2018 would be useful to validate and or update the maps presented in this paper the spatial information provided in this paper could be integrated with data from other spatial databases related to groundwater resources allowing for wider assessments for example integration with recharge and discharge base flow maps provided by ana 2021 could add more information for groundwater management strategies the spatial indicators could also be used as some of the inputs for groundwater vulnerability assessments to potential pollution sources integration of hydrogeological spatial data with socioeconomic data could also be used to investigate population dependence of groundwater resources vrba and lipponen 2007 gross domestic product dependence on extracted groundwater chakraborty et al 2021 and social vulnerability to groundwater scarcity collins and bolin 2007 and pollution biswas et al 2022 other possibilities for improving the methodology would be to establish more detailed filtering parameters on the siagas database classified by type of well water capture modes and or by type of aquifer confined free etc furthermore it would be possible to analyze the stratification of the database based on different seasons when the data were collected division by dry or rainy period or evaluation of the trend over the years to verify spatiotemporal patterns as proposed by vasconcelos et al 2017 funding information this study was funded by the coordination for the improvement of

11766,this study spatially characterizes the potential and pressure of the supply of groundwater resources in brazil indicators obtained from ordinary kriging kernel density estimation and multivariate geovisualization techniques using the brazilian groundwater information system siagas were proposed the cartographic results culminated in maps of the potential and pressure of groundwater use in brazil and proved to be promising for the planning and management of water resources sedimentary basins had the highest specific yield 2 16 m3 h m and stabilization yield 11 19 m3 h as well as the greatest total abstraction pressure 1054967 m3 h although they had lower exploitation by aquifer area 0 54 m3 h km2 than carbonate 1 91 m3 h km2 and volcanic aquifers 0 80 m3 h km2 contrastingly crystalline aquifers had the lowest specific yield 0 63 m3 h m and stabilization yield 5 71 m3 h specifically it highlights the potential use of the alter do chão aquifer in northern brazil and the western guarani and bauru caú aquifers while they indicate a concern with the pressure of use on these last two aquifers as well as on the urucuia aquifer and on the metropolitan

caused several problems including the differentiated pressure balance on the subsoil with subsequent cases of land subsidence and even collapse affecting buildings and other infrastructure works freeze and cherry 1979 rebouças 2008 in addition to significant impacts on natural underground and surface flows due to the significant reduction in aquifer levels wicander and monroe 2008 this growing demand for groundwater use reflects economic development tundisi and tundisi 2011 ana 2017a and is a phenomenon which has been observed in several countries coelho and havens 2016 thus with the growing consequences of the increased use of aquifers the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco emphasized the importance of developing indicators for groundwater management vrba and lipponen 2007 in this context vrba and lipponen 2007 proposed the development of indicators for groundwater management based on available and updatable data for each country however the assessment of exploitable resources is challenging due to the geological complexity of reservoirs and underground flow patterns impairing the quality of predictions of the exploitation consequences of these resources feitosa and feitosa 2008 an indicator arises from a simplified model of reality to communicate and support decisions taken by managers in planning monitoring and setting guidelines for environmental management goals transmitting information adapted to each sector and local interest magalhães júnior 2012 in this context they can be useful for the rational and sustainable use of aquifers to promote human development and well being coelho and havens 2016 groundwater indicators studies focusing on recharge potentiality javadi et al 2021 and discharge baseflow based on hydrological gauges stations are a useful approach for groundwater studies olabode 2019 however the spatial scarcity of rainfall and gauging stations in developing countries makes the spatial resolution basins coarser besides adding uncertainty to the interpolated climatological data other studies on groundwater indicators focus on vulnerability to contamination javadi et al 2011 such as the god foster 1987 and drastic aller et al 1987 methods but their resolutions are constrained by the geological and soil maps which also have coarse resolution at national level for developing countries numerical modeling of aquifer dynamics such as the modflow method langevin et al 2017 can be used to extrapolate aquifer properties in space and time as well as simulating scenarios malmir et al 2021 however this approach is better suited mostly for porous aquifers and furthermore requires a reliable three dimensional model of lithological layers which is often absent for many aquifers the use of direct data interpolated directly from the locations of the wells is still a promising but less explored way to increase resolution and show the internal variability within geological domains and it is the main methodological contribution of this paper although this paper deals only with groundwater quantity from data of the wells other relevant and complementary approaches also include groundwater quality pollution sources el osta et al 2022a physicochemical suitability for distinct uses el osta et al 2022b and integration with socioeconomic data vrba and lipponen 2007 in coastal aquifers there is a relevant interplay between all these factors because over exploitation may lead to the advance of saline seawater on continental groundwater sources saatsaz et al 2013 a previous schematic map of specific yield for wells at brazilian scale was provided by rebouças 2008 at a very coarse resolution before the data from the brazilian groundwater information system sistema de informações de águas subterrâneas siagas became available in this context the current paper relevance for groundwater management in brazil is providing spatial information regarding groundwater resources with a level of detail that was not available before the spatial heterogeneity of pressure for groundwater still has not been evaluated at national scale in brazil and is another contribution of this paper groundwater is the main source of water supply to 43 of the brazilian municipalities and 15 of the brazilian population ana 2021 groundwater use has increased through the last decades hirata et al 2009 especially due to droughts that have repeatedly affected the surface water supply systems abas 2015 vasconcelos et al 2017 suggested that the study of the yield and the variation of the piezometric level of tube wells can produce indicators regarding the potential of conjunctive use strategies surface and underground water that obtain a more stable supply with less environmental impact vasconcelos et al 2013 used indicators from the siagas database a base of well characteristics available for the brazilian territory to study patterns of underground water circulation the general objective of this paper is the proposition of indicators for the determination and interpretation of quantitative and qualitative data recognition and management of the use of groundwater in brazil using a national database provided by siagas taking into account the influence of lithological affinities and hydrogeological potential the specific objectives of this paper are contribute to the improvement of discussions on vulnerability feasibility and cost effectiveness of groundwater use produce maps of the proposed indicators to serve as a water resource management tool contribute to discussions about the impacts of underground water extraction in brazil and identify its potentialities and pressures fill through interpolation using geostatistical models the stabilization and specific yield gaps of the original database propose a framework of multivariate geovisualization of groundwater use indicators which can be easily implemented and updated with widely available well s databases at diverse spatial scales in many countries 2 materials and methods 2 1 indicators from the database available from siagas a total of 299 227 wells were obtained 1 data extraction took place between december 2017 and february 2018 siagas is updated almost daily so only data from wells that were registered until february 28 2018 were downloaded 1 for the entire brazilian territory each well containing georeferenced information regarding location yield and quantitative monitoring pumping test among other information to determine the indicators the following variables provided by the system were used yield stabilization yield specific yield static level dynamic level final depth and well situation fig 1 although specific yield is a usual indicator for groundwater management frameworks saatsaz et al 2013 as well as piezometric level drawdown malmir et al 2021 this paper innovates exploring how these indicators and other usually available well data can be integrated for estimating distinct aspects of groundwater potentiality and use pressure according to the dpsir driver pressure state impact response framework oecd 1993 adapted to groundwater indicators as proposed by malmir et al 2021 the current study focused on the pressure for water use the state as potentiality for groundwater use and the impacts on aquifer level possible drivers and responses were discussed for selected aquifers the indicators for the use or conservation preservation of groundwater in brazil were defined as stabilization yield m³ h representation of the measure of the volume of water that is extracted in the well for a given period continuously and stably against the lowering of the piezometric potential being a general indicator of groundwater use for this indicator when there was information in the yield attribute the stabilization yield indicator was filled with it otherwise it would be filled with the value of the stabilization yield attribute from siagas as well fig 2 as there are wells with both empty or zero attributes these were discarded stabilization yield density represents how much groundwater is explored in different regions of the country indicating the pressure of resource use in relation to the surface area the stabilization yield density indicator is the result of a cartographic manipulation through the use of a kernel function applied to the stabilization yield indicator depth m an indicator of viable aquifer exploration potential viable exploration can be understood as the conjunction of physical factors presence of water and performability of rocks combined with economic technological and water demand factors that also vary in each region cost effectiveness m³ h m obtained from the ratio between the stabilization yield of the well and its drilling depth where wells with higher yield and with less depth have the best cost benefit indicators in constructive terms given the volume of water produced per unit of time with the least expenditure invested in construction drawdown m calculated from the difference between the static and dynamic level values obtained from the pumping test it represents an indicator of the aquifer s vulnerability to drawdown during groundwater exploitation the static level is the depth of the water inside the well without pumping while the dynamic level indicates the water level while the well is being pumped and always corresponds to a certain yield stabilization yield obtained during the same pumping test the lowering of the water level increases the velocity and causes a reversal in the direction of groundwater flow thus the drawdown increases the vulnerability of wells regarding the volume of water available over time and their susceptibility to contamination drawdown density indicates the impact of extraction of the groundwater resource in relation to the surface area that is how much groundwater pumping has impacted aquifers in different regions this indicator is the result of a cartographic manipulation through the use of a kernel function applied to the drawdown indicator specific yield m³ h m calculated by dividing the stabilization yield by the drawdown it is indicative of the potential use of groundwater available for exploitation when there was information in the specific yield attribute the specific yield indicator was filled with it otherwise it would be filled with the quotient between the stabilization yield and the drawdown if there were wells with a zero for specific yield value these were discarded fig 3 potentiality multivariate map obtained through the simple average of the standardized indicators of cost benefit drawdown stabilization yield and specific yield with the first two cartographic products obtained from the interpolation performed during this work usage pressure multivariate map obtained from a simple average of the standardized drawdown density and stabilization yield density indicators both using the same kernel radius suitability for groundwater use a set of maps using multivariate geovisualization techniques which summarize the results of the last two indicators mentioned potentiality and usage pressure after calculating the indicators for each well the wells were divided by hydrogeological domain cprm 2007 fig 4 a set of geological units with similar characteristics in terms of groundwater the hydrogeological domains are delimited based on the lithological characteristics of the rocks by their inferred storage conditions porosity flow permeability occurrence conditions length thickness and structure exploitability easy regular difficult and natural recharge rain infiltration mente 2008 rebouças 2008 as depicted in fig 4 the porous cenozoic formation is the most extensive domain in brazil especially in the amazonic northern region often overlaying or interconnected to sedimentary basins the fissural intertwined crystalline and metasedimentary domains also cover most of the other half of the territory except for the extensive volcanic domains in southern brazil nevertheless there is still no systematic spatial information at brazilian national level of hydraulic parameters groundwater recharge and discharge of each hydrogeological domain this lack of information on a national scale highlights the relevance of results of this paper for a general evaluation of groundwater potentiality in brazil 2 2 interpolation by kriging interpolations were performed using the geostatistical method of ordinary kriging with the geostatistical analyst extension for arcgis to estimate the values of the stabilization yield depth cost effectiveness drawdown and specific yield indicators a logarithmic transformation of the data was used to approximate them to a normal distribution each indicator resulted in seven geostatistical models one for each hydrogeological domain with the subsequent combination of them in a mosaic to result in a single map for brazil per indicator fig 5 the kriging parameters were calibrated through internal cross validation of well data for each hydrogeological domain assuring a better match with their distinct hydrogeological spatial dynamics then from the results obtained from the interpolation using the ordinary kriging method for drawdown and stabilization yield the previously discarded data from wells with missing information were filled with the values produced by the adopted geostatistical model resulting in a dataset with these estimated values this new dataset was used for the creation of density maps detailed in the following subsection 2 3 2 3 kernel density estimation using the technique of kernel density estimation kde the stabilization yield density and drawdown density indicators were mapped with these kernel maps it is possible to illustrate the impact of underground water extraction that is the effects of the extraction of this resource in a certain area unit km 2 in this study throughout the national territory the kde parameters were evaluated in two ways a choosing a radius and function that provide the maximum differentiation of the regions on the map carlos et al 2010 kuter et al 2011 equation 1 1 s e a r c h r a d i u s 0 9 min s d 1 i n 2 d m n 0 2 where sd is the standard distance between points dm is the median distance n is the sum of the values of the attribute field for each point esri 2008 b choosing an optimization parameter to perform the point density for prediction the root mean square error rmse by cross validation hart and zandbergen 2014 ruckthongsook et al 2018 sequentially we chose a radius with the best balance between the greater differentiation prescribed by equation 1 and the lesser loss in predictive power smallest average squared error using the elbow rule i e finding in a graph the radius after which the rmse stabilizes at the same time that it is closer to the greater differentiation obtained in equation 1 the geoprocessing tool used was the kernel smoothing of the geostatistical wizard in the arcgis software using the quartic kernel function for the generation of the raster the kernel density tool of spatial analyst for arcgis was used 2 4 groundwater resource demand by hydrogeological domain the water demands in each hydrogeological domain cprm 2007 were investigated yield per area in km2 the stabilization yield data were then separated by their domains and the values of the indicator in question were added zonal statistics were performed separating the features by the hydrogeological domains from the result of the interpolated stabilization yield and specific yield data to obtain their average for each domain for this calculation the point database of the stabilization yield indicator was used considering only the wells whose situation reported by siagas was empty pumping equipped or precarious excluding wells in the situations closed abandoned clogged unusable not installed stopped dry and monitoring well equipped with automatic level gauge 2 5 multivariate geovisualization five multivariate geovisualization maps were developed to interpret in an integrated manner the univariate indicators produced for the use of groundwater as suggested by vasconcelos et al 2017 the first one illustrates the potential use of groundwater and was obtained through the average of the standardized values z score fig 6 between the variables of the indicators obtained by interpolation stabilization yield cost benefit lowering and specific yield the depth indicator was not used for the potentiality map because the greater depth may indicate that there is a greater exploitable volume of aquifers however it may also be a reflection of the need to drill more due to very low specific yield insufficient to meet the demands if the wells are too shallow the second map illustrates regions of the brazilian territory where there is pressure for the use of groundwater fig 6 and was obtained by averaging the standardized values of the kernel maps that is the yield density and drawdown density maps both with a search radius of 40 km from these two multivariate maps potentiality and pressure another three were produced fig 6 the first map of the set is based on the simple average of the aggregated indicators of potentiality and pressure of use the second map is a bivariate composition red and blue color axes of the same two layers used in the previous map pressure and potential based on the theory of additive color mixing grassmann 1854 the last multivariate map is a map using the iso cluster method by iterative migration of means ball and hall 1965 richards 2013 developed by combining indicators of potentiality and pressure of water use indicating where they are combined singularly 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics table 1 contains the results of the medians means and their respective standard deviations for stabilization yield depth cost benefit drawdown and specific yield indicators separated by hydrogeological domains the indicators point out that the hydrogeological domains with the best exploitation characteristics high yield good cost effectiveness and less drawdown are sedimentary basins cenozoic formations and carbonates metacarbonates the volcanic and mixed aquifers porous fissure had intermediate values while the crystalline and metasedimentary metavolcanic aquifers had the worst values a more detailed analysis of descriptive statistics is presented in the appendix table 2 presents the results of zonal statistics on kriged surfaces performed for all domains considering the indicators stabilization yield and specific yield the results follow the same trends as in table 1 although they are calculated by averaging the area pixels rather than the number of individual wells 3 2 stabilization yield depth cost effectiveness drawdown and specific yield maps below in fig 7 two maps of each indicator are always presented the first contains the result of the interpolation by ordinary kriging while the second contains the standard deviation related to the generated model which can be used as an indicator of estimation uncertainty the adjustments performed by the variograms are presented in the appendix regions with more data i e more wells registered in siagas in this case southeast and northeast and which have more even sampling across the surface tend to present fewer uncertainties in the results generated by the interpolation in this respect the respective standard deviation maps of the interpolations have in general the highest values precisely in the northern region of the country that is where there are fewer wells in the database and or have a greater distance between them reflecting the lower demographic density and consequently the demand for the use of this natural resource however other factors such as heterogeneity in the characteristics of nearby wells can also affect the standard deviation finally to provide a complete database the gaps referring to stabilization yield and specific yíeld of the database downloaded from siagas were filled from the interpolation performed and the information regarding the standard deviation was added from the ordinary kriging results these can be accessed through a repository provided by this study 2 2 available at https drive google com drive folders 15ps2tly8qtqkj1yietuc mvskynue2wj 3 3 groundwater demand by hydrogeological domain table 3 shows the results of demand for the water resource showing in which domain more groundwater is being extracted and its relation to the total area of the hydrogeological domains density it should be noted again that the data in table 3 refer to a sampling of existing wells recognizing that there will be several unregistered wells in this context ana 2021 estimated that the wells registered in the siagas database would be approximately 13 of the total number of wells in brazil however based on the simplified assumption that unregistered wells have spatial distribution and characteristics similar to those registered these values serve as indicators for relative comparison between the different domains analyzing the total value of stabilization yield the sedimentary basins and cenozoic formations domains both porous are the ones with the largest underground water extraction in brazil while the porous fissural mixed domain has the lowest production even as it is not the smallest in area considering the total stabilization yield by domain area there is more groundwater being extracted per square kilometer in the carbonates metacarbonates fissure domains followed by the volcanic rocks domain this result indicates the potential for using porous aquifers that are possibly being less explored 3 4 stabilization yield density and drawdown density the maps in fig 8 show the stabilization yield a and drawdown b kernel density maps based on a 40 km kernel radius intermediate between the optimum capacity of forecasting and the optimal capacity of differentiating areas the stabilization yield density map illustrates the aggregated pressure of water use while the drawdown density map indicates the aggregated impact in the aquifer a detailed description of the analysis for the kernel radius is given in the appendix the results demonstrate a greater yield density in the northeast and south regions of the country the metropolitan region of são paulo in southeastern brazil has both high yield density and the highest drawdown density 3 5 integrated indicator maps using multivariate geovisualization the first multivariate map illustrates the potential for using groundwater fig 9 a considering the cost benefit lowering stabilization yield and specific yield indicators the second map illustrates regions of the brazilian territory where there is pressure for the use of groundwater fig 9 b indicating the intensity with which this resource is extracted and used and may bring caution to the expansion of the use of this type of water resource in these locations the map in fig 9 c shows the balance between potential and pressure by the simple average between the maps in fig 9 a and 9 b another geovisualization option is the bivariate map fig 9 d the darker the color i e closer to the upper right corner of the bivariate legend the better the region s water performance as it means greater potential and less pressure on the resource the bluish areas upper left corner of the bivariate legend which have small spots on the map indicate areas where there is a high potential for the use of groundwater but there is already a strong pressure for use the areas in lighter red lower right corner of the legend however which are more prevalent in southern brazil have relatively less potential and less pressure for use in combination the last multivariate map fig 9 e shows the results of the isocluster of indicators of potentiality and pressure of groundwater use the table in the legend indicates which and how much of each indicator influences the four resulting groups regarding a reference mean of zero standard deviations thus group 1 presents a value of 0 14 for potentiality and 1 71 for pressure that is this group emphasizes more strongly the influence of the indicator of greater pressure in the use of water resources than potentiality demonstrating concern about the use of groundwater group 4 has a value of 1 27 for potential and 0 08 for pressure that is this group emphasizes the influence of the indicator of the potential use of the water resource more than the pressure of use on it making this group preferential to expanding the use of aquifers groups 2 and 3 have intermediate values and their results are more tenuous when compared to groups 1 and 4 group 2 presents a value of 0 61 for potentiality and 0 02 for pressure indicating that its pressure on the use of the resource is not so significant but its potential is even less so the northeastern hinterland most of the southeastern and southern states and almost all goiás center of the country are mostly located in group 2 group 3 however presents a value of 0 08 for potentiality and 0 11 for pressure that is the potentiality although not as significant as pointed out in group 4 is still relatively greater than the pressure on the use of groundwater therefore these are areas with some potential yet to be explored 4 discussion spatially the greatest potential for groundwater use occurred in the north of the country amazon basin some points in the state of bahia urucuia and marizal aquifers and parts of the midwest and southeast paraná basin these regions when confronted with the map of hydrogeological domains of brazil fig 4 indicate predominantly porous aquifer outcrops in agreement with the results found in the statistical analysis tables 1 and 2 the main areas of concern are the metropolitan regions especially são paulo in southeastern brazil with low potential and high pressure for the use of groundwater several coastal capitals in northeastern brazil also have low potential and high usage pressure the previous brazilian map of specific yield provided by rebouças 2008 despite its coarser spatial resolution conforms to the general patters with the one provided in fig 8 e with higher values in northern and western brazil however the higher spatial resolution of fig 8 e was able to better identify the characteristics of each aquifer especially the urucuia and marizal fig 9 f which did not appear on the rebouças 2008 map ana 2021 estimated the aquifer recharge in the spatial resolution of the main large watersheds in brazil proposing a sustainable groundwater abstraction limit for these basins the highest recharge rates for example 5553 8 m3 s in tapajós madeira basin as well as sustainable abstraction limits are in the amazon region in the basins that may contribute with regional groundwater flows to alter do chão aquifer in consonance with the findings of this paper the western half of paraná basin also has higher recharge rates approximately 2200 m3 s and sustainable abstraction limits than the eastern half recharge rate of approximately 1000 m3 s adding more relevance to the potential of expansion of groundwater use for this area the coastal aquifers of brazil on the other hand where most of groundwater use pressure of metropolitan regions are located have the lowest recharge rates usually below 75 m3 s and sustainable abstraction limits when compared to the rest of the country this pattern raises more concern regarding over abstraction in coastal areas and the consequent intrusion of saline water in these aquifers a detailed discussion on the selected aquifers that present the greatest potential and pressure on the elaborated indicators fig 6 f is presented in the next subsections 4 1 amazon basin alter do chão the alter do chão aquifer has the greatest potential for use in brazil and is a sedimentary aquifer with low use pressure except in the urbanized area of manaus in riverine communities in the alter do chão aquifer region access to groundwater can provide an alternative for better water quality that is lower water treatment costs when compared to surface waters with a higher content of organic matter and bacteria however as studied by azevedo 2006 because the alter do chão aquifer is located under the floodplain of the amazon river care is needed to avoid contamination of wells during seasonal episodes of river flooding either by choosing a non flooding location before drilling or by an appropriate well protection infrastructure after flooding that may occur over the wells it is also necessary to raise awareness among the local population about the necessary care to disinfect these wells atiles and vendrell 2012 4 2 são francisco basin urucuia and marizal aquifers with productivity considered high the urucuia is a sedimentary aquifer responsible on average for 30 of the estimated availability in the são francisco basin providing between 80 and 90 of river flow in the basin s dry periods ana 2017b barbosa et al 2017 however the intensive use of ground and surface water for irrigation in the urucuia region has compromised groundwater reserves and river flows gonçalves et al 2018 2020a it is important to achieve integrated management of surface and groundwater among these two aquifer systems urucuia and marizal and the são francisco basin especially because the demands for underground and surface water resources in the urucuia region affect the flow of rivers downstream in the são francisco basin intensifying conflicts over the use of water this also causes greater pressure for the use of downstream aquifers such as the sedimentary aquifer marizal this management becomes more relevant and complex because of the water transfer system from the são francisco basin to the semi arid region of northeastern brazil cbhsf 2016 considering the already critical situation of the surface water balance in the são francisco river basin this additional extraction of the aquifers further enhances the impact already felt in the generation of hydroelectric energy in this river and the salinization of the river delta cbhsf 2015 it is also worth noting that although a large part of the urucuia and marizal aquifers are within the são francisco basin part of these aquifers extends outside the basin and their impact within the são francisco basin due to the scarcity of surface water may therefore compromise the availability of groundwater resources in adjacent regions 4 3 paraná basin bauru caiuá and guarani aquifers due to the fact that the bauru caiuá sedimentary aquifer is superimposed on the guarani sedimentary aquifer in large stretches of the paraná river basin one of the limitations of the mapping methodology used in this study is highlighted part of the wells located in the bauru caiuá aquifer could potentially be capturing water from guarani which is below ground thus for this reason these aquifer systems present in the paraná basin are discussed together comparing the indicators in the multivariate geovisualizations fig 6 the high demand and the high pressure of use on the water is evident mainly in the state of são paulo and northern paraná state where several sectors irrigation industry and supply compete and generate conflicts for the use of this resource hirata and foster 2021 the rainfall regime over the basin region is higher than that of the northeast alleviating the use of water resources for irrigation even though it becomes necessary at some times of the year melo 2018 however it is worth mentioning that the basin does not have a precipitation rate as high as the northern region of the country and that the various uses and occupations of the soil end up impacting recharge areas of the bauru caiuá and guarani aquifers lucas and wendland 2016 furthermore pollution and contamination of surface watercourses combined with recent water crises led to a search for groundwater throughout the basin here integrated management becomes essential due to the importance at the national level that the southeastern economy generates for the country although the use is concentrated in the eastern region of the paraná river basin fig 5 a the indicator maps point to similar potential use on the western half of the basin in the state of mato grosso do sul this potential may be relevant in the case of the future expansion of irrigated agriculture in this region furthermore the sag is a transboundary aquifer calling attention to possible impacts at the international level for example overexploitation of the guarani aquifer in brazilian territory may impact the base flow of the paraná river and its tributaries impacting downstream countries argentina uruguay and paraguay gonçalves et al 2020b 4 4 limitations of results the indicators presented in this article have some limitations for example although wells in karst areas performed well in this study their reserves are smaller than those of porous aquifers and their depletion can lead to subsidence and undermining risks therefore ideally the indicators presented should be complemented by more in depth studies however they present a starting point for analysis especially in regions that lack more detailed hydrogeological studies in relation to the results obtained by ordinary kriging their reliability depends on understanding the limitations of the models and the reliability of the data used gorokhovski 2014 as for the main limitation of interpolation it is worth emphasizing the local heterogeneity as it is responsible for directly affecting the hydrogeological processes vasconcelos et al 2017 the local heterogeneity of the characteristics of the wells was smoothed by modeling the nugget effect in the interpolation function montés 1994 separating the interpolation map most likely value prediction if a new well is drilled in a given location from its noise standard deviation map however in areas with fewer observation wells and greater variability of indicator values for nearby wells interpolation is consequently less reliable producing a less consistent picture of the characteristics of the aquifer s vasconcelos et al 2017 and this was visualized in the standard deviation maps the consistency and reliability of the database is a relevant concern because it is a built in common effort of several stakeholders 3 3 only the water management institutions of each state are allowed to register the wells in the system however the information is obtained through data provided both by public institutions by the well drillers and even the users themselves and there may be errors in filling it out reducing the certainty in the estimates unfortunately this factor is beyond the control of this article but it is suggested that siagas should have a constant and effective oversight to provide a more solid basis for decision makers with quality and reliable data another limitation is due to the separation by the gis database of the hydrogeological domain since its limits are only available in two dimensions making it difficult to identify effectively exploited aquifers thus it was assumed that each well geographically located on the surface of the domain is extracting water from it however aquifers can overlap at different depths and therefore the well may not be necessarily extracted from a higher aquifer closer to the surface furthermore the simple separation of wells into hydrogeological domains does not consider the possibility of groundwater flows between them additionally the yield analyzed in this article refers much more to the potential of the well and the pump used than to the actual use of the well the pressure indicator on the use of aquifers ended up not considering the available underground reserve which influences as already discussed the base flow of rivers in relation to kde the criticism that the technique treats discrete events as a continuous surface can be highlighted anderson 2009 and that the choice of parameters especially the radius could lead to cartographic products that are quite different from each other however for graphic and visual interpretation purposes it still proved useful in its purpose in this article 5 conclusions through the geostatistical method of ordinary kriging it was possible to estimate values for the indicators proposed by this work for locations not sampled or not registered in the database provided by siagas any interpolation performed is limited to an uncertainty vasconcelos et al 2017 but due to the choice of kriging modeling it was possible to generate and visualize the standard deviation of the interpolation result furthermore as almost half of the wells had no information on stabilization yield and or specific yield it was possible to fill in with the estimates resulting from geostatistics serving as a basis for consultation and or future studies that may be developed on the theme thus this work proposed the spatial modeling of specific indicators for groundwater use at the national level the use of multivariate maps helped to identify areas with greater or lesser potential to expand the use of groundwater in addition to pointing out where there is already great pressure on this resource recommending caution or even restriction of use in these regions 5 1 suggestions for future work obviously given the scale chosen in this article further studies at different scales are recommended at the desired level of detail for each specific project or objective the maps presented here are just guidelines for the potential and problems regarding the use of groundwater in brazil and the suggestion is to use them as a preliminary basis for discussion for more specific future studies for future studies other indicators could be developed and interpolated from the siagas database using again the same technique used in ordinary kriging for example water quality data from wells were not used which may become a complementary indicator to assist with decisions and guidelines for expanding the use of this resource throughout the territory another possible interpolation approach could be to consider the division by aquifers and not by hydrogeological domains analyzing whether the parameters would be more homogeneous or not for example with a slightly more detailed study in research on local hydrogeological processes repeating the interpolation process with new well data available in siagas after february 2018 would be useful to validate and or update the maps presented in this paper the spatial information provided in this paper could be integrated with data from other spatial databases related to groundwater resources allowing for wider assessments for example integration with recharge and discharge base flow maps provided by ana 2021 could add more information for groundwater management strategies the spatial indicators could also be used as some of the inputs for groundwater vulnerability assessments to potential pollution sources integration of hydrogeological spatial data with socioeconomic data could also be used to investigate population dependence of groundwater resources vrba and lipponen 2007 gross domestic product dependence on extracted groundwater chakraborty et al 2021 and social vulnerability to groundwater scarcity collins and bolin 2007 and pollution biswas et al 2022 other possibilities for improving the methodology would be to establish more detailed filtering parameters on the siagas database classified by type of well water capture modes and or by type of aquifer confined free etc furthermore it would be possible to analyze the stratification of the database based on different seasons when the data were collected division by dry or rainy period or evaluation of the trend over the years to verify spatiotemporal patterns as proposed by vasconcelos et al 2017 funding information this study was funded by the coordination for the improvement of

11767,environmental flow is the minimal flow that has to be discharged maintain healthy ecosystem national green tribunal ngt law states 15 of the average lean season flow as the environmental flow inability to maintain may incite a decline in the health of the ecosystem the research work evaluates the sufficiency of the ngt s law on environmental flow using the hydrology method the proposed work evaluates the environmental flow requirements for larji hydropower dam 126 mw kullu himachal pradesh traditionally to validate the environmental flow requirement results one of the environmental flow methods will be used here to aid the results of the environmental flow assessment geographic information system applications has been used the environmental flow requirement evaluated from the flow duration curve is more than the 15 of the average lean season flow the attempted work concludes that up to 20 25 of average lean season flow shall be maintained as environmental flow for the current ecosystem the result has an added advantage and is beneficial to the existing ecosystem graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrology method environmental flow hydropower project flow duration curve gis applications 1 introduction himachal pradesh currently aims at producing hydropower up to 20 000 mw owing to that many hydropower projects have been constructed operated with the natural and abandons resource of water beas river basin produces up to 6000 mw intending to produce more hydropower potential the administration overlooks the fact that it affects the ecosystem an increase in hydropower projects leads to a greater requirement for water that exploits no water resources for fish habitat or the livelihood of downstream people for example the pandoh dam has been constructed downstream of the larji dam and to the downstream of pandoh hydropower project patikari dam a small hydropower project has been constructed considering that the environmental flow requirement for the larji dam has been satisfied then the environmental flow requirement for the pandoh dam and the successive dams becomes debatable to overcome the impact of hydropower on the ecosystem the environmental flow has been suggested as a mitigation measure the ngt order has been passed to maintain 15 of the average lean season flow as environmental flow in downstream side of dam national green tribunal which is a parliament act that takes care of the issues relating to the environment the percentage norms of the ecological flow to be maintained took distinctive ups and downs in its regard and ngt has finalized 15 of the average lean season flow that must be maintained in the hydropower dams to maintain the ecosystem the indicators used while drafting the ngt order for environmental flow assessment are endangered species and aquatic biota habitat trout fish farming vegetation farming is the primary source of occupation human population livelihood depends on the river conflicts related to water and its quality etc and for the maintenance of these ecosystem s indicators in a healthy way is of prime importance see fig 1 according to acreman et al 2016 environmental flow is the required flow to support the livelihood estuarine and freshwater ecosystem depending on the source of water the need for the environmental flow was to preserve the required amount of water for the ecosystem s sustenance to produce more hydropower via hydropower projects more water will be exploited from the river for power production and hence the water availability in the river for agriculture as well as the ecosystem will reduce although maintaining the environmental flow is the primary goal but the main thing to be noticed is whether the amount of environmental flow has to be maintained sufficiently or not also ungauged data was calculated to fix the environmental flow value that has been currently maintained hence it is important to calculate the environmental flow based on the current scenario and relate it to the maintained environmental flow values there are more than two hundred environmental flow assessment methods and it s up till now evolving under categories of the hydrological method hydraulic methodology habitat approach and holistic methodology the methodologies have their own upsides and drawbacks owing to various limitations and conditions the hydrology method which makes use of the past flow data has been used in this research work due to the data deficiency the rainfall runoff analysis has been carried out to calculate the runoff the runoff has been used as inflow data the flow in the river between june and september is high as the higher concentration of rainfall happens during this month the commonly used hydrology methods are the range of variability method rva tennant s method flow duration curve fdc base flow methodology and so forward the proposed work uses the fdc method for the estimation of

has been compared with ngt s environmental flow value based on the results the recommendation has been made the present research attempts to evaluate the required environmental flow for the larji hydropower dam by means of the hydrological method and compare it with ngt norms for its sufficiency to validate the results the gis and remote sensing application has been employed 2 study area larji hydropower project has 126 mw installed capacity which is situated on the beas river in kullu district of himachal pradesh the larji hydropower project started its operation in the year 2008 catchment area 4921 sq km at an elevation of 2299 msl the primary occupation of the downstream people is agriculture and about more than 80 percent of the employees are involved in farming and the primary source of water is from the beas river the major agricultural crops in the district are paddy wheat maize barley and pulses such as gram rajmash urad and peas etc potato and apple are the major cash crop in this region and aditya et al 2013 state that the construction of the dam has affected the production of apples to level induced climate change and has caused pollution in the river in addition to this larji has been identified as a great source for fish farming by the state fisheries department and trout are being farmed extensively for the habitat of the fishes the environmental flow should be maintained downstream of the dam the catchment receives precipitation due to the southwest monsoons as well as the western disturbances that pass over the northwest part of the country during winters the live storage capacity of the larji reservoir is 230 ha which is adequate for running the power station at full installed capacity for more than 4 h a day during lean periods the course of the beas river takes a knee bend diversion after larji and hence the fluctuations in the flow of water are unpredictable the project will enable energy generation of 587 gwh in 90 dependable

be 95 of the exceedance inflow r h s comparison comes into play where there is a presence of variation as stated above the average value of the lean season i e 15 is compared with the required environmental flow i e 95 of the exceedance flow the assessment would either result in the acceleration of the environmental flow percentage or maintenance no change of the environmental flow percentage fig 2 the maintenance no change of the environmental flow percentage would happen when the general flow value is less than the average leann season flow in other words the acceleration would not happen if the r h s is less than the l h s vice versa acceleration of the environmental flow percentage would be suggested the result of suggestion where acceleration of the environmental flow percentage would be validated by employing the calculations made through the gis and rs application in the vegetation impact on the downstream resultants of flow of river is based on the land use pattern change and contrariwise too the effects do not stop here but extends to the low vegetation when there is no nil flow in the river this proves and thus justifies the lack of environmental flow discharge 3 1 hydrological method the flow duration curve method fdc will be used when there pertains an insufficiency in the flow data this method helps in identifying the environmental flow by plotting the graph between the discharge and the percentile of exceedance larji hydropower project is a run of river projects the inflow fig 3 for a period of 29 years 1980 2018 has been used to derive the environmental flow from fdc the discharge value corresponding to 95 in the graph is termed as the q95 the q95 value will be used as the minimal flow to protect the river fdc is the plot between the percentage of exceedance in the x axis and discharge in the y axis fdc can be created for different time spans yearly month to month and step by step the flow data used for the analysis for the duration of 1980 2018 to build an fdc initially the flow data are distinguished into a few ranges and adjusted in decreasing order to form a segment next the flow discharge for the total number of days has been consistently noted that is set apart as n then the total number of days corresponding to a specific flow is summed up as input in a separate section cumulative esteem m is included in the increasing order for the flow extend esteem or day by day discharge positioned in decreasing order the percentage of exceedance pp or the exceedance likelihood of the occasion p was determined by the weibull plotting equation equation 1 subramanya k 2013 1 pp m n 1 100 where n no of flow events m ranking of the flow events now the coordinates are taken into logarithmic values and plotted against to obtain the q95 values the fdc has all the earmarks of being in the shape that delineates flow within the norms 3 2 limitations and assumptions the fdc method was chosen because of its advantage of producing the result for data deficient flows efstratiadis et al 2014 according to vogel and fennessey 1994 the results of the method are based on the particular time period of input data and hence the result is subjective to reliability in some cases hydrological techniques which depend on recorded data methods are condemned for being frail as far as environmental information and are deficient to clarify the ecological hydrological relationship petts 1996 it has an abnormal state of result exactness in the examination with the other three strategies hence to overcome these limitations gis and rs applications have been employed the ndvi and lulc have been carried out on the downstream side of the dam to assess the spatial extent of the vegetation s health 3 3 gis and rs application in order to represent the impact on the ecosystems spatially and temporally the ndvi analysis was performed with satellite images as input in order to detect the differences in the state of vegetation covers before and after the construction of the dam table 2 shows the data acquisition dates and table 3 depicts the band combination formula for ndvi analysis the mapping of lulc has been carried out to understand the changes pertained in the study area over the course of time due to any natural or manmade activity the landsat 8 data was downloaded from the https earthexplorer usgs gov the analysis has been carried out for two periods healthy august to october and lean period november to february that too before and after the construction of the dam the larji dam was constructed in 2008 hence landsat data of lean period for before and after the construction of the dam was downloaded for the analysis the land use land cover classification was done in order to obtain a wide level of cataloging to infer different lulc classes as this work focuses on agriculture the classification will be regarding the vegetation components and water resources the assessment has been carried out using the gis applications the ndvi and lulc 4 results 4 1 hydrological method in this research work the fdc method has been employed to assess the environmental flow requirements for the larji basin the discharge value corresponding to 95 q95 depicts the environmental flow to be maintained in the dam the q95 value for all the years 1979 2018 is given in table 1 the fdc has been illustrated for the year 1979 1999 in fig 4 and 2000 2018 in fig 5 fig 6 represents the low flow value month wise as a bar chart the august month indicates higher discharge marking as the high flow season the low flow pertains in the months of november to february lean flow season in a year for around 171 days a low discharge of range of 7 13 m3 s has been discharged from the dam the current environmental flow maintained in downstream of the river is 7 cumecs out of five months three months doesn t satisfy the requirement a significant gap has been attained between the maintained and the required flow based on the way the curve progress uncertainties in the flow can be determined in that note all the years show natural flow the flow corresponding to the 95 exceedance for each year has been given in table 4 similarly the average of the december lean season month has been taken for all the years 15 of the average of december has been taken as the left hand side value the environmental flow was the incentive for individual years i e q95 values have been taken as the right hand side values 15 of the average lean season and q95 values are given in table 3 and the plot between these parameters are shown in fig 7 the q95 of the fdc values ranges from 7 m3 s to 17 m3 s and 15 of the average lean season flow value ranges from 1 m3 s to 6 m3 s fig 7 it can be seen in the figure that the required environmental flow is more than the current practice i e 15 of the average lean season flow 4 2 gis and rs application 4 2 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi typically analyzes the degree of greenness the greenness degree of the image correlates with the density of vegetation ndvi correlates with the amount of chlorophyll ndvi varies between 1 until 1 closer to 1 of ndvi more presence of vegetation crown density the very low values of ndvi less than 0 1 match up to barren land of sand rock or snow from 0 2 to 0 3 correspond to shrub and grassland and values from 0 6 to 0 8 indicate forest cover the ndvi analysis for the larji watershed during the lean season was carried out for 2002 landsat 7 data and 2018 landsat 8 data the results show that the greenness level has decreased from 0 72 to 0 51 in the year 2018 and the spatial extent of healthy vegetation also decreased fig 8 ndvi establishes the spatial and temporal differences in vegetation cover spread the spatial extent of the greenness in both the lean and high flow period has been decreased after the construction operation of the hydropower project considering the study area which has been located near perennial water resources the vegetation must be the best of its nature in fig 8 the reddish color indicates the absence of the vegetation this could be either build up land barren land and poor vegetation the dark blue color shows the healthy vegetation the spatial extent of the results shows that the vegetation extent has decreased after the construction of the dam the ndvi value has also decreased from 0 68 to 0 51 showing that the richness in the vegetation health has also decreased 4 2 2 lulc the lulc change for the larji dam during the lean period fig 9 shows a substantial decrease in agriculture around 0 9 along the banks of the beas river this has been reasoned out with the field survey carried out in these particular locations with the availability of the water required for agriculture has been decreased people have abandoned the agricultural practice this led to increase in open forest cover shrubs and open forest the forest cover also decreased up to 5 4 the barren land change has been up to a 1 5 decrease the change detection has been provided in terms of bar diagram fig 10 the settlement increased by up to 5 4 along the riverside the mandi town is in the downstream side of the river the major increase in the built up is in this location the water dependent ecosystem also includes the livelihood of the locales in this region fig 11 the water contribution has been decreased up to 0 3 from 2002 to 2018 the construction and operation of the dam has impacted the water resources in the region paving way for the decrease in agricultural practices the decrease in the agricultural activity suited the idea to increase the anthropogenic activity in the downstream the restoration of the land use before the construction of the dam will happen if the agricultural practices begin for which the required environmental flow should be maintained 5 discussion in situations where data was deficient the hydrological method shall be utilized to give sufficient environmental flow requirements in the dam rivers regardless of data insufficiency ten year data was broken down to obtain the fdc and the 7q10 the month august demonstrates variable flow capacity with higher discharge when contrasted with others gholami v et al 2020 estimated the environmental water requirement for the miankaleh wetland the author utilized the tenant fdc method hydrology method the wetted perimeter method hydraulic method and the physical habitat simulation model phabsim habitat method the results show that the current discharge of the rivers is less than the estimated ewr showing the discharge rates do not meet the water requirement for aquatic species of the miankaleh wetland table 5 shows the various flow norms suggested by various institutions these institutions suggest environmental flow more than 15 of average lean season flow according to smakhtin et al 2006 expert s judgment can be used to derive the environmental management class emc provided a few questions were properly asked that relate to the characteristics of the river in addition suitable questions involving the characteristics of the river the existing status of the river constraints etc were questioned and the results suggest that the environmental management class for the river is class b slightly modified class b has been chosen because the impact of the biodiversity is intact besides water generation activities in the river and also irrigation activities are allowed vogel and fennessey 1994 criticized that the fdc result is based on the period of flow data given as input the questionnaire conducted among the locale also supports the hydrology result that the flow in the river isn t sufficient for their livelihood fig 12 the mandi town is on the downstream side of the river the major increase in the built up is in this location the water dependent ecosystem also includes the livelihood of the locales in this region the sufficiency of the environmental flow has been discussed with the aid of the hydrology method and gis application the author would like to suggest that the ngt order on environmental flow can increase the percentage up to 25 i e 25 of the average lean season flow fig 13 shows that the 25 value meets the required environmental flow from the fdc results considering the hydropower production aspect and the environmental impact the suggestion is medieval between the hydropower production and environmental impact aspect the research work focused on the objectives in hand while the work paves way for future studies such as 1 the assessed environmental flow can be validated using the measured flow data 2 the percentage increase in the ngt norms can be checked for the sufficiency in maintaining the health of the system in the river basin 3 the questionnaire survey can be conducted in other parts of the beas river basin 4 the results can be applied for other basins and generalize the environmental flow norms for all the basins in india 5 a common methodology can be derived where data deficiency is a big issue in the assessment of environmental flow 6 conclusion with the aim to produce a greater amount of hydropower the administration overexploits the presence of water in the river hence there may arise a situation in which the ecosystem won t be able to sustain the riverbed ecology and riparian environment due to its case therefore there is a greater need to evaluate the requirements of ngt law s 15 of the average lean season flow for the stream has to be released to the downstream of diversion structure for the protection of flora fauna and aquatic life between intake and confluence point of tailrace and the stream the construction and operation of the dam have affected the quantity and quality of the water hence the water dependent ecosystem has been heavily affected by this in the downstream the environmental flow maintained in the larji hydropower dam is the result of past year flow data that is before the construction and operation of the dam i e 7 cumecs the 15 of the average lean season flow ranges 1 7 m3 s cumecs according to this the maintenance of the ngt law is as per order but with the current condition the author would like to suggest environmental flow as 20 25 of the average lean season flow based on various aspects although the fdc method is suitable in case of data deficiency the fact that results are based on the time period of the flow data entered as input the method has its own advantage and disadvantage the merit is that for the current condition the needed environmental flow can be calculated and the demerit is the result is questionable at various faces to overcome the flaw the gis analysis and questionnaire survey was carried out at a small scale to know about the scenario on the downstream side of the study area the locale s perception towards the sufficiency of the river water matches the result of fdc method this method s result should be combined with additional information to arrive at proper results this helps in preserving the water for the agriculture fish ecosystem cattle etc and their basic living during the lean period evaluating the sufficiency of the environmental flow helps in the decision making process by the administration and by maintaining the health of ecosystem that also meets the power requirements without any hurdle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11767,environmental flow is the minimal flow that has to be discharged maintain healthy ecosystem national green tribunal ngt law states 15 of the average lean season flow as the environmental flow inability to maintain may incite a decline in the health of the ecosystem the research work evaluates the sufficiency of the ngt s law on environmental flow using the hydrology method the proposed work evaluates the environmental flow requirements for larji hydropower dam 126 mw kullu himachal pradesh traditionally to validate the environmental flow requirement results one of the environmental flow methods will be used here to aid the results of the environmental flow assessment geographic information system applications has been used the environmental flow requirement evaluated from the flow duration curve is more than the 15 of the average lean season flow the attempted work concludes that up to 20 25 of average lean season flow shall be maintained as environmental flow for the current ecosystem the result has an added advantage and is beneficial to the existing ecosystem graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrology method environmental flow hydropower project flow duration curve gis applications 1 introduction himachal pradesh currently aims at producing hydropower up to 20 000 mw owing to that many hydropower projects have been constructed operated with the natural and abandons resource of water beas river basin produces up to 6000 mw intending to produce more hydropower potential the administration overlooks the fact that it affects the ecosystem an increase in hydropower projects leads to a greater requirement for water that exploits no water resources for fish habitat or the livelihood of downstream people for example the pandoh dam has been constructed downstream of the larji dam and to the downstream of pandoh hydropower project patikari dam a small hydropower project has been constructed considering that the environmental flow requirement for the larji dam has been satisfied then the environmental flow requirement for the pandoh dam and the successive dams becomes debatable to overcome the impact of hydropower on the ecosystem the environmental flow has been suggested as a mitigation measure the ngt order has been passed to maintain 15 of the average lean season flow as environmental flow in downstream side of dam national green tribunal which is a parliament act that takes care of the issues relating to the environment the percentage norms of the ecological flow to be maintained took distinctive ups and downs in its regard and ngt has finalized 15 of the average lean season flow that must be maintained in the hydropower dams to maintain the ecosystem the indicators used while drafting the ngt order for environmental flow assessment are endangered species and aquatic biota habitat trout fish farming vegetation farming is the primary source of occupation human population livelihood depends on the river conflicts related to water and its quality etc and for the maintenance of these ecosystem s indicators in a healthy way is of prime importance see fig 1 according to acreman et al 2016 environmental flow is the required flow to support the livelihood estuarine and freshwater ecosystem depending on the source of water the need for the environmental flow was to preserve the required amount of water for the ecosystem s sustenance to produce more hydropower via hydropower projects more water will be exploited from the river for power production and hence the water availability in the river for agriculture as well as the ecosystem will reduce although maintaining the environmental flow is the primary goal but the main thing to be noticed is whether the amount of environmental flow has to be maintained sufficiently or not also ungauged data was calculated to fix the environmental flow value that has been currently maintained hence it is important to calculate the environmental flow based on the current scenario and relate it to the maintained environmental flow values there are more than two hundred environmental flow assessment methods and it s up till now evolving under categories of the hydrological method hydraulic methodology habitat approach and holistic methodology the methodologies have their own upsides and drawbacks owing to various limitations and conditions the hydrology method which makes use of the past flow data has been used in this research work due to the data deficiency the rainfall runoff analysis has been carried out to calculate the runoff the runoff has been used as inflow data the flow in the river between june and september is high as the higher concentration of rainfall happens during this month the commonly used hydrology methods are the range of variability method rva tennant s method flow duration curve fdc base flow methodology and so forward the proposed work uses the fdc method for the estimation of environmental flow 1 1 review of various environmental flow methodologies environmental flow assessment is entirely a new field in developing countries like india the author evaluated the

would not happen if the r h s is less than the l h s vice versa acceleration of the environmental flow percentage would be suggested the result of suggestion where acceleration of the environmental flow percentage would be validated by employing the calculations made through the gis and rs application in the vegetation impact on the downstream resultants of flow of river is based on the land use pattern change and contrariwise too the effects do not stop here but extends to the low vegetation when there is no nil flow in the river this proves and thus justifies the lack of environmental flow discharge 3 1 hydrological method the flow duration curve method fdc will be used when there pertains an insufficiency in the flow data this method helps in identifying the environmental flow by plotting the graph between the discharge and the percentile of exceedance larji hydropower project is a run of river projects the inflow fig 3 for a period of 29 years 1980 2018 has been used to derive the environmental flow from fdc the discharge value corresponding to 95 in the graph is termed as the q95 the q95 value will be used as the minimal flow to protect the river fdc is the plot between the percentage of exceedance in the x axis and discharge in the y axis fdc can be created for different time spans yearly month to month and step by step the flow data used for the analysis for the duration of 1980 2018 to build an fdc initially the flow data are distinguished into a few ranges and adjusted in decreasing order to form a segment next the flow discharge for the total number of days has been consistently noted that is set apart as n then the total number of days corresponding to a specific flow is summed up as input in a separate section cumulative esteem m is included in the increasing order for the flow extend esteem or day by day discharge positioned in decreasing order the percentage of exceedance pp or the exceedance likelihood of the occasion p was determined by the weibull plotting equation equation 1 subramanya k 2013 1 pp m n 1 100 where n no of flow events m ranking of the flow events now the coordinates are taken into logarithmic values and plotted against to obtain the q95 values the fdc has all the earmarks of being in the shape that delineates flow within the norms 3 2 limitations and assumptions the fdc method was chosen because of its advantage of producing the result for data deficient flows efstratiadis et al 2014 according to vogel and fennessey 1994 the results of the method are based on the particular time period of input data and hence the result is subjective to reliability in some cases hydrological techniques which depend on recorded data methods are condemned for being frail as far as environmental information and are deficient to clarify the ecological hydrological relationship petts 1996 it has an abnormal state of result exactness in the examination with the other three strategies hence to overcome these limitations gis and rs applications have been employed the ndvi and lulc have been carried out on the downstream side of the dam to assess the spatial extent of the vegetation s health 3 3 gis and rs application in order to represent the impact on the ecosystems spatially and temporally the ndvi analysis was performed with satellite images as input in order to detect the differences in the state of vegetation covers before and after the construction of the dam table 2 shows the data acquisition dates and table 3 depicts the band combination formula for ndvi analysis the mapping of lulc has been carried out to understand the changes pertained in the study area over the course of time due to any natural or manmade activity the landsat 8 data was downloaded from the https earthexplorer usgs gov the analysis has been carried out for two periods healthy august to october and lean period november to february that too before and after the construction of the dam the larji dam was constructed in 2008 hence landsat data of lean period for before and after the construction of the dam was downloaded for the analysis the land use land cover classification was done in order to obtain a wide level of cataloging to infer different lulc classes as this work focuses on agriculture the classification will be regarding the vegetation components and water resources the assessment has been carried out using the gis applications the ndvi and lulc 4 results 4 1 hydrological method in this research work the fdc method has been employed to assess the environmental flow requirements for the larji basin the discharge value corresponding to 95 q95 depicts the environmental flow to be maintained in the dam the q95 value for all the years 1979 2018 is given in table 1 the fdc has been illustrated for the year 1979 1999 in fig 4 and 2000 2018 in fig 5 fig 6 represents the low flow value month wise as a bar chart the august month indicates higher discharge marking as the high flow season the low flow pertains in the months of november to february lean flow season in a year for around 171 days a low discharge of range of 7 13 m3 s has been discharged from the dam the current environmental flow maintained in downstream of the river is 7 cumecs out of five months three months doesn t satisfy the requirement a significant gap has been attained between the maintained and the required flow based on the way the curve progress uncertainties in the flow can be determined in that note all the years show natural flow the flow corresponding to the 95 exceedance for each year has been given in table 4 similarly the average of the december lean season month has been taken for all the years 15 of the average of december has been taken as the left hand side value the environmental flow was the incentive for individual years i e q95 values have been taken as the right hand side values 15 of the average lean season and q95 values are given in table 3 and the plot between these parameters are shown in fig 7 the q95 of the fdc values ranges from 7 m3 s to 17 m3 s and 15 of the average lean season flow value ranges from 1 m3 s to 6 m3 s fig 7 it can be seen in the figure that the required environmental flow is more than the current practice i e 15 of the average lean season flow 4 2 gis and rs application 4 2 1 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi typically analyzes the degree of greenness the greenness degree of the image correlates with the density of vegetation ndvi correlates with the amount of chlorophyll ndvi varies between 1 until 1 closer to 1 of ndvi more presence of vegetation crown density the very low values of ndvi less than 0 1 match up to barren land of sand rock or snow from 0 2 to 0 3 correspond to shrub and grassland and values from 0 6 to 0 8 indicate forest cover the ndvi analysis for the larji watershed during the lean season was carried out for 2002 landsat 7 data and 2018 landsat 8 data the results show that the greenness level has decreased from 0 72 to 0 51 in the year 2018 and the spatial extent of healthy vegetation also decreased fig 8 ndvi establishes the spatial and temporal differences in vegetation cover spread the spatial extent of the greenness in both the lean and high flow period has been decreased after the construction operation of the hydropower project considering the study area which has been located near perennial water resources the vegetation must be the best of its nature in fig 8 the reddish color indicates the absence of the vegetation this could be either build up land barren land and poor vegetation the dark blue color shows the healthy vegetation the spatial extent of the results shows that the vegetation extent has decreased after the construction of the dam the ndvi value has also decreased from 0 68 to 0 51 showing that the richness in the vegetation health has also decreased 4 2 2 lulc the lulc change for the larji dam during the lean period fig 9 shows a substantial decrease in agriculture around 0 9 along the banks of the beas river this has been reasoned out with the field survey carried out in these particular locations with the availability of the water required for agriculture has been decreased people have abandoned the agricultural practice this led to increase in open forest cover shrubs and open forest the forest cover also decreased up to 5 4 the barren land change has been up to a 1 5 decrease the change detection has been provided in terms of bar diagram fig 10 the settlement increased by up to 5 4 along the riverside the mandi town is in the downstream side of the river the major increase in the built up is in this location the water dependent ecosystem also includes the livelihood of the locales in this region fig 11 the water contribution has been decreased up to 0 3 from 2002 to 2018 the construction and operation of the dam has impacted the water resources in the region paving way for the decrease in agricultural practices the decrease in the agricultural activity suited the idea to increase the anthropogenic activity in the downstream the restoration of the land use before the construction of the dam will happen if the agricultural practices begin for which the required environmental flow should be maintained 5 discussion in situations where data was deficient the hydrological method shall be utilized to give sufficient environmental flow requirements in the dam rivers regardless of data insufficiency ten year data was broken down to obtain the fdc and the 7q10 the month august demonstrates variable flow capacity with higher discharge when contrasted with others gholami v et al 2020 estimated the environmental water requirement for the miankaleh wetland the author utilized the tenant fdc method hydrology method the wetted perimeter method hydraulic method and the physical habitat simulation model phabsim habitat method the results show that the current discharge of the rivers is less than the estimated ewr showing the discharge rates do not meet the water requirement for aquatic species of the miankaleh wetland table 5 shows the various flow norms suggested by various institutions these institutions suggest environmental flow more than 15 of average lean season flow according to smakhtin et al 2006 expert s judgment can be used to derive the environmental management class emc provided a few questions were properly asked that relate to the characteristics of the river in addition suitable questions involving the characteristics of the river the existing status of the river constraints etc were questioned and the results suggest that the environmental management class for the river is class b slightly modified class b has been chosen because the impact of the biodiversity is intact besides water generation activities in the river and also irrigation activities are allowed vogel and fennessey 1994 criticized that the fdc result is based on the period of flow data given as input the questionnaire conducted among the locale also supports the hydrology result that the flow in the river isn t sufficient for their livelihood fig 12 the mandi town is on the downstream side of the river the major increase in the built up is in this location the water dependent ecosystem also includes the livelihood of the locales in this region the sufficiency of the environmental flow has been discussed with the aid of the hydrology method and gis application the author would like to suggest that the ngt order on environmental flow can increase the percentage up to 25 i e 25 of the average lean season flow fig 13 shows that the 25 value meets the required environmental flow from the fdc results considering the hydropower production aspect and the environmental impact the suggestion is medieval between the hydropower production and environmental impact aspect the research work focused on the objectives in hand while the work paves way for future studies such as 1 the assessed environmental flow can be validated using the measured flow data 2 the percentage increase in the ngt norms can be checked for the sufficiency in maintaining the health of the system in the river basin 3 the questionnaire survey can be conducted in other parts of the beas river basin 4 the results can be applied for other basins and generalize the environmental flow norms for all the basins in india 5 a common methodology can be derived where data deficiency is a big issue in the assessment of environmental flow 6 conclusion with the aim to produce a greater amount of hydropower the administration overexploits the presence of water in the river hence there may arise a situation in which the ecosystem won t be able to sustain the riverbed ecology and riparian environment due to its case therefore there is a greater need to evaluate the requirements of ngt law s 15 of the average lean season flow for the stream has to be released to the downstream of diversion structure for the protection of flora fauna and aquatic life between intake and confluence point of tailrace and the stream the construction and operation of the dam have affected the quantity and quality of the water hence the water dependent ecosystem has been heavily affected by this in the downstream the environmental flow maintained in the larji hydropower dam is the result of past year flow data that is before the construction and operation of the dam i e 7 cumecs the 15 of the average lean season flow ranges 1 7 m3 s cumecs according to this the maintenance of the ngt law is as per order but with the current condition the author would like to suggest environmental flow as 20 25 of the average lean season flow based on various aspects although the fdc method is suitable in case of data deficiency the fact that results are based on the time period of the flow data entered as input the method has its own advantage and disadvantage the merit is that for the current condition the needed environmental flow can be calculated and the demerit is the result is questionable at various faces to overcome the flaw the gis analysis and questionnaire survey was carried out at a small scale to know about the scenario on the downstream side of the study area the locale s perception towards the sufficiency of the river water matches the result of fdc method this method s result should be combined with additional information to arrive at proper results this helps in preserving the water for the agriculture fish ecosystem cattle etc and their basic living during the lean period evaluating the sufficiency of the environmental flow helps in the decision making process by the administration and by maintaining the health of ecosystem that also meets the power requirements without any hurdle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11768,due to the shortage of fresh surface water caused by climate change groundwater has become a vital water supply for household agricultural and industrial use alternative methods for determining groundwater depth amount and quality at a lower cost and less effort are critical this study aims to determine the depth and kind of groundwater in najaf city iraq using aqua detector remote sensing device thirty nine sample locations were chosen in rural and urban regions to cover the city s 441 23 square kilometres five geographic models of groundwater depth and type were created using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method in arcgis software the results indicate that groundwater is available across the study region beginning at 100 m and lower depths additionally it has been found that the nature of groundwater fluctuates with the location and depth the findings of this study aid in selecting wells locations and depths in the study region that generate maximum quality and quantity of groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality groundwater depth aqua detector remote sensing gis wf 303 gh 1 introduction research in recent years has focused on studying groundwater in the middle east especially in iraq abdullah et al 2020 abdulrazzaq et al 2020 abojassim 2020 baba karem yazdani 2021 hassan et al 2022 ismail et al 2020 until 1970 iraq depends on surface water resources from its rivers tigris and euphrates and their tributaries to supply its water demands this water has begun to shrink gradually because of hydrological projects in riparian countries al ansari et al 2021 al ansari and adamo 2018 al ansari et al 2018 climate change has been another reason for the scarcity of surface water in iraq and the other adjacent states in the middle east abbas et al 2018 h lee 2007 due to these reasons the demand increased for groundwater during the past three decades al ansari 2021 h al bahrani et al 2021b al rawabdeh et al 2013 aljawad et al 2018 groundwater originates from precipitation rain and melting ice that penetrates the soil and is stored in the voids between rocks and soil particles within geological formations groundwater consists of nearly 95 percent of fresh water in the earth the usual geological formations of groundwater supply are sands gravel sandstone and limestone and can be classified as aquifers or confining beds the aquifer is an unconsolidated rock that will yield water in a useable quantity to a well or spring while the confining bed is a rock unit having very low hydraulic conductivity that restricts the movement of groundwater either into or out of adjacent aquifers chapman 1996 heath 2004 ojo et al 2012 the groundwater depth generally relies on the equilibrium between groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge including infiltration lateral inflow surface runoff evapotranspiration and other groundwater balance elements krogulec et al 2020 taylor and alley 2002 because water is the first general solvent groundwater usually contains significant concentrations of dissolved solids compared with surface water groundwater quality depends on the chemical composition of precipitation on the biologic and chemical reactions occurring on the land surface and in the soil zone and on the mineral composition of the aquifers and confining beds through which the water moves horizontally and vertically from an aquifer system to another or even from a geological formation to another in one system aljawad et al 2018 heath 2004 the low annual precipitation and the high evaporation also increase groundwater salinity mosaffa et al 2021 detecting the groundwater presence is an expensive process as it requires drilling wells and conducting chemical and physical tests of the samples to determine their suitability for various uses therefore searching for alternative ways to save cost and effort is very important remote sensing technology coupled with geographic information system gis is greatly preferred due to the ease of preparing a huge database over large areas required for the study and limited field checks khan et al 2020 remote sensing rs is defined as detecting goals or studying any phenomena without physical contact between the tools and these targets this technique depends on the tool s ability to receive and analyze the electromagnetic energy that emits or reflects from the targets han 2012 lavender and lavender 2015 liang and wang 2019 tempfli et al 2009 the usability of rs and gis techniques to explore and assess the location depth and type of groundwater have been adopted by many scholars either to define and identify promising areas for groundwater potential zones arefin 2020 bourjila et al 2021 magesh et al 2012 al manmi and rauf

babiker et al 2007 the gap in studying and classifying the groundwater in iraq still exists even so the development and utilization of groundwater began in 1935 when the first groundwater well was mechanically drilled al ansari et al 2014 the traditional methods of selecting drilling locations and well depths make the results unexpected for groundwater quantity and quality unfortunately these methods are not always guaranteed this study employs the aqua remote sensing device and the gis software to detect the type and depth of groundwater at several locations in najaf city finally spatial models are constructed for the results the dependence of these results develops groundwater sustainability in the study region since it reduces the mix of normal groundwater with salty and polluted ones located above it during the drilling process as a result it preserves the groundwater from deterioration and pollution it also lessens the wells drilling that produces low productivity or inferior groundwater this manuscript aims and objectives are to build digital classification maps that illustrate and clarify the depth and type of groundwater at najaf city using the aqua remote sensing device and gis 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area 2 1 1 a location the current investigation involves determining the groundwater type and depth of 39 sites along the urban and rural regions of najaf city via the remote sensing device aqua to build gis models to illustrate the type and depth classifications of groundwater on najaf map where the selected sites cover the boundary of the city and the important places najaf city is the capital of najaf governorate which locates in the southern west of iraq fig 1 with a 28 824 km2 area the average high temperature of 14 c in january to 42 c in july and the average low temperature of 6 c in january to 29 c in july the city population 1 220 145 and a population distribution rural urban 28 9 71 1 moreover it has a typical desert climate with only 99 mm of the yearly rainfall so desert plains dominate its landscape jasim et al 2021 jasim et al 2022 the city also contains the largest islamic cemetery in the world wadi al salam cemetery which covers 6 01 km2 fattah and caso 2009 according to the hydro geological system of iraq most lands of najaf city locates in the southern desert zone this system is classified into seven hydrological zones by al jibori and al basrawi hk and al basrawi 2013 beneath najaf city there is a vast groundwater aquifer called dammam aquifer the quality of this aquifer is highly variable with a total dissolved solid ranging between 390 mg l to about 5000 mg l most previously excavated wells contain salty chloride type however some wells have sulfate types with a smell of h2s aljawad et al 2018 thirty nine sites were selected to study and excavate groundwater type and depth using a new method that depends on the remote sensing device aqua the coordinates of these locations were determined with a gps device this new method of detecting groundwater that adopts a remote sensing device differs from the previous traditional methods which depend on the drilling of the wells and studying the morphology and geology of the region because these methods are more costly less efficient slow and random 2 1 2 b soil description in general sand makes from 50 to 85 of the soil with a few layers of clay and silty clayey soil at various depths the most common soil conditions are thick to extremely dense sand and cemented sand in most regions the angle of internal friction ø exceeds 35 in most of the analyzed regions the carrying capacity from spt values exceeds 10 ton m2 and the amount of sulfate in the water approaches 10 gypsum concentration is high reaching up to 25 in some areas al maliki et al 2018 sohaib k al mamoori et al 2018 almamoori 2017 2 1 3 c geomorphology different deposits cover the studied region geologically the dibdiba formation pliocene pleistocene is the oldest and it may be found in a tiny region west of the study area in the tar an najaf sandstone is the lithological component of the dibdiba sohaib kareem al mamoori et al 2020 ill sorted fine coarse grained tiny pebbles with a thickness of around 10 m are frequently recorded barwary and slewa 1994 the dibdiba formation has a lower contact with the injana formation upper miocene the injana has a thickness of 20 35 m and is mainly made up of red partially greenish silty sandy calcareous claystone and lenticels of grey brownish greenish and yellowish sandstone with thin layers 0 30 m of marly and chalky limestone thrown in for good measure barwary and slewa 1994 buday and jassim 1987 gypcrete pleistocene holocene is found in most of the research region to a thickness of 0 5 2 m of secondary gypsum in a powdery form or fibrous prismatic hard well crystallized form and as brownish spongy form flood plain and anthropogenic deposits are the holocene deposits located in a limited region east and south of the study area the flood plain deposits are made up of a loam made up of clayey silt deposits from the euphrates river that may be up to 15 m thick jassim and goff 2006 the bodies of old irrigation canals and hillocks of ancient towns make up the majority of anthropogenic deposits al kubaisi et al 2018 table 1 describes the geological formation in the study area while the geological map is presented in fig 2 2 2 aqua remote sensing device aqua is a device that uses the remote sensing rs technique to detect location depth and type of groundwater figs 4 and 5 this device records the long electromagnetics reflected from different types of water to cover a 200 m searching radius and up to 200 m depths besides its ability to recognize between normal salty and mineral waters al bahrani 2018a al bahrani 2018b discovered the aptitude of this device to detect and monitor the magnetic effect in salty water which can improve the magnetic treatment system of salty groundwater h s al bahrani 2018a al bahrani and others also discovered another usage of the aqua device and they found its ability to detect hydrocarbons contamination of surface and underground water in different vertical and horizontal spaces h s al bahrani et al 2021a the following steps were conducted carefully to carry out this study firstly the site was selected and recorded its coordinates then the aqua device was operated to detect the type and depth of groundwater at that site and typed its information next the same previous actions were done precisely at the other sites inside and around the city after that the data was entered into excel and arcgis software to analyze it statistically and build digital maps showing groundwater type and depth classifications in najaf city aqua can detect water at disconnected depths 0 25 50 100 150 and 200 m it can also scan horizontal circles with radiuses of 0 25 50 100 150 and 200 m the device can recognize different types of water i e normal salty and mineral it can also recognize carbonic and hydrocarbon polluted water h al bahrani et al 2021b the work with this device is entirely sensible to wind speed from the author s experience it is better to use it when the wind is silent less than 10 km h to get more accurate results plastic pollution also confuses its outcomes as a result it should consider these obstructions when a person uses this device to detect groundwater the procedure of the aqua work to detect the type and depth of groundwater relied on the following steps in the beginning the device was powered then the option of horizontal distance was put on 25 m to cover a circular area 25 m radius next a normal water option and a depth of 25 m were selected and then the scan icon was activated to operate the detecting system when the device begins to rotate horizontally around itself it detects normal groundwater at a depth range of 0 25 m the previous steps were repeated accurately and carefully for the other water types salty and mineral and the other depths 50 100 150 and 200 m finally the information was recorded about groundwater type and depth range and transferred to the other locations to do the same procedure 2 3 data collection thirty nine points were selected to examine the type and depth of groundwater in the study area fig 6 shows these points locations according to their importance the selected points cover most rural and urban regions of najaf city the results of the remote sensing investigation illustrate the dissimilarity of groundwater quality with depth change which was introduced in table 2 as it is seen the groundwater can be found below 100 m depth and the possibility of finding normal water will also increase when drilling wells beyond 100 m below this depth there is no pure mineral water however there is a mixture of mineral water with normal or salty waters the normal water can be found at deeper depths and its percentage up the 25 m is few as shown in fig 7 2 4 gis interpolation methods a geographical information system gis is an integrated system that combines spatial data with hardware and software to manage analyze and display all forms of geographical information sohaib kareem al mamoori and al maliki 2016 bolstad 2016 li et al 2011 this system can be used as an archive an analytical and a decision support system a gis can do many types of analysis such as data query derivative mapping and process modelling to produce and build different types of tables maps and databases its work depends on storing two types of data that are found on a map these are the geographic features and the attributes or qualities of these features however most systems use one of two fundamental map representation techniques vector and raster eastman et al 1993 in this study the gis technique to build classification maps for the type and depth of groundwater depended on the following each point recorded in the study has its coordinates represented by the latitude and longitude values using gps in addition the water type was recorded for each point for depths of 25 50 100 150 and 200 m by the aqua device these points were firstly drawn according to the coordinates using a polygon as a point via the arcgis software by introducing the water quality to the five depths classifications 0 25 25 50 50 100 100 150 and 150 200 m the water quality became known at each point interpolation was used and represented by the inverse distance weighting idw method to draw the contour line for water quality this method is commonly used as a deterministic interpolation available in arcgis this method is summed up by estimating the point values unknown on the map based on data and distances of points known values the idw method is applied to each of the five depths mentioned above thus we get five maps depending on the water quality input with different classifications the resulting maps are converted into a raster with 30 30 m for each depth each water classification area is calculated by multiplying the number of cells by the area of one cell 30 30 so the total area is calculated for each type and different water depths 3 results and discussion the outcomes of the aqua device of each point with its coordinates were entered into the arcgis software to build five spatial depth quality models in these models the depth classifications of this study are 0 25 25 50 50 100 100 150 and 150 200 m these five models are classified into eight water quality categories no water normal salty mineral normal mineral salty normal salty mineral and salty normal mineral water figs 8 and 9 show the groundwater spatial depth quality models in najaf city red spots represent no water while orange shows the areas with normal groundwater suitable for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes the yellow colour represents salty groundwater unsuitable for most uses in contrast the light green colour shows the mineral groundwater with high concentrations of carbonates and bicarbonates compounds or significant amounts of organic carbon the other colours denote the mixed states of the three groundwater types normal salty and mineral it is clear from these five visible models that the red colour no water disappears below 100 m figs 8 9a and 9b show that the red colour concentrated in the eastern part for depths of 0 100 and this is normal because the area is topographically high while the western part contains salty water and few parts have normal water and this is due to the depression of the western region therefore it can be generalized that najaf groundwater is available at depths greater than 100 m the orange spots normal water are larger in shallow depths 0 25 m than their areas in depths 25 100 m particularly in the rural regions at the west of najaf however the orange spots of normal groundwater enlarge in urban regions with increasing depth the yellow colour reduction salty groundwater with depth increasing is also observed furthermore the type mixture of groundwater accumulates at 100 200 m depths it is also noticed that the water quality model at depth 100 150 m is as similar to the model at depth 150 200 m they are supposed to be in the same hydrological layer and there is hardly any human intervention at these depths the groundwater area covered with these spatial models is 441 23 km table 3 and fig 10 classify the area percentage of groundwater according to its status and depth in the study region which is found via the aqua device and gis software results it is found that only 23 of the study area does not have groundwater at a depth range of 0 25 m simultaneously 17 of normal water is at this depth suitable for agriculture and other uses while 21 is unsuitable salty water 1 the previous positive experiments of using the aqua device to detect the location type and depth of groundwater must be presented with a certain verification of the results of this study 2 in addition the investigation of the depth and type of wells that were located in the study area by many previous researchers al kubaisi et al 2018 alikhan et al 2020 khassaf and hassan 2017 proved the accuracy of results of these gis classification models 3 another check was done by comparing the results of the aqua detector with a new detecting device wf 303 gh fig 11 it was found that the detecting results of these two different devices were similar wf 303 gh is one of the newest instruments used to detect groundwater made by the mwf american turkish company its accuracy is enhanced in comparison with other instruments because it detects groundwater depending on two different systems the first one is the long range locator system lrl its search principle is receiving electrostatic fields of water by digital frequency signal processing to search for water to a 1000 m maximum depth and to a 2000 m maximum horizontal radius it also recognizes between normal salty mineral and all water types the new excellence in this unit is the wireless connection between it and the ground reinforcement unit in the same instrument this virtue reduces the confusion in the ground to increase the search accuracy fig 12a the second system is the geophysical search system which measures and analyzes the ground s electrical resistance levels and polar grouping according to automatic processing this unit can automatically detect water depth up to 800 m water type fresh salty and mineral water density quantity of water in percentages the highest value of groundwater flow between research electrodes and cavities fig 12 b the basic principles of electrical resistance work and other geotechnical methods are found in rolia and sutjiningsih 2018 4 table 3 represents field verification by measuring the coordinates and the total dissolved solids tds of some wells in the study area comparing the results with the water type classifications of the digital maps in fig 9 the total dissolved solids tds of water is classified into three categories by food and agriculture organization fao according to the degree of restriction ayers and westcot 1985 there is no restriction when tds is below 450 mg l slight to moderate restriction when its range equals 450 2000 mg l and severe restrictions when it is greater than 2000 mg l the expression no restriction means no soil or cropping problems are recognized or experienced at tds less than 450 mg l the expression meaning of slight to moderate restriction is gradually increasing care in the selection of crops and requirements of management alternatives when full yield potential is to be carried out if the water quality is classified as severe restrictions the water user should face soil and cropping problems or reduced yields in some 5 cases it has been seen that farmers have used water with tds greater than 2000 mg l severe restrictions to cultivate plants such as tomatoes cucumbers onions barely and other salt restricted plants this happens when the dissolved solids in water are not severely harmful to these plants therefore it is recommended when using poor water quality for irrigation to conduct a series of pilot farming studies to decide the best farming and cropping techniques that need to be applied the parallel of the data in the last two columns of table 4 gives acceptable verification for the digital maps 4 conclusions we have studied in this research the groundwater type and depth in najaf city using the aqua remote sensing device and modelling the results with gis to build digital classification maps of groundwater type and depth it is concluded from this study the possibility of detecting and excavating the location and depth of good quality groundwater by using the appropriate groundwater finder such as aqua or wf303gh the study area has different types of groundwater such as normal salty and mineral additionally it contains a mixture of all three types as

11768,due to the shortage of fresh surface water caused by climate change groundwater has become a vital water supply for household agricultural and industrial use alternative methods for determining groundwater depth amount and quality at a lower cost and less effort are critical this study aims to determine the depth and kind of groundwater in najaf city iraq using aqua detector remote sensing device thirty nine sample locations were chosen in rural and urban regions to cover the city s 441 23 square kilometres five geographic models of groundwater depth and type were created using the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation method in arcgis software the results indicate that groundwater is available across the study region beginning at 100 m and lower depths additionally it has been found that the nature of groundwater fluctuates with the location and depth the findings of this study aid in selecting wells locations and depths in the study region that generate maximum quality and quantity of groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality groundwater depth aqua detector remote sensing gis wf 303 gh 1 introduction research in recent years has focused on studying groundwater in the middle east especially in iraq abdullah et al 2020 abdulrazzaq et al 2020 abojassim 2020 baba karem yazdani 2021 hassan et al 2022 ismail et al 2020 until 1970 iraq depends on surface water resources from its rivers tigris and euphrates and their tributaries to supply its water demands this water has begun to shrink gradually because of hydrological projects in riparian countries al ansari et al 2021 al ansari and adamo 2018 al ansari et al 2018 climate change has been another reason for the scarcity of surface water in iraq and the other adjacent states in the middle east abbas et al 2018 h lee 2007 due to these reasons the demand increased for groundwater during the past three decades al ansari 2021 h al bahrani et al 2021b al rawabdeh et al 2013 aljawad et al 2018 groundwater originates from precipitation rain and melting ice that penetrates the soil and is stored in the voids between rocks and soil particles within geological formations groundwater consists of nearly 95 percent of fresh water in the earth the usual geological formations of groundwater supply are sands gravel sandstone and limestone and can be classified as aquifers or confining beds the aquifer is an unconsolidated rock that will yield water in a useable quantity to a well or spring while the confining bed is a rock unit having very low hydraulic conductivity that restricts the movement of groundwater either into or out of adjacent aquifers chapman 1996 heath 2004 ojo et al 2012 the groundwater depth generally relies on the equilibrium between groundwater recharge and groundwater discharge including infiltration lateral inflow surface runoff evapotranspiration and other groundwater balance elements krogulec et al 2020 taylor and alley 2002 because water is the first general solvent groundwater usually contains significant concentrations of dissolved solids compared with surface water groundwater quality depends on the chemical composition of precipitation on the biologic and chemical reactions occurring on the land surface and in the soil zone and on the mineral composition of the aquifers and confining beds through which the water moves horizontally and vertically from an aquifer system to another or even from a geological formation to another in one system aljawad et al 2018 heath 2004 the low annual precipitation and the high evaporation also increase groundwater salinity mosaffa et al 2021 detecting the groundwater presence is an expensive process as it requires drilling wells and conducting chemical and physical tests of the samples to determine their suitability for various uses therefore searching for alternative ways to save cost and effort is very important remote sensing technology coupled with geographic information system gis is greatly preferred due to the ease of preparing a huge database over large areas required for the study and limited field checks khan et al 2020 remote sensing rs is defined as detecting goals or studying any phenomena without physical contact between the tools and these targets this technique depends on the tool s ability to receive and analyze the electromagnetic energy that emits or reflects from the targets han 2012 lavender and lavender 2015 liang and wang 2019 tempfli et al 2009 the usability of rs and gis techniques to explore and assess the location depth and type of groundwater have been adopted by many scholars either to define and identify promising areas for groundwater potential zones arefin 2020 bourjila et al 2021 magesh et al 2012 al manmi and rauf 2016 arunbose et al 2021 khan et al 2020 machiwal et al 2011 tahiri et al 2020 groundwater contamination risk maps ducci 1999 s m lee min woo kim and ahn 2003 or to determine groundwater quality babiker et al 2007 the gap in studying and classifying the groundwater in iraq still exists even so the development and utilization of groundwater began in 1935 when the first groundwater well was mechanically drilled al ansari et al 2014 the traditional methods of selecting drilling locations and well depths make the results unexpected for groundwater quantity and quality unfortunately these methods are not always guaranteed this study employs the aqua remote sensing device and the gis software to detect the type and depth of groundwater at several locations in najaf city finally spatial models are constructed for the results the dependence of these results develops groundwater sustainability in the study region since it reduces the mix of normal groundwater with salty and polluted ones located above it during the drilling process as a result it preserves the groundwater from deterioration and pollution it also lessens the wells drilling that produces low productivity or inferior groundwater this manuscript aims and objectives are to build digital classification maps that illustrate and clarify the depth and type of groundwater at najaf city using the aqua remote sensing device and gis 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area 2 1 1 a location the current investigation involves determining the groundwater type and depth of 39 sites along the urban and rural regions of najaf city via the remote sensing device aqua to build gis models to illustrate the type and depth classifications of groundwater on najaf map where the selected sites cover the boundary of the city and the important places najaf city is the capital of najaf governorate which locates in the southern west of iraq fig 1 with a 28 824 km2 area the average high temperature of 14 c in january to 42 c in july and the average low temperature of 6 c in january to 29 c in july the city population 1 220 145 and a population distribution rural urban 28 9 71 1 moreover it has a typical desert climate with only 99 mm of the yearly rainfall so desert plains dominate its landscape jasim et al 2021 jasim et al 2022 the city also contains the largest islamic cemetery in the world wadi al salam cemetery which covers 6 01 km2 fattah and caso 2009 according to the hydro geological system of iraq most lands of najaf city locates in the southern desert zone this system is classified into seven hydrological zones by al jibori and al basrawi hk and al basrawi 2013 beneath najaf city there is a vast groundwater aquifer called dammam aquifer the quality of this aquifer is highly variable with a total dissolved solid ranging between 390 mg l to about 5000 mg l most previously excavated wells contain salty chloride type however some wells have sulfate types with a smell of h2s aljawad et al 2018 thirty nine sites were selected to study and excavate groundwater type and depth using a new method that depends on the remote sensing device aqua the coordinates of these locations were determined with a gps device this new method of detecting groundwater that adopts a remote sensing device differs from the previous traditional methods which depend on the drilling of the wells and studying the morphology and geology of the region because these methods are more costly less efficient slow and random 2 1 2 b soil description in general sand makes from 50 to 85 of the soil with a few layers of clay and silty clayey soil at various depths the most common soil conditions are thick to extremely dense sand and cemented sand in most regions the angle of internal friction ø exceeds 35 in most of the analyzed regions the carrying capacity from spt values exceeds 10 ton m2 and the amount of sulfate in the water approaches 10 gypsum concentration is high reaching up to 25 in some areas al maliki et al 2018 sohaib k al mamoori et al 2018 almamoori 2017 2 1 3 c geomorphology different deposits cover the studied region geologically the dibdiba formation pliocene pleistocene is the oldest and it may be found in a tiny region west of the study area in the tar an najaf sandstone is the lithological component of the dibdiba sohaib kareem al mamoori et al 2020 ill sorted fine coarse grained tiny pebbles with a thickness of around 10 m are frequently recorded barwary and slewa 1994 the dibdiba formation has a lower contact with the injana formation upper miocene the injana has a thickness of 20 35 m and is mainly made up of red partially greenish silty sandy calcareous claystone and lenticels of grey brownish greenish and yellowish sandstone with thin layers 0 30 m of marly and chalky limestone thrown in for good measure barwary and slewa 1994 buday and jassim 1987 gypcrete pleistocene holocene is found in most of the research region to a thickness of 0 5 2 m of secondary gypsum in a powdery form or fibrous prismatic hard well crystallized form and as brownish spongy form flood plain and anthropogenic deposits are the holocene deposits located in a limited region east and south of the study area the flood plain deposits are made up of a loam made up of clayey silt deposits from the euphrates river that may be up to 15 m thick jassim and goff 2006 the bodies of old irrigation canals and hillocks of ancient towns make up the majority of anthropogenic deposits al kubaisi et al 2018 table 1 describes the geological formation in the study area while the geological map is presented in fig 2 2 2 aqua remote sensing device aqua is a device that uses the remote sensing rs technique to detect location depth and type of groundwater figs 4 and 5 this device records the long electromagnetics reflected from different types of water to cover a 200 m searching radius and up to 200 m depths besides its ability to recognize between normal salty and mineral waters al bahrani 2018a al bahrani 2018b discovered the aptitude of this device to detect and monitor the magnetic effect in salty water which can improve the magnetic treatment system of salty groundwater h s al bahrani 2018a al bahrani and others also discovered another usage of the aqua device and they found its ability to detect hydrocarbons contamination of surface and underground water in different vertical and horizontal spaces h s al bahrani et al 2021a the following steps were conducted carefully to carry out this study firstly the site was selected and recorded its coordinates then the aqua device was operated to detect the type and depth of groundwater at that site and typed its information next the same previous actions were done precisely at the other sites inside and around the city after that the data was entered into excel and arcgis software to analyze it statistically and build digital maps showing groundwater type and depth classifications in najaf city aqua can detect water at disconnected depths 0 25 50 100 150 and 200 m it can also scan horizontal circles with radiuses of 0 25 50 100 150 and 200 m the device can recognize different types of water i e normal salty and mineral it can also recognize carbonic and hydrocarbon polluted water h al bahrani et al 2021b the work with this device is entirely sensible to wind speed from the author s experience it is better to use it when the wind is silent less than 10 km h to get more accurate results plastic pollution also confuses its outcomes as a result it should consider these obstructions when a person uses this device to detect groundwater the procedure of the aqua work to detect the type and depth of groundwater relied on the following steps in the beginning the device was powered then the option of horizontal distance was put on 25 m to cover a circular area 25 m radius next a normal water option and a depth of 25 m were selected and then the scan icon was activated to operate the detecting system when the device begins to rotate horizontally around itself it detects normal groundwater at a depth range of 0 25 m the previous steps were repeated accurately and carefully for the other water types salty and mineral and the other depths 50 100 150 and 200 m finally the information was recorded about groundwater type and depth range and transferred to the other locations to do the same procedure 2 3 data collection thirty nine points were selected to examine the type and depth of groundwater in the study area fig 6 shows these points locations according to their importance the selected points cover most rural and urban regions of najaf city the results of the remote sensing investigation illustrate the dissimilarity of groundwater quality with depth change which was introduced in table 2 as it is seen the groundwater can be found below 100 m depth and the possibility of finding normal water will also increase when drilling wells beyond 100 m below this depth there is no pure mineral water however there is a mixture of mineral water with normal or salty waters the normal water can be found at deeper depths and its percentage up the 25 m is few as shown in fig 7 2 4 gis interpolation methods a geographical information system gis is an integrated system that combines spatial data with hardware and software to manage analyze and display all forms of geographical information sohaib kareem al mamoori and al maliki 2016 bolstad 2016 li et al 2011 this system can be used as an archive an analytical and a decision support system a gis can do many types of analysis such as data query derivative mapping and process modelling to produce and build different types of tables maps and databases its work depends on storing two types of data that are found on a map these are the geographic features and the attributes or qualities of these features however most systems use one of two fundamental map representation techniques vector and raster eastman et al 1993 in this study the gis technique to build classification maps for the type and depth of groundwater depended on the following each point recorded in the study has its coordinates represented by the latitude and longitude values using gps in addition the water type was recorded for each point for depths of 25 50 100 150 and 200 m by the aqua device these points were firstly drawn according to the coordinates using a polygon as a point via the arcgis software by introducing the water quality to the five depths classifications 0 25 25 50 50 100 100 150 and 150 200 m the water quality became known at each point interpolation was used and represented by the inverse distance weighting idw method to draw the contour line for water quality this method is commonly used as a deterministic interpolation available in arcgis this method is summed up by estimating the point values unknown on the map based on data and distances of points known values the idw method is applied to each of the five depths mentioned above thus we get five maps depending on the water quality input with different classifications the resulting maps are converted into a raster with 30 30 m for each depth each water classification area is calculated by multiplying the number of cells by the area of one cell 30 30 so the total area is calculated for each type and different water depths 3 results and discussion the outcomes of the aqua device of each point with its coordinates were entered into the arcgis software to build five spatial depth quality models in these models the depth classifications of this study are 0 25 25 50 50 100 100 150 and 150 200 m these five models are classified into eight water quality categories no water normal salty mineral normal mineral salty normal salty mineral and salty normal mineral water figs 8 and 9 show the groundwater spatial depth quality models in najaf city red spots represent no water while orange shows the areas with normal groundwater suitable for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes the yellow colour represents salty groundwater unsuitable for most uses in contrast the light green colour shows the mineral groundwater with high concentrations of carbonates and bicarbonates compounds or significant amounts of organic carbon the other colours denote the mixed states of the three groundwater types normal salty and mineral it is clear from these five visible models that the red colour no water disappears below 100 m figs 8 9a and 9b show that the red colour concentrated in the eastern part for depths of 0 100 and this is normal because the area is topographically high while the western part contains salty water and few parts have normal water and this is due to the depression of the western region therefore it can be generalized that najaf groundwater is available at depths greater than 100 m the orange spots normal water are larger in shallow depths 0 25 m than their areas in depths 25 100 m particularly in the rural regions at the west of najaf however the orange spots of normal groundwater enlarge in urban regions with increasing depth the yellow colour reduction salty groundwater with depth increasing is also observed furthermore the type mixture of groundwater accumulates at 100 200 m depths it is also noticed that the water quality model at depth 100 150 m is as similar to the model at depth 150 200 m they are supposed to be in the same hydrological layer and there is hardly any human intervention at these depths the groundwater area covered with these spatial models is 441 23 km table 3 and fig 10 classify the area percentage of groundwater according to its status and depth in the study region which is found via the aqua device and gis software results it is found that only 23 of the study area does not have groundwater at a depth range of 0 25 m simultaneously 17 of normal water is at this depth suitable for agriculture and other uses while 21 is unsuitable salty water 1 the previous positive experiments of using the aqua device to detect the location type and depth of groundwater must be presented with a certain verification of the results of this study 2 in addition the investigation of the depth and type of wells that were located in the study area by many previous researchers al kubaisi et al 2018 alikhan et al 2020 khassaf and hassan 2017 proved the accuracy of results of these gis classification models 3 another check was done by comparing the results of the aqua detector with a new detecting device wf 303 gh fig 11 it was found that the detecting results of these two different devices were similar wf 303 gh is one of the newest instruments used to detect groundwater made by the mwf american turkish company its accuracy is enhanced in comparison with other instruments because it detects groundwater depending on two different systems the first one is the long range locator system lrl its search principle is receiving electrostatic fields of water by digital frequency signal processing to search for water to a 1000 m maximum depth and to a 2000 m maximum horizontal radius it also recognizes between normal salty mineral and all water types the new excellence in this unit is the wireless connection between it and the ground reinforcement unit in the same instrument this virtue reduces the confusion in the ground to increase the search accuracy fig 12a the second system is the geophysical search system which measures and analyzes the ground s electrical resistance levels and polar grouping according to automatic processing this unit can automatically detect water depth up to 800 m water type fresh salty and mineral water density quantity of water in percentages the highest value of groundwater flow between research electrodes and cavities fig 12 b the basic principles of electrical resistance work and other geotechnical methods are found in rolia and sutjiningsih 2018 4 table 3 represents field verification by measuring the coordinates and the total dissolved solids tds of some wells in the study area comparing the results with the water type classifications of the digital maps in fig 9 the total dissolved solids tds of water is classified into three categories by food and agriculture organization fao according to the degree of restriction ayers and westcot 1985 there is no restriction when tds is below 450 mg l slight to moderate restriction when its range equals 450 2000 mg l and severe restrictions when it is greater than 2000 mg l the expression no restriction means no soil or cropping problems are recognized or experienced at tds less than 450 mg l the expression meaning of slight to moderate restriction is gradually increasing care in the selection of crops and requirements of management alternatives when full yield potential is to be carried out if the water quality is classified as severe restrictions the water user should face soil and cropping problems or reduced yields in some 5 cases it has been seen that farmers have used water with tds greater than 2000 mg l severe restrictions to cultivate plants such as tomatoes cucumbers onions barely and other salt restricted plants this happens when the dissolved solids in water are not severely harmful to these plants therefore it is recommended when using poor water quality for irrigation to conduct a series of pilot farming studies to decide the best farming and cropping techniques that need to be applied the parallel of the data in the last two columns of table 4 gives acceptable verification for the digital maps 4 conclusions we have studied in this research the groundwater type and depth in najaf city using the aqua remote sensing device and modelling the results with gis to build digital classification maps of groundwater type and depth it is concluded from this study the possibility of detecting and excavating the location and depth of good quality groundwater by using the appropriate groundwater finder such as aqua or wf303gh the study area has different types of groundwater such as normal salty and mineral additionally it contains a mixture of all three types as

11769,in the last decade researchers have underscored the need for carrying out climate change analysis at regional and sub regional levels against this backdrop we analyzed the climatic variability and environmental changes that occurred during the last seven decades 1958 2019 and their impact on groundwater variability in south bihar india we employed a mixed method approach and analyzed both the quantitative scientific data and qualitative ethnographic data collected from the local farmers the scientific data was compiled for the climatic parameters rainfall and temperature hydrological parameters runoff actual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and climate water deficit terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage capacity using terraclimate model and global land data assimilation system the public perception of climatic variability and environmental change was analyzed using farmers understanding of environmental variability in selected villages of south bihar in terms of climatic variations the historical climatic data showed rainfall variability over the last seven decades higher unpredictability in monsoon rainfall is evident from the 1990s onwards the average temperature had gone up by 0 5 oc over the study period the surface and groundwater deficit across south bihar was relatively high above 600 mm with a significant sub regional variation from the public understanding perspective the climatic variations were mostly narrated in terms of deficit and erratic rainfall which increased in recent decades farmers explained the groundwater scarcity and associated environmental changes based on their lived experience both scientific and farmers understanding of environmental variability explains the high climatic variability during the last three decades graphical abstract image 1 keywords climatic variations environmental change hydrological conditions groundwater fluctuation public perception south bihar india 1 introduction

climatic data collection and modeling approach for this study the historic climatic data is collected from terraclimate a monthly climate and water balance gridded data for global terrestrial surfaces abatzoglou et al 2018 it is climatically aided interpolation based high spatial resolution data from worldclim datasets these data have been divided into two categories i primary climate variables e g rainfall temperature and ii derived variables e g runoff evapotranspiration et potential evapotranspiration pet this dataset is widely employed for scenario generation of hydrological and ecological studies in the present study different climatic rainfall and temperature and hydrological runoff et pet and climate water deficit parameters are examined for a period of 61 years 1958 2019 to obtain the annual and seasonal climatological hydro climatic information of the study area fig 2 however the spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial water storage tws and groundwater storage gws have been conducted only for a relatively short period 2000 2014 from the global land data assimilation system gldas2 and catchment land surface model clsm due to unavailability of the high resolution long term

temperature are critically important parameters in defining climatic variations and are crucial for agriculture and future crop productivity watson and challinor 2013 the runoff is extremely important for river morphological studies because of changes in the landscape by the action of erosion the runoff data is vital for understanding watershed management and groundwater recharge sharma et al 2022 the runoff is affected by various meteorological factors like the type of rainfall rainfall amount duration intensity distribution of rainfall the direction of storm movement and antecedent rainfall ries 1990 it depends on various physical characteristics like elevation slope of the land land use drainage area basin shape and drainage network pattern the et and pet are significant for understanding the characteristics of the crop over the growing season mhetre et al 2013 the climate water deficit data indicates the water stress areas considering the changing climatic conditions the current analysis mainly focuses on annual and season wise historical environmental changes from the secondary dataset terraclimate 1958 2019 and gldas2 2000 2014 historical data represent the spatiotemporal environmental changes climatic condition hydrological condition and total water availability condition of south bihar the above mentioned seasonal and annual data for temperature tws and gws over the study domain were extracted using a mask file in climate data operator software schulzweida 2021 the spatial plots of the tws and gws are prepared using the matplotlib package in python3 hunter 2007 further the area averaged value of temperature over the study domain for these periods is then extracted by taking the mean of the temperature values at each grid point and different time series the probability density pdf curve is prepared from seasonal and annual temperature time series data to represent the temporal variability using the matplotlib package in python3 the area averaged value of the hydrometeorological parameters is further explored to examine their relationship using kendall and pearson heatmap correlation matrix analysis it is prepared using the seaborn package in python3 waskom 2021 2 3 village level data collection to augment the historical climatic and environmental data collected from scientific databases we conducted 24 life history interviews with farmers in three villages simraur nekpur and meyar of gaya and nalanda district south bihar during 2019 2021 the life history interviews with farmers lasted between 30to 70 minutes the details of the selected respondent such as gender age and educational qualification in the life history surveys are listed in table s1 we purposively selected farmers in the age bracket of 45 years 85 years and ensured that either they were active farmers or had actively done farming in the past a bottom up assessment sharma 2020b of climatic variations is crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of environmental change conway et al 2019 madhuri and sharma 2020 paudel et al 2020 singh et al 2016 life history interviews have become an effective tool for capturing bottom up perspectives singh et al 2019 wolf et al 2010 life history involves open ended interviewing and offers a rich description of life as a whole singh et al 2019 given the life of farming communities revolving around agrarian practices at the local level over a long duration the perceptions memories and experiences of climatic variation and environmental change among farmers can offer a rich contextual understanding of the local situation key personal moments in the agrarian life of farmers when agricultural practices were influenced by environmental changes help to develop a bottom up understanding of climatic variability and environmental change the interviews were conducted in hindi and magdhi a local dialect all the life history interviews were recorded and transcribed thereafter the data collected through the interviews were manually coded adu 2019 and analyzed employing the conceptual framework 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal changes in climatic conditions fig 3 represents the seasonal and annual rainfall variability during the historical period indicating the temporal change of the climatic variability over the study region the rainfall variability is significantly high among seasons with the highest rainfall received during monsoon followed by post monsoon pre monsoon and winter seasons subsequently fig 3 this indicates that the monsoonal rain is the major contributor of water in south bihar while the other seasons contribute much less it is observed that the rainfall was above normal for most of the time during 1958 1990 while it declined in most of the seasons during 1991 2018 fig 3a however the rainfall variability is relatively higher during the post monsoon winter and pre monsoon seasons fig 3b d the recorded cumulative annual rainfall is maximum 1560 mm and minimum 594 mm during 1971 and 1992 respectively table 1 as the monsoon is the main rainfall contributing season over the study area the interannual variability closely resembles the pattern of the annual rainfall our findings corroborate with laskar et al 2014 who studied the rainfall over bihar from 1871 to 2011 and reported that 84 of rainfall occurs during monsoon 7 in pre monsoon 6 in post monsoon and 3 in the winter season it can be noted that rainfall distributions during monsoon and pre monsoon may strongly impact agriculture activities a careful examination of these results doesn t show any clear trend in rainfall but reflects variability in the selected seven decades in south bihar 3 2 temporal changes in hydrological parameters fig 4 reflects the probability density function pdf of the seasonal annual temperature for 1958 to 2019 over the study region among the seasons pre monsoon is found to be warmer among seasons with an average temperature of 31 7 oc the winter i e december february months is the coldest season with a mean value of around 29 oc while the average temperature for monsoon and post monsoon is close to 29 5 oc the average seasonal and annual temperature has increased during the study period while the average temperature has gone up by 0 5 oc in the past seven decades data not presented it is essential to understand the hydrological conditions for sustainable and efficient use of water resources in the era of climate uncertainty in the present study four important hydrological parameters like runoff evapotranspiration et potential evapotranspiration pet and climate water deficit by the terraclimate dataset from 1958 to 2019 have been considered for further examination figure s1 s4 runoff is a very significant parameter for the natural water cycle being the wettest season the monsoon receives the highest rainfall and has the highest seasonal runoff compared to other seasons the annual runoff value is found to be highest 655 mm and lowest 33 mm during 1971 and 1992 respectively table 1 the minimum and maximum values of runoff can be attributed to the annual rainfall of around 1560 mm and a minimum 594 mm during 1971 and 1992 respectively which were the years with maximum and minimum rainfall table 1 the runoff not only depends upon the precipitation but also on soil type slope and land use land cover changes it is only part of the rainfall which enters the stream directly after rainfall rao 2020 the lowest seasonal runoff 0 26 mm and 0 mm is observed during the pre monsoon of 1972 and the winter of 2006 table 1 further the relatively higher rainfall led to runoff of more than 400 mm in 1987 2011 and 2019 the analysis shows that the variability of runoff over the study domain is high for seasonal as well as annual rainfall figure s1 the present study also examines the et another critical component of the water cycle the analysis reflects that the seasonal maximum et occurred during monsoon and pre monsoon are estimated to be 539 mm and 46 mm respectively in 1994 table 1 the seasonal rainfall shows that et during monsoon has declined in recent times however the variability is high over other seasons figure s2 the analysis for annual et ranges from 638 mm 1993 to 947 mm 1978 during the study period table 1 the pet over the study domain is examined for all seasons and also on an annual basis figure s3 the pet during monsoon from 1958 to 1990 is higher than the period from 1991 to 2018 while winter shows the opposite behavior the variability of pet during pre monsoon and post monsoon is much high among the seasons the annual pet variability is quite similar to the behavior of monsoon which reflects the higher values in the initial half of the study period and lower values in the later half of the study period the pet describes the capacity to induce the climate for evaporation from soil plus transpiration by plants the pet varies between 1372 mm and 1601 mm during the study period table 1 the climate water deficit is another crucial parameter for agriculture water management it was calculated from the integrated climatic and hydrological parameters using a thornthwaite mather climate water balance model willmott et al 1985 the present study uses the climate water deficit parameter for spatiotemporal environmental changes which represents the annual evaporative demand that exceeds the available water the analysis shows that the annual climate water deficit varied between 492 mm minimum and 955 mm maximum during 1971 and 1992 respectively table 1 it is interesting to observe that the study region is mostly water deficit during the entire period with values mostly exceeding 600 mm with an exception during 1971 492 mm 1973 593 mm 1978 506 mm and 1990 565 mm among seasons the pre monsoon has the highest water deficit five to six fold higher than the other seasons figure s4 this is followed by low 28 143 mm to moderate 90 188 mm water deficit during post monsoon and winter respectively interestingly monsoon the highest precipitating season is also water deficit during most of the study period except for 1971 1978 1990 and 2011 3 3 spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial water storage terrestrial water storage tws is a crucial parameter for understanding the global hydrological cycle it indicates the summation of all forms of water on the land surface it can be divided into five main categories such as surface water storage sws groundwater storage gws soil moisture storage sms canopy water storage cws and snow water equivalent swe for better planning of water resources management purposes zhang et al 2019 the tws represents the spatiotemporal variability of the dryness and wetness condition over an area the present study examines the seasonal and annual tws over the study domain for the period of 2000 2014 using global land data assimilation system gldas2 and catchment land surface model clsm fig 5 the spatial structure confirms that the tws is low in pre monsoon compared to other seasons the seasonally averaged monsoon tws over the study domain reflects that southern districts such as nawada gaya and jamui have higher tws than the other districts fig 5a the tws is highest in nawada 1100 2000 mm followed by gaya 800 1200 mm and jamui 800 1100 mm while other districts show the value in a range of 700 900 mm only it was perceived that a relatively high tws had appeared in the district of nawada gaya and jamui because of the existing dense river network it is found that these districts were also covered by a higher percentage of forest land as compared to other districts in contrast a low tws was observed in the district of aurangabad rohtas buxar bhojpur patna bhagalpur and munger the tws during post monsoon is higher than in the pre monsoon and winter seasons the tws in nawada shows even more than 2000 mm and tws values increase by 100 200 mm in all districts across the study domain for the pre monsoon time fig 5b this increase can be attributed to the increase in soil water and groundwater during the monsoon period it is interesting to observe that the wintertime spatial distribution and magnitude of tws are very similar to the monsoon months across the study area except the tws is high over nawada district fig 5c the decline in rainfall may lead to a decrease in the soil water content and hence the tws decreases in winter as compared to the post monsoon season the tws is most negligible across the study domain during pre monsoon where the tws ranges between 700 and 1100 mm with the highest magnitude for nawada district fig 5d the annual averaged tws also closely resembles the monsoon pattern in terms of spatial distribution and magnitude across the study domain fig 5e apart from this the tws also shows temporal variability which can be attributed to the impact of environmental climate change over the study area table 2 total water availability is very significant for future sustainable water resources planning considering the climate uncertainty 3 4 spatiotemporal changes in groundwater storage groundwater is one of the major source for irrigation and domestic use in the region groundwater aquifers act as a reservoir and can be utilized during droughts and when surface water remains unavailable vaux 2011 an understanding of groundwater storage gws conditions is required for the proper management of regional groundwater in the present research the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual gws estimation have been computed using tws from the year 2000 2014 over the study domain the seasonal and annual gws follows a similar spatial distribution across the study domain fig 6 the gws reflects that the southern districts such as gaya nawada and jamui have higher gws 600 1300 mm as compared to the other districts 500 700 mm in the monsoon season over the study domain fig 6a the higher tws during post monsoon leads to higher values of gws than during monsoon with the highest value 1000 1300 mm around the southern districts of the study domain fig 6b this slowly declines during winter in both the southern districts 800 1300 mm and also in other districts 500 700 mm fig 6c the gws has the most negligible value during the pre monsoon due to the less tws and long dry period and higher temperature across the study domain however the southern districts such as gaya nawada and jamui still show a gws of 600 1200 mm while the rest have a magnitude of less than 450 mm fig 6d similarly analysis of the annual gws reflects a similar spatial pattern as that of monsoon fig 6e this analysis shows that the high groundwater stress zones occurred in aurangabad rohtas buxar bhojpur patna and arwal however high groundwater storage 1021 1700 mm manifests in gaya nawada and jamui districts for the studied duration because of the availability of high terrestrial water further a moderate gws appeared in the district of bhabhua sheikhpura lakhisrai bhagalpur and banka irrespective of these spatial features the gws also shows a high variability over the study domain during the selected period which can be attributed to the changing climatic conditions table 3 3 5 correlation analysis the study further examines the relationship among different hydrometeorological parameters such as rainfall rf temperature tmp runoff q actual evapotranspiration aet terrestrial water storage tws and groundwater storage gws using kendall and pearson heatmap correlation matrix analysis fig 7 it indicates the bivariate analysis of two variables and the direction of the relationship sahoo et al 2021 it also measures the strength of association of two variables and identifies a monotonous relationship these correlation values vary between 1 and 1 where 1 1 and 0 indicate the positive negative and no relationship respectively dhar et al 2014 the correlation of rainfall is high with gws above 0 65 tws above 0 65 and runoff above 0 75 as compared to other parameters fig 7 the study domain receives most rainfall during the monsoon period and the rest of the seasons are dry the higher the rainfall the higher the runoff during the rainy period and hence the correlation between them are high the rain fills the surface water bodies over the study domain and increases the tws hence more rainfall leads to higher tws which is reflected in the higher correlation value over the study domain the higher tws supports the infiltration of the water below ground which leads to an increase in the gws therefore the correlation between tws and gws is robust above 0 95 which is also evident from the analysis of spatial features overall the change in the runoff tws and gws are directly dependent upon the rainfall which is apparent from the strong positive correlation between them further a moderate correlation value of aet with rf gws and tws can be attributed to a rise in the rainfall leading to an increase in the tws gws and ultimately the aet the temperature is negatively correlated with all the other parameters over the study domain 3 6 climatic variations and environmental changes the bottom up perspective historically south bihar is a water deficit region unlike the northern part of the state which is water rich agriculture in the region remained primarily rain fed and dependent on the age old traditional irrigation system sengupta 1980 sharma 2021 water availability and irrigation technologies have continuously played a significant role in shaping the agrarian practices in the region sharma 2017 climatic variations were reported by the farmers primarily in terms of erratic and deficit rainfall the majority of the respondents narrated that the rainfall has declined over the years and has become more uncertain the erratic rainfall shaped their choice of paddy varieties during the 1960s and 70s for instance one of the farmers narrated that bakoiya a traditional rice variety was the most popular paddy variety in those days for farming there was a phrase called bol bakoiya 36 maund marte harte 32 maund it means that even if the bakoiya variety of the paddy suffers due to a lack of 1 or 2 rounds of irrigation at the time of maturity of the crop it would still give a good yield maund is a traditional unit of mass equivalent to roughly 37 kilogram per acre lh 1 male farmer interestingly even though the region has witnessed several droughts in the last seven decades bandyopadhyay et al 2021 dyson and maharatna 1992 in the living memory of farmers the drought of 1966 was the most significant most respondents narrated the significance of the drought occurred in 1966 in their personal life histories in addition local farmers emphasized the role of 1966 drought in terms of altering the agrarian practices and cropping pattern in the region for instance farmers narrated agriculture developed in the village only after the drought of 1966 in my memory there wasn t as punishing a drought as that in 1966 i have seen one or two more droughts in between 1966 and 2019 but i don t remember the exact years of those droughts lh 1 male farmer there were no dug wells here before the drought of 1966 rainfall was the primary source of irrigation at that time with good rains we used to have good crops but during deficit rainfall there use to be no production water scarcity for irrigation was the biggest problem in agriculture in those days lh 12 male farmer dug wells came up after the drought of 1966 if nature favored in those times then the paddy crop would grow if not the paddy crop would burn away during sowing or at the later stage in some years there was good paddy production too but it was never a certain thing lh 16 male farmer the region is known for the traditional ahar pyne irrigation system sengupta 1980 sharma 2017 however by the 1950s and 60s the spread and use of the traditional irrigation system started dwindling down the lack of reliable irrigation sources especially during failed or weak monsoon used to be a constant source of worry for farmers lack of reliable irrigation infrastructure and uncertain rains had significantly shaped the agrarian practices in the region the environmental change and climatic variability were mostly understood through the lens of changing rainfall patterns and dwindling water availability for instance the respondents stated the water wasn t available in good amount in those days 1960s to grow beyond two crops paddy and khesari aka grass pea people were unable to cultivate many other crops due to lack of irrigation facillities uncertainty in production was the main problem in agriculture in those days lh 2 male farmer during 1960s the biggest problem in farming was the lack of proper irrigation because of irrigation shortage it used to be a drought for over 3 years in continuity frequently in those years most of the farming land used to remain untouched uncultivated due to lack of irrigation only the bhitha high land was used for growing a small amount of maize and sorghum crops that were rainfed lh 5 male farmer to tackle the surface water unavailability and erratic rainfall farmers relied on different labor intensive traditional irrigation technologies the introduction of modern irrigation technologies happened during the 1970s and picked up after the 1990s for instance one of the farmer stated the government financed around 25 30 dug wells in the village for irrigation after thedrought of 1966 the dug wells worked well for 10 years for irrigation after that the water table went down and rehat traditional irrigation technology stopped working then we purchased a petter engine motor modern irrigation technology to irrigate our farms lh 10 male farmer uncertain untimely and unreliable rainfall less rainfall and recurring droughts have remained a major concern for the farmers for the last seven decades in south bihar interestingly during earlier periods due to the relatively well functional ahar pyne system the region remained largely immune from severe droughts sengupta 1980 in the last three decades the situation has aggravated for instance the farmers stated even in the 1990s the water for irrigation wasn t great in case of no rains the crops wouldn t grow at all the rains in the past in general were much better than the current days even with the small amount of rain we could grow some much needed crops to feed ourselves but today it isn t like that the rain deficit has increased in comparison to the past lh 6 male farmer the uncertain nature of rains is a major concern for agriculture it is heavy rainfall sometimes at other times it is drought drought was there earlier also but now i believe that rains in current times are consistently so poor there is rain on one day and then you have to wait till the next 15 days this can t be termed as a rainy season lh 5 male farmer the rains have a shortfall in recent years the rainfall declined sharply in the last 20 25 years lh 8 male farmer it is important to note that the problems due to uncertain and deficient rainfall were further compounded due to the decay of traditional water harvesting practices and increased intensification of agriculture in addition the encroachment of water harvesting structures water bodies and water channels at the local level has eroded the availability of surface water in general because of these changes irrigation practices started shifting from surface based rain fed models to groundwater based hybrid models sharma 2017 rain still plays a significant role and in the absence of average rainfall agricultural practices get significantly hampered however in recent decades the uncertainties in rainfall are tackled by relying on groundwater groundwater based irrigation ensures the availability of irrigation at the required interval and at an appropriate time and is less sensitive to climatic variability in the shorter run however over extraction of groundwater and drying up of upper layers have been reported by many farmers for instance farmers narrated earlier the droughts used to be much more prominent today everywhere you can see bore wells the farming is expanding and production has increased due to the availability of irrigation sources lh 14 female farmer when petter came for irrigation only then we start growing wheat now the electricity supply is good but now groundwater aquifers in the upper layers are exhausted for wheat last year we did one round of irrigation but the water depleted during the second round of irrigation borewells of 150 200 feet were operational but those borewells are not within reach of everyone there are only 2 4 such borewells in the village lh 16 male farmer interestingly temperature related variability was not reported by any of the respondents farmers reported climatic variations mostly in terms of changes in rainfall intensity and pattern changes in winter weather in terms of fog and other variabilities such as more insect attacks on crops were reported by a couple of respondents several farmers were unable to offer causal factors for the deficit and unreliable rainfall in their words the rains are severely low this year only god knows why this is happening i am just an ordinary human how can i know the reason behind it the government says that the felling of trees is the reason behind less rainfall we aren t educated people how can we know all that however the number of trees that you see today is more than what used to be earlier in the village lh 14 female farmer i don t know much if the rainfall is reducing due to climate change but people say that there aren t trees around i personally don t know if the absence of trees leads to less rainfall i have already told you that i studied till 6th 7th standard only many scientists have become knowledgeable some did ma and others did something else isn t it what is a fact how can i know yes life does teach you but i don t know that much what are the effects and why it s not happening i don t know these things yes earlier the rains were so good compared to now but as i said i don t have that much knowledge to tell you why it has changed so much lh 16 male farmer farmers were explaining climatic variations based primarily on their lived experiences only a couple of well educated farmers were able to link the relationship between climatic variations deficient rainfall erratic rainfall and global climate change whereas many other respondents based on their experience were able to explain the changing environmental conditions but were not able to explicitly explain the reason behind that some of the farmers showed ambiguity and ignorance while explaining the cause of climatic variations whereas few others explained the climatic variations as a result of god s wish for instance a couple of respondents stated the rains have become so less these years it s all the mystery and it depends upon the whims of nature it s all dependent on the mercy of nature the second thing is that sin is increasing on earth which is the main reason for less rain lh 19 male farmer as for the reasons behind water scarcity it can be explained by weather officials only what can i say about that the rainy season didn t come this year on time it came very late the reasons behind less rainfall can only be explained by educated people like you we didn t study that much all i see is that the rainy season didn t arrive if the rainy season comes then we get water if it doesn t then where is the question of getting water lh 20 male farmer in a nutshell from the farmer s perspective the narratives on water deficit were unanimous most farmers observed the sharp climatic variability and explained it in terms of erratic and deficit rainfall 4 discussion for effective management of natural resources under the changing climatic conditions it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of spatiotemporal environmental changes at the local and regional scales ford 2015 xie et al 2015 climate change impacts the local level environmental conditions which can significantly hamper agriculture and other activities arora 2019 tesfaye et al 2017 studied downscaled data for the past 1980 1990 and future 2030 and 2050 to identify the climate risk for crop production in bihar it was perceived that minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and evapotranspiration would increase in the near and mid term periods with respect to the baseline period within the state they reported that the average annual rainfall is 990 1300 mm in the south zone of bihar which is comparable to the observed values of around 1200 mm in the current study zakwan and ara 2019 employed a non parametric mann kendall statistical trend analysis technique on annual rainfall data they found that about 84 of rainfall occurs during monsoon months and noticed a declining rainfall trend from 1986 to 2016 the present study also confirms that the monsoon is the highest precipitating season with a rainfall contribution of around 84 to the total annual rainfall in contrast the other seasons receive comparatively little rain for hydrological analysis the present research has considered runoff actual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and climate water deficit in south bihar high runoff indicates the low infiltration that leads to low water storage and increases the chances of flooding high aet and pet indicate the high removal of water from the surface through evaporation and transpiration it was noticed that high runoff aet and pet results in water shortage problems which ultimately lead to a drought condition anamika 2008 and shekhar and sinha 2020 studied the runoff and physio chemical analysis of wetlands using a hydrological model over south bihar they proposed that wetlands natural and man made are an essential source of water and can be utilized for irrigation drinking hydroelectricity and bathing purposes the present study reflects that the tws and gws are much less in aurangabad rohtas buxar bhojpur patna and munger all these districts are primarily agrarian districts in south bihar and besides relying on surface water groundwater extraction is relatively high in these districts in addition the number of water bodies including wetlands is relatively less sinha et al 2018 used a gis environment to examine the pre and post monsoon groundwater dynamics in north bihar from 2004 to 2013 they found that around 80 of irrigation supplies come from groundwater sources which led to a decline in the groundwater level by 2 3 m in begusarai bhagalpur samastipur katihar and purnea there is a seasonal variability in tws and gws within the study domain the highest seasonal average temperature is observed during pre monsoon 31 5 c while for rest of the season it varies between 28 c 30 c the relatively higher temperature leads to higher values of aet and pet across the study domain this study also reflects a strong positive correlation of rainfall with runoff aet pet tws and gws while it negatively correlates with the temperature the combined impact of the declining rainfall increasing runoff increasing temperature and increasing aet and pet leads to a very high annual water deficit over the study domain ranging from 492 mm to 955 mm the annual rainfall over this region was insufficient to meet the agricultural requirements during the study period since the study area is experiencing a water deficit the dependence on tws and gws is very high to meet the domestic and agricultural demand further within the study area gaya nawada and jamui districts had higher tws and gws hence experiencing less stress on the water resources while aurangabad rohtas buxar bhojpur patna and arwal districts are high groundwater stress zones in these districts the dependence is more on the groundwater sources for meeting irrigation and domestic needs similarly a moderate gws has appeared in bhabhua sheikhpura lakhisrai bhagalpur and banka districts of the studied domain in terms of the bottom up perspective the climatic variations were mostly narrated in terms of deficit and erratic rainfall by the farmers the farmers explained the climatic variations and associated environmental changes changes in groundwater and surface water availability drought a more extended period of fog during winter and increased insect attacks on crops based on their lived experience the drought of 1966 was considered a significant environmental episode in the local and regional history dyson and maharatna 1992 by the majority of the farmers interestingly according to meteorological data 1966 was not the worst year in terms of deficit of rainfall perhaps the absence of modern irrigation technologies and complete reliance on rainfed agriculture had intensified the impact of drought during that period in the later period the growth of groundwater based irrigation has relatively saved the well off farmers from the vagaries of monsoon and low rainfall sharma 2021 interestingly most farmers explained the climatic variations not as a result of anthropogenic activities but more as a result of god s wish only a couple of farmers could assert that the global changes and anthropogenic factors were the cause of climatic variations in the region the public understanding of climate change in rural bihar significantly defies the scientific consensus more critical and deeper engagement is required to interpret the cultural values and farmers perceptions of climatic variations the present work is a preliminary work over the south bihar region in the future the authors will employ high resolution atmospheric and hydrological models to examine the long term behavior of these hydroclimatic parameters over the study area by the end of the century the current study focuses on the quantitative aspect of change in seasonal and annual water availability due to climatic and environmental variability the impact of these phenomena on water quality was beyond the scope of this study however examining the impact of climatic variations on water groundwater and surface water quality delpla et al 2009 using different water quality index wqi such as canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi national sanitation foundation water quality index nsf wqi uddin et al 2021 could be a potential area of future research in addition we would present a deeper analysis of the public understanding of climate change an under developed and under studied region like bihar requires more scientific and critical social science research on climate change at regional and sub regional levels to develop a comprehensive policy response for designing mitigation and adaptation programs 5 conclusions the spatiotemporal historical environmental changes have been examined for four local season wise climatic conditions 1958 2019 hydrological condition 1958 2019 terrestrial water storage tws condition 2000 2014 and groundwater storage gws condition 2000 2014 from the terraclimate and the global land data assimilation system gldas data in this study the results show that annual rainfall and average temperature values vary from 593 mm to 1560 mm and 28 c 30 c respectively further there is a variability of rainfall across the seasons and years however unlike the rainfall the average temperature has gone up by 0 5 oc although the study area receives a good amount of rainfall it still faces a water deficit across all seasons and annually from the farmer s perspective the climatic variations were mostly narrated in terms of deficit and erratic rainfall farmers explained the climatic variations and associated environmental changes changes in groundwater and surface water availability drought a longer period of fog during winter and increased insect attacks on crops based on their lived experience most of the farmers explained the climatic variations not as a result of anthropogenic activities but more in terms of god s wish both quantitative scientific and qualitative ethnographic data from local respondents explain the heightened climatic variability and water deficit during the last three decades the historical climatic data and public perceptions of environmental change were able to explain the climatic and environmental changes faced in the region however deeper engagement is required to understand the farmers response to these environmental changes to draft effective policy interventions as part of the mitigation and adaptation regime especially when many of them do not rely on scientific reasoning to explain the climatic variations and environmental change the results from this analysis can be directly utilized for better and effective evidence based policy making at the local sub regional and provincial levels author

11769,in the last decade researchers have underscored the need for carrying out climate change analysis at regional and sub regional levels against this backdrop we analyzed the climatic variability and environmental changes that occurred during the last seven decades 1958 2019 and their impact on groundwater variability in south bihar india we employed a mixed method approach and analyzed both the quantitative scientific data and qualitative ethnographic data collected from the local farmers the scientific data was compiled for the climatic parameters rainfall and temperature hydrological parameters runoff actual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and climate water deficit terrestrial water storage and groundwater storage capacity using terraclimate model and global land data assimilation system the public perception of climatic variability and environmental change was analyzed using farmers understanding of environmental variability in selected villages of south bihar in terms of climatic variations the historical climatic data showed rainfall variability over the last seven decades higher unpredictability in monsoon rainfall is evident from the 1990s onwards the average temperature had gone up by 0 5 oc over the study period the surface and groundwater deficit across south bihar was relatively high above 600 mm with a significant sub regional variation from the public understanding perspective the climatic variations were mostly narrated in terms of deficit and erratic rainfall which increased in recent decades farmers explained the groundwater scarcity and associated environmental changes based on their lived experience both scientific and farmers understanding of environmental variability explains the high climatic variability during the last three decades graphical abstract image 1 keywords climatic variations environmental change hydrological conditions groundwater fluctuation public perception south bihar india 1 introduction regional and sub regional scale analysis of environmental and climatic change is emerging as a crucial area of research jacob et al 2020 kasimov et al 2017 nepal 2016 shepherd 2019 weber et al 2018 xie et al 2015 exploring the manifestations of regional climate change in terms of its physical origins vulnerabilities and exposures produced at the regional level and public understanding of such changes are essential for formulating evidence based planning and effective interventions xie et al 2015 scholars have advocated for the importance of studying climate variability and environmental changes at the regional level ford 2015 incca 2010 jacob et al 2020 xie et al 2015 in india several regional climate change studies have been carried out over the last decade das et al 2020 dubey et

on ecologically fragile regions such as coastal zones biodiversity hotspots forested areas selected river basins and the himalayan regions incca 2010 mishra et al 2013 raha et al 2012 ravindranath et al 2006 climate change studies primarily focusing on the eastern regions of the country at the sub regional level are still limited ravindranath et al 2011 singh et al 2020 studies on different agro climatic zones in the eastern parts of the country have tremendous importance given the reliance of millions of people on agriculture in the region acharya and das 2012 lopez ridaura et al 2018 sharma 2021 in addition the eastern region is highly vulnerable to climate change threats due to higher heat stress drought and flood risks lopez ridaura et al 2018 tesfaye et al 2017 bihar one of the under developed eastern states of india having more than 100 million population census of india 2011 is under studied from the environmental and climatic perspective in recent years few attempts have been made to examine the climatic variability and its impact on agriculture and other natural resources in bihar lopez ridaura et al 2018 mittal and hariharan 2018 mondal et al 2014 sinha et al 2019 syed et al 2014 tesfaye et al 2017 toorop et al 2020 yi ping et al 2020 yet these studies do not offer a long term comprehensive sub regional picture for instance tesfaye et al 2017 identified future climate risk by studying a period of 30 years 1980 2009 of weather data in bihar sinha et al 2019 developed a drought index combined climatologic deviation index by combining different aspects of

2014 sinha et al 2008 tripathi et al 2019 a comprehensive sub regional analysis of climatic variability and environmental change in bihar is still missing the existing studies either focused on a small time frame tesfaye et al 2017 or a smaller spatial unit yi ping et al 2020 for analyzing the climatic variability in addition most of these studies focus on analyzing historical climate data and do not engage with the public understanding of environmental and climatic variability recent studies have elaborated that farmers have experiential knowledge of climatic variations and local environmental change banerjee 2015 burnham et al 2016 stock et al 2019 farmers are crucial stakeholders in the study of environmental change in this predominantly agrarian region of india sharma 2021 the farmer s understanding of environmental and climatic change is crucial for framing appropriate policy responses in terms of population bihar 104 million is greater than germany 83 million census

goals related to climate change would be challenging to meet if states like bihar fall behind it is crucial to develop a thorough understanding of environmental and climatic change at the sub regional level using top down scientific and bottom up views of local actors perspectives nisbet and weiss 2010 sabatier 1986 sharma 2020b for developing appropriate policy responses in the present study we tried to analyze climate change at the sub regional level two agro climatic zones zone iii a south east alluvial plain and zone iii b south west alluvial plain within a time frame of around seven decades to develop the top down understanding in the present research work we focused on the spatiotemporal analysis of historical climatic data at the sub regional level by studying different hydro climatic parameters we augmented the top down understanding of climatic variations and environmental change with a bottom up perspective by analyzing the opinion of farmers in selected villages of gaya and nalanda district in south bihar india the article is divided into five sections the first section deals with the introduction section two describes the study area data and methodology section three presents the results and section four offers the discussion the concluding remarks are presented in section five 2 study area data and methodology 2 1 study area bihar is india s third largest state in terms of population lopez ridaura et al 2018 notably only 11 3 of the population lives in urban areas while the rest 88 7 population resides in rural areas census of india 2011 around 81 of the workforce of the state is involved in agriculture lopez ridaura et al 2018 the state has three crucial agro climatic zones north east north west and south tesfaye et al 2017 rice wheat and maize are the major crops in bihar rice is the dominant monsoon crop bihar has thirty eight districts and 534 blocks the river ganga divides the state into north and south bihar the present study focuses on south bihar fig 1 consisting of seventeen districts bhabhua rohtas buxar bhojpur aurangabad gaya jahanabad patna nawada nalanda sheikhpura jamui lakhisarai munger banka bhagalpur and arwal the tributaries of the ganga like karamnasa durgawati sone punpun falgu harohar badua and chandan are situated in south bihar fig 1 sone is one of the longest rivers traversing through south bihar 2 2 climatic data collection and modeling approach for this study the historic climatic data is collected from terraclimate a monthly climate and water balance gridded data for global terrestrial surfaces abatzoglou et al 2018 it is climatically aided interpolation based high spatial resolution data from worldclim datasets these data have been divided into two categories i primary climate variables e g rainfall temperature and ii derived variables e g runoff evapotranspiration et potential evapotranspiration pet this dataset is widely employed for scenario generation of hydrological and ecological studies in the present study different climatic rainfall and temperature and hydrological runoff et pet and climate water deficit parameters are examined for a period of 61 years 1958 2019 to obtain the annual and seasonal climatological hydro climatic information of the study area fig 2 however the spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial water storage tws and groundwater storage gws have been conducted only for a relatively short period 2000 2014 from the global land data assimilation system gldas2 and catchment land surface model clsm due to unavailability of the high resolution long term data rzepecka and birylo 2020 syed et al 2008 these data indicated the ground based observational data for land surface modeling the present study considers four meteorological seasons for the analysis such as monsoon june september season 1 post monsoon october november season 2 winter december february season 3 and pre monsoon march may season 4 fig 2 the framework employed in this study uses historical hydro climatic data to identify and explain the climatology seasonal and interannual variability the quantitative spatio temporal and correlation and qualitative ethnographic data were analyzed and validated based on the lived experiences of the farmers and existing literature fig 2 in the present study tws is being estimated using eq 1 and gws is calculated from the estimated tws data using eq 2 as shown below rui and beaudoing 2018 1 t w s s o i l w a t e r s n o w w a t e r e q u i v a l e n t c a n o p y w a t e r g r o u n d w a t e r 2 g w s t w s r o o t z o n e s o i l

water resource applications the seasonal spatiotemporal distribution of tws and gws are mapped over the study area in the gis environment the inverse distance weighting idw method was employed to generate the spatial distribution of water resources mapping from the global gldas2 and clsm datasets idw is a deterministic estimation method which is intuitive efficient and works best with evenly nearest distributed points wu and hung 2016 the rainfall temperature runoff aet pet climate water deficit tws and gws data indicate the overall environmental change in the study area the rainfall and temperature are critically important parameters in defining climatic variations and are crucial for agriculture and future crop productivity watson and challinor 2013 the runoff is extremely important for river morphological studies because of changes in the landscape by the action of erosion the runoff data is vital for understanding watershed management and groundwater recharge sharma et al 2022 the runoff is affected by various meteorological factors like the type of rainfall rainfall amount duration intensity distribution of rainfall the direction of storm movement and antecedent rainfall ries 1990 it depends on various physical characteristics like elevation slope of the land land use drainage area basin shape and drainage network pattern the et and pet are significant for understanding the characteristics of the crop over the growing season mhetre et al 2013 the climate water deficit data indicates the water stress areas considering the changing climatic conditions the current analysis mainly focuses on annual and season wise historical environmental changes from the secondary dataset terraclimate 1958 2019 and gldas2 2000 2014 historical data represent the spatiotemporal environmental changes climatic condition hydrological condition and total water availability condition of south bihar the above mentioned seasonal and annual data for temperature tws and gws over the study domain were extracted using a mask file in climate data operator software schulzweida 2021 the spatial plots of the tws and gws are prepared using the matplotlib package in python3 hunter 2007 further the area averaged value of temperature over the study domain for these periods is then extracted by taking the mean of the temperature values at each grid point and different time series the probability density pdf curve is prepared from seasonal and annual temperature time series data to represent the temporal variability using the matplotlib package in python3 the area averaged value of the hydrometeorological parameters is further explored to examine their relationship using kendall and pearson heatmap correlation matrix analysis it is prepared using the seaborn package in python3 waskom 2021 2 3 village level data collection to augment the historical climatic and environmental data collected from scientific databases we conducted 24 life history interviews with farmers in three villages simraur nekpur and meyar of gaya and nalanda district south bihar during 2019 2021 the life history interviews with farmers lasted between 30to 70 minutes the details of the selected respondent such as gender age and educational qualification in the life history surveys are listed in table s1 we purposively selected farmers in the age bracket of 45 years 85 years and ensured that either they were active farmers or had actively done farming in the past a bottom up assessment sharma 2020b of climatic variations is crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of environmental change conway et al 2019 madhuri and sharma 2020 paudel et al 2020 singh et al 2016 life history interviews have become an effective tool for capturing bottom up perspectives singh et al 2019 wolf et al 2010 life history involves open ended interviewing and offers a rich description of life as a whole singh et al 2019 given the life of farming communities revolving around agrarian practices at the local level over a long duration the perceptions memories and experiences of climatic variation and environmental change among farmers can offer a rich contextual understanding of the local situation key personal moments in the agrarian life of farmers when agricultural practices were influenced by environmental changes help to develop a bottom up understanding of climatic variability and environmental change the interviews were conducted in hindi and magdhi a local dialect all the life history interviews were recorded and transcribed thereafter the data collected through the interviews were manually coded adu 2019 and analyzed employing the conceptual framework 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal changes in climatic conditions fig 3 represents the seasonal and annual rainfall variability during the historical period indicating the temporal change of the climatic variability over the study region the rainfall variability is significantly high among seasons with the highest rainfall received during monsoon followed by post monsoon pre monsoon and winter seasons subsequently fig 3 this indicates that the monsoonal rain is the major contributor of water in south bihar while the other seasons contribute much less it is observed that the rainfall was above normal for most of the time during 1958 1990 while it declined in most of the seasons during 1991 2018 fig 3a however the rainfall variability is relatively higher during the post monsoon winter and pre monsoon seasons fig 3b d the recorded cumulative annual rainfall is maximum 1560 mm and minimum 594 mm during 1971 and 1992 respectively table 1 as the monsoon is the main rainfall contributing season over the study area the interannual variability closely resembles the pattern of the annual rainfall our findings corroborate with laskar et al 2014 who studied the rainfall over bihar from 1871 to 2011 and reported that 84 of rainfall occurs during monsoon 7 in pre monsoon 6 in post monsoon and 3 in the winter season it can be noted that rainfall distributions during monsoon and pre monsoon may strongly impact agriculture activities a careful examination of these results doesn t show any clear trend in rainfall but reflects variability in the selected seven decades in south bihar 3 2 temporal changes in hydrological parameters fig 4 reflects the probability density function pdf of the seasonal annual temperature for 1958 to 2019 over the study region among the seasons pre monsoon is found to be warmer among seasons with an average temperature of 31 7 oc the winter i e december february months is the coldest season with a mean value of around 29 oc while the average temperature for monsoon and post monsoon is close to 29 5 oc the average seasonal and annual temperature has increased during the study period while the average temperature has gone up by 0 5 oc in the past seven decades data not presented it is essential to understand the hydrological conditions for sustainable and efficient use of water resources in the era of climate uncertainty in the present study four important hydrological parameters like runoff evapotranspiration et potential evapotranspiration pet and climate water deficit by the terraclimate dataset from 1958 to 2019 have been considered for further examination figure s1 s4 runoff is a very significant parameter for the natural water cycle being the wettest season the monsoon receives the highest rainfall and has the highest seasonal runoff compared to other seasons the annual runoff value is found to be highest 655 mm and lowest 33 mm during 1971 and 1992 respectively table 1 the minimum and maximum values of runoff can be attributed to the annual rainfall of around 1560 mm and a minimum 594 mm during 1971 and 1992 respectively which were the years with maximum and minimum rainfall table 1 the runoff not only depends upon the precipitation but also on soil type slope and land use land cover changes it is only part of the rainfall which enters the stream directly after rainfall rao 2020 the lowest seasonal runoff 0 26 mm and 0 mm is observed during the pre monsoon of 1972 and the winter of 2006 table 1 further the relatively higher rainfall led to runoff of more than 400 mm in 1987 2011 and 2019 the analysis shows that the variability of runoff over the study domain is high for seasonal as well as annual rainfall figure s1 the present study also examines the et another critical component of the water cycle the analysis reflects that the seasonal maximum et occurred during monsoon and pre monsoon are estimated to be 539 mm and 46 mm respectively in 1994 table 1 the seasonal rainfall shows that et during monsoon has declined in recent times however the variability is high over other seasons figure s2 the analysis for annual et ranges from 638 mm 1993 to 947 mm 1978 during the study period table 1 the pet over the study domain is examined for all seasons and also on an annual basis figure s3 the pet during monsoon from 1958 to 1990 is higher than the period from 1991 to 2018 while winter shows the opposite behavior the variability of pet during pre monsoon and post monsoon is much high among the seasons the annual pet variability is quite similar to the behavior of monsoon which reflects the higher values in the initial half of the study period and lower values in the later half of the study period the pet describes the capacity to induce the climate for evaporation from soil plus transpiration by plants the pet varies between 1372 mm and 1601 mm during the study period table 1 the climate water deficit is another crucial parameter for agriculture water management it was calculated from the integrated climatic and hydrological parameters using a thornthwaite mather climate water balance model willmott et al 1985 the present study uses the climate water deficit parameter for spatiotemporal environmental changes which represents the annual evaporative demand that exceeds the available water the analysis shows that the annual climate water deficit varied between 492 mm minimum and 955 mm maximum during 1971 and 1992 respectively table 1 it is interesting to observe that the study region is mostly water deficit during the entire period with values mostly exceeding 600 mm with an exception during 1971 492 mm 1973 593 mm 1978 506 mm and 1990 565 mm among seasons the pre monsoon has the highest water deficit five to six fold higher than the other seasons figure s4 this is followed by low 28 143 mm to moderate 90 188 mm water deficit during post monsoon and winter respectively interestingly monsoon the highest precipitating season is also water deficit during most of the study period except for 1971 1978 1990 and 2011 3 3 spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial water storage terrestrial water storage tws is a crucial parameter for understanding the global hydrological cycle it indicates the summation of all forms of water on the land surface it can be divided into five main categories such as surface water storage sws groundwater storage gws soil moisture storage sms canopy water storage cws and snow water equivalent swe for better planning of water resources management purposes zhang et al 2019 the tws represents the spatiotemporal variability of the dryness and wetness condition over an area the present study examines the seasonal and annual tws over the study domain for the period of 2000 2014 using global land data assimilation system gldas2 and catchment land surface model clsm fig 5 the spatial structure confirms that the tws is low in pre monsoon compared to other seasons the seasonally averaged monsoon tws over the study domain reflects that southern districts such as nawada gaya and jamui have higher tws than the other districts fig 5a the tws is highest in nawada 1100 2000 mm followed by gaya 800 1200 mm and jamui 800 1100 mm while other districts show the value in a range of 700 900 mm only it was perceived that a relatively high tws had appeared in the district of nawada gaya and jamui because of the existing dense river network it is found that these districts were also covered by a higher percentage of forest land as compared to other districts in contrast a low tws was observed in the district of aurangabad rohtas buxar bhojpur patna bhagalpur and munger the tws during post monsoon is higher than in the pre monsoon and winter seasons the tws in nawada shows even more than 2000 mm and tws values increase by 100 200 mm in all districts across the study domain for the pre monsoon time fig 5b this increase can be attributed to the increase in soil water and groundwater during the monsoon period it is interesting to observe that the wintertime spatial distribution and magnitude of tws are very similar to the monsoon months across the study area except the tws is high over nawada district fig 5c the decline in rainfall may lead to a decrease in the soil water content and hence the tws decreases in winter as compared to the post monsoon season the tws is most negligible across the study domain during pre monsoon where the tws ranges between 700 and 1100 mm with the highest magnitude for nawada district fig 5d the annual averaged tws also closely resembles the monsoon pattern in terms of spatial distribution and magnitude across the study domain fig 5e apart from this the tws also shows temporal variability which can be attributed to the impact of environmental climate change over the study area table 2 total water availability is very significant for future sustainable water resources planning considering the climate uncertainty 3 4 spatiotemporal changes in groundwater storage groundwater is one of the major source for irrigation and domestic use in the region groundwater aquifers act as a reservoir and can be utilized during droughts and when surface water remains unavailable vaux 2011 an understanding of groundwater storage gws conditions is required for the proper management of regional groundwater in the present research the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual gws estimation have been computed using tws from the year 2000 2014 over the study domain the seasonal and annual gws follows a similar spatial distribution across the study domain fig 6 the gws reflects that the southern districts such as gaya nawada and jamui have higher gws 600 1300 mm as compared to the other districts 500 700 mm in the monsoon season over the study domain fig 6a the higher tws during post monsoon leads to higher values of gws than during monsoon with the highest value 1000 1300 mm around the southern districts of the study domain fig 6b this slowly declines during winter in both the southern districts 800 1300 mm and also in other districts 500 700 mm fig 6c the gws has the most negligible value during the pre monsoon due to the less tws and long dry period and higher temperature across the study domain however the southern districts such as gaya nawada and jamui still show a gws of 600 1200 mm while the rest have a magnitude of less than 450 mm fig 6d similarly analysis of the annual gws reflects a similar spatial pattern as that of monsoon fig 6e this analysis shows that the high groundwater stress zones occurred in aurangabad rohtas buxar bhojpur patna and arwal however high groundwater storage 1021 1700 mm manifests in gaya nawada and jamui districts for the studied duration because of the availability of high terrestrial water further a moderate gws appeared in the district of bhabhua sheikhpura lakhisrai bhagalpur and banka irrespective of these spatial features the gws also shows a high variability over the study domain during the selected period which can be attributed to the changing climatic conditions table 3 3 5 correlation analysis the study further examines the relationship among different hydrometeorological parameters such as rainfall rf temperature tmp runoff q actual evapotranspiration aet terrestrial water storage tws and groundwater storage gws using kendall and pearson heatmap correlation matrix analysis fig 7 it indicates the bivariate analysis of two variables and the direction of the relationship sahoo et al 2021 it also measures the strength of association of two variables and identifies a monotonous relationship these correlation values vary between 1 and 1 where 1 1 and 0 indicate the positive negative and no relationship respectively dhar et al 2014 the correlation of rainfall is high with gws above 0 65 tws above 0 65 and runoff above 0 75 as compared to other parameters fig 7 the study domain receives most rainfall during the monsoon period and the rest of the seasons are dry the higher the rainfall the higher the runoff during the rainy period and hence the correlation between them are high the rain fills the surface water bodies over the study domain and increases the tws hence more rainfall leads to higher tws which is reflected in the higher correlation value over the study domain the higher tws supports the infiltration of the water below ground which leads to an increase in the gws therefore the correlation between tws and gws is robust above 0 95 which is also evident from the analysis of spatial features overall the change in the runoff tws and gws are directly dependent upon the rainfall which is apparent from the strong positive correlation between them further a moderate correlation value of aet with rf gws and tws can be attributed to a rise in the rainfall leading to an increase in the tws gws and ultimately the aet the temperature is negatively correlated with all the other parameters over the study domain 3 6 climatic variations and environmental changes the bottom up perspective historically south bihar is a water deficit region unlike the northern part of the state which is water rich agriculture in the region remained primarily rain fed and dependent on the age old traditional irrigation system sengupta 1980 sharma 2021 water availability and irrigation technologies have continuously played a significant role in shaping the agrarian practices in the region sharma 2017 climatic variations were reported by the farmers primarily in terms of erratic and deficit rainfall the majority of the respondents narrated that the rainfall has declined over the years and has become more uncertain the erratic rainfall shaped their choice of paddy varieties during the 1960s and 70s for instance one of the farmers narrated that bakoiya a traditional rice variety was the most popular paddy variety in those days for farming there was a phrase called bol bakoiya 36 maund marte harte 32 maund it means that even if the bakoiya variety of the paddy suffers due to a lack of 1 or 2 rounds of irrigation at the time of maturity of the crop it would still give a good yield maund is a traditional unit of mass equivalent to roughly 37 kilogram per acre lh 1 male farmer interestingly even though the region has witnessed several droughts in the last seven decades bandyopadhyay et al 2021 dyson and maharatna 1992 in the living memory of farmers the drought of 1966 was the most significant most respondents narrated the significance of the drought occurred in 1966 in their personal life histories in addition local farmers emphasized the role of 1966 drought in terms of altering the agrarian practices and cropping pattern in the region for instance farmers narrated agriculture developed in the village only after the drought of 1966 in my memory there wasn t as punishing a drought as that in 1966 i have seen one or two more droughts in between 1966 and 2019 but i don t remember the exact years of those droughts lh 1 male farmer there were no dug wells here before the drought of 1966 rainfall was the primary source of irrigation at that time with good rains we used to have good crops but during deficit rainfall there use to be no production water scarcity for irrigation was the biggest problem in agriculture in those days lh 12 male farmer dug wells came up after the drought of 1966 if nature favored in those times then the paddy crop would grow if not the paddy crop would burn away during sowing or at the later stage in some years there was good paddy production too but it was never a certain thing lh 16 male farmer the region is known for the traditional ahar pyne irrigation system sengupta 1980 sharma 2017 however by the 1950s and 60s the spread and use of the traditional irrigation system started dwindling down the lack of reliable irrigation sources especially during failed or weak monsoon used to be a constant source of worry for farmers lack of reliable irrigation infrastructure and uncertain rains had significantly shaped the agrarian practices in the region the environmental change and climatic variability were mostly understood through the lens of changing rainfall patterns and dwindling water availability for instance the respondents stated the water wasn t available in good amount in those days 1960s to grow beyond two crops paddy and khesari aka grass pea people were unable to cultivate many other crops due to lack of irrigation facillities uncertainty in production was the main problem in agriculture in those days lh 2 male farmer during 1960s the biggest problem in farming was the lack of proper irrigation because of irrigation shortage it used to be a drought for over 3 years in continuity frequently in those years most of the farming land used to remain untouched uncultivated due to lack of irrigation only the bhitha high land was used for growing a small amount of maize and sorghum crops that were rainfed lh 5 male farmer to tackle the surface water unavailability and erratic rainfall farmers relied on different labor intensive traditional irrigation technologies the introduction of modern irrigation technologies happened during the 1970s and picked up after the 1990s for instance one of the farmer stated the government financed around 25 30 dug wells in the village for irrigation after thedrought of 1966 the dug wells worked well for 10 years for irrigation after that the water table went down and rehat traditional irrigation technology stopped working then we purchased a petter engine motor modern irrigation technology to irrigate our farms lh 10 male farmer uncertain untimely and unreliable rainfall less rainfall and recurring droughts have remained a major concern for the farmers for the last seven decades in south bihar interestingly during earlier periods due to the relatively well functional ahar pyne system the region remained largely immune from severe droughts sengupta 1980 in the last three decades the situation has aggravated for instance the farmers stated even in the 1990s the water for irrigation wasn t great in case of no rains the crops wouldn t grow at all the rains in the past in general were much better than the current days even with the small amount of rain we could grow some much needed crops to feed ourselves but today it isn t like that the rain deficit has increased in comparison to the past lh 6 male farmer the uncertain nature of rains is a major concern for agriculture it is heavy rainfall sometimes at other times it is drought drought was there earlier also but now i believe that rains in current times are consistently so poor there is rain on one day and then you have to wait till the next 15 days this can t be termed as a rainy season lh 5 male farmer the rains have a shortfall in recent years the rainfall declined sharply in the last 20 25 years lh 8 male farmer it is important to note that the problems due to uncertain and deficient rainfall were further compounded due to the decay of traditional water harvesting practices and increased intensification of agriculture in addition the encroachment of water harvesting structures water bodies and water channels at the local level has eroded the availability of surface water in general because of these changes irrigation practices started shifting from surface based rain fed models to groundwater based hybrid models sharma 2017 rain still plays a significant role and in the absence of average rainfall agricultural practices get significantly hampered however in recent decades the uncertainties in rainfall are tackled by relying on groundwater groundwater based irrigation ensures the availability of irrigation at the required interval and at an appropriate time and is less sensitive to climatic variability in the shorter run however over extraction of groundwater and drying up of upper layers have been reported by many farmers for instance farmers narrated earlier the droughts used to be much more prominent today everywhere you can see bore wells the farming is expanding and production has increased due to the availability of irrigation sources lh 14 female farmer when petter came for irrigation only then we start growing wheat now the electricity supply is good but now groundwater aquifers in the upper layers are exhausted for wheat last year we did one round of irrigation but the water depleted during the second round of irrigation borewells of 150 200 feet were operational but those borewells are not within reach of everyone there are only 2 4 such borewells in the village lh 16 male farmer interestingly temperature related variability was not reported by any of the respondents farmers reported climatic variations mostly in terms of changes in rainfall intensity and pattern changes in winter weather in terms of fog and other variabilities such as more insect attacks on crops were reported by a couple of respondents several farmers were unable to offer causal factors for the deficit and unreliable rainfall in their words the rains are severely low this year only god knows why this is happening i am just an ordinary human how can i know the reason behind it the government says that the felling of trees is the reason behind less rainfall we aren t educated people how can we know all that however the number of trees that you see today is more than what used to be earlier in the village lh 14 female farmer i don t know much if the rainfall is reducing due to climate change but people say that there aren t trees around i personally don t know if the absence of trees leads to less rainfall i have already told you that i studied till 6th 7th standard only many scientists have become knowledgeable some did ma and others did something else isn t it what is a fact how can i know yes life does teach you but i don t know that much what are the effects and why it s not happening i don t know these things yes earlier the rains were so good compared to now but as i said i don t have that much knowledge to tell you why it has changed so much lh 16 male farmer farmers were explaining climatic variations based primarily on their lived experiences only a couple of well educated farmers were able to link the relationship between climatic variations deficient rainfall erratic rainfall and global climate change whereas many other respondents based on their experience were able to explain the changing environmental conditions but were not able to explicitly explain the reason behind that some of the farmers showed ambiguity and ignorance while explaining the cause of climatic variations whereas few others explained the climatic variations as a result of god s wish for instance a couple of respondents stated the rains have become so less these years it s all the mystery and it depends upon the whims of nature it s all dependent on the mercy of nature the second thing is that sin is increasing on earth which is the main reason for less rain lh 19 male farmer as for the reasons behind water scarcity it can be explained by weather officials only what can i say about that the rainy season didn t come this year on time it came very late the reasons behind less rainfall can only be explained by educated people like you we didn t study that much all i see is that the rainy season didn t arrive if the rainy season comes then we get water if it doesn t then where is the question of getting water lh 20 male farmer in a nutshell from the farmer s perspective the narratives on water deficit were unanimous most farmers observed the sharp climatic variability and explained it in terms of erratic and deficit rainfall 4 discussion for effective management of natural resources under the changing climatic conditions it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of spatiotemporal environmental changes at the local and regional scales ford 2015 xie et al 2015 climate change impacts the local level environmental conditions which can significantly hamper agriculture and other activities arora 2019 tesfaye et al 2017 studied downscaled data for the past 1980 1990 and future 2030 and 2050 to identify the climate risk for crop production in bihar it was perceived that minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and evapotranspiration would increase in the near and mid term periods with respect to the baseline period within the state they reported that the average annual rainfall is 990 1300 mm in the south zone of bihar which is comparable to the observed values of around 1200 mm in the current study zakwan and ara 2019 employed a non parametric mann kendall statistical trend analysis technique on annual rainfall data they found that about 84 of rainfall occurs during monsoon months and noticed a declining rainfall trend from 1986 to 2016 the present study also confirms that the monsoon is the highest precipitating season with a rainfall contribution of around 84 to the total annual rainfall in contrast the other seasons receive comparatively little rain for hydrological analysis the present research has considered runoff actual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and climate water deficit in south bihar high runoff indicates the low infiltration that leads to low water storage and increases the chances of flooding high aet and pet indicate the high removal of water from the surface through evaporation and transpiration it was noticed that high runoff aet and pet results in water shortage problems which ultimately lead to a drought condition anamika 2008 and shekhar and sinha 2020 studied the runoff and physio chemical analysis of wetlands using a hydrological model over south bihar they proposed that wetlands natural and man made are an essential source of water and can be utilized for irrigation drinking hydroelectricity and bathing purposes the present study reflects that the tws and gws are much less in aurangabad rohtas buxar bhojpur patna and munger all these districts are primarily agrarian districts in south bihar and besides relying on surface water groundwater extraction is relatively high in these districts in addition the number of water bodies including wetlands is relatively less sinha et al 2018 used a gis environment to examine the pre and post monsoon groundwater dynamics in north bihar from 2004 to 2013 they found that around 80 of irrigation supplies come from groundwater sources which led to a decline in the groundwater level by 2 3 m in begusarai bhagalpur samastipur katihar and purnea there is a seasonal variability in tws and gws within the study domain the highest seasonal average temperature is observed during pre monsoon 31 5 c while for rest of the season it varies between 28 c 30 c the relatively higher temperature leads to higher values of aet and pet across the study domain this study also reflects a strong positive correlation of rainfall with runoff aet pet tws and gws while it negatively correlates with the temperature the combined impact of the declining rainfall increasing runoff increasing temperature and increasing aet and pet leads to a very high annual water deficit over the study domain ranging from 492 mm to 955 mm the annual rainfall over this region was insufficient to meet the agricultural requirements during the study period since the study area is experiencing a water deficit the dependence on tws and gws is very high to meet the domestic and agricultural demand further within the study area gaya nawada and jamui districts had higher tws and gws hence experiencing less stress on the water resources while aurangabad rohtas buxar bhojpur patna and arwal districts are high groundwater stress zones in these districts the dependence is more on the groundwater sources for meeting irrigation and domestic needs similarly a moderate gws has appeared in bhabhua sheikhpura lakhisrai bhagalpur and banka districts of the studied domain in terms of the bottom up perspective the climatic variations were mostly narrated in terms of deficit and erratic rainfall by the farmers the farmers explained the climatic variations and associated environmental changes changes in groundwater and surface water availability drought a more extended period of fog during winter and increased insect attacks on crops based on their lived experience the drought of 1966 was considered a significant environmental episode in the local and regional history dyson and maharatna 1992 by the majority of the farmers interestingly according to meteorological data 1966 was not the worst year in terms of deficit of rainfall perhaps the absence of modern irrigation technologies and complete reliance on rainfed agriculture had intensified the impact of drought during that period in the later period the growth of groundwater based irrigation has relatively saved the well off farmers from the vagaries of monsoon and low rainfall sharma 2021 interestingly most farmers explained the climatic variations not as a result of anthropogenic activities but more as a result of god s wish only a couple of farmers could assert that the global changes and anthropogenic factors were the cause of climatic variations in the region the public understanding of climate change in rural bihar significantly defies the scientific consensus more critical and deeper engagement is required to interpret the cultural values and farmers perceptions of climatic variations the present work is a preliminary work over the south bihar region in the future the authors will employ high resolution atmospheric and hydrological models to examine the long term behavior of these hydroclimatic parameters over the study area by the end of the century the current study focuses on the quantitative aspect of change in seasonal and annual water availability due to climatic and environmental variability the impact of these phenomena on water quality was beyond the scope of this study however examining the impact of climatic variations on water groundwater and surface water quality delpla et al 2009 using different water quality index wqi such as canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index ccme wqi national sanitation foundation water quality index nsf wqi uddin et al 2021 could be a potential area of future research in addition we would present a deeper analysis of the public understanding of climate change an under developed and under studied region like bihar requires more scientific and critical social science research on climate change at regional and sub regional levels to develop a comprehensive policy response for designing mitigation and adaptation programs 5 conclusions the spatiotemporal historical environmental changes have been examined for four local season wise climatic conditions 1958 2019 hydrological condition 1958 2019 terrestrial water storage tws condition 2000 2014 and groundwater storage gws condition 2000 2014 from the terraclimate and the global land data assimilation system gldas data in this study the results show that annual rainfall and average temperature values vary from 593 mm to 1560 mm and 28 c 30 c respectively further there is a variability of rainfall across the seasons and years however unlike the rainfall the average temperature has gone up by 0 5 oc although the study area receives a good amount of rainfall it still faces a water deficit across all seasons and annually from the farmer s perspective the climatic variations were mostly narrated in terms of deficit and erratic rainfall farmers explained the climatic variations and associated environmental changes changes in groundwater and surface water availability drought a longer period of fog during winter and increased insect attacks on crops based on their lived experience most of the farmers explained the climatic variations not as a result of anthropogenic activities but more in terms of god s wish both quantitative scientific and qualitative ethnographic data from local respondents explain the heightened climatic variability and water deficit during the last three decades the historical climatic data and public perceptions of environmental change were able to explain the climatic and environmental changes faced in the region however deeper engagement is required to understand the farmers response to these environmental changes to draft effective policy interventions as part of the mitigation and adaptation regime especially when many of them do not rely on scientific reasoning to explain the climatic variations and environmental change the results from this analysis can be directly utilized for better and effective evidence based policy making at the local sub regional and provincial levels author
