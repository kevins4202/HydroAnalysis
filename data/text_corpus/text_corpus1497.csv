wds this model determines minimization of risk which is caused by simultaneous multi point contamination injection in wds using cvar approach the cvar considers uncertainties of contamination injection in the form of probability distribution function and calculates low probability extreme events in this approach extreme losses occur at tail of the losses distribution function four objective optimization model based on nsga ii algorithm is developed to minimize losses of contamination injection through cvar of affected population and detection time and also minimize the two other main criteria of optimal placement of sensors including probability of undetected events and cost finally to determine the best solution preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee as a subgroup of multi criteria decision making mcdm approach is utilized to rank the alternatives on the trade off curve among objective functions also sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the importance of each criterion on promethee results considering three relative weighting scenarios the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is examined through applying it to lamerd wds in the southwestern part of iran the promethee suggests 6 sensors with suitable distribution that approximately cover all regions of wds optimal values related to cvar of affected population and detection time as well as probability of undetected events for the best optimal solution are equal to 17 055 persons 31 mins and 0 045 respectively the obtained results of the proposed methodology in lamerd wds show applicability of cvar based multi objective simulation optimization model for incorporating the main uncertainties of contamination injection in order to evaluate extreme value of losses in wds keywords water distribution system risk management conditional value at risk optimal placement of sensors promethee 1 introduction water distribution system wds is an important structure which is expected to deliver the safe drinking water to consumers through network of pipes hart and murray 2010 based on the features of wds such as their distributed geography and a lot of accessible points these structures are vulnerable to threats such as intentional contamination events in this regard water utility managers increasingly feel the need to detect the contamination and reduce the losses caused by intentional contamination event in wds optimal placement of sensors is a cost effective framework for mitigating acquired losses of contamination events a sufficient set of sensors with optimal layout in wds can provide early warning system that would maximize the health level of consumers or minimize the risk optimal placement of sensors in wds should be considered as a multi objective optimization problem with respect to all above mentioned reasons various multi objective simulation optimization models have been developed for sensor placement considering possible contamination injection scenarios weickgenannt et al 2010 hart and murray 2010 it should be noted that various uncertainties exist in the simulation of contamination injection scenarios in wds such as locations of injection time of injection mass and duration of injection few studies have simultaneously considered these uncertainties in the optimization of sensors with respect to the risk of contamination in wds in this regard shastri and diwekar 2006 utilized stochastic programing method for optimal placement of sensors under uncertainties to reduce the risk of affected population they considered uncertainties including location of injection and water demand of nodes at a specific time their results show that changes in flow direction due to temporal variation of demands can have an effect on the uncontaminated nodes and increase affected population they utilized improved objective functions of berry et al 2005 and investigated four scenarios for flow pattern murray et al 2008 utilized threat ensemble vulnerability assessment and sensor placement optimization tool teva spot for minimizing the risk of contamination injection in wds the acceptable risk was determined based on several measures of risk including number of affected population percentage of incidents detected and extent of contamination in wds weickgenannt et al 2010 proposed a two objective optimization model based on nsga ii method which minimized the number of sensors and the risk of contamination in their research risk of contamination is described as failure probability of an optimal set of sensors to detect contamination injection as well as volume of contaminated water consumed prior to detection they used aleid simulation software kwr aleid software http www waterware nl aleid for analysis of a large number of possible contamination injection scenarios importance based scenario sampling method was also utilized for considering the most important scenarios including scenarios occurring close to highly populated area or nodes with high demands cvar is a useful method for risk measurement of probabilistic uncertainties that can be used for optimization of sensors placement in wds cvar is a modified version of value at risk var which is often utilized in economic science to improve coherent measure of risk artzner et al 1999 this approach has been used in water resource management field in limited number of researches webby et al 2006 investigated cvar method to minimize the loss due to change in the water level of lake burley griffin australia yamout et al 2007 used stochastic programing model based on cvar for water allocation problem in east central florida piantadosi et al 2008 evaluated cvar method for supporting urban storm water management which minimized environmental damage as a result of flood or environmental water shortage shao et al 2011 using two stage stochastic programing investigated optimal water resource allocation model under uncertainty based on cvar approach recently soltani et al 2016 presented a methodology based on cvar approach and nonlinear interval number programming ninp for simultaneous allocation of agricultural water and waste load in karkhe river in their research cvar based objective function was used to incorporate agricultural losses due to unpredictability of available river flow to the extent of the authors knowledge cvar based multi objective optimization model cmom of sensors placement in wds considering the extreme value of risk has not been studied before also more previous researches considered the injection of contamination in wds as single point form so in this study the multi point contamination injection for investigating the critical risk of contamination injection is evaluated in this condition detection of multi point contamination injection event is a complex problem this means if the contaminant is injected from different point of wds simultaneously the great number of nodes are contaminated results in more affected population therefore the epanet 1 computerized simulation model to predicts the dynamic hydraulic and water quality behavior within a drinking water distribution system adopted by user s manual rossman 2000 1 water quality simulation model is used for evaluating possible contamination injection events which considers a simultaneous multi point injection a multi objective simulation optimization model based on epanet simulation model and nsga ii model is developed to determine the pareto optimal solutions of considered objectives four objective functions in the multi objective optimization model are considered including losses and main criteria for optimal placement of sensors losses are determined as cvar of affected population and detection time and main criteria consist of probability of undetected events and number of sensors as cost solving the cmom will result in a trade off curve among objective functions considering multi point injection scenarios it should be noticed it is necessary to rank the non dominated solutions on trade off curve with respect to qualitative and quantitative criteria in this regard bazargan lari 2014 determined the best solution of optimal placement of sensors on trade off curve among minimization objective functions using two multiple attribute decision making madm techniques namely evidential reasoning er and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis in this study promethee method is used for choosing the best optimal solution among several non dominant solutions with respect to its features like considering the preference function being easy to use understandable and having the ability to cope with uncertainties to evaluate the applicability of the proposed methodology it is applied to a large scale wds of lamerd city in the southwestern part of iran 2 methodology flowchart of the proposed stochastic methodology based on cvar method for optimal placement of sensors in wds is presented in fig 1a the developed framework combines a stochastic water quality simulation model for multi point injection of contamination a cvar based multi objective optimization model and promethee method for ranking solutions on trade off curve this model is able to determine the best acceptable optimal placement of sensors in wds with minimum risk that results from the uncertainties of contamination injection as illustrated in fig 1a the proposed methodology consists of six main steps step 1 gathering basic data physical data such as number of nodes pipes hydrants tanks reservoirs pipe roughness and etc and basic information for analyzing hydraulic and water quality behavior of wds including main hydraulic characteristics of wds such as elevation of nodes base demand step 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is implemented for determining extreme situation of uncertain parameters that have more effect on consumer population and lead to greater risk by contamination injection scenarios in this study a few assumptions are considered based on previous studies 1 contamination injection occurs at zero demand nodes in this study fire hydrants based on direct accessibility connection to the main pipes and the corresponding higher volume of water which passes through them afshar and khombi 2015 2 time of injection is determined based on time of peak demand on daily demand pattern in these times contamination has a more destructive impact on the consumer population shen and mcbean 2010 3 potential locations of sensors are specified not only to spread across wds but also to cover a greater number of nodes this means different nodes and pipes with various flow direction are connected to each potential node of sensors yoo et al 2015 based on mentioned assumptions sensitivity analysis is carried out for determining effective ranges of mass and duration of injection in wds based on the impact of contaminated water on the human body on public health in sensitivity analysis a person is considered as exposed when cumulative mass of contamination reaches to the critical dose more details about critical dose and value of contamination are presented in section 3 in this study a discrete uniform distribution function is assigned to the mass and duration of injection in their effective ranges also location and time of contamination injection are considered as scenario based inputs step 3 developing epanet simulation model in order to incorporate uncertainties of contamination injection including location mass duration and time of contamination injection monte carlo simulation mcs is utilized for generating all possible injection scenarios so the total single point injection scenarios are determined by considering all possible combinations of random values injection mass and duration and scenario based inputs location and time of injection in mcs these scenarios are simulated using epanet simulation model the outputs of epanet concentration of contaminant in each time step at all wds nodes for all contamination injection scenarios are stored as water quality matrices wqm step 4 deriving effect of multi point contamination injection as mentioned earlier in this study the proposed methodology is extended not only for single point injection but also for supporting multi point injection of contamination in wds as well as considering risk of extreme value based on cvar method it is observed that because of large dimension of wqm epanet outputs for all multi point contamination injection scenarios the resulting database may exceed from the computer memory capacity for solving this problem storing all wqm for single point injection scenarios as database and using them to extract multi point water quality matrix mpwqm based on superposition principle for all multi point injection scenarios provides a way to deal with the high volume of data that caused componential problem so with this approach run time of simulation model is decreased all steps for developing mpwqm from wqm based on three point contamination injection are presented in fig 1b as shown in fig 1b based on superposition principle mpwqm database for all multi point contamination injections in this study three point injection are calculated more details about application of superposition principle for obtaining concentration of arsenic due to multi point injection of contamination using epanet simulation model are presented in section 2 1 following this step detection time and affected population prior to detection of each potential sensor are calculated using the obtained mpwqm database step 5 multi objective optimization model the flowchart of the fifth step is shown in fig 1c and the optimization steps are as follows 1 define objective functions 2 link the mpwqm database of multi point contamination injection obtained by epanet simulation model with nsga ii optimization model 3 set the parameters of nsga ii model including number of population and generation selection method coefficients of crossover and mutation 4 determining minimum value of cvar of affected population cvar of detection time probability of undetected events and number of sensors on trade off curve using cvar based multi ojective optimization model step 6 developing mcdm model finally the promethee method is utilized for ranking and comparing the non dominated alternatives on the trade off curve based on importance of criteria as mentioned earlier three relative weighting scenarios are analyzed on weight of each criterion in promethee method supplementary material table s1 this approach is able to determine the best number and layout of sensors in wds considering importance of all criteria in decision process 2 1 epanet simulation model the epanet simulation model was developed by the u s epa united state environmental protection agency which is a numerical model for hydraulic and water quality analysis in wds rossman et al 1993 the epanet solves hydraulic and water quality behavior based on two governing equations including conservation of mass and energy simultaneously to solve the headloss equation and flow continuity in pipes through hydraulic analysis gradient method is utilized todini and pilati 1987 the fraction headloss is computed using the hazen williams darcy weisbach or chezy manning formulas in this study hazen williams roughness coefficient is set in the epanet water quality simulation model the mass conservation equation in water quality simulation is a linear relation with considering reaction kinetics in this study decay rate of arsenic in water distribution system is assumed as the first order reaction n 1 rossman et al 1993 epanet considers advective transport of dissolved substance in pipes that is presented as following equation rossman 2000 1 c i t u i c i x r c i where c i concentration mass volume in pipe i as a function of distance x and time t u i flow velocity length time in pipe i and r rate of reaction mass volume time as a function of concentration according to assumption of the first order kinetics n 1 decay reaction r r kc n kc is used in advective transport equation in pipes so advective transport is a linear equation in addition complete mixing of contamination is occurred at each junction which receive inflow from two or more pipes so the concentration of leaving contamination from a junction is flow weighted sum of the concentrations of the contamination in inflowing pipes which is calculated as follow 2 c i x 0 j e i k q j c j x l j q k ext c k ext j e i k q j q k ext where i pipe that has leaving flow from node k i k set of pipes which entering flow into the node k l j length of pipe j q j flow in pipe j volume time q k ext external flow that entering in node k c k ext concentration of external flow in node k c i x 0 concentration at the start of pipe i c j x l concentration at the end of pipe i in this study epanet model is utilized to calculate the concentration of contamination in each node for all multi point contamination injection scenarios in wds the epanet programmer s toolkit as dynamic link library dll is used to link epanet s hydraulic and water quality simulation model to matlab in respect to linear equations of concentration eqs 1 and 2 in step 4 of the main flowchart superposition principle can be used for calculating concentration due to multi point contamination injection through single point contamination injection 2 2 conditional value at risk method artzner et al 1999 presented an analysis on risk measures and defined a set of axioms and features which should be satisfied by each risk measure method if these axioms would be desirable by risk measure then it is introduced as coherent risk measure method axioms include monotonicity translation equivariance subadditivity and positive homogeneity for random variables x and y descriptions of axioms based on risk measure σ are presented as follow 1 monotonicity higher losses mean higher risk x y σ x σ y 2 translation equivariance increasing or decreasing the loss increases decreases the risk by the same amount σ x c σ x c 3 subadditivity diversification decreases risk σ x y σ x σ y 4 monotonicity doubling the portfolio size doubles the risk σ λ x λ σ x var and cvar are popular functions for risk measure var can be coherent measure of risk only for normal loss distribution otherwise it lacks subadditivity axiom cvar satisfies this axiom and is defined as coherent measure of risk the highest loss at a certain confidence level β or minimum loss which does not exceed from probability 1 β and mean excess loss are defined as var and cvar respectively rockafellar and uryasev 2002 therefore for decision vector x and uncertain random variable y cumulative distribution function cdf of loss v f x y is calculated by the following equation piantadosi et al 2008 3 ψ x v p y f x y v consequently var and cvar are determined based on the cdf and probability density function pdf of losses at the specific confidence level β by the following equations 4 var β x min v r ψ x v β 5 cvar x e v r ψ x v β where e is the expected value of losses greater than var it means that cvar is the center area of pdf curve for values larger than var rockafellar and uryasev 1999 presented linear function to minimize value of cvar for a finite number of scenarios q at confidence level β eqs 6 and 7 6 min f β x ξ ξ 1 1 β k 1 q f x y ξ pd k 7 f x y ξ f x y ξ f x y ξ 0 0 f x y ξ 0 where ξ and pd k are var at confidence level β and probability density function respectively 2 3 nsga ii algorithm the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is a multi objective optimization algorithm that utilizes the elitism to create a parto optimal front for conflicting objective functions this algorithm uses an evolutionary process including selection crossover and mutation according to the ordering of pareto dominance the population is sorted into a hierarchy of sub populations also in nsga ii algorithm similarity among members of each sub group on pareto front is cosidered deb et al 2000 more details and applications of nsga ii optimization model are presented in deb et al 2000 2002 nikoo et al 2014 2015 raei et al 2017 and alizadeh et al 2017 2 4 risk based multi objective optimization model in the nsga ii multi objective optimization model location and number of sensors are considered as binary decision variables it should be noticed that in the risk based multi objective optimization model based on simulation database of all contamination injection scenarios each binary chromosome contains a few genes genes demonstrate potential location of sensors in wds that values of gene is equal to 0 node without sensor or 1 node equipped with a sensor for each chromosome in each generation nsga ii model suggests a layout of sensors as an example a decision vector is as follows x 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 based on the suggested layout and number of sensors in all injection scenarios minimum detection times are considered as losses of one subsequently based on the mentioned minimum values losses of affected population in all injection scenarios are calculated to quantify the extreme losses of affected population and detection time caused by uncertain parameters of contamination injection linear functions of cvar are utilized in optimization process eqs 8 and 9 it should be noted that a scenario is considered as detected scenario if the minimum detection time of suggested sensors is less than the duration of simulation process the probability of undetected events and number of sensors are defined in eqs 10 and 11 in the following the formulation of risk based multi objective optimization to extract a trade off curve among objective functions is presented 8 min cvar dt β ξ dt β 1 1 β n

of alternatives which was developed by brans et al 1984 and brans and vincke 1985 they extended it to six ranking forms including promethee i partial ranking promethee ii complete ranking promethee iii ranking based on intervals promethee iv continuous case promethee v multiple criteria decision analysis mcda including segmentation constraints and promethee vi representation of the human brain brans and mareschal 2005 zhang et al 2009 in this study complete ranking promethee ii is used which is utilized to rank finite numbers of alternatives considering several conflicting criteria in the first step of this method for a set of alternatives a a 1 a 2 a n and a set of criteria c c 1 c 2 c m pairwise comparison between all alternatives is implemented brans and vincke 1985 13 d k c k a i c k a j 0 where c k a i is value of alternative a i corresponding to criterion k in the second step the parameter p k that evaluates all alternatives for criteria k is determined using eq 14 14 p k c k max c k min brans et al 1986 suggested six types of generalized preference functions including usual criterion quasi criterion criterion with linear preference level criterion gaussian criterion criterion with linear preference and indifference area brans et al 1986 recommended the generalized criterion with linear preference function and also linear preference function and indifference area as applicable method by users in this paper linear preference function type iii is utilized 15 p k d k p k 0 d k p k 1 d k p k the value of preference function changes between 0 without preference and 1 the most preference considering all criteria preference function relation of alternative a i over a j π a i a j is calculated 16 π a i a j k 1 m w k p k where m is number of all criteria and w k is weight importance of k th criterion as a result leaving flow φ and entering flow φ of alternative a i are determined using eqs 17 and 18 respectively 17 φ a i 1 n 1 j 1 j i n π a i a j 18 φ a i 1 n 1 j 1 j i n π a j a i as mentioned before the complete rankings promethee ii is utilized whose ranking alternatives are based on net flow φ net 19 φ net a i φ a i φ a i the alternative with the higher net flow is chosen as the best solution in this paper four mentioned objective functions are considered as criteria in promethee approach with respect to importance of criteria and also based on the expert opinions different weights are assigned to them in order to rank obtained alternatives on trade off curve in cmom in this study pairwise comparison between all alternatives is done and net flow is calculated using subtraction of entering flow from leaving flow the first rank is chosen as the best possible solution of sensors placement in wds more details and applications of promethee approach are presented in brans and mareschal 2005 zhang et al 2009 and nikoo et al 2015 3 case study the proposed methodology is applied to wds of lamerd city in fars province in the southwestern part of iran lamerd wds includes 122 nodes 185 pipes 2 reservoirs and 1 tank which supply the water demands of lamerd city fig 2 shows the potential locations of contamination injection ghaedi 2009 in this study arsenic as a known public health risk and dangerous substance is considered as contamination which low concentration of it can cause a critical condition in water distribution system lytle et al 2004 klosterman et al 2010 shafiee and zechman 2013 bazargan lari 2014 it should be noted that pre analysis is done to assess the number of affected population when a contamination injection event occurs through each hydrant as potential locations of contamination injection based on this sensitivity analysis some of the hydrants used in research of ghaedi 2009 with low effectiveness are removed from further investigation the results demonstrated that contamination injection through some of the hydrants was unable to affect on large portions of wds due to the hydraulic condition of lamrd wds flow direction for example flow direction through all pipes for two different times in duration of simulation are demonstrated in fig 3 using epanet software as shown in fig 3 based on the variation of nodal demand flow directions are changed through some of pipes in duration of simulation process according to the hydraulic condition of lamerd wds generally direction of water flow in pipes are changed from downstream nodes to upstream nodes in fig 3 therefore based on the obtained results from pre analysis 18 nodes which supply the water demand of 20 035 persons from 122 nodes which supply the water demand of 147 643 persons were not affected by contamination injection from all existing hydrants in wds fig 4 as shown in fig 2 the southwestern part of the wds does not have potential location of injection node and is not contaminated by all injection scenarios since the placement of sensors in wds should be a practical solution in all conditions worst conditions of contamination injection are investigated therefore a zero demand node is considered in the nearest point to one of the reservoirs in lamerd wds for the better evaluation of the wds in critical condition and also for presenting the best practical solution to this problem added node in fig 2 finally 14 potential locations of contamination injection are selected as potential contamination injection nodes and approximate values of uncertain parameters time location mass and duration of contamination injection are determined based on sensitivity analysis darkness and poor night vision decrease security and surveillance that provide a suitable condition for intentional injection of contamination in wds by pressurize pump so three times are considered in darkness condition 04 00 05 00 and 06 00 also three scenarios for time of contamination injection 07 00 08 00 and 09 00 are determined according to times of peak demand daily demand s pattern fig 5 as shown in fig 5 mentioned times of contamination injection are a few hours before peak demands therefore with respect to existing low lag time between time of injection and peak demands high volume of contaminated water consumed by consumers in wds make more affected population also 19 potential locations of sensors are selected which are scattered over all regions of wds more details about hydraulic and water quality parameters for developed epanet simulation model are presented in table 1 as mentioned earlier a discrete uniform distribution is assigned to mass and duration of injection based on their effective ranges and 10 random combinations are generated by considering all combinations of four uncertain parameters 840 6 times 10 random combinations 14 locations of contamination injection unique contamination injection scenarios are determined as single point contamination injection scenarios these scenarios are simulated using epanet water quality simulation model and their outputs are stored in wqm database in this study multi point injection scenarios are investigated three point injection so based on all triad combinations of potential locations of injection c 14 3 364 combinations 6 times of injection and 10 combinations of random parameters 21 840 multi point injection scenarios n s are generated using superposition principle wqm which is obtained by each single point injection scenario is utilized to calculate the mpwqm of all triad combinations of injection and then affected population and detection time matrices at each potential location of sensors in this study 19 nodes are computed in this study effect of contamination is considered through ingestion of water while skin absorption is ignored saha et al 1999 based on the demand of drinking water for each human 3 lit day person demand multipliers of water for each node are modified therefore in each time step ingested mass is equal to summation of consumed contamination mass concentration of arsenic at each time step base demand of node on time demand multiplier of drinking water the critical value represents the one at which a person experiences symptoms which is different for various contaminations the arsenic critical value varies based on the average weight of a person critical value critical dose body weight shafiee and zechman 2013 20 c d 5 0 10 8 p w where c d and p w are arsenic critical value kg and average of consumer body weight kg respectively in this study for all consumers an average weight of 70 kg is assigned subsequently critical value of arsenic is equal to 3 5 mg 4 results and discussion as previously mentioned in the first step of the proposed methodology epanet model is run for different injection scenarios and 21 840 mpwqm are obtained based on superposition principle for all three point injection scenarios for explanation in fig 6 a and b minimum maximum average and standard deviation of affected population and detection time for 21 840 multi point injection scenarios in 19 potential locations of sensors are presented as shown in fig 6a maximum of affected population is equal to 147 441 persons which is accured in 12 injection scenarios when injection scenario is detected by sensor number 18 also for some of the injection scenarios affected population is equal to 0 it means for some of injection scenarios a potential sensor in wds exists which detects the injection scenario immediately in this paper it was assumed that threshold of sensor detection is 0 01 mg l for more illustration parameters of one of the contamination injection scenarios 79th scenario detected by 8th sensor with this feature are presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 if the mentioned scenario is detected by the 8th sensor the detection time would be approximately low so cumulative mass of arsenic doesn t reach to the critical value in all consumers 3 5 mg in each human body that cause zero affected population locations of injection are demonstrated in fig 2 as blue arrows which are nearest to node numbers 15 12 and 8 as shown in fig 6b the 8th and 11th sensors have minimum detection time 3 2 and 4 3 minutes respectively for 49th and 60th injection scenarios respectively it should be noted that only one potential sensors do not detect all injection scenarios therefore maximum value of detection time of each sensor in fig 6b is considered as duration of simulation process in this study 2880 minutes number of detected scenarios n ds by each potential sensor in wds are shown in fig 7 as mentioned earlier in each iteration of optimization model a set of sensors with different layout is suggested based on the suggested set n ds is calculated if all sensors of the suggested set can t detect contamination injection scenario it would be considered as an undetected event this value is variable in each iteration of optimization process then cmom is developed by linking nsga ii model with the mpwqm database to obtain a trade off curve among the objective functions in order to obtain global optimum solutions the number of population size is considered 15 times more than the number of decision variables number of potential sensors 19 also based on trial and error and engineering judgment maximum number of generation as well as crossover and mutation coefficients are set at 300 0 8 and 0 2 respectively using the developed risk based multi objective optimization model 29 unique points solutions on the trade off among objective functions are determined in this study for sensitivity analysis three more common confidence levels are considered β in cvar approach including 0 90 0 95 and 0 99 for calculating cvar of losses rockafellar and uryasev 1999 if decision makers are more conservative they choose higher confidence level which causes more risk with low occurrence probability these values are tested in developed cmom after running the optimization model for different confidence levels promethee model is utilized for determining the final decision on the trade off curve among objective functions increasing the confidence level from 0 90 to 0 99 leads to increase of cvar values of affected population from 7128 to 47 195 persons for the best alternative obtained by promethee method in this case study results for one of the common confidence levels 95 are presented as an example the three dimensional trade off curve among number of sensor cvar of affected population and detection time for confidence level 95 is presented in fig 8 also two dimensional trade off between number of sensor and cvar of affected population is shown in fig 9 as shown in figs 8 and 9 generally with increasing the number of sensors in wds cvar of affected population is decreased it should be noted that in optimization of sensor placement four objective functions are considered in multi objective optimization model so trade off curve among four objective functions is complex and doesn t present the results carefully as mentioned earlier all criteria should be minimized to determine the best solution for optimal placement of sensors for more clarification a pairwise comparison between all alternatives on trade off curve is done and then the preference function relation is calculated for each alternative based on the third weighting scenario results of promethee approach for selecting the best solution of placement of sensor based on three relative weighting scenarios are available online in supplementary material tables s1 s4 finally leaving ϕ entering ϕ net flow ϕ net and rank of each alternative for the third weighting scenario supplementary material table s1 are reported in table 3 the 16th alternative is chosen as the best possible solution among alternatives table 3 ϕ ϕ and ϕ net of the first rank 16th alternative are equal to 1 975 0 266 and 1 709 respectively the objective functions of the selected solution 16th alternative are shown in table 4 values of objective functions for best optimal placement of sensors due to different relative weighting scenarios are presented in supplementary material table s5 as shown in table 4 six sensors are selected that their locations in wds are in node numbers 4 6 9 10 11 and 18 fig 2 based on this selected layout these sensors are suitably located in all regions of lamerd wds and cover a lot of nodes with less risk of contamination for consumers also efficiency of layout of sensors is reasonable regarding the value of probability of undetected events in table 4 it is observed that the population of north and southeast regions of lamerd wds are more than other regions of wds and need to more sensors var or maximum losses at confidence level 95 on cdf curve is shown in fig 10 var of affected population and detection time corresponding to the best alternative are equal to 10 895 persons and 25 7 minutes respectively as shown in fig 11 a and b var and the maximum possible losses for all three point injection scenarios are used to calculate cvar on pdf curve of affected population and detection time as shown in fig 11a and b the maximum losses of affected population and detection time are 29 275 persons and 63 3 minutes respectively that occur in wds considering all three point injection scenarios for suggested potential sensors obtained by nsga ii model 5 summary and conclusion in this paper a new risk based multi objective optimization framework was developed considering risk of uncertainties of multi point contamination injection this model was able to determine the optimal placement of sensors in wds with the minimum risk based on cvar approach epanet water quality simulation model was utilized for evaluating probable multi point contamination injection scenarios nsga ii multi objective optimization model including two objective functions relevant to losses cvar of affected population and detection time as well as probability of undetected events and cost determined by number of sensors was linked to database matrices obtained by epanet software applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework were examined on lamerd wds in the southwestern part of iran the results presented a decision space for users which contains optimal location and number of sensors while minimizing the system risk in order to rank the alternatives on trade off curve among objective functions promethee method was employed to choose the best solution the results showed that promethee approach is able to rank alternatives on trade off curve for minimizing the system risk according to preference of each alternative based on the importance of criteria in this study uncertainties relevant to parameters of contamination injection in wds are considered in simulation model in future works the proposed methodology can be extended for considering conflict among stakeholders and the best compromise solution can be determined using bargaining theories and social choice methods

7485,in this study a new stochastic model based on conditional value at risk cvar and multi objective optimization methods is developed for optimal placement of sensors in water distribution system wds this model determines minimization of risk which is caused by simultaneous multi point contamination injection in wds using cvar approach the cvar considers uncertainties of contamination injection in the form of probability distribution function and calculates low probability extreme events in this approach extreme losses occur at tail of the losses distribution function four objective optimization model based on nsga ii algorithm is developed to minimize losses of contamination injection through cvar of affected population and detection time and also minimize the two other main criteria of optimal placement of sensors including probability of undetected events and cost finally to determine the best solution preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation promethee as a subgroup of multi criteria decision making mcdm approach is utilized to rank the alternatives on the trade off curve among objective functions also sensitivity analysis is done to investigate the importance of each criterion on promethee results considering three relative weighting scenarios the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is examined through applying it to lamerd wds in the southwestern part of iran the promethee suggests 6 sensors with suitable distribution that approximately cover all regions of wds optimal values related to cvar of affected population and detection time as well as probability of undetected events for the best optimal solution are equal to 17 055 persons 31 mins and 0 045 respectively the obtained results of the proposed methodology in lamerd wds show applicability of cvar based multi objective simulation optimization model for incorporating the main uncertainties of contamination injection in order to evaluate extreme value of losses in wds keywords water distribution system risk management conditional value at risk optimal placement of sensors promethee 1 introduction water distribution system wds is an important structure which is expected to deliver the safe drinking water to consumers through network of pipes hart and murray 2010 based on the features of wds such as their distributed geography and a lot of accessible points these structures are vulnerable to threats such as intentional contamination events in this regard water utility managers increasingly feel the need to detect the contamination and reduce the losses caused by intentional contamination event in wds optimal placement of sensors is a cost effective framework for mitigating acquired losses of contamination events a sufficient set of sensors with optimal layout in wds can provide early warning system that would maximize the health level of consumers or minimize the risk optimal placement of sensors in wds should be considered as a multi objective optimization problem with respect to all above mentioned reasons various multi objective simulation optimization models have been developed for sensor placement considering possible contamination injection scenarios weickgenannt et al 2010 hart and murray 2010 it should be noted that various uncertainties exist in the simulation of contamination injection scenarios in wds such as locations of injection time of injection mass and duration of injection few studies have simultaneously considered these uncertainties in the optimization of sensors with respect to the risk of contamination in wds in this regard shastri and diwekar 2006 utilized stochastic programing method for optimal placement of sensors under uncertainties to reduce the risk of affected population they considered uncertainties including location of injection and water demand of nodes at a specific time their results show that changes in flow direction due to temporal variation of demands can have an effect on the uncontaminated nodes and increase affected population they utilized improved objective functions of berry et al 2005 and investigated four scenarios for flow pattern murray et al 2008 utilized threat ensemble vulnerability assessment and sensor placement optimization tool teva spot for minimizing the risk of contamination injection in wds the acceptable risk was determined based on several measures of risk including number of affected population percentage of incidents detected and extent of contamination in wds weickgenannt et al 2010 proposed a two objective optimization model based on nsga ii method which minimized the number of sensors and the risk of contamination in their research risk of contamination is described as failure probability of an optimal set of sensors to detect contamination injection as well as volume of contaminated water consumed prior to detection they used aleid simulation software kwr aleid software http www waterware nl aleid for analysis of a large number of possible contamination injection scenarios importance based scenario sampling method was also utilized for considering the most important scenarios including scenarios occurring close to highly populated area or nodes with high demands cvar is a useful method for risk measurement of probabilistic uncertainties that can be used for optimization of sensors placement in wds cvar is a modified version of value at risk var which is often utilized in economic science to improve coherent measure of risk artzner et al 1999 this approach has been used in water resource management field in limited number of researches webby et al 2006 investigated cvar method to minimize the loss due to change in the water level of lake burley griffin australia yamout et al 2007 used stochastic programing model based on cvar for water allocation problem in east central florida piantadosi et al 2008 evaluated cvar method for supporting urban storm water management which minimized environmental damage as a result of flood or environmental water shortage shao et al 2011 using two stage stochastic programing investigated optimal water resource allocation model under uncertainty based on cvar approach recently soltani et al 2016 presented a methodology based on cvar approach and nonlinear interval number programming ninp for simultaneous allocation of agricultural water and waste load in karkhe river in their research cvar based objective function was used to incorporate agricultural losses due to unpredictability of available river flow to the extent of the authors knowledge cvar based multi objective optimization model cmom of sensors placement in wds considering the extreme value of risk has not been studied before also more previous researches considered the injection of contamination in wds as single point form so in this study the multi point contamination injection for investigating the critical risk of contamination injection is evaluated in this condition detection of multi point contamination injection event is a complex problem this means if the contaminant is injected from different point of wds simultaneously the great number of nodes are contaminated results in more affected population therefore the epanet 1 computerized simulation model to predicts the dynamic hydraulic and water quality behavior within a drinking water distribution system adopted by user s manual rossman 2000 1 water quality simulation model is used for evaluating possible contamination injection events which considers a simultaneous multi point injection a multi objective simulation optimization model based on epanet simulation model and nsga ii model is developed to determine the pareto optimal solutions of considered objectives four objective functions in the multi objective optimization model are considered including losses and main criteria for optimal placement of sensors losses are determined as cvar of affected population and detection time and main criteria consist of probability of undetected events and number of sensors as cost solving the cmom will result in a trade off curve among objective functions considering multi point injection scenarios it should be noticed it is necessary to rank the non dominated solutions on trade off curve with respect to qualitative and quantitative criteria in this regard bazargan lari 2014 determined the best solution of optimal placement of sensors on trade off curve among minimization objective functions using two multiple attribute decision making madm techniques namely evidential reasoning er and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis in this study promethee method is used for choosing the best optimal solution among several non dominant solutions with respect to its features like considering the preference function being easy to use understandable and having the ability to cope with uncertainties to evaluate the applicability of the proposed methodology it is applied to a large scale wds of lamerd city in the southwestern part of iran 2 methodology flowchart of the proposed stochastic methodology based on cvar method for optimal placement of sensors in wds is presented in fig 1a the developed framework combines a stochastic water quality simulation model for multi point injection of contamination a cvar based multi objective optimization model and promethee method for ranking solutions on trade off curve this model is able to determine the best acceptable optimal placement of sensors in wds with minimum risk that results from the uncertainties of contamination injection as illustrated in fig 1a the proposed methodology consists of six main steps step 1 gathering basic data physical data such as number of nodes pipes hydrants tanks reservoirs pipe roughness and etc and basic information for analyzing hydraulic and water quality behavior of wds including main hydraulic characteristics of wds such as elevation of nodes base demand step 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is implemented for determining extreme situation of uncertain parameters that have more effect on consumer population and lead to greater risk by contamination injection scenarios in this study a few assumptions are considered based on previous studies 1 contamination injection occurs at zero demand nodes in this study fire hydrants based on direct accessibility connection to the main pipes and the corresponding higher volume of water which passes through them afshar and khombi 2015 2 time of injection is determined based on time of peak demand on daily demand pattern in these times contamination has a more destructive impact on the consumer population shen and mcbean 2010 3 potential locations of sensors are specified not only to spread across wds but also to cover a greater number of nodes this means different nodes and pipes with various flow direction are connected to each potential node of sensors yoo et al 2015 based on mentioned assumptions sensitivity analysis is carried out for determining effective ranges of mass and duration of injection in wds based on the impact of contaminated water on the human body on public health in sensitivity analysis a person is considered as exposed when cumulative mass of contamination reaches to the critical dose more details about critical dose and value of contamination are presented in section 3 in this study a discrete uniform distribution function is assigned to the mass and duration of injection in their effective ranges also location and time of contamination injection are considered as scenario based inputs step 3 developing epanet simulation model in order to incorporate uncertainties of contamination injection including location mass duration and time of contamination injection monte carlo simulation mcs is utilized for generating all possible injection scenarios so the total single point injection scenarios are determined by considering all possible combinations of random values injection mass and duration and scenario based inputs location and time of injection in mcs these scenarios are simulated using epanet simulation model the outputs of epanet concentration of contaminant in each time step at all wds nodes for all contamination injection scenarios are stored as water quality matrices wqm step 4 deriving effect of multi point contamination injection as mentioned earlier in this study the proposed methodology is extended not only for single point injection but also for supporting multi point injection of contamination in wds as well as considering risk of extreme value based on cvar method it is observed that because of large dimension of wqm epanet outputs for all multi point contamination injection scenarios the resulting database may exceed from the computer memory capacity for solving this problem storing all wqm for single point injection scenarios as database and using them to extract multi point water quality matrix mpwqm based on superposition principle for all multi point injection scenarios provides a way to deal with the high volume of data that caused componential problem so with this approach run time of simulation model is decreased all steps for developing mpwqm from wqm based on three point contamination injection are presented in fig 1b as shown in fig 1b based on superposition principle mpwqm database for all multi point contamination injections in this study three point injection are calculated more details about application of superposition principle for obtaining concentration of arsenic due to multi point injection of contamination using epanet simulation model are presented in section 2 1 following this step detection time and affected population prior to detection of each potential sensor are calculated using the obtained mpwqm database step 5 multi objective optimization model the flowchart of the fifth step is shown in fig 1c and the optimization steps are as follows 1 define objective functions 2 link the mpwqm database of multi point contamination injection obtained by epanet simulation model with nsga ii optimization model 3 set the parameters of nsga ii model including number of population and generation selection method coefficients of crossover and mutation 4 determining minimum value of cvar of affected population cvar of detection time probability of undetected events and number of sensors on trade off curve using cvar based multi ojective optimization model step 6 developing mcdm model finally the promethee method is utilized for ranking and comparing the non dominated alternatives on the trade off curve based on importance of criteria as mentioned earlier three relative weighting scenarios are analyzed on weight of each criterion in promethee method supplementary material table s1 this approach is able to determine the best number and layout of sensors in wds considering importance of all criteria in decision process 2 1 epanet simulation model the epanet simulation model was developed by the u s epa united state environmental protection agency which is a numerical model for hydraulic and water quality analysis in wds rossman et al 1993 the epanet solves hydraulic and water quality behavior based on two governing equations including conservation of mass and energy simultaneously to solve the headloss equation and flow continuity in pipes through hydraulic analysis gradient method is utilized todini and pilati 1987 the fraction headloss is computed using the hazen williams darcy weisbach or chezy manning formulas in this study hazen williams roughness coefficient is set in the epanet water quality simulation model the mass conservation equation in water quality simulation is a linear relation with considering reaction kinetics in this study decay rate of arsenic in water distribution system is assumed as the first order reaction n 1 rossman et al 1993 epanet considers advective transport of dissolved substance in pipes that is presented as following equation rossman 2000 1 c i t u i c i x r c i where c i concentration mass volume in pipe i as a function of distance x and time t u i flow velocity length time in pipe i and r rate of reaction mass volume time as a function of concentration according to assumption of the first order kinetics n 1 decay reaction r r kc n kc is used in advective transport equation in pipes so advective transport is a linear equation in addition complete mixing of contamination is occurred at each junction which receive inflow from two or more pipes so the concentration of leaving contamination from a junction is flow weighted sum of the concentrations of the contamination in inflowing pipes which is calculated as follow 2 c i x 0 j e i k q j c j x l j q k ext c k ext j e i k q j q k ext where i pipe that has leaving flow from node k i k set of pipes which entering flow into the node k l j length of pipe j q j flow in pipe j volume time q k ext external flow that entering in node k c k ext concentration of external flow in node k c i x 0 concentration at the start of pipe i c j x l concentration at the end of pipe i in this study epanet model is utilized to calculate the concentration of contamination in each node for all multi point contamination injection scenarios in wds the epanet programmer s toolkit as dynamic link library dll is used to link epanet s hydraulic and water quality simulation model to matlab in respect to linear equations of concentration eqs 1 and 2 in step 4 of the main flowchart superposition principle can be used for calculating concentration due to multi point contamination injection through single point contamination injection 2 2 conditional value at risk method artzner et al 1999 presented an analysis on risk measures and defined a set of axioms and features which should be satisfied by each risk measure method if these axioms would be desirable by risk measure then it is introduced as coherent risk measure method axioms include monotonicity translation equivariance subadditivity and positive homogeneity for random variables x and y descriptions of axioms based on risk measure σ are presented as follow 1 monotonicity higher losses mean higher risk x y σ x σ y 2 translation equivariance increasing or decreasing the loss increases decreases the risk by the same amount σ x c σ x c 3 subadditivity diversification decreases risk σ x y σ x σ y 4 monotonicity doubling the portfolio size doubles the risk σ λ x λ σ x var and cvar are popular functions for risk measure var can be coherent measure of risk only for normal loss distribution otherwise it lacks subadditivity axiom cvar satisfies this axiom and is defined as coherent measure of risk the highest loss at a certain confidence level β or minimum loss which does not exceed from probability 1 β and mean excess loss are defined as var and cvar respectively rockafellar and uryasev 2002 therefore for decision vector x and uncertain random variable y cumulative distribution function cdf of loss v f x y is calculated by the following equation piantadosi et al 2008 3 ψ x v p y f x y v consequently var and cvar are determined based on the cdf and probability density function pdf of losses at the specific confidence level β by the following equations 4 var β x min v r ψ x v β 5 cvar x e v r ψ x v β where e is the expected value of losses greater than var it means that cvar is the center area of pdf curve for values larger than var rockafellar and uryasev 1999 presented linear function to minimize value of cvar for a finite number of scenarios q at confidence level β eqs 6 and 7 6 min f β x ξ ξ 1 1 β k 1 q f x y ξ pd k 7 f x y ξ f x y ξ f x y ξ 0 0 f x y ξ 0 where ξ and pd k are var at confidence level β and probability density function respectively 2 3 nsga ii algorithm the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii is a multi objective optimization algorithm that utilizes the elitism to create a parto optimal front for conflicting objective functions this algorithm uses an evolutionary process including selection crossover and mutation according to the ordering of pareto dominance the population is sorted into a hierarchy of sub populations also in nsga ii algorithm similarity among members of each sub group on pareto front is cosidered deb et al 2000 more details and applications of nsga ii optimization model are presented in deb et al 2000 2002 nikoo et al 2014 2015 raei et al 2017 and alizadeh et al 2017 2 4 risk based multi objective optimization model in the nsga ii multi objective optimization model location and number of sensors are considered as binary decision variables it should be noticed that in the risk based multi objective optimization model based on simulation database of all contamination injection scenarios each binary chromosome contains a few genes genes demonstrate potential location of sensors in wds that values of gene is equal to 0 node without sensor or 1 node equipped with a sensor for each chromosome in each generation nsga ii model suggests a layout of sensors as an example a decision vector is as follows x 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 based on the suggested layout and number of sensors in all injection scenarios minimum detection times are considered as losses of one subsequently based on the mentioned minimum values losses of affected population in all injection scenarios are calculated to quantify the extreme losses of affected population and detection time caused by uncertain parameters of contamination injection linear functions of cvar are utilized in optimization process eqs 8 and 9 it should be noted that a scenario is considered as detected scenario if the minimum detection time of suggested sensors is less than the duration of simulation process the probability of undetected events and number of sensors are defined in eqs 10 and 11 in the following the formulation of risk based multi objective optimization to extract a trade off curve among objective functions is presented 8 min cvar dt β ξ dt β 1 1 β n

of alternatives which was developed by brans et al 1984 and brans and vincke 1985 they extended it to six ranking forms including promethee i partial ranking promethee ii complete ranking promethee iii ranking based on intervals promethee iv continuous case promethee v multiple criteria decision analysis mcda including segmentation constraints and promethee vi representation of the human brain brans and mareschal 2005 zhang et al 2009 in this study complete ranking promethee ii is used which is utilized to rank finite numbers of alternatives considering several conflicting criteria in the first step of this method for a set of alternatives a a 1 a 2 a n and a set of criteria c c 1 c 2 c m pairwise comparison between all alternatives is implemented brans and vincke 1985 13 d k c k a i c k a j 0 where c k a i is value of alternative a i corresponding to criterion k in the second step the parameter p k that evaluates all alternatives for criteria k is determined using eq 14 14 p k c k max c k min brans et al 1986 suggested six types of generalized preference functions including usual criterion quasi criterion criterion with linear preference level criterion gaussian criterion criterion with linear preference and indifference area brans et al 1986 recommended the generalized criterion with linear preference function and also linear preference function and indifference area as applicable method by users in this paper linear preference function type iii is utilized 15 p k d k p k 0 d k p k 1 d k p k the value of preference function changes between 0 without preference and 1 the most preference considering all criteria preference function relation of alternative a i over a j π a i a j is calculated 16 π a i a j k 1 m w k p k where m is number of all criteria and w k is weight importance of k th criterion as a result leaving flow φ and entering flow φ of alternative a i are determined using eqs 17 and 18 respectively 17 φ a i 1 n 1 j 1 j i n π a i a j 18 φ a i 1 n 1 j 1 j i n π a j a i as mentioned before the complete rankings promethee ii is utilized whose ranking alternatives are based on net flow φ net 19 φ net a i φ a i φ a i the alternative with the higher net flow is chosen as the best solution in this paper four mentioned objective functions are considered as criteria in promethee approach with respect to importance of criteria and also based on the expert opinions different weights are assigned to them in order to rank obtained alternatives on trade off curve in cmom in this study pairwise comparison between all alternatives is done and net flow is calculated using subtraction of entering flow from leaving flow the first rank is chosen as the best possible solution of sensors placement in wds more details and applications of promethee approach are presented in brans and mareschal 2005 zhang et al 2009 and nikoo et al 2015 3 case study the proposed methodology is applied to wds of lamerd city in fars province in the southwestern part of iran lamerd wds includes 122 nodes 185 pipes 2 reservoirs and 1 tank which supply the water demands of lamerd city fig 2 shows the potential locations of contamination injection ghaedi 2009 in this study arsenic as a known public health risk and dangerous substance is considered as contamination which low concentration of it can cause a critical condition in water distribution system lytle et al 2004 klosterman et al 2010 shafiee and zechman 2013 bazargan lari 2014 it should be noted that pre analysis is done to assess the number of affected population when a contamination injection event occurs through each hydrant as potential locations of contamination injection based on this sensitivity analysis some of the hydrants used in research of ghaedi 2009 with low effectiveness are removed from further investigation the results demonstrated that contamination injection through some of the hydrants was unable to affect on large portions of wds due to the hydraulic condition of lamrd wds flow direction for example flow direction through all pipes for two different times in duration of simulation are demonstrated in fig 3 using epanet software as shown in fig 3 based on the variation of nodal demand flow directions are changed through some of pipes in duration of simulation process according to the hydraulic condition of lamerd wds generally direction of water flow in pipes are changed from downstream nodes to upstream nodes in fig 3 therefore based on the obtained results from pre analysis 18 nodes which supply the water demand of 20 035 persons from 122 nodes which supply the water demand of 147 643 persons were not affected by contamination injection from all existing hydrants in wds fig 4 as shown in fig 2 the southwestern part of the wds does not have potential location of injection node and is not contaminated by all injection scenarios since the placement of sensors in wds should be a practical solution in all conditions worst conditions of contamination injection are investigated therefore a zero demand node is considered in the nearest point to one of the reservoirs in lamerd wds for the better evaluation of the wds in critical condition and also for presenting the best practical solution to this problem added node in fig 2 finally 14 potential locations of contamination injection are selected as potential contamination injection nodes and approximate values of uncertain parameters time location mass and duration of contamination injection are determined based on sensitivity analysis darkness and poor night vision decrease security and surveillance that provide a suitable condition for intentional injection of contamination in wds by pressurize pump so three times are considered in darkness condition 04 00 05 00 and 06 00 also three scenarios for time of contamination injection 07 00 08 00 and 09 00 are determined according to times of peak demand daily demand s pattern fig 5 as shown in fig 5 mentioned times of contamination injection are a few hours before peak demands therefore with respect to existing low lag time between time of injection and peak demands high volume of contaminated water consumed by consumers in wds make more affected population also 19 potential locations of sensors are selected which are scattered over all regions of wds more details about hydraulic and water quality parameters for developed epanet simulation model are presented in table 1 as mentioned earlier a discrete uniform distribution is assigned to mass and duration of injection based on their effective ranges and 10 random combinations are generated by considering all combinations of four uncertain parameters 840 6 times 10 random combinations 14 locations of contamination injection unique contamination injection scenarios are determined as single point contamination injection scenarios these scenarios are simulated using epanet water quality simulation model and their outputs are stored in wqm database in this study multi point injection scenarios are investigated three point injection so based on all triad combinations of potential locations of injection c 14 3 364 combinations 6 times of injection and 10 combinations of random parameters 21 840 multi point injection scenarios n s are generated using superposition principle wqm which is obtained by each single point injection scenario is utilized to calculate the mpwqm of all triad combinations of injection and then affected population and detection time matrices at each potential location of sensors in this study 19 nodes are computed in this study effect of contamination is considered through ingestion of water while skin absorption is ignored saha et al 1999 based on the demand of drinking water for each human 3 lit day person demand multipliers of water for each node are modified therefore in each time step ingested mass is equal to summation of consumed contamination mass concentration of arsenic at each time step base demand of node on time demand multiplier of drinking water the critical value represents the one at which a person experiences symptoms which is different for various contaminations the arsenic critical value varies based on the average weight of a person critical value critical dose body weight shafiee and zechman 2013 20 c d 5 0 10 8 p w where c d and p w are arsenic critical value kg and average of consumer body weight kg respectively in this study for all consumers an average weight of 70 kg is assigned subsequently critical value of arsenic is equal to 3 5 mg 4 results and discussion as previously mentioned in the first step of the proposed methodology epanet model is run for different injection scenarios and 21 840 mpwqm are obtained based on superposition principle for all three point injection scenarios for explanation in fig 6 a and b minimum maximum average and standard deviation of affected population and detection time for 21 840 multi point injection scenarios in 19 potential locations of sensors are presented as shown in fig 6a maximum of affected population is equal to 147 441 persons which is accured in 12 injection scenarios when injection scenario is detected by sensor number 18 also for some of the injection scenarios affected population is equal to 0 it means for some of injection scenarios a potential sensor in wds exists which detects the injection scenario immediately in this paper it was assumed that threshold of sensor detection is 0 01 mg l for more illustration parameters of one of the contamination injection scenarios 79th scenario detected by 8th sensor with this feature are presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 if the mentioned scenario is detected by the 8th sensor the detection time would be approximately low so cumulative mass of arsenic doesn t reach to the critical value in all consumers 3 5 mg in each human body that cause zero affected population locations of injection are demonstrated in fig 2 as blue arrows which are nearest to node numbers 15 12 and 8 as shown in fig 6b the 8th and 11th sensors have minimum detection time 3 2 and 4 3 minutes respectively for 49th and 60th injection scenarios respectively it should be noted that only one potential sensors do not detect all injection scenarios therefore maximum value of detection time of each sensor in fig 6b is considered as duration of simulation process in this study 2880 minutes number of detected scenarios n ds by each potential sensor in wds are shown in fig 7 as mentioned earlier in each iteration of optimization model a set of sensors with different layout is suggested based on the suggested set n ds is calculated if all sensors of the suggested set can t detect contamination injection scenario it would be considered as an undetected event this value is variable in each iteration of optimization process then cmom is developed by linking nsga ii model with the mpwqm database to obtain a trade off curve among the objective functions in order to obtain global optimum solutions the number of population size is considered 15 times more than the number of decision variables number of potential sensors 19 also based on trial and error and engineering judgment maximum number of generation as well as crossover and mutation coefficients are set at 300 0 8 and 0 2 respectively using the developed risk based multi objective optimization model 29 unique points solutions on the trade off among objective functions are determined in this study for sensitivity analysis three more common confidence levels are considered β in cvar approach including 0 90 0 95 and 0 99 for calculating cvar of losses rockafellar and uryasev 1999 if decision makers are more conservative they choose higher confidence level which causes more risk with low occurrence probability these values are tested in developed cmom after running the optimization model for different confidence levels promethee model is utilized for determining the final decision on the trade off curve among objective functions increasing the confidence level from 0 90 to 0 99 leads to increase of cvar values of affected population from 7128 to 47 195 persons for the best alternative obtained by promethee method in this case study results for one of the common confidence levels 95 are presented as an example the three dimensional trade off curve among number of sensor cvar of affected population and detection time for confidence level 95 is presented in fig 8 also two dimensional trade off between number of sensor and cvar of affected population is shown in fig 9 as shown in figs 8 and 9 generally with increasing the number of sensors in wds cvar of affected population is decreased it should be noted that in optimization of sensor placement four objective functions are considered in multi objective optimization model so trade off curve among four objective functions is complex and doesn t present the results carefully as mentioned earlier all criteria should be minimized to determine the best solution for optimal placement of sensors for more clarification a pairwise comparison between all alternatives on trade off curve is done and then the preference function relation is calculated for each alternative based on the third weighting scenario results of promethee approach for selecting the best solution of placement of sensor based on three relative weighting scenarios are available online in supplementary material tables s1 s4 finally leaving ϕ entering ϕ net flow ϕ net and rank of each alternative for the third weighting scenario supplementary material table s1 are reported in table 3 the 16th alternative is chosen as the best possible solution among alternatives table 3 ϕ ϕ and ϕ net of the first rank 16th alternative are equal to 1 975 0 266 and 1 709 respectively the objective functions of the selected solution 16th alternative are shown in table 4 values of objective functions for best optimal placement of sensors due to different relative weighting scenarios are presented in supplementary material table s5 as shown in table 4 six sensors are selected that their locations in wds are in node numbers 4 6 9 10 11 and 18 fig 2 based on this selected layout these sensors are suitably located in all regions of lamerd wds and cover a lot of nodes with less risk of contamination for consumers also efficiency of layout of sensors is reasonable regarding the value of probability of undetected events in table 4 it is observed that the population of north and southeast regions of lamerd wds are more than other regions of wds and need to more sensors var or maximum losses at confidence level 95 on cdf curve is shown in fig 10 var of affected population and detection time corresponding to the best alternative are equal to 10 895 persons and 25 7 minutes respectively as shown in fig 11 a and b var and the maximum possible losses for all three point injection scenarios are used to calculate cvar on pdf curve of affected population and detection time as shown in fig 11a and b the maximum losses of affected population and detection time are 29 275 persons and 63 3 minutes respectively that occur in wds considering all three point injection scenarios for suggested potential sensors obtained by nsga ii model 5 summary and conclusion in this paper a new risk based multi objective optimization framework was developed considering risk of uncertainties of multi point contamination injection this model was able to determine the optimal placement of sensors in wds with the minimum risk based on cvar approach epanet water quality simulation model was utilized for evaluating probable multi point contamination injection scenarios nsga ii multi objective optimization model including two objective functions relevant to losses cvar of affected population and detection time as well as probability of undetected events and cost determined by number of sensors was linked to database matrices obtained by epanet software applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework were examined on lamerd wds in the southwestern part of iran the results presented a decision space for users which contains optimal location and number of sensors while minimizing the system risk in order to rank the alternatives on trade off curve among objective functions promethee method was employed to choose the best solution the results showed that promethee approach is able to rank alternatives on trade off curve for minimizing the system risk according

7486,recent research has found that hydrologic modeling over decadal time periods often requires time variant model parameters most prior work has focused on assessing time variance in model parameters conceptualizing watershed features and functions in this paper we assess whether adding a time variant scalar to potential evapotranspiration pet can be used in place of time variant parameters using the hbv hydrologic model and four different simple but common pet methods hamon priestly taylor oudin and hargreaves we simulated 60 years of daily discharge on four rivers in new york state allowing all ten model parameters to vary in time achieved good model fits in terms of daily nse and long term water balance however allowing single model parameters to vary in time including a scalar on pet achieved nearly equivalent model fits across pet methods overall varying a pet scalar in time is likely more physically consistent with known biophysical controls on pet as compared to varying parameters conceptualizing innate watershed properties related to soil properties such as wilting point and field capacity this work suggests that the seeming need for time variance in innate watershed parameters may be due to overly simple evapotranspiration formulations that do not account for all factors controlling evapotranspiration over long time periods keywords watershed modeling evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration streamflow 1 introduction hydrologic models can be useful tools for simulating water availability and partitioning at the land surface especially for future time periods moore 1985 wagener et al 2010 in practice the accuracy of such future predictions is judged based on the ability of a model to simulate historical streamflow driven by observed meteorological inputs moore 1985 wagener et al 2001 oudin et al 2005a aghakouchek and habib 2010 while historical observations of air temperature precipitation and streamflow are abundant there is a much more limited network of direct measurements of evapotranspiration et wang and dickinson 2012 long et al 2014 as such very few studies use direct measurements of either potential et or actual et instead potential et is estimated by any number of possible equations within the hydrologic literature see oudin et al 2005b for a comprehensive list and actual et is simulated by the model as a function of model parameters and model states as governed by potential et mcmahon et al 2013 in most rainfall runoff modeling studies there is typically no evaluation of the accuracy of potential or actual et estimates instead as long as the hydrologic model is able to simulate a discharge time series with a suitable fit to observed discharge data the selected et equations are implicitly assumed to be sufficient along with the rest of the hydrologic model there have been two recent developments in the hydrology literature that suggest the sufficiency of et equations used within hydrologic models should be revisited and more carefully investigated first milly and dunne 2016 carried out a comparison of the consistency between climate model estimated et during wet conditions and standard approaches to estimating potential et pet in hydrologic models run offline to a climate model surprisingly milly and dunne 2016 found that a simple net radiation model was preferable to the penman monteith model penman 1948 monteith 1981 often considered the most physically robust of all pet model choices chen et al 2005 donohue et al 2010 mcvicar et al 2007 milly and dunne 2016 noted that the penman monteith model run offline from a gcm could not account for factors such as changes in stomatal conductance interception of water on vegetation subhourly weather variations and elevational variations in the thermodynamic gradient which were key to predicting future streamflow and estimating actual et second there has been a recognition that parameters in hydrologic models are often time dependent in relation to the climate conditions under which the model was calibrated thus parameters representing seemingly immutable physical properties e g wilting point catchment storage saturated conductivity must be treated as non constant in time to simulate streamflow under varying conditions e g hartmann and bardossy 2005 chiew et al 2009 merz et al 2011 gharari et al 2013 coron et al 2014 thirel et al 2015a however to our knowledge these studies have not considered an alternative possibility that in these conceptual representations et models may have time dependent parameters this is despite the fact that many of these studies have used relatively simple pet models such as that of oudin et al 2005a or thornthwaite 1948 that are only dependent on temperature and day of the year inconsistencies in et have likely not been thoroughly investigated because they are often difficult to detect if a modeled et estimate is incorrect it is usually not evident by only looking at the ability of a model to replicate daily flows the most typical output on which hydrologic models are calibrated instead bias in et estimates may only be apparent when looking at the long term water balance of a watershed wagener et al 2010 thirel et al 2015b while many hydrologic modeling studies have focused on shorter periods for model testing and validation e g less than 10 years a small number of studies have shown that longer periods of time on the order of 30 years e g hartmann and bardossy 2005 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2014 are necessary before bias in the water budget is apparent and distinguishable from random errors calibration may be able to limit bias over short periods of several years if controls on et remain consistent over the short calibration and validation periods only multi decadal assessment periods can objectively assess whether et models can account for slowly changing controls on et one of the few papers to broadly consider the suitability of et models using a long term water balance is oudin et al 2005b oudin et al 2005b considered whether using mean pet in hydrologic models worked as well as using a temporally varying pet calculated using a formulation such as penman monteith with comparisons presented across watersheds worldwide using validation periods of five year lengths however oudin et al 2005b focused on the comparability of the pet models to each other with less consideration of model agreement with reality indeed based on a measure of cumulative errors in the simulated long term water balance they found that simulations run using both the mean pet and penman monteith had a typical median cumulative water budget value of 88 after an approximately 5 year run implying that the long term water balance even when permitting cumulative negative and positive errors over long periods to negate was off by 12 models within the lower middle quartile could be off by 20 such known uncertainty in water yield due to et estimation even without other uncertainties e g model structure climatic drivers would limit the utility of the model in making future predictions of water availability a critical use of many hydrologic models this paper joins the collection of recent papers that evaluate the stability of model parameters over the long term however instead of only tracking variability in time of parameters that control internal partitioning within the watershed this paper seeks to treat the et formulation as an adjustable quantity scaled by its own time dependent parameter much as milly and dunne 2016 recognized limitations of the penman monteith model relative to climate model calculations of et it would not be unexpected that even simpler pet equations often used in hydrologic models also face similar or greater limitations indeed analyses of flux tower observations often present interannual variations in the priestly taylor coefficient wilson and baldocchi 2000 brummer et al 2012 often relatable in part to changes in canopy conductance most applications of simple pet models do not assume any such interannual variations exist in short the primary goal of this paper is to identify whether time variable scaling of et besides that induced by climate drivers improves discharge simulations similarly or better than allowing other model variables to vary in time variation in et over time may be driven by non climatic factors such as changes in land cover changes in vegetative response to moisture availability or climate changing co2 concentration and any number of other potential factors we suggest that it is more physically plausible for largely biological factors that control et to vary in time than for abiotic variables that quantify fundamental physical features of a watershed to vary in time this paper explores the possibility of whether the time variant watershed model parameters found when calibrations are made under differing climatic conditions may actually be more suitably explained by the possibility of overly simplistic et equations fundamentally we assess whether a time variant scalar should be applied to standard et equations to account for temporal variations in controls on et to assess we test the ability of a common conceptual hydrologic model to simulate streamflow for 60 year records over four different river systems a long period is essential as it captures long term shifts in external variables such as climate or land use that may not be evident over short time periods these shifts may be reflective of the range of conditions possibly found in future time periods several different assessment approaches are evaluated 1 no model parameters vary in time 2 all parameters are allowed to vary in time concurrently 3 single parameters related to physical features of the catchment are allowed to vary in time with all others held constant and 4 only a pet scalar is allowed to vary in time 2 methods 2 1 study watersheds the modeling analysis is carried out for four watersheds within the lake erie and lake ontario drainage table 1 and fig 1 these watersheds were selected for their long united states geological survey usgs discharge records availability of spatially averaged precipitation and temperature data input data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration great lakes environmental research laboratory noaa glerl hunter et al 2015 and because of the importance of accurately quantifying long term inputs and storage changes on the great lakes while in relatively close proximity there are differences across the watersheds the northern most black river is more snow dominated and exhibits stronger seasonality in flows the oswego river watershed includes drainage from flow regulated lakes i e the finger lakes in all four watersheds land cover includes a mix of forest and agricultural land use table 1 all watersheds are more than 40 forested have no major urban centers and have no major water diversions tree species in the black river watershed consist of northern hardwoods e g sugar maple yellow birch american beech while the other three watersheds primarily consist of oak hickory forests since satellite based land use is only available back to the 1970 s and the hydrologic records of the rivers in our study date back to the 1940 s exact changes in land use over the full study period are not known several studies in central new york state most indicative of the genesee and oswego watersheds indicate the most frequent land use change is reforestation of former agricultural fields stover and marks 1998 shaw et al 2014 this reforestation began in the 1930 s with most reforestation well underway by the middle of the twentieth century 2 2 hydrologic models this paper primarily presents analysis undertaken using a formulation of hbv bergström 1975 1992 1995 lindström et al 2005 presented in hundecha and bardossy 2004 and aghakouchak and habib 2010 however to ensure the results were not simply dependent on the chosen model a parallel analysis was also completed using the hymod hydrologic model wagener et al 2001 boyle et al 2003 kollat et al 2012 both models have similar numbers of parameters and input requirements but they have slightly different model structures particularly in regard to soil moisture accounting schemes because the results using both models were similar as a matter of brevity in presenting findings we do not show both models in the main portion of this paper instead detailed results for hymod are provided in supplementary material while hbv can be applied as a semi distributed model we implemented it as a lumped model where each study watershed was represented by a single hydrologic unit the lumped model consists of three different storage layers a soil store an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir plus the potential for water storage in a snowpack we used a formulation of hbv with ten parameters that simulates streamflow on a daily time step a temperature threshold tt partitions precipitation between rain and snow based on daily average air temperature melt from any accumulated snow occurs when air temperatures exceed tt and is governed by a degree day factor ddf relating air temperatures in excess of tt to mm of melt rain or melt enters the soil store where it may either leave via evapotranspiration move to the upper reservoir as a function of current soil storage field capacity fc and a shape parameter β or exit as overland flow directly to the stream in the soil store a threshold water level l determines the occurrence of overland flow water leaves the upper and lower reservoirs and becomes streamflow as described by three parameters representing residence times that release quickflow k0 interflow k1 and baseflow k2 water may percolate from the upper to the lower reservoir at a constant rate kp evapotranspiration only occurs from the upper soil store the soil store linearly limits potential evapotranspiration according to the ratio between a threshold parameter pwp and available soil storage when soil storage exceeds precipitation aet is equal to the potential rate pet is calculated as described below model parameters and abbreviations are described in table 2 daily average air temperature and precipitation used as model input were provided by the noaa glerl for each watershed with dataset creation described by hunter et al 2015 model simulations of streamflow are compared to daily observations of streamflow provided by the usgs we note that stream gage location and stream gage technology changes through time and is described in detail by the usgs for each stream gage while differences in technology and gage location over 60 year periods do have potential to impact data accuracy and introduce errors in the modeling process we note that the usgs post corrects all records for these changes making these datasets vetted and curated for potential data errors 2 3 potential evapotranspiration models potential evapotranspiration pet is estimated using four different methods oudin hamon hargreaves and priestly taylor while this represents just a subset of all simple pet methods in the literature these fall into the three main categories temperature based hamon radiation based priestly taylor and hybrid models hargreaves and oudin these four pet methods represent different climate drivers on pet and can provide some insight into controls on pet additionally studies have shown that hydrologic model performance may be impacted by the choice of pet estimation algorithm hence why we sought to test performance across these different methods vorosmarty et al 1998 andréassian et al 2004 the oudin method calculates pet as 1a pet 1000 r e λ ρ t 5 10 if t 5 0 1b pet 0 if t 5 0 where pet is in mm day 1 λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 ρ is the density of water kg m 3 t is air surface temperature deg c and re is daily extraterrestrial net radiation mj m 2 d 1 calculated solely from julian date and latitude dingman 2008 to calculate pet at each site we applied the latitude associated with the streamflow gaging station the oudin et al 2005a b model originated from a reanalysis of 27 different pe models applied to a large number of watersheds which concluded that streamflow simulation efficiency was highest for pe models based on temperature and radiation the hamon 1961 method calculates pet as 2 pet 29 8 h day e sat t t 273 2 t 5 10 where hday is the number of daylight hours and esat t is the saturation vapor pressure kpa as a function of the air surface temperature the hargreaves hargreaves 1975 hargreaves and samani 1982 method calculates pet using an estimate for daily extraterrestrial solar radiation and measured air temperature following 3 pet 0 0023 r e λ ρ t max t min 0 5 t 17 8 where tmax and tmin are daily maximum and minimum air temperature respectively finally the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 calculates pet using measured radiation values and air temperature in this formulation pet is calculated as 4 pet 1000 α λ ρ δ δ γ r n g where α is a coefficient describing the amount of surface moisture that could be evaporated we use a value of 1 26 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 and rn is net radiation mj m 2 d 1 net radiation is estimated by balancing net solar and net longwave radiation net solar radiation comes from ncar ncep reanalysis available at a monthly scale from 1948 to present where the monthly mean value is used for each day kalnay et al 1996 net longwave radiation is estimated using a stefan boltzmann formulation that accounts for humidity and takes both daily minimum and maximum air temperature k into account dingman 2008 within this calculation of net longwave radiation we do not directly adjust for cloud cover but assume that air temperature variations indirectly take this into account g the soil heat exchange term is considered negligible 2 4 approaches to model fitting model fitting is carried out in two ways 1 a traditional method in which the model is calibrated for a short interval and then the fitted parameters are presumed to be invariant in time and 2 a more non standard method in which parameters are allowed to be time variant a summary of the different model experiments can be found in table 3 for the traditional approach we began by calibrating the hbv models to a five year period from january 1 1948 to december 31 1952 for each watershed we randomly sampled each model parameter space 50 000 times across feasible parameter ranges table 2 and ran each model for all parameter samples using observed meteorology alongside estimates of pet from four different pet methods model performance was assessed in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for daily discharge nse qdaily and the five year runoff ratio error rre rre was calculated by aggregating observed and simulated daily streamflow and precipitation data to a five year average rre is implicitly equal to mean error in five year aggregated streamflow just simply normalized by precipitation as precipitation is observed and does not change between model runs presenting error in rre is equivalent to presenting error in aggregated five year q we chose to present this error using runoff ratio as it inherently accounts for temporal variations in precipitation and discussion of rre focuses on secondary controls on long term q variations this baseline calibration was carried out in two ways by using nse qdaily alone and by using both nse qdaily and rre for nse qdaily and rre together we identified the ten parameter sets with the highest nse that had an rre of less than 5 error for nse qdaily alone we simply took the ten parameter sets with the highest nse we make use of ten sets instead of a single set to account for potential equifinality and uncertainty within the initial calibration period as this is likely to affect model performance during validation periods once calibrated to the baseline period the parameter sets were then validated across the remainder of the study period as calibration was for a five year period centered on 1950 jan 1 1948 dec 31 1952 validation is assessed within a five year moving window for 58 different but overlapping sequential periods the first of the 58 periods is centered on 1951 jan 1 1949 dec 31 1953 while the last period is centered on 2008 jan 1 2006 dec 31 2010 we assess performance during each of these validation periods using nse of qdaily and rre from daily observed precipitation alongside observed and model simulated streamflow data pet methods and parameter sets were not mixed the remaining analyses of the model fit allow for time variant model parameters these three different analyses summarized in table 3 are in essence a series of experiments intended to elucidate how standard assumption about et modeling may influence one s interpretation of the behavior of other model variables these approaches are approach 1 a time variant approach where the same calibration method is applied to each five year period to select the parameter sets that minimize error in the runoff ratio 5 and yield high performance in terms of nse of qdaily parameters are not fixed all model parameters are varied across their feasible range for each five year period for 60 000 latin hypercube generated parameter samples this provides a direct comparison to performance of static parameter sets and provides a point of reference for assessing the influence of allowing single parameters to vary in time via approaches 2 and 3 this analysis represents the scenario where pet estimates are assumed to be accurate and uncertainties in model predictions through time are only accounted for through variations in model parameters this approach is included to represent the scenarios typically employed by other studies that have explored the time invariance of model parameters by allowing all parameters to vary through time merz et al 2011 coron et al 2014 thirel et al 2015a b no parameter values from the original calibration period 1948 1952 are kept constant through time as there were many different parameter sets that generated acceptable performance when all parameters were treated as time variant we summarized the range of results for parameter sets generating absolute rre of less than 5 in terms of the highest nse and top 25 of all nse values meeting the water balance criterion per five year period approach 2 a time invariant approach where a single parameter is allowed to vary in time while all other parameters are held constant to values obtained in the baseline fit to 1948 1952 to do this we divided the range of each parameter into 50 equal intervals between the minimum and maximum feasible values table 2 holding other parameters to values estimated during the calibration period this analysis was performed for each model parameter and for each of the ten calibrated parameter sets we selected the parameter value for each of the ten calibration sets that produced the highest nse with rre below 5 thus we end with ten parameter values corresponding to the ten originally calibrated sets per five year period approach 3 a time invariant approach where a scalar is added to pet to test if uncertainty in pet can replicate streamflow across future periods to be clear in most hydrologic models including hbv pet is usually scaled by a function f that accounts for moisture availability smoisture within hbv this is implemented using a parameter pwp that linearly limits aet based on soil moisture and pet in addition to this adjustment for moisture availability we apply a second scalar value k that varies in time t on an annual basis this reflects yet unidentified physical controls on et that are not directly quantified by standard approaches to modeling et while some models use crop coefficients that adjust for properties of specific vegetation types and for seasonal variations in crop development the scalar k is intended to more broadly capture any number of possible non soil moisture controls on et such controls are elaborated on in more detail in the discussion section thus the conversion between pet and aet as carried out in our simulations is 5 aet k t f s moisture pet within this analysis we varied the scalar k on pet between 50 of the estimated value corresponding to a parameter range between 0 5 and 1 5 we deterministically explored model performance for each five year period letting pet vary across this range holding all other model parameters to calibrated values this simulated a scenario where model parameters are time invariant and the pet estimation is assumed to be a major source of uncertainty for approaches 2 and 3 model output was simulated for 60 years at a daily time step for multiple parameter variations and for each of the ten original calibration sets for each five year period we summarize model performance in terms of nse for daily streamflow and the absolute rre to simplify our presentation of model performance across parameter sets and through time we averaged nse across each of the ten original parameter sets per five year period to demonstrate how approaches 2 and 3 altered the water balance we quantified the average percentage of five year periods where changing a single parameter value reduced rre below 5 for each of the ten parameter sets we also present the impact of these parameter changes on model predicted fluxes aet aet was summed for each five year period with results presented as a range across parameter sets per five year period finally we compared parameter values obtained via approaches 2 and 3 to climate in terms of both annual and five year average air temperature and precipitation we assessed relationships through time for all ten parameter sets the strength of linear relationships was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 and the strength of nonlinear relationships was assessed using the spearman s rank correlation coefficient 3 results 3 1 calibration period fits across pet algorithms and hydrologic models for the calibration period 1948 to 1952 we identified ten parameter sets per watershed per pet estimation algorithm with the highest nse and minimal rre table 4 calibrated sets with the oudin model produced the highest nse values median nse values with the oudin model ranges from 0 79 oswego to 0 56 cattaraugus for the calibration period we also selected the ten parameter sets per watershed per pet algorithm that had the highest nse without consideration of rre the ten best runs selected only by highest nse result in rre greater than 40 for some watershed pet model combinations table 4 indicating that a model s ability to replicate daily variability is not indicative of it s ability to correctly predict the long term water balance including rre as an additional constraint did result in slightly lower nse values with the magnitude of the differences dependent on the pet algorithm decreases in nse performance when rre is constrained are largest for the hargreaves and hamon pet methods but much smaller for the oudin method across all watersheds and both hydrologic models our finding that the oudin method produces the highest nse values across all four watersheds and both hydrologic models is consistent with prior findings oudin et al 2005b the priestley taylor method produced slightly lower values of nse followed by the hamon and hargreaves methods which corresponded to the lowest nse values within the calibration period the remainder of our results show findings for the oudin model only as this method consistently outperformed other methods in terms of nse while other methods did not show any additional ability to improve runoff ratio error while we only show this comparison during the calibration period table 4 the same relationship is found across the entire record length see supplementary material 3 2 time invariant vs time variant validation in contrast to the time invariant calibration time variant analyses approach 1 selected changing parameter sets with high performance across different periods performance for both the time variant and time invariant models were summarized in five year moving window increments in terms of the absolute rre and nse fig 2 in the genesee and cattaraugus watersheds during several periods in the record see fig 2 time invariant model calibration runs had lower model performance in terms of nse than that of the time variant model runs fig 2a on the black and oswego rivers performance for time variant and time invariant model runs was generally similar across the entire period of record thus we found that time variant parameterization sometimes resulted in stronger but more often similar model performance for different time periods for nse this suggests that time invariant parameter sets are often comparable to time variant parameter sets for replicating daily variability in stream discharge even over long periods of time these findings are in agreement with results from hartmann and bardossy 2005 and merz et al 2011 where the ability of hbv to simulate hydrology across multiple decades was also tested relaxing constraints on time variant runs to identify the top simulations with only the best nse without matching rre yielded similar levels of performance suggesting that the additional constraint on rre does not alter model performance in terms of nse see fig 3 however large deviations between the time invariant and time variant models were observed for rre when all parameters were treated as time variant approach 1 simulations of the runoff ratio had minimal error not shown conversely the time invariant approach had sizable rre fig 2b on all four rivers despite consistently having high nse values on the black and oswego rivers this indicates that the time invariant models could not correctly estimate long term changes in the water balance 3 3 time variable calibration with single parameters to test how individual parameters varying through time modified rre approach 2 we fixed all but one model parameter and then systematically changed the parameter across a physically plausible range we report the percentage of the ten calibrated parameter sets for which optimizing a single given parameter reduced the rre below 5 across all five year periods from 1951 1949 1953 through 2008 2006 2010 in the bottom portion of the table we also report the average nse achieved for each single parameter optimization table 5 we found that only certain parameters could be adjusted to improve the rre and maintain consistently high nse values as seen in table 5 these parameters included pwp fc and for some watersheds b these parameters are able to regulate the water partitioned to et by modifying the soil water threshold at which et occurs interestingly the degree day factor ddf was also able to reduce rre but to the detriment of nse varying of other parameter values was not able to reduce rre while still maintaining high nse notably nearly all parameters for which time variable calibration was useful for reducing the rre while maintaining consistently high nse were associated with model soil moisture routines 3 4 time variable calibration with a scalar on pet in place of adjusting innate model parameters in approach 3 we tested the effects of a time variable single scalar applied to estimates of potential et k eq 5 again this approach was applied to ten calibrated parameter sets obtained for each pet method and watershed for all models and pet combinations scaling pet successfully matched the water balance while retaining high nse values table 5 these nse values were again highest when pet was estimated with the oudin equation average performance with the oudin equation across all time periods and ten different parameter sets was highest for the oswego watershed nse 0 62 and lowest for the genesee watershed nse 0 45 given the ability of adjustments of et to directly modify the water balance it is not surprising that a time variable et scalar could be used to achieve low rre however it is notable that this maintenance of low rre was done with little effect on the ability to capture variations in daily flows as quantified by nse 3 5 aet process dynamics for single parameter calibration approaches an underlying question is whether time variance in different parameters has the same ultimate outcome on hydrologic fluxes thus we considered whether a time variant pwp value and a time variant pet scalar approaches 2 3 could generate similar aet values pwp was considered as it was one of three single parameter values that minimized rre table 5 other parameters such as f or b would have a similar outcome in replicating aet fig 4 displays five year averages of predicted aet for time variant pwp value and a time variant pet benchmarked against predictions assuming parameters are static the baseline approach predicts less variable aet patterns while varying either pwp or the pet scalar yields similar and more variable aet simulations specifically this indicates that changing either pwp or the pet scalar seems to have the same ultimate outcome in adjusting aet to improve the fit of the long term water balance this ability to adjust aet with innate model parameters also indicates why a scalar on pet may not have been implemented in prior studies see fig 5 however to achieve this variation in aet requires pet scalar values to vary between 0 5 and 1 5 while requiring pwp values to vary by over 100 mm plots of temporal variations in pwp and pet scalar values are included in supplementary material arguably the large temporal variability in pwp values necessary to simulate aet has no physical explanation while such processes as soil compaction erosion or accumulation of new organic matter could possibly vary pwp by small amounts over small spatial areas there are no processes that could likely cause such dramatic changes over large areas in contrast there are a number of possible processes that could lead to the variations in the pet scalars this is presented more extensively below these results indicate that while different approaches can match the long term water balance the underlying physical reasonability of the different approaches is not equivalent 3 6 parameter values and climate to assess possible relationships between climate and parameter values we regressed the best fit values for soil parameters pwp and fc and the pet scalar against annual and five year average precipitation and air temperature linear relationships between climate and parameter values were poor r2 0 2 for all combinations of parameter values and climate variables however nonlinear relationships were relatively strong for the black river and the oswego river spearman s rank correlation coefficients between five year average air temperature and parameters fc and pet were on the order of 0 40 to 0 45 black river and 0 43 to 0 52 oswego river with positive values and similar ranges for relationships between five year average air temperature and parameter pwp weaker nonlinear relationships were found between five year average precipitation and pwp fc and k for the cattaraugus river and genesee river watershed all relationships are included in supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of pet methods on model performance our calibration and validation periods compared model performance across four different pet estimation methods while many studies utilize a single method for estimating pet we found that some pet estimation schemes may outperform others in our own analysis streamflow nse was highest for the oudin method as compared to other pet approaches this was also true when all parameters were varied outside the calibration period approach 1 these findings are consistent with oudin et al 2005a b where rainfall runoff model performance for four different hydrological models was compared across 27 different pet models for several hundred catchments however high nse did not guarantee high rre indicating that the oudin method is not necessarily able to simulate long term shifts in et a logical consideration would be whether a more physically based model better accounted for shifts in et as indicated by milly and dunne 2016 net radiation has been found to be a robust measure of pet variations when compared to gcms priestly taylor is fundamentally a net radiation model relative to the temperature and hybrid models we consider but it did not provide a more robust estimation of rre in accounting for all possible external controls temperature based also did not improve rre overall this suggests that long term shifts in pet that dictate variations in rre are likely not directly related to climate forcing we do not directly test the penman monteith approach in this study largely because in the humid temperate climate of northern new york state the vapor pressure deficit is typically small and the penman monteith equation is dominated by the radiative term furthermore while studies continue to advocate that the penman monteith model may provide more physically realistic estimates of pet chen et al 2005 donohue et al 2010 mcvicar et al 2007 mcmahon et al 2013 there is a growing body of literature that suggests this may not be the case kay and davies 2008 milly and dunne 2016 schymanski and or 2017 4 2 climate controls on parameter variability to date much of the literature on parameter transferability has found strong relationships between climate and model performance and therefore model parameters for instance many studies have recognized that changes in climate may affect parameter transferability from year to year merz et al 2011 vaze et al 2010 osuch et al 2015 in particular merz et al 2011 used data from several watersheds in austria to test temporal trends in model parameters calibrated to different five year periods and found trends in parameter value variations through time we found weak but present nonlinear relationships between five year average air temperature and parameter values for watersheds located farthest north oswego river and black river and between five year average precipitation and parameter values for the genesee river and cattaraugus river watersheds these relationships suggest that climate plays a role in parameter transferability across study watersheds but the weak non linear relationships suggest that there are other time varying controls that ultimately govern the use of hydrological models to simulate long term behavior 4 3 applying a processed based interpretation to scenarios of time variant and invariant parameters several different model fitting approaches successfully simulated streamflow through time but each approach also makes different fundamental assumptions about the underlying physical processes leading to the dynamic parameter values allowing all parameters to vary for each time period gave a sense of the best possible fit that could be achieved but allowing all parameters to vary likely obscures physical controls by enabling parameters to compensate for one another through interactions as found by sensitivity analyses of lumped hydrologic models parameters are often highly interactive e g van werkhoven et al 2008 herman et al 2013 temporally varying a single model parameter through time revealed more direct controls on model function allowing a time variant soil parameter or a time variant pet scalar could improve the water budget fig 4 table 4 arguably allowing soil parameters to change in time is less physically realistic than allowing a pet scalar to change in time cases of dramatic land use change or landscape modification could justify changes to soil parameters but in most scenarios there is no way such properties could change at the decadal time scale this would be a change more on the order of thousands of years while modelers have explicitly allowed soil parameters to vary with climate westra et al 2014 pathiraja et al 2016 they acknowledge there is little physical justification and that it is instead an indicator for the need for changes to model structure thus in terms of modifying model structure we suggest that it is much more physically consistent to assume that a scalar on pet varies fundamentally this conclusion implies that the empirical equations often used to estimate potential evapotranspiration may not be sufficient for simulating catchment hydrology across decades in particular direct field measurements of vegetative water vapor exchange with the atmosphere lend support to the idea that simple et models may not be able to simulate interannual variations in et these direct measurements have typically been made using eddy flux techniques or sap flux measurements for instance studies that have looked at interannual variations in the priestly taylor alpha value wilson and baldocchi 2000 brummer et al 2012 have noted that the alpha can vary by 15 over only several years nearly equivalent to the magnitude of scaling imposed when the pet scalar was treated as time invariant while a changing priestly taylor alpha indicates gross annual changes in et it does not explain fundamental mechanisms of this temporal change other studies have worked to understand these more fundamental mechanisms some studies have sought to separate out different climate and biological controls on et stoy et al 2006 asserted that annual changes in vapor deficit as well as stomatal conductance explained intrannual variations with such variations more minimal in hard wood forest sites but large in successional grass lands and coniferous forest other studies have sought to consider finer temporal or spatial scales in terms of temporal scale very recent studies have introduced the idea that relatively infrequent but critical periods most active hours in a given year can distinguish the annual et in one year from another year zscheischler et al 2016 proposed that most active hours are often a confluence of ideal long term evolving variables e g soil moisture with ideal short term evolving variables e g radiation that can be difficult to capture at daily or greater time intervals in terms of spatial scale several studies have evaluated species specific variations in et ford et al 2011 and the effect of induced species succession on et matheny et al 2014 these studies have found sizable differences in et between species and difficulty in simulating species succession using standard model parameters such as changes in leaf area index in particular ford et al 2011 specifically note that while models can be calibrated most models will not be able to capture species changes others have looked at the influence of the time scale of growth of specific plant features such as roots on et dean et al 2016 given the known reforestation and likely tree species succession over portions of our study watersheds it is possible that changes in vegetation are part of the explanation for the time variance in the pet scalar existing field studies are still somewhat limited in revealing inter annual variations over decadal scales wilson and baldocchi 2000 was one of the first studies to examine more than intra annual variations in et looking at three years of data however examples of subsequent studies that look at interannual variations stoy et al 2006 brummer et al 2012 zscheischler et al 2016 have only used three four and seven years of data respectively not decades as eddy flux tower data sets continue to be collected and lengthened it may be possible to undertake a more direct analysis of interannual variation at a multi decadal time scale given the increasingly recognized need to reconcile modeled processes with observations e g gupta et al 2012 our analysis strongly suggests that there are still existing questions related to model structures required to adequately simulate hydrology not only under future climatic conditions but to also match historical multi decadal records this could include the combination of satellite based et products e g long et al 2014 roy et al 2017 with direct albeit small scale measurements of et via the fluxnet micrometeorology tower network e g zhou and wang 2016 we note that the ability of satellite observations to estimate et observations across longer periods of time remains untested glenn et al 2007 wang and dickinson 2012 ultimately more work is needed to understand global evaporative trends fu et al 2009 mao et al 2015 especially how they may influence the application of hydrologic models 4 4 model intercomparison and benchmarking a potential path forward for reconciling observations and model simulations could also build on several recent approaches to model intercomparison and benchmarking e g smith et al 2004 smith et al 2012 best et al 2015 clark et al 2015a b and the use of information theory to compare the information content of observations alongside different sources of model uncertainty e g ehret et al 2014 nearing and gupta 2015 nearing et al 2016 peters lidard et al 2017 these two approaches both consider how and why models may succeed or fail and assign quantitative values to these terms across different temporal and spatial scales and provide frameworks for assessing decisions made my modelers alongside added information from observations central to these efforts is benchmarking model performance prioritizing metrics observations and acceptable limits and utilizing comparisons across different model frameworks treating different structural equations as hypotheses for key processes and levels of complexity needed to realistically represent how a given system may function best et al 2015 several approaches to testing flexible model frameworks e g fenicia et al 2011 have been developed to assess how decisions regarding the mathematical descriptions of and relationships between different hydrologic processes may impact model performance and ultimately model realism clark et al 2015a b 2017 in this study we consider a small number of hypotheses applied to a conceptual model framework couched in a comparison to existing observations for four watersheds located in a similar climatic region advancing findings from this study should ultimately draw on a flexible model framework approach applied to numerous watersheds at multiple spatial scales e g peters lidard et al 2017 5 conclusions across a study of four northeast u s watersheds simulated with four pet methods we found multiple approaches could be used to achieve a high nse for daily streamflow and low error in runoff ratio when model calibration is made over decades in most prior cases in the literature parameter adjustments were only made on variables representative of innate watershed properties this presumed that precipitation and pet drivers influencing the water balance were correct in time and that errors in discharge were somehow related to temporal changes in parameters that control watershed water partitioning instead our findings show that scaling pet in time beyond that already done to account for moisture availability results in model fits as good as if hydrological model parameters are modified in time we suggest that it is physically more consistent for pet to vary in time than for innate watershed properties represented by model parameters to change in time furthermore while temporal changes to the pet scalar and changes to watershed model parameters result in near identical aet fluxes the variability in soil parameter values necessary to replicate the water balance was physically unrealistic while direct measurements of other watershed variables would be needed to entirely validate the actual behavior in these watersheds replicating behavior through use of a time variable pet scalar seems more consistent with physical expectations while choice of pet method did influence overall model performance all pet models were similarly unable to replicate reasonable values of rre when parameters were treated as time invariant we tested three different categories of pet models temperature radiation and combination models all required a time variant scaling of pet to improve rre this suggests that the time variant scalar being applied to rre is not simply scaling for dominant climate drivers and that there are other yet unidentified factors that lead to interannual variations in pet biophysics literature offers a number of observations and suggestions of other possible controls including changing atmospheric demand alongside influences from vegetation ultimately the hydrologic community has a broad need to reconcile hydrologic model deficiencies for not only improving predictability in the future but more importantly demonstration that existing models can match previously observed hydrology during the last several decades such demonstration is

7486,recent research has found that hydrologic modeling over decadal time periods often requires time variant model parameters most prior work has focused on assessing time variance in model parameters conceptualizing watershed features and functions in this paper we assess whether adding a time variant scalar to potential evapotranspiration pet can be used in place of time variant parameters using the hbv hydrologic model and four different simple but common pet methods hamon priestly taylor oudin and hargreaves we simulated 60 years of daily discharge on four rivers in new york state allowing all ten model parameters to vary in time achieved good model fits in terms of daily nse and long term water balance however allowing single model parameters to vary in time including a scalar on pet achieved nearly equivalent model fits across pet methods overall varying a pet scalar in time is likely more physically consistent with known biophysical controls on pet as compared to varying parameters conceptualizing innate watershed properties related to soil properties such as wilting point and field capacity this work suggests that the seeming need for time variance in innate watershed parameters may be due to overly simple evapotranspiration formulations that do not account for all factors controlling evapotranspiration over long time periods keywords watershed modeling evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration streamflow 1 introduction hydrologic models can be useful tools for simulating water availability and partitioning at the land surface especially for future time periods moore 1985 wagener et al 2010 in practice the accuracy of such future predictions is judged based on the ability of a model to simulate historical streamflow driven by observed meteorological inputs moore 1985 wagener et al 2001 oudin et al 2005a aghakouchek and habib 2010 while historical observations of air temperature precipitation and streamflow are abundant there is a much more limited network of direct measurements of evapotranspiration et wang and dickinson 2012 long et al 2014 as such very few studies use direct measurements of either potential et or actual et instead potential et is estimated by any number of possible equations within the hydrologic literature see oudin et al 2005b for a comprehensive list and actual et is simulated by the model as a function of model parameters and model states as governed by potential et mcmahon et al 2013 in most rainfall runoff modeling studies there is typically no evaluation of the accuracy of potential or actual et estimates instead as long as the hydrologic model is able to simulate a discharge time series with a suitable fit to observed discharge data the selected et equations are implicitly assumed to be sufficient along with the rest of the hydrologic model there have been two recent developments in the hydrology literature that suggest the sufficiency of et equations used within hydrologic models should be revisited and more carefully investigated first milly and dunne 2016 carried out a comparison of the consistency between climate model estimated et during wet conditions and standard approaches to estimating potential et pet in hydrologic models run offline to a climate model surprisingly milly and dunne 2016 found that a simple net radiation model was preferable to the penman monteith model penman 1948 monteith 1981 often considered the most physically robust of all pet model choices chen et al 2005 donohue et al 2010 mcvicar et al 2007 milly and dunne 2016 noted that the penman monteith model run offline from a gcm could not account for factors such as changes in stomatal conductance interception of water on vegetation subhourly weather variations and elevational variations in the thermodynamic gradient which were key to predicting future streamflow and estimating actual et second there has been a recognition that parameters in hydrologic models are often time dependent in relation to the climate conditions under which the model was calibrated thus parameters representing seemingly immutable physical properties e g wilting point catchment storage saturated conductivity must be treated as non constant in time to simulate streamflow under varying conditions e g hartmann and bardossy 2005 chiew et al 2009 merz et al 2011 gharari et al 2013 coron et al 2014 thirel et al 2015a however to our knowledge these studies have not considered an alternative possibility that in these conceptual representations et models may have time dependent parameters this is despite the fact that many of these studies have used relatively simple pet models such as that of oudin et al 2005a or thornthwaite 1948 that are only dependent on temperature and day of the year inconsistencies in et have likely not been thoroughly investigated because they are often difficult to detect if a modeled et estimate is incorrect it is usually not evident by only looking at the ability of a model to replicate daily flows the most typical output on which hydrologic models are calibrated instead bias in et estimates may only be apparent when looking at the long term water balance of a watershed wagener et al 2010 thirel et al 2015b while many hydrologic modeling studies have focused on shorter periods for model testing and validation e g less than 10 years a small number of studies have shown that longer periods of time on the order of 30 years e g hartmann and bardossy 2005 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2014 are necessary before bias in the water budget is apparent and distinguishable from random errors calibration may be able to limit bias over short periods of several years if controls on et remain consistent over the short calibration and validation periods only multi decadal assessment periods can objectively assess whether et models can account for slowly changing controls on et one of the few papers to broadly consider the suitability of et models using a long term water balance is oudin et al 2005b oudin et al 2005b considered whether using mean pet in hydrologic models worked as well as using a temporally varying pet calculated using a formulation such as penman monteith with comparisons presented across watersheds worldwide using validation periods of five year lengths however oudin et al 2005b focused on the comparability of the pet models to each other with less consideration of model agreement with reality indeed based on a measure of cumulative errors in the simulated long term water balance they found that simulations run using both the mean pet and penman monteith had a typical median cumulative water budget value of 88 after an approximately 5 year run implying that the long term water balance even when permitting cumulative negative and positive errors over long periods to negate was off by 12 models within the lower middle quartile could be off by 20 such known uncertainty in water yield due to et estimation even without other uncertainties e g model structure climatic drivers would limit the utility of the model in making future predictions of water availability a critical use of many hydrologic models this paper joins the collection of recent papers that evaluate the stability of model parameters over the long term however instead of only tracking variability in time of parameters that control internal partitioning within the watershed this paper seeks to treat the et formulation as an adjustable quantity scaled by its own time dependent parameter much as milly and dunne 2016 recognized limitations of the penman monteith model relative to climate model calculations of et it would not be unexpected that even simpler pet equations often used in hydrologic models also face similar or greater limitations indeed analyses of flux tower observations often present interannual variations in the priestly taylor coefficient wilson and baldocchi 2000 brummer et al 2012 often relatable in part to changes in canopy conductance most applications of simple pet models do not assume any such interannual variations exist in short the primary goal of this paper is to identify whether time variable scaling of et besides that induced by climate drivers improves discharge simulations similarly or better than allowing other model variables to vary in time variation in et over time may be driven by non climatic factors such as changes in land cover changes in vegetative response to moisture availability or climate changing co2 concentration and any number of other potential factors we suggest that it is more physically plausible for largely biological factors that control et to vary in time than for abiotic variables that quantify fundamental physical features of a watershed to vary in time this paper explores the possibility of whether the time variant watershed model parameters found when calibrations are made under differing climatic conditions may actually be more suitably explained by the possibility of overly simplistic et equations fundamentally we assess whether a time variant scalar should be applied to standard et equations to account for temporal variations in controls on et to assess we test the ability of a common conceptual hydrologic model to simulate streamflow for 60 year records over four different river systems a long period is essential as it captures long term shifts in external variables such as climate or land use that may not be evident over short time periods these shifts may be reflective of the range of conditions possibly found in future time periods several different assessment approaches are evaluated 1 no model parameters vary in time 2 all parameters are allowed to vary in time concurrently 3 single parameters related to physical features of the catchment are allowed to vary in time with all others held constant and 4 only a pet scalar is allowed to vary in time 2 methods 2 1 study watersheds the modeling analysis is carried out for four watersheds within the lake erie and lake ontario drainage table 1 and fig 1 these watersheds were selected for their long united states geological survey usgs discharge records availability of spatially averaged precipitation and temperature data input data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration great lakes environmental research laboratory noaa glerl hunter et al 2015 and because of the importance of accurately quantifying long term inputs and storage changes on the great lakes while in relatively close proximity there are differences across the watersheds the northern most black river is more snow dominated and exhibits stronger seasonality in flows the oswego river watershed includes drainage from flow regulated lakes i e the finger lakes in all four watersheds land cover includes a mix of forest and agricultural land use table 1 all watersheds are more than 40 forested have no major urban centers and have no major water diversions tree species in the black river watershed consist of northern hardwoods e g sugar maple yellow birch american beech while the other three watersheds primarily consist of oak hickory forests since satellite based land use is only available back to the 1970 s and the hydrologic records of the rivers in our study date back to the 1940 s exact changes in land use over the full study period are not known several studies in central new york state most indicative of the genesee and oswego watersheds indicate the most frequent land use change is reforestation of former agricultural fields stover and marks 1998 shaw et al 2014 this reforestation began in the 1930 s with most reforestation well underway by the middle of the twentieth century 2 2 hydrologic models this paper primarily presents analysis undertaken using a formulation of hbv bergström 1975 1992 1995 lindström et al 2005 presented in hundecha and bardossy 2004 and aghakouchak and habib 2010 however to ensure the results were not simply dependent on the chosen model a parallel analysis was also completed using the hymod hydrologic model wagener et al 2001 boyle et al 2003 kollat et al 2012 both models have similar numbers of parameters and input requirements but they have slightly different model structures particularly in regard to soil moisture accounting schemes because the results using both models were similar as a matter of brevity in presenting findings we do not show both models in the main portion of this paper instead detailed results for hymod are provided in supplementary material while hbv can be applied as a semi distributed model we implemented it as a lumped model where each study watershed was represented by a single hydrologic unit the lumped model consists of three different storage layers a soil store an upper reservoir and a lower reservoir plus the potential for water storage in a snowpack we used a formulation of hbv with ten parameters that simulates streamflow on a daily time step a temperature threshold tt partitions precipitation between rain and snow based on daily average air temperature melt from any accumulated snow occurs when air temperatures exceed tt and is governed by a degree day factor ddf relating air temperatures in excess of tt to mm of melt rain or melt enters the soil store where it may either leave via evapotranspiration move to the upper reservoir as a function of current soil storage field capacity fc and a shape parameter β or exit as overland flow directly to the stream in the soil store a threshold water level l determines the occurrence of overland flow water leaves the upper and lower reservoirs and becomes streamflow as described by three parameters representing residence times that release quickflow k0 interflow k1 and baseflow k2 water may percolate from the upper to the lower reservoir at a constant rate kp evapotranspiration only occurs from the upper soil store the soil store linearly limits potential evapotranspiration according to the ratio between a threshold parameter pwp and available soil storage when soil storage exceeds precipitation aet is equal to the potential rate pet is calculated as described below model parameters and abbreviations are described in table 2 daily average air temperature and precipitation used as model input were provided by the noaa glerl for each watershed with dataset creation described by hunter et al 2015 model simulations of streamflow are compared to daily observations of streamflow provided by the usgs we note that stream gage location and stream gage technology changes through time and is described in detail by the usgs for each stream gage while differences in technology and gage location over 60 year periods do have potential to impact data accuracy and introduce errors in the modeling process we note that the usgs post corrects all records for these changes making these datasets vetted and curated for potential data errors 2 3 potential evapotranspiration models potential evapotranspiration pet is estimated using four different methods oudin hamon hargreaves and priestly taylor while this represents just a subset of all simple pet methods in the literature these fall into the three main categories temperature based hamon radiation based priestly taylor and hybrid models hargreaves and oudin these four pet methods represent different climate drivers on pet and can provide some insight into controls on pet additionally studies have shown that hydrologic model performance may be impacted by the choice of pet estimation algorithm hence why we sought to test performance across these different methods vorosmarty et al 1998 andréassian et al 2004 the oudin method calculates pet as 1a pet 1000 r e λ ρ t 5 10 if t 5 0 1b pet 0 if t 5 0 where pet is in mm day 1 λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 ρ is the density of water kg m 3 t is air surface temperature deg c and re is daily extraterrestrial net radiation mj m 2 d 1 calculated solely from julian date and latitude dingman 2008 to calculate pet at each site we applied the latitude associated with the streamflow gaging station the oudin et al 2005a b model originated from a reanalysis of 27 different pe models applied to a large number of watersheds which concluded that streamflow simulation efficiency was highest for pe models based on temperature and radiation the hamon 1961 method calculates pet as 2 pet 29 8 h day e sat t t 273 2 t 5 10 where hday is the number of daylight hours and esat t is the saturation vapor pressure kpa as a function of the air surface temperature the hargreaves hargreaves 1975 hargreaves and samani 1982 method calculates pet using an estimate for daily extraterrestrial solar radiation and measured air temperature following 3 pet 0 0023 r e λ ρ t max t min 0 5 t 17 8 where tmax and tmin are daily maximum and minimum air temperature respectively finally the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 calculates pet using measured radiation values and air temperature in this formulation pet is calculated as 4 pet 1000 α λ ρ δ δ γ r n g where α is a coefficient describing the amount of surface moisture that could be evaporated we use a value of 1 26 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa c 1 and rn is net radiation mj m 2 d 1 net radiation is estimated by balancing net solar and net longwave radiation net solar radiation comes from ncar ncep reanalysis available at a monthly scale from 1948 to present where the monthly mean value is used for each day kalnay et al 1996 net longwave radiation is estimated using a stefan boltzmann formulation that accounts for humidity and takes both daily minimum and maximum air temperature k into account dingman 2008 within this calculation of net longwave radiation we do not directly adjust for cloud cover but assume that air temperature variations indirectly take this into account g the soil heat exchange term is considered negligible 2 4 approaches to model fitting model fitting is carried out in two ways 1 a traditional method in which the model is calibrated for a short interval and then the fitted parameters are presumed to be invariant in time and 2 a more non standard method in which parameters are allowed to be time variant a summary of the different model experiments can be found in table 3 for the traditional approach we began by calibrating the hbv models to a five year period from january 1 1948 to december 31 1952 for each watershed we randomly sampled each model parameter space 50 000 times across feasible parameter ranges table 2 and ran each model for all parameter samples using observed meteorology alongside estimates of pet from four different pet methods model performance was assessed in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient for daily discharge nse qdaily and the five year runoff ratio error rre rre was calculated by aggregating observed and simulated daily streamflow and precipitation data to a five year average rre is implicitly equal to mean error in five year aggregated streamflow just simply normalized by precipitation as precipitation is observed and does not change between model runs presenting error in rre is equivalent to presenting error in aggregated five year q we chose to present this error using runoff ratio as it inherently accounts for temporal variations in precipitation and discussion of rre focuses on secondary controls on long term q variations this baseline calibration was carried out in two ways by using nse qdaily alone and by using both nse qdaily and rre for nse qdaily and rre together we identified the ten parameter sets with the highest nse that had an rre of less than 5 error for nse qdaily alone we simply took the ten parameter sets with the highest nse we make use of ten sets instead of a single set to account for potential equifinality and uncertainty within the initial calibration period as this is likely to affect model performance during validation periods once calibrated to the baseline period the parameter sets were then validated across the remainder of the study period as calibration was for a five year period centered on 1950 jan 1 1948 dec 31 1952 validation is assessed within a five year moving window for 58 different but overlapping sequential periods the first of the 58 periods is centered on 1951 jan 1 1949 dec 31 1953 while the last period is centered on 2008 jan 1 2006 dec 31 2010 we assess performance during each of these validation periods using nse of qdaily and rre from daily observed precipitation alongside observed and model simulated streamflow data pet methods and parameter sets were not mixed the remaining analyses of the model fit allow for time variant model parameters these three different analyses summarized in table 3 are in essence a series of experiments intended to elucidate how standard assumption about et modeling may influence one s interpretation of the behavior of other model variables these approaches are approach 1 a time variant approach where the same calibration method is applied to each five year period to select the parameter sets that minimize error in the runoff ratio 5 and yield high performance in terms of nse of qdaily parameters are not fixed all model parameters are varied across their feasible range for each five year period for 60 000 latin hypercube generated parameter samples this provides a direct comparison to performance of static parameter sets and provides a point of reference for assessing the influence of allowing single parameters to vary in time via approaches 2 and 3 this analysis represents the scenario where pet estimates are assumed to be accurate and uncertainties in model predictions through time are only accounted for through variations in model parameters this approach is included to represent the scenarios typically employed by other studies that have explored the time invariance of model parameters by allowing all parameters to vary through time merz et al 2011 coron et al 2014 thirel et al 2015a b no parameter values from the original calibration period 1948 1952 are kept constant through time as there were many different parameter sets that generated acceptable performance when all parameters were treated as time variant we summarized the range of results for parameter sets generating absolute rre of less than 5 in terms of the highest nse and top 25 of all nse values meeting the water balance criterion per five year period approach 2 a time invariant approach where a single parameter is allowed to vary in time while all other parameters are held constant to values obtained in the baseline fit to 1948 1952 to do this we divided the range of each parameter into 50 equal intervals between the minimum and maximum feasible values table 2 holding other parameters to values estimated during the calibration period this analysis was performed for each model parameter and for each of the ten calibrated parameter sets we selected the parameter value for each of the ten calibration sets that produced the highest nse with rre below 5 thus we end with ten parameter values corresponding to the ten originally calibrated sets per five year period approach 3 a time invariant approach where a scalar is added to pet to test if uncertainty in pet can replicate streamflow across future periods to be clear in most hydrologic models including hbv pet is usually scaled by a function f that accounts for moisture availability smoisture within hbv this is implemented using a parameter pwp that linearly limits aet based on soil moisture and pet in addition to this adjustment for moisture availability we apply a second scalar value k that varies in time t on an annual basis this reflects yet unidentified physical controls on et that are not directly quantified by standard approaches to modeling et while some models use crop coefficients that adjust for properties of specific vegetation types and for seasonal variations in crop development the scalar k is intended to more broadly capture any number of possible non soil moisture controls on et such controls are elaborated on in more detail in the discussion section thus the conversion between pet and aet as carried out in our simulations is 5 aet k t f s moisture pet within this analysis we varied the scalar k on pet between 50 of the estimated value corresponding to a parameter range between 0 5 and 1 5 we deterministically explored model performance for each five year period letting pet vary across this range holding all other model parameters to calibrated values this simulated a scenario where model parameters are time invariant and the pet estimation is assumed to be a major source of uncertainty for approaches 2 and 3 model output was simulated for 60 years at a daily time step for multiple parameter variations and for each of the ten original calibration sets for each five year period we summarize model performance in terms of nse for daily streamflow and the absolute rre to simplify our presentation of model performance across parameter sets and through time we averaged nse across each of the ten original parameter sets per five year period to demonstrate how approaches 2 and 3 altered the water balance we quantified the average percentage of five year periods where changing a single parameter value reduced rre below 5 for each of the ten parameter sets we also present the impact of these parameter changes on model predicted fluxes aet aet was summed for each five year period with results presented as a range across parameter sets per five year period finally we compared parameter values obtained via approaches 2 and 3 to climate in terms of both annual and five year average air temperature and precipitation we assessed relationships through time for all ten parameter sets the strength of linear relationships was assessed using the coefficient of determination r2 and the strength of nonlinear relationships was assessed using the spearman s rank correlation coefficient 3 results 3 1 calibration period fits across pet algorithms and hydrologic models for the calibration period 1948 to 1952 we identified ten parameter sets per watershed per pet estimation algorithm with the highest nse and minimal rre table 4 calibrated sets with the oudin model produced the highest nse values median nse values with the oudin model ranges from 0 79 oswego to 0 56 cattaraugus for the calibration period we also selected the ten parameter sets per watershed per pet algorithm that had the highest nse without consideration of rre the ten best runs selected only by highest nse result in rre greater than 40 for some watershed pet model combinations table 4 indicating that a model s ability to replicate daily variability is not indicative of it s ability to correctly predict the long term water balance including rre as an additional constraint did result in slightly lower nse values with the magnitude of the differences dependent on the pet algorithm decreases in nse performance when rre is constrained are largest for the hargreaves and hamon pet methods but much smaller for the oudin method across all watersheds and both hydrologic models our finding that the oudin method produces the highest nse values across all four watersheds and both hydrologic models is consistent with prior findings oudin et al 2005b the priestley taylor method produced slightly lower values of nse followed by the hamon and hargreaves methods which corresponded to the lowest nse values within the calibration period the remainder of our results show findings for the oudin model only as this method consistently outperformed other methods in terms of nse while other methods did not show any additional ability to improve runoff ratio error while we only show this comparison during the calibration period table 4 the same relationship is found across the entire record length see supplementary material 3 2 time invariant vs time variant validation in contrast to the time invariant calibration time variant analyses approach 1 selected changing parameter sets with high performance across different periods performance for both the time variant and time invariant models were summarized in five year moving window increments in terms of the absolute rre and nse fig 2 in the genesee and cattaraugus watersheds during several periods in the record see fig 2 time invariant model calibration runs had lower model performance in terms of nse than that of the time variant model runs fig 2a on the black and oswego rivers performance for time variant and time invariant model runs was generally similar across the entire period of record thus we found that time variant parameterization sometimes resulted in stronger but more often similar model performance for different time periods for nse this suggests that time invariant parameter sets are often comparable to time variant parameter sets for replicating daily variability in stream discharge even over long periods of time these findings are in agreement with results from hartmann and bardossy 2005 and merz et al 2011 where the ability of hbv to simulate hydrology across multiple decades was also tested relaxing constraints on time variant runs to identify the top simulations with only the best nse without matching rre yielded similar levels of performance suggesting that the additional constraint on rre does not alter model performance in terms of nse see fig 3 however large deviations between the time invariant and time variant models were observed for rre when all parameters were treated as time variant approach 1 simulations of the runoff ratio had minimal error not shown conversely the time invariant approach had sizable rre fig 2b on all four rivers despite consistently having high nse values on the black and oswego rivers this indicates that the time invariant models could not correctly estimate long term changes in the water balance 3 3 time variable calibration with single parameters to test how individual parameters varying through time modified rre approach 2 we fixed all but one model parameter and then systematically changed the parameter across a physically plausible range we report the percentage of the ten calibrated parameter sets for which optimizing a single given parameter reduced the rre below 5 across all five year periods from 1951 1949 1953 through 2008 2006 2010 in the bottom portion of the table we also report the average nse achieved for each single parameter optimization table 5 we found that only certain parameters could be adjusted to improve the rre and maintain consistently high nse values as seen in table 5 these parameters included pwp fc and for some watersheds b these parameters are able to regulate the water partitioned to et by modifying the soil water threshold at which et occurs interestingly the degree day factor ddf was also able to reduce rre but to the detriment of nse varying of other parameter values was not able to reduce rre while still maintaining high nse notably nearly all parameters for which time variable calibration was useful for reducing the rre while maintaining consistently high nse were associated with model soil moisture routines 3 4 time variable calibration with a scalar on pet in place of adjusting innate model parameters in approach 3 we tested the effects of a time variable single scalar applied to estimates of potential et k eq 5 again this approach was applied to ten calibrated parameter sets obtained for each pet method and watershed for all models and pet combinations scaling pet successfully matched the water balance while retaining high nse values table 5 these nse values were again highest when pet was estimated with the oudin equation average performance with the oudin equation across all time periods and ten different parameter sets was highest for the oswego watershed nse 0 62 and lowest for the genesee watershed nse 0 45 given the ability of adjustments of et to directly modify the water balance it is not surprising that a time variable et scalar could be used to achieve low rre however it is notable that this maintenance of low rre was done with little effect on the ability to capture variations in daily flows as quantified by nse 3 5 aet process dynamics for single parameter calibration approaches an underlying question is whether time variance in different parameters has the same ultimate outcome on hydrologic fluxes thus we considered whether a time variant pwp value and a time variant pet scalar approaches 2 3 could generate similar aet values pwp was considered as it was one of three single parameter values that minimized rre table 5 other parameters such as f or b would have a similar outcome in replicating aet fig 4 displays five year averages of predicted aet for time variant pwp value and a time variant pet benchmarked against predictions assuming parameters are static the baseline approach predicts less variable aet patterns while varying either pwp or the pet scalar yields similar and more variable aet simulations specifically this indicates that changing either pwp or the pet scalar seems to have the same ultimate outcome in adjusting aet to improve the fit of the long term water balance this ability to adjust aet with innate model parameters also indicates why a scalar on pet may not have been implemented in prior studies see fig 5 however to achieve this variation in aet requires pet scalar values to vary between 0 5 and 1 5 while requiring pwp values to vary by over 100 mm plots of temporal variations in pwp and pet scalar values are included in supplementary material arguably the large temporal variability in pwp values necessary to simulate aet has no physical explanation while such processes as soil compaction erosion or accumulation of new organic matter could possibly vary pwp by small amounts over small spatial areas there are no processes that could likely cause such dramatic changes over large areas in contrast there are a number of possible processes that could lead to the variations in the pet scalars this is presented more extensively below these results indicate that while different approaches can match the long term water balance the underlying physical reasonability of the different approaches is not equivalent 3 6 parameter values and climate to assess possible relationships between climate and parameter values we regressed the best fit values for soil parameters pwp and fc and the pet scalar against annual and five year average precipitation and air temperature linear relationships between climate and parameter values were poor r2 0 2 for all combinations of parameter values and climate variables however nonlinear relationships were relatively strong for the black river and the oswego river spearman s rank correlation coefficients between five year average air temperature and parameters fc and pet were on the order of 0 40 to 0 45 black river and 0 43 to 0 52 oswego river with positive values and similar ranges for relationships between five year average air temperature and parameter pwp weaker nonlinear relationships were found between five year average precipitation and pwp fc and k for the cattaraugus river and genesee river watershed all relationships are included in supplementary material 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of pet methods on model performance our calibration and validation periods compared model performance across four different pet estimation methods while many studies utilize a single method for estimating pet we found that some pet estimation schemes may outperform others in our own analysis streamflow nse was highest for the oudin method as compared to other pet approaches this was also true when all parameters were varied outside the calibration period approach 1 these findings are consistent with oudin et al 2005a b where rainfall runoff model performance for four different hydrological models was compared across 27 different pet models for several hundred catchments however high nse did not guarantee high rre indicating that the oudin method is not necessarily able to simulate long term shifts in et a logical consideration would be whether a more physically based model better accounted for shifts in et as indicated by milly and dunne 2016 net radiation has been found to be a robust measure of pet variations when compared to gcms priestly taylor is fundamentally a net radiation model relative to the temperature and hybrid models we consider but it did not provide a more robust estimation of rre in accounting for all possible external controls temperature based also did not improve rre overall this suggests that long term shifts in pet that dictate variations in rre are likely not directly related to climate forcing we do not directly test the penman monteith approach in this study largely because in the humid temperate climate of northern new york state the vapor pressure deficit is typically small and the penman monteith equation is dominated by the radiative term furthermore while studies continue to advocate that the penman monteith model may provide more physically realistic estimates of pet chen et al 2005 donohue et al 2010 mcvicar et al 2007 mcmahon et al 2013 there is a growing body of literature that suggests this may not be the case kay and davies 2008 milly and dunne 2016 schymanski and or 2017 4 2 climate controls on parameter variability to date much of the literature on parameter transferability has found strong relationships between climate and model performance and therefore model parameters for instance many studies have recognized that changes in climate may affect parameter transferability from year to year merz et al 2011 vaze et al 2010 osuch et al 2015 in particular merz et al 2011 used data from several watersheds in austria to test temporal trends in model parameters calibrated to different five year periods and found trends in parameter value variations through time we found weak but present nonlinear relationships between five year average air temperature and parameter values for watersheds located farthest north oswego river and black river and between five year average precipitation and parameter values for the genesee river and cattaraugus river watersheds these relationships suggest that climate plays a role in parameter transferability across study watersheds but the weak non linear relationships suggest that there are other time varying controls that ultimately govern the use of hydrological models to simulate long term behavior 4 3 applying a processed based interpretation to scenarios of time variant and invariant parameters several different model fitting approaches successfully simulated streamflow through time but each approach also makes different fundamental assumptions about the underlying physical processes leading to the dynamic parameter values allowing all parameters to vary for each time period gave a sense of the best possible fit that could be achieved but allowing all parameters to vary likely obscures physical controls by enabling parameters to compensate for one another through interactions as found by sensitivity analyses of lumped hydrologic models parameters are often highly interactive e g van werkhoven et al 2008 herman et al 2013 temporally varying a single model parameter through time revealed more direct controls on model function allowing a time variant soil parameter or a time variant pet scalar could improve the water budget fig 4 table 4 arguably allowing soil parameters to change in time is less physically realistic than allowing a pet scalar to change in time cases of dramatic land use change or landscape modification could justify changes to soil parameters but in most scenarios there is no way such properties could change at the decadal time scale this would be a change more on the order of thousands of years while modelers have explicitly allowed soil parameters to vary with climate westra et al 2014 pathiraja et al 2016 they acknowledge there is little physical justification and that it is instead an indicator for the need for changes to model structure thus in terms of modifying model structure we suggest that it is much more physically consistent to assume that a scalar on pet varies fundamentally this conclusion implies that the empirical equations often used to estimate potential evapotranspiration may not be sufficient for simulating catchment hydrology across decades in particular direct field measurements of vegetative water vapor exchange with the atmosphere lend support to the idea that simple et models may not be able to simulate interannual variations in et these direct measurements have typically been made using eddy flux techniques or sap flux measurements for instance studies that have looked at interannual variations in the priestly taylor alpha value wilson and baldocchi 2000 brummer et al 2012 have noted that the alpha can vary by 15 over only several years nearly equivalent to the magnitude of scaling imposed when the pet scalar was treated as time invariant while a changing priestly taylor alpha indicates gross annual changes in et it does not explain fundamental mechanisms of this temporal change other studies have worked to understand these more fundamental mechanisms some studies have sought to separate out different climate and biological controls on et stoy et al 2006 asserted that annual changes in vapor deficit as well as stomatal conductance explained intrannual variations with such variations more minimal in hard wood forest sites but large in successional grass lands and coniferous forest other studies have sought to consider finer temporal or spatial scales in terms of temporal scale very recent studies have introduced the idea that relatively infrequent but critical periods most active hours in a given year can distinguish the annual et in one year from another year zscheischler et al 2016 proposed that most active hours are often a confluence of ideal long term evolving variables e g soil moisture with ideal short term evolving variables e g radiation that can be difficult to capture at daily or greater time intervals in terms of spatial scale several studies have evaluated species specific variations in et ford et al 2011 and the effect of induced species succession on et matheny et al 2014 these studies have found sizable differences in et between species and difficulty in simulating species succession using standard model parameters such as changes in leaf area index in particular ford et al 2011 specifically note that while models can be calibrated most models will not be able to capture species changes others have looked at the influence of the time scale of growth of specific plant features such as roots on et dean et al 2016 given the known reforestation and likely tree species succession over portions of our study watersheds it is possible that changes in vegetation are part of the explanation for the time variance in the pet scalar existing field studies are still somewhat limited in revealing inter annual variations over decadal scales wilson and baldocchi 2000 was one of the first studies to examine more than intra annual variations in et looking at three years of data however examples of subsequent studies that look at interannual variations stoy et al 2006 brummer et al 2012 zscheischler et al 2016 have only used three four and seven years of data respectively not decades as eddy flux tower data sets continue to be collected and lengthened it may be possible to undertake a more direct analysis of interannual variation at a multi decadal time scale given the increasingly recognized need to reconcile modeled processes with observations e g gupta et al 2012 our analysis strongly suggests that there are still existing questions related to model structures required to adequately simulate hydrology not only under future climatic conditions but to also match historical multi decadal records this could include the combination of satellite based et products e g long et al 2014 roy et al 2017 with direct albeit small scale measurements of et via the fluxnet micrometeorology tower network e g zhou and wang 2016 we note that the ability of satellite observations to estimate et observations across longer periods of time remains untested glenn et al 2007 wang and dickinson 2012 ultimately more work is needed to understand global evaporative trends fu et al 2009 mao et al 2015 especially how they may influence the application of hydrologic models 4 4 model intercomparison and benchmarking a potential path forward for reconciling observations and model simulations could also build on several recent approaches to model intercomparison and benchmarking e g smith et al 2004 smith et al 2012 best et al 2015 clark et al 2015a b and the use of information theory to compare the information content of observations alongside different sources of model uncertainty e g ehret et al 2014 nearing and gupta 2015 nearing et al 2016 peters lidard et al 2017 these two approaches both consider how and why models may succeed or fail and assign quantitative values to these terms across different temporal and spatial scales and provide frameworks for assessing decisions made my modelers alongside added information from observations central to these efforts is benchmarking model performance prioritizing metrics observations and acceptable limits and utilizing comparisons across different model frameworks treating different structural equations as hypotheses for key processes and levels of complexity needed to realistically represent how a given system may function best et al 2015 several approaches to testing flexible model frameworks e g fenicia et al 2011 have been developed to assess how decisions regarding the mathematical descriptions of and relationships between different hydrologic processes may impact model performance and ultimately model realism clark et al 2015a b 2017 in this study we consider a small number of hypotheses applied to a conceptual model framework couched in a comparison to existing observations for four watersheds located in a similar climatic region advancing findings from this study should ultimately draw on a flexible model framework approach applied to numerous watersheds at multiple spatial scales e g peters lidard et al 2017 5 conclusions across a study of four northeast u s watersheds simulated with four pet methods we found multiple approaches could be used to achieve a high nse for daily streamflow and low error in runoff ratio when model calibration is made over decades in most prior cases in the literature parameter adjustments were only made on variables representative of innate watershed properties this presumed that precipitation and pet drivers influencing the water balance were correct in time and that errors in discharge were somehow related to temporal changes in parameters that control watershed water partitioning instead our findings show that scaling pet in time beyond that already done to account for moisture availability results in model fits as good as if hydrological model parameters are modified in time we suggest that it is physically more consistent for pet to vary in time than for innate watershed properties represented by model parameters to change in time furthermore while temporal changes to the pet scalar and changes to watershed model parameters result in near identical aet fluxes the variability in soil parameter values necessary to replicate the water balance was physically unrealistic while direct measurements of other watershed variables would be needed to entirely validate the actual behavior in these watersheds replicating behavior through use of a time variable pet scalar seems more consistent with physical expectations while choice of pet method did influence overall model performance all pet models were similarly unable to replicate reasonable values of rre when parameters were treated as time invariant we tested three different categories of pet models temperature radiation and combination models all required a time variant scaling of pet to improve rre this suggests that the time variant scalar being applied to rre is not simply scaling for dominant climate drivers and that there are other yet unidentified factors that lead to interannual variations in pet biophysics literature offers a number of observations and suggestions of other possible controls including changing atmospheric demand alongside influences from vegetation ultimately the hydrologic community has a broad need to reconcile hydrologic model deficiencies for not only improving predictability in the future but more importantly demonstration that existing models can match previously observed hydrology during the last several decades such demonstration is

7487,streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing of mountain rivers are susceptible to climate change trends and variability in streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in four mountain basins in the southern tianshan were analyzed in this study streamflow trends were detected by mann kendall tests and changes in snowmelt runoff timing were analyzed based on the winter spring snowmelt runoff center time wsct pearson s correlation coefficient was further calculated to analyze the relationships between climate variables streamflow and wsct annual streamflow increased significantly in past decades in the southern tianshan especially in spring and winter months however the relations between streamflow and temperature precipitation depend on the different streamflow generation processes annual precipitation plays a vital role in controlling recharge in the toxkon basin while the kaidu and huangshuigou basins are governed by both precipitation and temperature seasonally temperature has a strong effect on streamflow in autumn and winter while summer streamflow appears more sensitive to changes in precipitation however temperature is the dominant factor for streamflow in the glacierized kunmalik basin at annual and seasonal scales an uptrend in streamflow begins in the 1990s at both annual and seasonal scales which is generally consistent with temperature and precipitation fluctuations average wsct dates in the kaidu and huangshuigou basins are earlier than in the toxkon and kunmalik basins and shifted towards earlier dates since the mid 1980s in all the basins it is plausible that wsct dates are more sensitive to warmer temperature in spring period compared to precipitation except for the huangshuigou basin taken together these findings are useful for applications in flood risk regulation future hydropower projects and integrated water resources management keywords climate change winter spring snowmelt runoff time wsct tarim basin central asia 1 introduction snowmelt contributes substantially to the springtime runoff and streamflow in mountain regions with colder climates the timing and volume of snowmelt runoff and streamflow can be particularly sensitive to climate change barnett et al 2005 stewart et al 2004 clow 2010 viviroli et al 2011 leppi et al 2012 the rivers flowing from the tianshan mountains known as the water towerofcentral asia are an important freshwater source for central asia sorg et al 2012 chen et al 2016a b additionally the snowmelt in the tianshan mountains as in other cold mountain regions contributes substantially to the springtime runoff and streamflow portions of the regional water balance chen et al 2016b average temperature and precipitation have been increasing over recent decades in northwestern china where the tianshan mountains are located xu et al 2004 chen et al 2006 kong and pang 2012 as precipitation influences streamflow directly while temperature mainly affects evapotranspiration snow glacier melt and the form rain or snow of precipitation singh and singh 2001 molini et al 2011 warmer and wetter conditions may result in an accelerated and unstable regional hydrological cycle in this semiarid region shen and chen 2010 chen 2014 streamflow variability is therefore remarkably important for studying the impacts of climate change streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in the tianshan mountains are expected to change under a changing climate streamflow experienced a remarkable increase with climate warming chen et al 2009 2013 liu et al 2011 which combined with glacier shrinkage leads to a significant increase in streamflow volume and earlier snowmelt runoff in the urumqi basin sun et al 2015 according to model simulations the timing of snowmelt runoff is projected to shift earlier due to temperature increase in spring wang et al 2010 liu et al 2011 however the impacts of climate change on streamflow differ in different basins the xinjiang province portion of the tianshan mountains in china runs from west to east around 1700 km long and therefore intercepts moist air coming from the westerlies and results in unevenly distributed precipitation and water resources chen 2014 the northern and western slopes of the tianshan receive more precipitation than the southern and eastern parts xu et al 2010 while temperature on the southern slopes is higher than on the northern slopes shen et al 2016 the climate related impacts on streamflow are even more complex in glacierized catchments for instance streamflow change in the kaidu basin in summer is mainly attributed to changes in mountain precipitation deng et al 2015 while temperature dominates streamflow changes in the highly glacierized kunmalik basin kundzewicz et al 2015 generally the distribution of streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing are undergoing significant changes due to climate variability which motivates the need to identify the streamflow variability and snowmelt runoff timing in meltwater dependent basins changes in streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing have become evident in other regions in recent decades global streamflow has tended to increase in the warming climate labat et al 2004 in addition streamflow increases have been projected due to increased temperature and precipitation in a glacierized river basin in nepal immerzeel et al 2012 quantified by means of center of volume date ct and spring pulse onset streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing were shifted earlier due to temperature increase in new england hodgkins et al 2003 and colorado clow 2010 these changes are also observed in western north america and eurasian arctic rivers stewart et al 2004 2005 cayan et al 2001 tan et al 2011 based on gcm models the projected streamflow in quebec canada is expected to increase in winter and decrease in spring boyer et al 2010 taken together changes in streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing are important indicators of climate related changes hodgkins et al 2003 however climate change and its impacts on streamflow are still poorly described especially with respect to snowmelt runoff changes in glacierized catchments in the tianshan mountains chen et al 2016b currently not much research in the tianshan mountains focuses on the streamflow variability at the basin scale while much of the recent work has focused on large regional areas shi et al 2007 chen et al 2009 tao et al 2011 xu et al 2010 wang et al 2013 therefore it is not well known how changes in climate might impact streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in different basins of the tianshan mountains to improve our general understanding of the impacts of climate change the knowledge of seasonal relationships between hydro meteorological variables at the basin scale must be improved this study therefore seeks to estimate the trends and variability of streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in four mountain basins in the southern tianshan from west to east and their possible sensitivity to climate change the objectives are 1 to estimate annual seasonal and monthly historical streamflow characteristics in four glacierized basins in the tianshan mountains 2 to characterize possible changes in snowmelt runoff timing 3 to obtain insights into hydrological processes and to identify the relationships between hydrological changes associated with climate variables 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area four glacierized basins toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou respectively in the southern tianshan were chosen based on the location and data availability fig 1 and table 1 mean elevations of the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins are 3634 3707 3008 and 2840 m above sea level a s l respectively the toxkon and kunmalik basins drain approximately 19 166 and 12 816 km2 upstream from the shaliguilanke and xiehela stations table 1 they are the main headwater subcatchments of the aksu river which is the main tributary of the tarim basin accounting for about 80 of its annual streamflow in addition approximately 4 and 20 of the toxkon and kunmalik basins respectively are glacierized doris et al 2016 the kaidu and huangshuigou basins are located in the central southern part of the tianshan mountains and cover 18 649 and 4298 km2 upstream from the dashankou and huangshuigou gauge stations streamflow from the kaidu and huangshuigou basins finally arrive at bosten lake which is another important water source for the tarim basin the basins are characterized by a continental semiarid climate mean annual streamflow in the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins are 148 381 189 and 69 mm year respectively table 1 temperature and precipitation from aphrodite see the data section are highly heterogeneous due to large elevational gradients and complex topography the kaidu basin has the coldest winters mean winter temperature 20 4 c followed by the kunmalik 17 2 c huangshuigou 15 8 c and toxkon 15 2 c basins fig 2 the highest mean summer temperature is found in the huangshuigou basin 10 4 c average summer temperatures in the toxkon kunmalik and kaidu basins are 9 3 6 9 and 9 2 c respectively generally temperature in winter is more variable than in summer while the opposite holds true for precipitation fig 2 winter is the driest season for all the basins 15 23 11 and 6 mm for the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins respectively precipitation mainly occurs in summer 115 152 138 and 127 mm for the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins moreover average precipitation in spring is higher in the toxkon and kunmalik 65 and 79 mm than the kaidu and huangshuigou 37 and 30 mm respectively basins 2 2 data streamflow gauge data were obtained from the hydrology andwater resourcesbureau of xinjiang four stations with daily streamflow data are available in the tianshan mountains the gauge locations are shown in fig 1 and the corresponding summary information is listed in table 1 the streamflow data cover a period of more than 30 years and all the data were strictly checked for homogeneity there are a few days of missing data 1 of the daily values for the daily streamflow in the shaliguilanke xiehela and huangshuigou stations however monthly data are available we interpolated the missing data using linear regression with neighboring data although uncertainties remain we assume that they won t have much influence on the trend detection there is only one observation station in each basin which cannot represent the spatial climate for the whole basin therefore time series of mean temperature and precipitation data within these basins were extracted form aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources gridded data yatagai et al 2012 aphrodite covers time span more than 45 years 1951 2007 for precipitation and 1961 2007 for temperature and it features a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 aphrodite is an interpolated dataset that can provides a basic description for the local climate and has been widely applied in central asia immerzeel et al 2015 shea et al 2015 krysanova et al 2015 climate stations are sparse in the tianshan mountains and most of the stations are located in the valley aphrodite may therefore underestimate the mountain precipitation due to the high orographic influence of the tianshan mountains however in terms of analyzing the streamflow and climate change variability the trend of climate and their relationship with discharge can also give valuable information we acknowledge that uncertainties related to the representation of climate in mountain areas remain the river basins were delineated by using hydrosheds elevation data approx 90 m 90 m resolution lehner et al 2008 2 3 methods temporal trends of streamflow were evaluated using non parametric mann kendall tests mann 1945 kendall 1975 at annual and monthly scales for each basin sen s slope sen 1968 was applied to analyze the linear rate of change to reduce the expected proportion of false discoveries that may occur by chance alone an adjustment for multiple comparisons was conducted by using the benjamini hochberg procedure benjamini and hochberg 1995 the false discovery rate was controlled at a level of 0 05 i e it is expected that no more than 5 of all null hypotheses rejected in this study were incorrectly rejected all statistical analyses were performed using r r core team 2016 snowmelt runoff timing was carried out using the theory of the center of mass of flow ct which is a flow weighted timing that represents the center of mass of the streamflow curve stewart et al 2004 ct is not necessarily related to the actual snowmelt timing but the change of ct can present as evidence for observed earlier actual melting stewart et al 2005 as most precipitation in the tianshan mountains falls in summer to avoid the impact of largeamounts of seasonal rainfall to the flow weight we computed ct only for the winter spring period january 1st to may 31st when streamflow is snowmelt dominated thus the annual winter spring snowmelt runoff center time wsct was calculated from wsct t i q i q i where ti is time in months or days from the beginning of the year january 1st qi is the corresponding streamflow for month i or day i therefore wsct is a date which is given in months or days and smoothed by locally weighted regression loess cleveland and devlin 1988 the correlations between streamflow wsct temperature and precipitation were furthermore measured using pearson s correlation coefficient r 3 results 3 1 trends and variability of streamflow annual streamflow showed an increasing trend in four basins in past decades based on the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator 9 29 14 35 18 02 and 4 34 mm per decade for the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins respectively however the streamflow increase was more strongly significant in the winter and spring months from november to march in four basins table 2 fig 4 seasonally streamflow amounts of the toxkon and kaidu basins appear to increase in every season while there are no significant trends in streamflow in the kunmalik and huangshuigou basins in summer and autumn respectively annual streamflow is expected to show the largest increase from the mid 1990s for each basin fig 3 seasonal patterns of streamflow are generally similar to the change patterns of annual streamflow that also increased since the early 1990s in terms of the cumulative anomalies fig 4 however seasonal changes are more variable in spring than changes for other seasons as well as at the annual scale 3 2 streamflow links with temperature and precipitation changes in streamflow at annual and seasonal scales can be linked to the variations of temperature and precipitation annual temperature increased significantly in all basins 0 2 0 5 0 5 c per decade for the kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins except for the toxkon basin seasonally temperature in autumn and winter has significantly increased in all the basins table 3 however only temperature in the kaidu basin rose significantly in all the seasons precipitation tended to increase in all basins but with more uncertainty as a significant trend was only detected in the huangshuigou basin table 3 winter precipitation increased significantly in all the basins except for the toxkon basin however annual streamflow increased substantially since the mid 1990s which very likely coincides with change patterns of annual precipitation and temperature annual temperature and precipitation also showed significant positive trends since the 1990s fig 3 seasonal change patterns of temperature and precipitation were also estimated based on the seasonal cumulative anomaly of temperature and precipitation figure s1 and s2 in supporting information we found consistent evidence that seasonal temperature had a steep change after the mid 1990s however seasonal precipitation is more variable than temperature average precipitation and temperature were compiled at annual and seasonal scales to identify the relationship between streamflow and climate variables table 4 annual and summer streamflows have a positive relation with precipitation in all the basins except for the glacierized kunmalik basin there has been no consistent relationship between streamflow and precipitation in the other seasons temperature has a significant positive relation with autumn and winter streamflow in the toxkon kaidu and huangshuigou basins however streamflow in the glacierized kunmalik basin generally has a significant relationship with temperature at annual and seasonal scales 3 3 changes of snowmelt runoff timing long term changes in wsct showed no significant trend based on the mann kendall tests except for the kaidu basin 3 4 days decade p 01 whose significant negative trend may have been enhanced by the short data period from west to east wsct shifts towards earlier dates average wsct during the study period for the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins are julian day 111 98 94 and 87 respectively a general nonlinear pattern was apparent according to which the wsct dates rose first and then decreased after mid 1980s based on the loess smooth line fig 5 all the gauge stations show consistent fluctuations in wsct which indicates earlier snowmelt runoff timing and increased winter spring runoff table 2 wsct shifted toward earlier dates after the mid 1980s 11 days julian day range 103 114 in the toxkon basin 5 days 94 99 in the kunmalik basin 8 days 88 97 in the kaidu basin and 8 days 82 90 in the huangshuigou basin respectively 3 4 relations of wsct to temperature and precipitation changes in wsct may be additional indicators of changing precipitation and temperature rivers that originate from the tianshan mountains are mainly supplied by precipitation and meltwater from snow and glaciers correlations between monthly precipitation and temperature with wsct dates were therefore explored table 5 there was no significant relationship between wsct dates and precipitation in the toxkon basin however average precipitation was found to have weak but significant positive correlation with wsct dates in may r 0 39 p 02 in the kaidu basin and in march r 0 37 p 01 in the huangshuigou basin nevertheless the strongest correlation between wsct dates and temperature in the toxkon basin was found in the period of february to april r 0 46 p 01 the strongest correlation between wsct dates and temperature in the kaidu basin was found in the period of march to april r 0 66 p 001 while no significant relationships were found in the huangshuigou basin however wsct dates were found to have a negative relationship with precipitation in the period of january to april r 0 34 p 02 and a positive relationship with temperature in may r 0 59 p 001 in the kunmalik basin 4 discussion the relationships between streamflow on the one side and temperature and precipitation on the other side vary among the basins at annual and seasonal scales which may be due to different streamflow generation processes basins in mountain areas are mainly recharged by both precipitation and meltwater as is the case in the kaidu and huangshuigou basins zhou et al 2016 however large amounts of precipitation are stored in the form of snow or glaciers in the strongly glacierized kunmalik basin streamflow is therefore highly dependent on temperature controlled snow and glacier meltwater krysanova et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2015 doris et al 2016 the toxkon basin has less glacier area and relatively lower elevation compare to the kunmalik basin which leads to a faster response of streamflow to precipitation krysanova et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2015 precipitation accumulated in winter as snow will be released as meltwater in the later warmer months thus increased winter precipitation and temperature can possibly explain the positive trends in streamflow in winter and spring tables 3 and 4 nevertheless owing to high glacier coverage in the kunmalik basin streamflow is generally more affected by temperature variability in any season streamflow increased more obviously in these four basins after the 1990s which further confirmed that streamflow is highly affected by the warmer temperature and higher precipitation in this period this result is consistent with previous research chen et al 2009 xu et al 2010 tao et al 2011 wang et al 2013 the atmospheric water vapor content which increased in the 1990s together with the intensified water cycle caused by global warming could further have strengthened the streamflow variability shi et al 2007 chen et al 2008 however the mechanisms behind the abrupt changes need further research changes in snowmelt runoff timing provide another indication that streamflow are susceptible to climate fluctuation in the tianshan mountains average snowmelt runoff timing in the western basins is later than in the eastern basins this finding may demonstrate that the toxkon and kunmalik basins are more influenced by the westerlies chen 2014 while the kaidu and huangshuifou basins are located in central xinjiang where the climate is warmer and dryer fig 2 the changes of wsct dates are coherent in all the basins snowmelt runoff timing shifted towards earlier dates since the mid 1980s since these basins are not heavily influenced by human activities the substantial changes of wsct could be primarily driven by the changes of precipitation and temperature a break point of temperature change was also identified in the mid 1980s chen et al 2006 2007 xu et al 2010 the association of wsct with temperature and precipitation in different periods in the toxkon and kaidu basins indicated that wsct happens earlier when spring temperature is higher meanwhile significant correlations of temperature are generally stronger than the precipitation correlations which further confirms that wsct is more sensitive to temperature variability this finding is consistent with previous studies according to which the changes of spring streamflow are related to the spring temperature change liu et al 2011 zhuang et al 2015 however precipitation is weakly but positively correlated with the wsct precipitation accumulated in spring will lead to greater snow depth and longer snow cover duration which will lead to a later meltwater peak in the warm months the snowmelt runoff center time therefore will be delayed wsct in the huangshuigou basin did not have a significant relationship with temperature which could be explained by its small area and relatively lower elevation reducing the importance of snowmelt the kunmalik basin has a highly snow cover and glaciers extent which may be the reason for a stronger relationship between streamflow and temperature but poor relationship with precipitation previous study had already indicated that the spring streamflow is dominated by changes in temperature kundzewicz et al 2015 streamflow runoff changes presumably reflect a complex response to climate change however uncertainties remain the process of snow and glacier melt is a complex issue in terms of orographic effects and data availability in mountain regions in addition data length quality and analysis methods are also contribute to uncertainties in the estimation furthermore since discharge data for artificial reservoirs was not available the investigation of snowmelt and hydrological changes may be biased in the kaidu basin even though the two reservoirs dashankou and chahanwusu have small capacity 5 8 of the annual streamflow since 1992 they can still influence streamflow during the dry season however the positive trend and presence of a break point are comparable to the adjacent huangshuigou basin mountain basins shoulder the task of suppling fresh water for downstream rivers since streamflow is substantially influenced by the variability of climate and climate change the variability of streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing can be important indicators for climate change additionally snowmelt runoff shifted earlier which may lead to less water released in summer when irrigation water demand is high the changes of streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing could therefore threaten seasonal water availability shen et al 2013 furthermore streamflow in spring and summer is expected to increase in the near future in the tianshan mountains hagg et al 2007 and fresh water supply is expected to be pushed towards its limits in the future in northwestern china guo and shen 2016 this study gives important insights into the spatial variability of streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing which is of great significance for flood control hydropower plants adaption and

timing in four mountain basins in the southern tianshan annual streamflow in this area exhibits a significant positive trend in all basins seasonally streamflow mainly increased in winter and spring months the relationships between streamflow and climate variables revealed that temperature plays a great role on streamflow in autumn and winter while streamflow is dominated by precipitation in summer in the toxkon kaidu and huangshuigou basins the glacierized kunmalik basin shows a different behavior in which temperature plays a key role for streamflow variability at annual and seasonal scales streamflow had an abrupt change in the mid 1990s at annual and seasonal scales a pattern that can also be identified in precipitation and temperature data from the southern tianshan the analysis of winter spring snowmelt runoff center time has shown that average wsct dates in the kaidu and huangshuigou basins are earlier than in the toxkon and kunmalik basins a clear shift towards earlier wsct was found since the mid 1980s which reflects the combined influences of temperature and precipitation it is particularly noteworthy that wsct is negatively related to temperature but positively related to precipitation in spring however the opposite relationship between wsct and temperature precipitation was found in the glacierized kunmalik basin although uncertainties remain

7487,streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing of mountain rivers are susceptible to climate change trends and variability in streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in four mountain basins in the southern tianshan were analyzed in this study streamflow trends were detected by mann kendall tests and changes in snowmelt runoff timing were analyzed based on the winter spring snowmelt runoff center time wsct pearson s correlation coefficient was further calculated to analyze the relationships between climate variables streamflow and wsct annual streamflow increased significantly in past decades in the southern tianshan especially in spring and winter months however the relations between streamflow and temperature precipitation depend on the different streamflow generation processes annual precipitation plays a vital role in controlling recharge in the toxkon basin while the kaidu and huangshuigou basins are governed by both precipitation and temperature seasonally temperature has a strong effect on streamflow in autumn and winter while summer streamflow appears more sensitive to changes in precipitation however temperature is the dominant factor for streamflow in the glacierized kunmalik basin at annual and seasonal scales an uptrend in streamflow begins in the 1990s at both annual and seasonal scales which is generally consistent with temperature and precipitation fluctuations average wsct dates in the kaidu and huangshuigou basins are earlier than in the toxkon and kunmalik basins and shifted towards earlier dates since the mid 1980s in all the basins it is plausible that wsct dates are more sensitive to warmer temperature in spring period compared to precipitation except for the huangshuigou basin taken together these findings are useful for applications in flood risk regulation future hydropower projects and integrated water resources management keywords climate change winter spring snowmelt runoff time wsct tarim basin central asia 1 introduction snowmelt contributes substantially to the springtime runoff and streamflow in mountain regions with colder climates the timing and volume of snowmelt runoff and streamflow can be particularly sensitive to climate change barnett et al 2005 stewart et al 2004 clow 2010 viviroli et al 2011 leppi et al 2012 the rivers flowing from the tianshan mountains known as the water towerofcentral asia are an important freshwater source for central asia sorg et al 2012 chen et al 2016a b additionally the snowmelt in the tianshan mountains as in other cold mountain regions contributes substantially to the springtime runoff and streamflow portions of the regional water balance chen et al 2016b average temperature and precipitation have been increasing over recent decades in northwestern china where the tianshan mountains are located xu et al 2004 chen et al 2006 kong and pang 2012 as precipitation influences streamflow directly while temperature mainly affects evapotranspiration snow glacier melt and the form rain or snow of precipitation singh and singh 2001 molini et al 2011 warmer and wetter conditions may result in an accelerated and unstable regional hydrological cycle in this semiarid region shen and chen 2010 chen 2014 streamflow variability is therefore remarkably important for studying the impacts of climate change streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in the tianshan mountains are expected to change under a changing climate streamflow experienced a remarkable increase with climate warming chen et al 2009 2013 liu et al 2011 which combined with glacier shrinkage leads to a significant increase in streamflow volume and earlier snowmelt runoff in the urumqi basin sun et al 2015 according to model simulations the timing of snowmelt runoff is projected to shift earlier due to temperature increase in spring wang et al 2010 liu et al 2011 however the impacts of climate change on streamflow differ in different basins the xinjiang province portion of the tianshan mountains in china runs from west to east around 1700 km long and therefore intercepts moist air coming from the westerlies and results in unevenly distributed precipitation and water resources chen 2014 the northern and western slopes of the tianshan receive more precipitation than the southern and eastern parts xu et al 2010 while temperature on the southern slopes is higher than on the northern slopes shen et al 2016 the climate related impacts on streamflow are even more complex in glacierized catchments for instance streamflow change in the kaidu basin in summer is mainly attributed to changes in mountain precipitation deng et al 2015 while temperature dominates streamflow changes in the highly glacierized kunmalik basin kundzewicz et al 2015 generally the distribution of streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing are undergoing significant changes due to climate variability which motivates the need to identify the streamflow variability and snowmelt runoff timing in meltwater dependent basins changes in streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing have become evident in other regions in recent decades global streamflow has tended to increase in the warming climate labat et al 2004 in addition streamflow increases have been projected due to increased temperature and precipitation in a glacierized river basin in nepal immerzeel et al 2012 quantified by means of center of volume date ct and spring pulse onset streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing were shifted earlier due to temperature increase in new england hodgkins et al 2003 and colorado clow 2010 these changes are also observed in western north america and eurasian arctic rivers stewart et al 2004 2005 cayan et al 2001 tan et al 2011 based on gcm models the projected streamflow in quebec canada is expected to increase in winter and decrease in spring boyer et al 2010 taken together changes in streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing are important indicators of climate related changes hodgkins et al 2003 however climate change and its impacts on streamflow are still poorly described especially with respect to snowmelt runoff changes in glacierized catchments in the tianshan mountains chen et al 2016b currently not much research in the tianshan mountains focuses on the streamflow variability at the basin scale while much of the recent work has focused on large regional areas shi et al 2007 chen et al 2009 tao et al 2011 xu et al 2010 wang et al 2013 therefore it is not well known how changes in climate might impact streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in different basins of the tianshan mountains to improve our general understanding of the impacts of climate change the knowledge of seasonal relationships between hydro meteorological variables at the basin scale must be improved this study therefore seeks to estimate the trends and variability of streamflow and snowmelt runoff timing in four mountain basins in the southern tianshan from west to east and their possible sensitivity to climate change the objectives are 1 to estimate annual seasonal and monthly historical streamflow characteristics in four glacierized basins in the tianshan mountains 2 to characterize possible changes in snowmelt runoff timing 3 to obtain insights into hydrological processes and to identify the relationships between hydrological changes associated with climate variables 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area four glacierized basins toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou respectively in the southern tianshan were chosen based on the location and data availability fig 1 and table 1 mean elevations of the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins are 3634 3707 3008 and 2840 m above sea level a s l respectively the toxkon and kunmalik basins drain approximately 19 166 and 12 816 km2 upstream from the shaliguilanke and xiehela stations table 1 they are the main headwater subcatchments of the aksu river which is the main tributary of the tarim basin accounting for about 80 of its annual streamflow in addition approximately 4 and 20 of the toxkon and kunmalik basins respectively are glacierized doris et al 2016 the kaidu and huangshuigou basins are located in the central southern part of the tianshan mountains and cover 18 649 and 4298 km2 upstream from the dashankou and huangshuigou gauge stations streamflow from the kaidu and huangshuigou basins finally arrive at bosten lake which is another important water source for the tarim basin the basins are characterized by a continental semiarid climate mean annual streamflow in the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins are 148 381 189 and 69 mm year respectively table 1 temperature and precipitation from aphrodite see the data section are highly heterogeneous due to large elevational gradients and complex topography the kaidu basin has the coldest winters mean winter temperature 20 4 c followed by the kunmalik 17 2 c huangshuigou 15 8 c and toxkon 15 2 c basins fig 2 the highest mean summer temperature is found in the huangshuigou basin 10 4 c average summer temperatures in the toxkon kunmalik and kaidu basins are 9 3 6 9 and 9 2 c respectively generally temperature in winter is more variable than in summer while the opposite holds true for precipitation fig 2 winter is the driest season for all the basins 15 23 11 and 6 mm for the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins respectively precipitation mainly occurs in summer 115 152 138 and 127 mm for the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins moreover average precipitation in spring is higher in the toxkon and kunmalik 65 and 79 mm than the kaidu and huangshuigou 37 and 30 mm respectively basins 2 2 data streamflow gauge data were obtained from the hydrology andwater resourcesbureau of xinjiang four stations with daily streamflow data are available in the tianshan mountains the gauge locations are shown in fig 1 and the corresponding summary information is listed in table 1 the streamflow data cover a period of more than 30 years and all the data were strictly checked for homogeneity there are a few days of missing data 1 of the daily values for the daily streamflow in the shaliguilanke xiehela and huangshuigou stations however monthly data are available we interpolated the missing data using linear regression with neighboring data although uncertainties remain we assume that they won t have much influence on the trend detection there is only one observation station in each basin which cannot represent the spatial climate for the whole basin therefore time series of mean temperature and precipitation data within these basins were extracted form aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources gridded data yatagai et al 2012 aphrodite covers time span more than 45 years 1951 2007 for precipitation and 1961 2007 for temperature and it features a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 aphrodite is an interpolated dataset that can provides a basic description for the local climate and has been widely applied in central asia immerzeel et al 2015 shea et al 2015 krysanova et al 2015 climate stations are sparse in the tianshan mountains and most of the stations are located in the valley aphrodite may therefore underestimate the mountain precipitation due to the high orographic influence of the tianshan mountains however in terms of analyzing the streamflow and climate change variability the trend of climate and their relationship with discharge can also give valuable information we acknowledge that uncertainties related to the representation of climate in mountain areas remain the river basins were delineated by using hydrosheds elevation data approx 90 m 90 m resolution lehner et al 2008 2 3 methods temporal trends of streamflow were evaluated using non parametric mann kendall tests mann 1945 kendall 1975 at annual and monthly scales for each basin sen s slope sen 1968 was applied to analyze the linear rate of change to reduce the expected proportion of false discoveries that may occur by chance alone an adjustment for multiple comparisons was conducted by using the benjamini hochberg procedure benjamini and hochberg 1995 the false discovery rate was controlled at a level of 0 05 i e it is expected that no more than 5 of all null hypotheses rejected in this study were incorrectly rejected all statistical analyses were performed using r r core team 2016 snowmelt runoff timing was carried out using the theory of the center of mass of flow ct which is a flow weighted timing that represents the center of mass of the streamflow curve stewart et al 2004 ct is not necessarily related to the actual snowmelt timing but the change of ct can present as evidence for observed earlier actual melting stewart et al 2005 as most precipitation in the tianshan mountains falls in summer to avoid the impact of largeamounts of seasonal rainfall to the flow weight we computed ct only for the winter spring period january 1st to may 31st when streamflow is snowmelt dominated thus the annual winter spring snowmelt runoff center time wsct was calculated from wsct t i q i q i where ti is time in months or days from the beginning of the year january 1st qi is the corresponding streamflow for month i or day i therefore wsct is a date which is given in months or days and smoothed by locally weighted regression loess cleveland and devlin 1988 the correlations between streamflow wsct temperature and precipitation were furthermore measured using pearson s correlation coefficient r 3 results 3 1 trends and variability of streamflow annual streamflow showed an increasing trend in four basins in past decades based on the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator 9 29 14 35 18 02 and 4 34 mm per decade for the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins respectively however the streamflow increase was more strongly significant in the winter and spring months from november to march in four basins table 2 fig 4 seasonally streamflow amounts of the toxkon and kaidu basins appear to increase in every season while there are no significant trends in streamflow in the kunmalik and huangshuigou basins in summer and autumn respectively annual streamflow is expected to show the largest increase from the mid 1990s for each basin fig 3 seasonal patterns of streamflow are generally similar to the change patterns of annual streamflow that also increased since the early 1990s in terms of the cumulative anomalies fig 4 however seasonal changes are more variable in spring than changes for other seasons as well as at the annual scale 3 2 streamflow links with temperature and precipitation changes in streamflow at annual and seasonal scales can be linked to the variations of temperature and precipitation annual temperature increased significantly in all basins 0 2 0 5 0 5 c per decade for the kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins except for the toxkon basin seasonally temperature in autumn and winter has significantly increased in all the basins table 3 however only temperature in the kaidu basin rose significantly in all the seasons precipitation tended to increase in all basins but with more uncertainty as a significant trend was only detected in the huangshuigou basin table 3 winter precipitation increased significantly in all the basins except for the toxkon basin however annual streamflow increased substantially since the mid 1990s which very likely coincides with change patterns of annual precipitation and temperature annual temperature and precipitation also showed significant positive trends since the 1990s fig 3 seasonal change patterns of temperature and precipitation were also estimated based on the seasonal cumulative anomaly of temperature and precipitation figure s1 and s2 in supporting information we found consistent evidence that seasonal temperature had a steep change after the mid 1990s however seasonal precipitation is more variable than temperature average precipitation and temperature were compiled at annual and seasonal scales to identify the relationship between streamflow and climate variables table 4 annual and summer streamflows have a positive relation with precipitation in all the basins except for the glacierized kunmalik basin there has been no consistent relationship between streamflow and precipitation in the other seasons temperature has a significant positive relation with autumn and winter streamflow in the toxkon kaidu and huangshuigou basins however streamflow in the glacierized kunmalik basin generally has a significant relationship with temperature at annual and seasonal scales 3 3 changes of snowmelt runoff timing long term changes in wsct showed no significant trend based on the mann kendall tests except for the kaidu basin 3 4 days decade p 01 whose significant negative trend may have been enhanced by the short data period from west to east wsct shifts towards earlier dates average wsct during the study period for the toxkon kunmalik kaidu and huangshuigou basins are julian day 111 98 94 and 87 respectively a general nonlinear pattern was apparent according to which the wsct dates rose first and then decreased after mid 1980s based on the loess smooth line fig 5 all the gauge stations show consistent fluctuations in wsct which indicates earlier snowmelt runoff timing and increased winter spring runoff table 2 wsct shifted toward earlier dates after the mid 1980s 11 days julian day range 103 114 in the toxkon basin 5 days 94 99 in the kunmalik basin 8 days 88 97 in the kaidu basin and 8 days 82 90 in the huangshuigou basin respectively 3 4 relations of wsct to temperature and precipitation changes in wsct may be additional indicators of changing precipitation and temperature rivers that originate from the tianshan mountains are mainly supplied by precipitation and meltwater from snow and glaciers correlations between monthly precipitation and temperature with wsct dates were therefore explored table 5 there was no significant relationship between wsct dates and precipitation in the toxkon basin however average precipitation was found to have weak but significant positive correlation with wsct dates in may r 0 39 p 02 in the kaidu basin and in march r 0 37 p 01 in the huangshuigou basin nevertheless the strongest correlation between wsct dates and temperature in the toxkon basin was found in the period of february to april r 0 46 p 01 the strongest correlation between wsct dates and temperature in the kaidu basin was found in the period of march to april r 0 66 p 001 while no significant relationships were found in the huangshuigou basin however wsct dates were found to have a negative relationship with precipitation in the period of january to april r 0 34 p 02 and a positive relationship with temperature in may r 0 59 p 001 in the kunmalik basin 4 discussion the relationships between streamflow on the one side and temperature and precipitation on the other side vary among the basins at annual and seasonal scales which may be due to different streamflow generation processes basins in mountain areas are mainly recharged by both precipitation and

7488,depth specific sampling of groundwater is important for a variety of hydrogeological applications several sampling methods are available but comparably little is known about how their results compare therefore samples from regular observation wells short screen micro filters and direct push were compared for two sites with differing hydrogeological conditions and land use both located in the fuhrberger feld germany the encountered hydrochemical zonation requires a high resolution of 1 m or better which the available small number of regular observation wells could only roughly mirror because the three methods employ significantly varying pumping rates and therefore have varying spatial origins of the sample individual concentrations at similar depths may differ significantly in a hydrologically and chemically dynamical environment such as the agricultural site this effect becomes more pronounced than for the more stable forest site the micro filters are probably the most depth specific but showed distinctly lower concentrations for dissolved gases than the other two methods due to degassing during sampling they should thus not be used for any method that relies on dissolved

böhlke and denver 1995 houben et al 2001 broers 2004 and to calibrate mathematical flow models e g zuber et al 2011 sanford 2011 different methods to obtain depth specific samples are available lerner and teutsch 1995 fig 1 shows some of the commonly used techniques observation wells with long screens fig 1a shown here merely for the sake of completeness can cause short circuiting of zones of different hydraulic heads and chemical compositions this can induce significant intra borehole flow and mixing even in the idle state which can negatively affect the quality of head measurements and water samples church and granato 1996 puls and paul 1997 reilly and leblanc 1998 hutchins and acree 2000 elci et al 2001 2003 britt 2005 zinn and konikow 2007 hofmann et al 2010 mayo 2010 colombani et al 2016 their use is therefore usually not recommended even the use of packers or passive samplers might not be sufficient to overcome this problem due to vertical flow through the gravel pack if present cherry et al 2007 developed a system which closes the whole well screen by a packer and allows depth specific sampling through a multi level port system a better choice is a nest of individual observation wells with short screen lengths preferably not more than 1 m long fig 1b and c they can either be installed into individual boreholes fig 1b or in a single borehole of larger diameter fig 1c the quality of samples from the latter strongly depends on the integrity of the annular seals separating the screens fig 1c something which is often problematic in slim boreholes both types are however quite expensive often restricting the number of sampling depths and thus the resolution a high vertical resolution can be obtained by using an array of tubes usually installed into one borehole with the inlets tube ends located at different depths fig 1d water enters through the end of the plastic tube often equipped with a micro filter the advantage of such micro filters is the obtainable high spatial resolution and depth resolution of typically 0 5 m or better this method has been applied e g by böttcher et al 1985 1990 1997 in the fuhrberger feld and by einarson and cherry 2002 a general problem of this approach is that both the inlets and the tube diameters are commonly small and the flow rate thus limited the sample thus comes from a very small proportion of the aquifer the installation of annular seals to reseal perforated aquitards is usually not possible due to the small diameter of the borehole and the many tubes and ports protruding from the base pipe finally direct push dp methods allow high resolution sampling e g puls and paul 1997 pitkin et al 1999 schulmeister et al 2004 amos and blowes 2008 dehnert et al 2010 hofmann et al 2010 commonly the dp probe is pushed to the final depth the screen is then released and samples are taken while retracting the probe upwards if the borehole below the currently sampled interval does not fully close flow from this damage zone below the screen may contribute significantly to the sampled water fig 1e pitkin et al 1999 developed a dp method that allows sampling through a small port at the drive point while driving downwards passing through zones of high concentrations may however induce slight dragging down of the contaminant to the next lower sampling depth due to the small port sample volumes are usually 1 l pitkin et al 1999 a general feature of dp is the lack of well development and the absence of a gravel pack therefore turbidity of the sampled water may be an issue due to the pump type usually a foot valve or a peristaltic pump the pumping rate is usually smaller than for regular observation wells the screen length is usually 1 m although resolutions down to 0 1 m have been documented with shorter screens or ports pitkin et al 1999 charette and allen 2006 several studies have shown that dp profiles are on par with more conventional sampling techniques e g schulmeister et al 2004 hofmann et al 2010 since the screen is re moved during the sampling dp usually constitutes a one time sampling and is thus not adequate for continuous monitoring the term multi level well will not be used here as it is sometimes used for both observation wells of the type shown in fig 1b d several previous studies have compared results of different sampling techniques puls and paul 1997 compared samples from three conventional monitoring wells each sampled by submersible pump bailer and depth specific passive sampler and dp sampling 30 cm screen length from a contaminated site their analytical scope was restricted to major ions and some heavy metals amos and blowes 2008 compared observation wells and dp profiles on a contaminated site for major ions and selected gases focusing on volatile organic contaminants hofmann et al 2010 compared groundwater samples obtained from long screened observation wells type fig 1a nested observation wells type fig 1b and direct push sampling fig 1e from three similar agricultural sites major ions stable isotopes and tritium were analyzed they found that long screens even when using packers are inferior to direct push and nested observation wells for both hydrochemical and isotopic analysis a good correlation of hydrochemical parameters between nested observation wells and direct push sampling methods was observed some deviations were found however especially in the shallow samples their site differs from the fuhrberger feld by its coarser granulometry and lower recharge rate 54 mm a hofmann et al 2010 the influence of the final sample collection technique submersible pump bailer passive sampler was studied by barcelona et al 1984 schalla et al 1988 and puls and paul 1997 the rationale of this study is to expand the scope of previously published studies in several ways first of all three methods with three pump types will be compared types fig 1b d and e of which the micro filters have attracted little attention so far secondly the analytical scope goes beyond that of previous studies by addressing in situ parameters major ions trace metals stable and radiogenic isotopes and dissolved gases special emphasis is put on trace gases and isotopes thereof which are important for the interpretation of many hydrochemical and hydrological processes manning et al 2003 e g denitrification weymann

limited choice of gases focusing mostly on volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons schalla et al 1988 amos and blowes 2008 finally the influence of land use is considered here by comparing an agricultural and a forest site previous studies were usually restricted to a single type of land use and forest sites were not considered so far e g puls and paul 1997 amos and blowes 2008 hofmann et al 2010 the fuhrberger feld is especially suited for this type of study since it has already been studied extensively and can be considered somewhat representative for large parts of northwestern europe the hydrological and hydrochemical processes that lead to the observed depth distribution of hydrochemistry dissolved gases and isotopes will not be discussed here 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area groundwater sampling was conducted in the fuhrberger feld which is a rural area surrounding the village of fuhrberg some 30 km north of hanover germany fig 2 its pedological and hydrogeological conditions have been investigated by e g frind et al 1990 böttcher et al 1985 1990 1997 springob et al 2001 weymann et al 1999 and franken et al 2009 besides its agricultural and forestry use the fuhrberger feld provides groundwater for the drinking water supply of hanover and its suburbs frind et al 1990 franken et al 2009 the aquifer is unconfined and comprised of mostly sandy quaternary sediments of 20 30 m thickness with some small silty interglacial deposits intercalated the base of the aquifer consists of glacial till and clay the depth of the water table fluctuates between 0 5 m and 2 5 m below ground surface the hydraulic conductivity is about 5 10 4 m s and the porosity is 0 3 average air temperature is 8 9 c and the mean annual rainfall about 680 mm a groundwater recharge rates depend on the land use 150 mm a for forested and 250 mm a for agricultural plots franken et al 2009 groundwater flows generally from south to north towards the water works however the sampled sites are not immediately affected by the cones of depression of the wells two sites were chosen for sampling fig 2b one in an area dominated by agriculture n5 and one in a forested area s1 this was done to check for effects of different types of land use and groundwater recharge rate the agricultural site is expected to have a more dynamic environment caused by a higher groundwater recharge rate thus a faster vertical transport velocity and a more dynamic hydrochemical input due to annual variations of crop type and fertilization the agricultural plots are sometimes irrigated during dry spells during the growing season this could potentially affect the recharge pattern and age stratification however the irrigation water comes from the same aquifer no surface water and is applied only in times of high plant demand and thus low groundwater recharge summer an influence on recharge patterns is thus unlikely the nearest irrigation well is more than 1 km away the forest site is densely stocked with both deciduous trees and conifers of various ages and shrub undergrowth 2 2 groundwater sampling at both sites a nest of four individual observation wells with different screen depths was available type fig 1b each with a screen of 1 m length and a diameter of two inch all were installed in the early 1980 s they were sampled using a grundfos mp1 submersible pump at pumping rates between 100 and 200 l h samples were taken after removing at least five borehole volumes and after stable values for the in situ parameters measured in a flow through cell were reached total drawdown was kept smaller than 20 of the height of the initial water column the initial depth to groundwater was 1 6 m for the forest site and 2 5 m for the agricultural site respectively a custom made micro filter system consisting of an assembly of thin tubes of 3 mm inner and 5 mm outer diameter protruding to different depths type fig 1d was available at both sites they were installed in the mid 1990 s at the tip each tube is equipped with a micro screen consisting of a plastic cylinder of 1 cm diameter and 10 cm length filled with quartz wool which is open at the bottom a peristaltic pump was used for sampling ismatech bmp due to the small tube diameter only a very low flow rate of a few ml min was obtained usually three ports were pumped at the same time to fasten the process and to promote horizontal flow to the port flow rates varied from port to port probably due to different degrees of clogging additionally a direct push sampling of groundwater was performed at both sites the rig used was a sg 0 12 by nordmeyer peine germany the casing was first pushed down to the final depth then the wire wound stainless steel screen of 1 m length was released and sampling took place step wise 1 m interval going from bottom to top using a foot valve pump installed at the screen top pumping rates were on the order of 10 s of l h the casing had a diameter of 38 mm 1 5 in while the screen had 25 mm 1 in at both sites all observation well and micro filter samples were taken within one day the direct push sampling took place one week later considering the low flow velocity of groundwater this time lag is negligible for both sites all samplings were spatially very close to each other within a 5 m radius to minimize the influence of lateral hydrochemical heterogeneities sampling took place in november 2015 with outside temperatures close to the average groundwater temperature of 10 c the observation wells of site n5 were resampled in september 2016 yielding almost identical results 2 3 hydrogeochemical analysis the analytical methods for water chemistry are summarized in table 1 the cation samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter in the field and then acidified to ph 2 with ultrapure nitric acid merck for stabilization the anion sample was not conditioned all sample bottles were brought to the laboratory on the sampling day and stored in the dark at 4 c prior to analysis 2 4 water isotope analysis the stable water isotope values δ2h and δ18o were analyzed using a cavity ring down laser spectrometer of the type picarro l2140 i on vaporized samples the accuracies for an independently measured quality check sample were better than 0 2 and 0 8 for δ18o and δ2h respectively delta values were measured relative to the vsmow slap scale vienna standard mean ocean water standard light antarctic precipitation tritium was determined by its decay product 3he at the institute of environmental physics at the university of bremen details on the analysis technique can be found in sültenfuβ et al 2009 samples were degassed and stored for 3he accumulation for about 100 days precision is better than 3 the detection limit for this data set is 0 02 tu tritium units for all observation wells and some direct push samples duplicates were taken and analyzed for neon and helium data for both agree well within the expected uncertainties for groundwater sampling 3 2 5 dissolved gas analysis for the analysis of dissolved nitrogen and argon bubble free groundwater samples were taken in 120 ml bottles with crimp cap and septum without headspace all bottles were allowed to overflow several minutes before placing the crimp cap the dissolved nitrogen and argon concentrations were measured with a membrane inlet gas chromatography mass spectrometer migcms e g kana et al 1994 before measurement all bottles were brought to room temperature directly before analysis the cap and septum were removed each sample was pumped along a gas permeable membrane dissolved gases diffused through the membrane into a sample loop helium was used as carrier gas the gas in the sample loop was further pumped through a porapakq column to separate n2 ar and o2 from water vapor and other gases the gas mixture is then passed through a second column mol sieve 5a to split up n2 ar and o2 the membrane and all columns are tempered to 60 c detection and quantification was performed with a quadrupole mass spectrometer calibration was performed with tap water equilibrated with ambient air at known temperature and pressure gas solubilities for calibration were taken from weiss 1970 samples for dissolved hydrocarbons methane were collected in 120 ml glass bottles with teflon coated butyl rubber seals and aluminum crimp caps samples were not acidified but immediately analyzed after arrival in the laboratory dissolved methane was determined applying a headspace equilibration method capasso and inguaggiato 1998 kampbell and vandegrift 1998 25 ml of the water was replaced by laboratory grade helium 5 9 and the samples equilibrated at a temperature of 20 c for at least two hours on a laboratory shaker see schloemer et al 2016 for details prior to the following measurements the total pressure in the glass bottles was measured using a pressure transducer range 0 160 kpa 0 8 kpa accuracy the concentration of methane was determined by gas chromatography gc using an agilent 6890 equipped with a manual split splitless injector and flame ionisation detector the quantification limit is approximately 0 2 ppm hydrocarbon in the sample gas the concentration of methane dissolved in groundwater was calculated using the partial pressure of the gases in equilibrium with the water derived from fractional concentration and total headspace pressure equilibration temperature volume of gas water and henry s law constant the relative error of the gc analysis is around 3 throughout the text we refer to volume concentrations of the dissolved gases nl l at a temperature of 293 k and a pressure of 101 325 pa the isotopic composition of methane was measured applying a cryo focussing with liquid nitrogen of the dissolved methane on a 1 m 1 16 packed column this system was coupled to a delta plus xl the lower quantification limit for the δ13c value of methane is 700 nl l isotope ratios are given in the standard notation versus the pee dee belemnite pdb standard coplen 2011 the average deviation on duplicates is 0 3 samples for analysis of helium isotopes and neon were taken in 40 cm3 copper tubes after flushing the tubes were squeezed with clamps to avoid any gas exchange during storage gases were extracted from water in a high vacuum system helium and neon were separated from other sample gases with a cryo system and admitted to the mass spectrometer the sample measurements were calibrated with atmospheric air analytical errors are 1 for he 2 for ne and 0 5 for 3he 4he ratios sültenfuβ et al 2009 separation of 3he from tritium decay tritiogenic 3he and radiogenic 4he from other he sources were performed after kipfer et al 2002 and references therein 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ parameters in the field different ec and ph probes were used for the observation wells and the micro filters on one hand and for the direct push samples on the other hand it was therefore decided to use the specific electrical conductivity ec and ph measurements from the laboratory which were done with identical equipment and at stable temperatures the ec values of the groundwater samples show similar depth trends for the three sampling methods at both sites fig 3 however for the forest site s1 the ec values from direct push are higher by more than 100 μs cm between 6 and 12 m fig 3b this coincides with a fine sand layer in some parts with silt as minor component fig 2c it could be argued that the borehole of the direct push did not close in this part allowing water to flow towards the well from below where higher ec values are found the general trend of increasing ph with depth was found by all methods fig 4 water of low ph is predominantly found in the uppermost meters of the water column probably due to atmospheric acid deposition again values from direct push are higher by up to one ph unit between 3 and 12 m but a better fit is found below 12 m again a possible explanation could be the inflow of deeper groundwater of higher ph from below the sampled interval through a borehole that did not close entirely hofmann et al 2010 also encountered the highest deviations between the sampling methods for shallow samples that is in a zone where steep geochemical gradients tend to occur groundwater in the fuhrberger feld is generally very reducing and dissolved oxygen concentrations are almost always below the detection limit even for the uppermost samples additionally the very low flow rates of the micro filters render measurements of both oxygen and redox potential dubious 3 2 water isotopes the concentrations of tritium obtained from all three sampling methods are in good agreement for the agricultural site n5 fig 5 a for the forest site s1 tritium concentrations are reasonably close to each other for the four depths where information is available from all three sampling methods fig 5b however there are noticeable deviations of up to 4 tu between the tritium profiles obtained from the micro filters and direct push sampling especially between 6 and 12 m and below 16 m the latter deviation might be due to an admixture of older water from below where a gravel layer is present with their higher pumping rate the direct push samples are more prone to induce flow from below than the micro filters with their very low pumping rate it should be noted that the profile at n5 shows a continuous tritium decrease over depth indicating a continuous recharge process while at s1 lateral inflow might has to be considered since tritium increases below 8 m again for the stable water isotopes the agricultural site n5 shows a marked variability over depth fig 6 a this probably reflects the highly dynamical input characteristic caused by seasonal and annual variations of crop types groundwater recharge and irrigation the variations underline the need for a high resolution of depth specific sampling in such a dynamic environment for the forest site all sampling methods result in similar stable isotope values at least when considering the analytical uncertainty fig 6b the micro filters generally show slightly higher values than the ones obtained from direct push the variation over depth in general is rather small reflecting the stable hydrological environment of a slowly growing forest 3 3 hydrochemistry the main ion chemistry of groundwater shows a distinct depth dependency at both sites figs 7 9 here two anions chloride sulfate and one cation calcium are shown as examples chloride was chosen since it is usually considered to be a conservative non reactive ion all sampling methods are able to recreate the general concentrations trends over depth of all ions reasonably well but there are significant deviations for some samples again in the depth interval between 6 and 12 m below surface where deviations between 20 and 40 and locally up to 200 and more are common in the case of calcium significant deviations are also found again below 16 m depth at the s1 site fig 9b where direct push samples yield around 65 mg l calcium while the micro filters show around 40 mg l a deviation by a factor of 1 6 a comparably close fit mostly 0 01 mg l of the three sampling methods was obtained for the trace metal zinc fig 10 especially for the s1 site fig 10b however it also shows the general problem of comparing methods with varying depth resolutions in the presence of steep geochemical gradients e g around 6 m at n5 or of local outliers e g between 14 and 17 m at s1 the reasons behind these deviations in the concentrations of the investigated hydrochemical constituents may be manifold the micro filters sample only a very small interval and volume of the aquifer while both the observation wells and the direct push samples average over an interval of at least one meter the pumping rates of the three methods are different on a logarithmic scale going from hundreds of l h observation wells to tens of l h direct push and finally a few l h micro filter they thus tap different volumes of the aquifer direct push samples always carry the potential problem that water may flow from underneath the currently sampled depth when the borehole has not closed completely after pulling up the screen to the next depth interval finally the direct push samples are often turbid and the standard filtration of 0 45 μm might not remove all colloids which then end up being analyzed as dissolved species to test the latter hypothesis the concentrations of silicon as sio2 were compared fig 11 silicon was chosen because it is commonly not only present as dissolved silicic acid but often also in the form of colloids and micro particles colloids clay and also calcite particles are often not removed during the standard 0 45 μm filtration used in groundwater sampling kennedy et al 1974 indeed in most cases the direct push samples show higher silicon values than the other sampling techniques by up to 3 mg l especially for the interval between 7 and 12 m for site s1 fig 11b which showed some distinct deviations for e g calcium fig 9b on the other hand both chloride and sulfate were also enriched in this interval at s1 and especially chloride is usually not part of colloids or particles 3 4 dissolved gases the solubility at 10 c of nitrogen and argon in fresh groundwater in equilibrium with the atmosphere is 647 and 17 2 μmol l respectively the measured concentrations of both dissolved gases show that the micro filters yield significantly lower values up to 30 than the observation wells and the direct push samples fig 12 the latter two are actually quite similar at both sites the general trends of concentration over depth at least for the s1 site are visible for all sampling methods fig 12b the solubility of methane in fresh groundwater in equilibrium with the atmosphere air ch4 content of 1 7 ppm is around 70 nl l 3 nmol l at 10 c the concentrations of dissolved methane at the fuhrberg site are significantly higher indicating in aquifer production compared to other groundwater samples from northwestern germany the absolute concentrations are however rather small schloemer et al 2016 concentrations obtained from the micro filters are significantly lower sometimes up to an order of magnitude fig 13 especially when compared to those from direct push the δ13c of the dissolved methane shows a very inconclusive behavior the deviations between the sampling methods at the same depth have a magnitude of several 10 s of in some cases far higher than the analytical uncertainty of around 1 fig 14 this is especially pronounced for the agricultural site fig 14a whereas the spread in the more stable forest environment is distinctly smaller this shows that the carbon isotopic composition of methane can be very sensitive if the initial absolute concentration of methane is low to which degree the strongly enriched δ13c methane of the direct push samples at very shallow depths 4m is a result of sampling procedure or actually reflecting a natural variation cannot be decided although the n5 site is highly dynamic and about 10 days have been elapsed between sampling with intermittent rainfall these variations are probably too large to be simply explained in terms of a microbiologically mediated methane oxidation process moreover this should be accompanied by a decrease in methane concentration which has not been observed for the s1 site observation wells and micro filters show identical values down to 7 m while direct push are slightly depleted in δ 13c by about 5 between 9 and 14 m all methods are matching exactly however below 15 m depth methane extracted from direct push samples is again depleted in the heavier isotope the difference in methane isotopy between the forest and the agricultural side may be an effect of the different photosynthesis types of plants present in both locations c3 plants such as wheat rye but also trees have 13c signatures between 25 and 29 while c4 plants such as corn and some grasses show values ranging between 12 and 16 bender 1968 1971 o leary 1988 while basically all plants in the forest are of the c3 type the c4 plant corn is frequently part of the cropping cycle in the fuhrberger feld the dissolved organic carbon in soil seepage from the agricultural sites with their rotation of c3 and c4 plants should therefore have a higher spread in its carbon isotopy than that from the forest this is indeed visible in fig 14 the measured signatures for both sites are however much more negative than the values mentioned above this indicates additional subsurface bacterial methane production which usually produces signatures lower than 50 whiticar 1999 the forest site lies within the typical range of 50 to 60 for bacterial fermentation of methylated organic substrates whiticar 1999 the very low signatures in the agricultural site could indicate inorganic carbonate as an additional source of methane since methyl fermentation would not produce values below 70 whiticar 1999 the solubility of helium in fresh groundwater in equilibrium at 10 c water temperature with the atmosphere is 4 65 10 5 nml kg nml normal milliliter at t 273 15 k p 1013 25 hpa dissolved helium again shows significantly lower concentrations in the micro filters compared to the other two methods fig 15 this is very pronounced for the older and helium enriched groundwater of site s1 where the micro filter results deviate from those from direct push by factors ranging between two and ten this would seriously affect tritium helium age dating where tritiogenic helium is one of the two key input parameters interestingly the observation wells show values somewhat lower than the direct push samples only for the three deeper direct push samples a nearly constant concentration of 3 10 5 nml kg for radiogenic 4he was found this indicates admixture of older water if this is assumed to be tritium free this explains the reduced tritium concentration in the deepest samples fig 5 and maybe also the deviations in calcium fig 9 the solubility of neon in fresh groundwater at 10 c in equilibrium with the atmosphere is 2 02 10 4 nml kg as neon has only atmospheric sources an excess points to an inclusion of air during recharge typical values are 10 30 excess ne a loss of neon as evident in fig 16 can be explained by degassing gas samples from micro filters have gas concentrations lower by 10 20 compared to direct push as the pumping with a peristaltic pump generates an underpressure except for the deeper direct push samples samples of s1 neon excess undersaturation fig 16 agrees well with helium excess undersaturation respectively fig 15 stripping of dissolved gases by excess nitrogen or methane gas should not affect gas isotope ratios significantly the 3he 4he ratio is triggered by the decay of tritium in these shallow aquifers studies here profiles of δ3he are shown in fig 15 for s1 massive differences between micro filter and direct push samples were detected the general finding that the micro filters tend to yield lower dissolved gas concentrations than the other two methods can probably be attributed to several features of the sampling technique which disrupt the gas water equilibrium the peristaltic pump creates a pulsed flow and locally an underpressure in the tube which can induce significant degassing barcelona et al 1984 smaller additional losses may occur by gas diffusion through the plastic tube during the upward passage of water provided that the concentrations outside are lower due to the small flow rate the fluid travels through the tube for several minutes especially when coming from greater depth the tubes have a high surface area to volume ratio due to their small inner diameter of 3 mm they are also several years old so their gas permeability may have increased over time however we do not consider this to be the dominant process to explain the δ3he differences as it is not supported by the under saturated neon and argon concentrations helium is more likely to get lost by exchange with the atmosphere either induced by the peristaltic pump or the slow filling of the copper tube in the field in practice the low pumping rate of the peristaltic pump may require several minutes to fill the sample bottles during which a new equilibrium might be established with atmospheric air it should be noted however that the measured gas concentrations are with the exception of nitrogen usually lower than the atmospheric equilibrium and thus this last process is also not probable this is confirmed by molofsky et al 2016 who found that methane losses from open sample bottles are small unless effervescence occurs at high concentrations in our case gas concentrations are usually far below equilibrium it should be noted that gas losses from groundwater may also occur under natural conditions leading to concentrations below equilibrium for example in denitrifying environments nitrate is converted into nitrogen gas which may form gas bubbles at least in shallow parts of the aquifer they might escape to the unsaturated zone and ultimately the atmosphere this gas phase can additionally strip other gases from the fluid the fuhrberger feld is known for denitrification böttcher et al 1985 1990 and the measured nitrogen concentrations in fig 12 indeed exceed equilibrium concentrations the ph of the shallow samples is also rather low at ph 4 5 fig 4 indicating that bicarbonate is converted into co2 which might also escape via bubbles formed by other gases these processes would however affect all sampling techniques equally but would be restricted to shallow samples from agricultural sites 4 conclusions depth specific analysis of groundwater is necessary to obtain detailed insights into flow and reactive transport processes in aquifers groundwater samples from observation wells were compared to ones from micro filters and the direct push technique for two sites one a highly dynamical agricultural plot and the other from a more stable forest plot it should be noted that both sites sample an unconfined and unconsolidated sandy aquifer in bedrock aquifers the geochemical zonation can be severely influenced by the location of fractures and their hydraulic properties the geochemical trends reflected in the depth profiles for both sites show that a high resolution of depth specific sampling of at least one meter is needed to actually see these trends and also peaks and outliers with the limited number of observation wells alone many of these features would have gone unnoticed each sampling method has its advantages and disadvantages regarding to cost spatial resolution and susceptibility to steep hydrochemical gradients as table 2 and fig 17 show the pumping rate varies over orders of magnitude the volume of water pumped during a sampling or in other words the volume of aquifer affected influences the sample composition a large volume will even out small scale hydrochemical heterogeneities which might locally bias the micro filter results on the other hand large volumes might lead to a blurring of steep gradients the micro filters are probably the most depth specific as hardly any flow from above or below the inlet is induced they are thus very useful when small scale variations and steep gradients need to be resolved on the other hand they are prone to local effects as they do not average out hydrochemical heterogeneity well screens always induce vertical flow components and thus inflow peaks at their top and bottom houben and hauschild 2011 houben 2015 this results in an admixture of water from above and below the screened interval fig 17 especially if a layer of higher permeability is tapped if the pump is installed above the screen which is commonly the case the peak at the top of the screen is usually more pronounced than that at the bottom korom et al 2003 such screens could therefore have a bias towards more shallow water than indicated by their screened depth for direct push water may additionally come preferentially from below the current screen depth if the borehole did not completely close after lifting the casing to the next sampling depth in this case the water sample would be biased towards deeper water fig 17 unfortunately it is difficult to predict under which circumstances the borehole might not close the forward working dp method of pitkin et al 1999 might be a better choice under such circumstances the micro filters showed a weak performance for dissolved gases because significant concentrations are lost via degassing due to the low flow rate and the pump type barcelona et al 1984 they should thus not be used for the assessment of dissolved gases in

cfc or the determination of paleo temperatures from noble gases the hydrochemical zonation underlying a highly dynamic agricultural environment with seasonally varying hydrological phytological and hydrochemical boundary conditions can be very complex at a small scale different sampling techniques will then easily show much higher deviations from each other than those obtained from a more stable

7488,depth specific sampling of groundwater is important for a variety of hydrogeological applications several sampling methods are available but comparably little is known about how their results compare therefore samples from regular observation wells short screen micro filters and direct push were compared for two sites with differing hydrogeological conditions and land use both located in the fuhrberger feld germany the encountered hydrochemical zonation requires a high resolution of 1 m or better which the available small number of regular observation wells could only roughly mirror because the three methods employ significantly varying pumping rates and therefore have varying spatial origins of the sample individual concentrations at similar depths may differ significantly in a hydrologically and chemically dynamical environment such as the agricultural site this effect becomes more pronounced than for the more stable forest site the micro filters are probably the most depth specific but showed distinctly lower concentrations for dissolved gases than the other two methods due to degassing during sampling they should thus not be used for any method that relies on dissolved

is the effect of a sequence of often microbially mediated redox reactions leading to oxic conditions in shallow groundwater and reducing conditions deeper down geochemical gradients may be so steep e g in the form of sharp reaction fronts or contaminant plumes may be so thin that sampling methods with a coarse vertical resolution may simply overlook them ronen et al 1987 smith et al 1991 puls and paul 1997 for many applications it is therefore imperative to obtain depth specific groundwater samples of high spatial resolution depth specific sampling is also needed to investigate the distribution of groundwater ages as a function of depth this information can be utilized to obtain recharge rates e g scanlon et al 2002 houben et al 2014 to investigate contaminant transport e g böhlke and denver 1995 houben et al 2001 broers 2004 and to calibrate mathematical flow models e g zuber et al 2011 sanford 2011 different methods to obtain depth specific samples are available lerner and teutsch 1995 fig 1 shows some of the commonly used techniques observation wells with long screens fig 1a shown here merely for the sake of completeness can cause short circuiting of zones of different hydraulic heads and chemical compositions this can induce significant intra borehole flow and mixing even in the idle state which can negatively affect the quality of head measurements and water samples church and granato 1996 puls and paul 1997 reilly and leblanc 1998 hutchins and acree 2000 elci et al 2001 2003 britt 2005 zinn and konikow 2007 hofmann et al 2010 mayo 2010 colombani et al 2016 their use is therefore usually not recommended even the use of packers or passive samplers might not be sufficient to overcome this problem due to vertical flow through the gravel pack if present cherry et al 2007 developed a system which closes the whole well screen by a packer and allows depth specific sampling through a multi level port system a better choice is a nest of individual observation wells with short screen lengths preferably not more than 1 m long fig 1b and c they can either be installed into individual boreholes fig 1b or in a single borehole of larger diameter fig 1c the quality of samples from the latter strongly depends on the integrity of the annular seals separating the screens fig 1c something which is often problematic in slim boreholes both types are however quite expensive often restricting the number of sampling depths and thus the resolution a high vertical resolution can be obtained by using an array of tubes usually installed into one borehole with the inlets tube ends located at different depths fig 1d water enters through the end of the plastic tube often equipped with a micro filter the advantage of such micro filters is the obtainable high spatial resolution and depth resolution of typically 0 5 m or better this method has been applied e g by böttcher et al 1985 1990 1997 in the fuhrberger feld and by einarson and cherry 2002 a general problem of this approach is that both the inlets and the tube diameters are commonly small and the flow rate thus limited the sample thus comes from a very small proportion of the aquifer the installation of annular seals to reseal perforated aquitards is usually not possible due to the small diameter of the borehole and the many tubes and ports protruding from the base pipe finally direct push dp methods allow high resolution sampling e g puls and paul 1997 pitkin et al 1999 schulmeister et al 2004 amos and blowes 2008 dehnert et al 2010 hofmann et al 2010 commonly the dp probe is pushed to the final depth the screen is then released and samples are taken while retracting the probe upwards if the borehole below the currently sampled interval does not fully close flow from this damage zone below the screen may contribute significantly to the sampled water fig 1e pitkin et al 1999 developed a dp method that allows sampling through a small port at the drive point while driving downwards passing through zones of high concentrations may however induce slight dragging down of the contaminant to the next lower sampling depth due to the small port sample volumes are usually 1 l pitkin et al 1999 a general feature of dp is the lack of well development and the absence of a gravel pack therefore turbidity of the sampled water may be an issue due to the pump type usually a foot valve or a peristaltic pump the pumping rate is usually smaller than for regular observation wells the screen length is usually 1 m although resolutions down to 0 1 m have been documented with shorter screens or ports pitkin et al 1999 charette and allen 2006 several studies have shown that dp profiles are on par with more conventional sampling techniques e g schulmeister et al 2004 hofmann et al 2010 since the screen is re moved during the sampling dp usually constitutes a one time sampling and is thus not adequate for continuous monitoring the term multi level well will not be used here as it is sometimes used for both observation wells of the type shown in fig 1b d several previous studies have compared results of different sampling techniques puls and paul 1997 compared samples from three conventional monitoring wells each sampled by submersible pump bailer and depth specific passive sampler and dp sampling 30 cm screen length from a contaminated site their analytical scope was restricted to major ions and some heavy metals amos and blowes 2008 compared observation wells and dp profiles on a contaminated site for major ions and selected gases focusing on volatile organic contaminants hofmann et al 2010 compared groundwater samples obtained from long screened observation wells type fig 1a nested observation wells type fig 1b and direct push sampling fig 1e from three similar agricultural sites major ions stable isotopes and tritium were analyzed they found that long screens even when using packers are inferior to direct push and nested observation wells for both hydrochemical and isotopic analysis a good correlation of hydrochemical parameters between nested observation wells and direct push sampling methods was observed some deviations were found however especially in the shallow samples their site differs from the fuhrberger feld by its coarser granulometry and lower recharge rate 54 mm a hofmann et al 2010 the influence of the final sample collection technique submersible pump bailer passive sampler was studied by barcelona et al 1984 schalla et al 1988 and puls and paul 1997 the rationale of this study is to expand the scope of previously published studies in several ways first of all three methods with three pump types will be compared types fig 1b d and e of which the micro filters have attracted little attention so far secondly the analytical scope goes beyond that of previous studies by addressing in situ parameters major ions trace metals stable and radiogenic isotopes and dissolved gases special emphasis is put on trace gases and isotopes thereof which are important for the interpretation of many hydrochemical and hydrological processes manning et al 2003 e g denitrification weymann

limited choice of gases focusing mostly on volatile chlorinated hydrocarbons schalla et al 1988 amos and blowes 2008 finally the influence of land use is considered here by comparing an agricultural and a forest site previous studies were usually restricted to a single type of land use and forest sites were not considered so far e g puls and paul 1997 amos and blowes 2008 hofmann et al 2010 the fuhrberger feld is especially suited for this type of study since it has already been studied extensively and can be considered somewhat representative for large parts of northwestern europe the hydrological and hydrochemical processes that lead to the observed depth distribution of hydrochemistry dissolved gases and isotopes will not be discussed here 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area groundwater sampling was conducted in the fuhrberger feld which is a rural area surrounding the village of fuhrberg some 30 km north of hanover germany fig 2 its pedological and hydrogeological conditions have been investigated by e g frind et al 1990 böttcher et al 1985 1990 1997 springob et al 2001 weymann et al 1999 and franken et al 2009 besides its agricultural and forestry use the fuhrberger feld provides groundwater for the drinking water supply of hanover and its suburbs frind et al 1990 franken et al 2009 the aquifer is unconfined and comprised of mostly sandy quaternary sediments of 20 30 m thickness with some small silty interglacial deposits intercalated the base of the aquifer consists of glacial till and clay the depth of the water table fluctuates between 0 5 m and 2 5 m below ground surface the hydraulic conductivity is about 5 10 4 m s and the porosity is 0 3 average air temperature is 8 9 c and the mean annual rainfall about 680 mm a groundwater recharge rates depend on the land use 150 mm a for forested and 250 mm a for agricultural plots franken et al 2009 groundwater flows generally from south to north towards the water works however the sampled sites are not immediately affected by the cones of depression of the wells two sites were chosen for sampling fig 2b one in an area dominated by agriculture n5 and one in a forested area s1 this was done to check for effects of different types of land use and groundwater recharge rate the agricultural site is expected to have a more dynamic environment caused by a higher groundwater recharge rate thus a faster vertical transport velocity and a more dynamic hydrochemical input due to annual variations of crop type and fertilization the agricultural plots are sometimes irrigated during dry spells during the growing season this could potentially affect the recharge pattern and age stratification however the irrigation water comes from the same aquifer no surface water and is applied only in times of high plant demand and thus low groundwater recharge summer an influence on recharge patterns is thus unlikely the nearest irrigation well is more than 1 km away the forest site is densely stocked with both deciduous trees and conifers of various ages and shrub undergrowth 2 2 groundwater sampling at both sites a nest of four individual observation wells with different screen depths was available type fig 1b each with a screen of 1 m length and a diameter of two inch all were installed in the early 1980 s they were sampled using a grundfos mp1 submersible pump at pumping rates between 100 and 200 l h samples were taken after removing at least five borehole volumes and after stable values for the in situ parameters measured in a flow through cell were reached total drawdown was kept smaller than 20 of the height of the initial water column the initial depth to groundwater was 1 6 m for the forest site and 2 5 m for the agricultural site respectively a custom made micro filter system consisting of an assembly of thin tubes of 3 mm inner and 5 mm outer diameter protruding to different depths type fig 1d was available at both sites they were installed in the mid 1990 s at the tip each tube is equipped with a micro screen consisting of a plastic cylinder of 1 cm diameter and 10 cm length filled with quartz wool which is open at the bottom a peristaltic pump was used for sampling ismatech bmp due to the small tube diameter only a very low flow rate of a few ml min was obtained usually three ports were pumped at the same time to fasten the process and to promote horizontal flow to the port flow rates varied from port to port probably due to different degrees of clogging additionally a direct push sampling of groundwater was performed at both sites the rig used was a sg 0 12 by nordmeyer peine germany the casing was first pushed down to the final depth then the wire wound stainless steel screen of 1 m length was released and sampling took place step wise 1 m interval going from bottom to top using a foot valve pump installed at the screen top pumping rates were on the order of 10 s of l h the casing had a diameter of 38 mm 1 5 in while the screen had 25 mm 1 in at both sites all observation well and micro filter samples were taken within one day the direct push sampling took place one week later considering the low flow velocity of groundwater this time lag is negligible for both sites all samplings were spatially very close to each other within a 5 m radius to minimize the influence of lateral hydrochemical heterogeneities sampling took place in november 2015 with outside temperatures close to the average groundwater temperature of 10 c the observation wells of site n5 were resampled in september 2016 yielding almost identical results 2 3 hydrogeochemical analysis the analytical methods for water chemistry are summarized in table 1 the cation samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter in the field and then acidified to ph 2 with ultrapure nitric acid merck for stabilization the anion sample was not conditioned all sample bottles were brought to the laboratory on the sampling day and stored in the dark at 4 c prior to analysis 2 4 water isotope analysis the stable water isotope values δ2h and δ18o were analyzed using a cavity ring down laser spectrometer of the type picarro l2140 i on vaporized samples the accuracies for an independently measured quality check sample were better than 0 2 and 0 8 for δ18o and δ2h respectively delta values were measured relative to the vsmow slap scale vienna standard mean ocean water standard light antarctic precipitation tritium was determined by its decay product 3he at the institute of environmental physics at the university of bremen details on the analysis technique can be found in sültenfuβ et al 2009 samples were degassed and stored for 3he accumulation for about 100 days precision is better than 3 the detection limit for this data set is 0 02 tu tritium units for all observation wells and some direct push samples duplicates were taken and analyzed for neon and helium data for both agree well within the expected uncertainties for groundwater sampling 3 2 5 dissolved gas analysis for the analysis of dissolved nitrogen and argon bubble free groundwater samples were taken in 120 ml bottles with crimp cap and septum without headspace all bottles were allowed to overflow several minutes before placing the crimp cap the dissolved nitrogen and argon concentrations were measured with a membrane inlet gas chromatography mass spectrometer migcms e g kana et al 1994 before measurement all bottles were brought to room temperature directly before analysis the cap and septum were removed each sample was pumped along a gas permeable membrane dissolved gases diffused through the membrane into a sample loop helium was used as carrier gas the gas in the sample loop was further pumped through a porapakq column to separate n2 ar and o2 from water vapor and other gases the gas mixture is then passed through a second column mol sieve 5a to split up n2 ar and o2 the membrane and all columns are tempered to 60 c detection and quantification was performed with a quadrupole mass spectrometer calibration was performed with tap water equilibrated with ambient air at known temperature and pressure gas solubilities for calibration were taken from weiss 1970 samples for dissolved hydrocarbons methane were collected in 120 ml glass bottles with teflon coated butyl rubber seals and aluminum crimp caps samples were not acidified but immediately analyzed after arrival in the laboratory dissolved methane was determined applying a headspace equilibration method capasso and inguaggiato 1998 kampbell and vandegrift 1998 25 ml of the water was replaced by laboratory grade helium 5 9 and the samples equilibrated at a temperature of 20 c for at least two hours on a laboratory shaker see schloemer et al 2016 for details prior to the following measurements the total pressure in the glass bottles was measured using a pressure transducer range 0 160 kpa 0 8 kpa accuracy the concentration of methane was determined by gas chromatography gc using an agilent 6890 equipped with a manual split splitless injector and flame ionisation detector the quantification limit is approximately 0 2 ppm hydrocarbon in the sample gas the concentration of methane dissolved in groundwater was calculated using the partial pressure of the gases in equilibrium with the water derived from fractional concentration and total headspace pressure equilibration temperature volume of gas water and henry s law constant the relative error of the gc analysis is around 3 throughout the text we refer to volume concentrations of the dissolved gases nl l at a temperature of 293 k and a pressure of 101 325 pa the isotopic composition of methane was measured applying a cryo focussing with liquid nitrogen of the dissolved methane on a 1 m 1 16 packed column this system was coupled to a delta plus xl the lower quantification limit for the δ13c value of methane is 700 nl l isotope ratios are given in the standard notation versus the pee dee belemnite pdb standard coplen 2011 the average deviation on duplicates is 0 3 samples for analysis of helium isotopes and neon were taken in 40 cm3 copper tubes after flushing the tubes were squeezed with clamps to avoid any gas exchange during storage gases were extracted from water in a high vacuum system helium and neon were separated from other sample gases with a cryo system and admitted to the mass spectrometer the sample measurements were calibrated with atmospheric air analytical errors are 1 for he 2 for ne and 0 5 for 3he 4he ratios sültenfuβ et al 2009 separation of 3he from tritium decay tritiogenic 3he and radiogenic 4he from other he sources were performed after kipfer et al 2002 and references therein 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ parameters in the field different ec and ph probes were used for the observation wells and the micro filters on one hand and for the direct push samples on the other hand it was therefore decided to use the specific electrical conductivity ec and ph measurements from the laboratory which were done with identical equipment and at stable temperatures the ec values of the groundwater samples show similar depth trends for the three sampling methods at both sites fig 3 however for the forest site s1 the ec values from direct push are higher by more than 100 μs cm between 6 and 12 m fig 3b this coincides with a fine sand layer in some parts with silt as minor component fig 2c it could be argued that the borehole of the direct push did not close in this part allowing water to flow towards the well from below where higher ec values are found the general trend of increasing ph with depth was found by all methods fig 4 water of low ph is predominantly found in the uppermost meters of the water column probably due to atmospheric acid deposition again values from direct push are higher by up to one ph unit between 3 and 12 m but a better fit is found below 12 m again a possible explanation could be the inflow of deeper groundwater of higher ph from below the sampled interval through a borehole that did not close entirely hofmann et al 2010 also encountered the highest deviations between the sampling methods for shallow samples that is in a zone where steep geochemical gradients tend to occur groundwater in the fuhrberger feld is generally very reducing and dissolved oxygen concentrations are almost always below the detection limit even for the uppermost samples additionally the very low flow rates of the micro filters render measurements of both oxygen and redox potential dubious 3 2 water isotopes the concentrations of tritium obtained from all three sampling methods are in good agreement for the agricultural site n5 fig 5 a for the forest site s1 tritium concentrations are reasonably close to each other for the four depths where information is available from all three sampling methods fig 5b however there are noticeable deviations of up to 4 tu between the tritium profiles obtained from the micro filters and direct push sampling especially between 6 and 12 m and below 16 m the latter deviation might be due to an admixture of older water from below where a gravel layer is present with their higher pumping rate the direct push samples are more prone to induce flow from below than the micro filters with their very low pumping rate it should be noted that the profile at n5 shows a continuous tritium decrease over depth indicating a continuous recharge process while at s1 lateral inflow might has to be considered since tritium increases below 8 m again for the stable water isotopes the agricultural site n5 shows a marked variability over depth fig 6 a this probably reflects the highly dynamical input characteristic caused by seasonal and annual variations of crop types groundwater recharge and irrigation the variations underline the need for a high resolution of depth specific sampling in such a dynamic environment for the forest site all sampling methods result in similar stable isotope values at least when considering the analytical uncertainty fig 6b the micro filters generally show slightly higher values than the ones obtained from direct push the variation over depth in general is rather small reflecting the stable hydrological environment of a slowly growing forest 3 3 hydrochemistry the main ion chemistry of groundwater shows a distinct depth dependency at both sites figs 7 9 here two anions chloride sulfate and one cation calcium are shown as examples chloride was chosen since it is usually considered to be a conservative non reactive ion all sampling methods are able to recreate the general concentrations trends over depth of all ions reasonably well but there are significant deviations for some samples again in the depth interval between 6 and 12 m below surface where deviations between 20 and 40 and locally up to 200 and more are common in the case of calcium significant deviations are also found again below 16 m depth at the s1 site fig 9b where direct push samples yield around 65 mg l calcium while the micro filters show around 40 mg l a deviation by a factor of 1 6 a comparably close fit mostly 0 01 mg l of the three sampling methods was obtained for the trace metal zinc fig 10 especially for the s1 site fig 10b however it also shows the general problem of comparing methods with varying depth resolutions in the presence of steep geochemical gradients e g around 6 m at n5 or of local outliers e g between 14 and 17 m at s1 the reasons behind these deviations in the concentrations of the investigated hydrochemical constituents may be manifold the micro filters sample only a very small interval and volume of the aquifer while both the observation wells and the direct push samples average over an interval of at least one meter the pumping rates of the three methods are different on a logarithmic scale going from hundreds of l h observation wells to tens of l h direct push and finally a few l h micro filter they thus tap different volumes of the aquifer direct push samples always carry the potential problem that water may flow from underneath the currently sampled depth when the borehole has not closed completely after pulling up the screen to the next depth interval finally the direct push samples are often turbid and the standard filtration of 0 45 μm might not remove all colloids which then end up being analyzed as dissolved species to test the latter hypothesis the concentrations of silicon as sio2 were compared fig 11 silicon was chosen because it is commonly not only present as dissolved silicic acid but often also in the form of colloids and micro particles colloids clay and also calcite particles are often not removed during the standard 0 45 μm filtration used in groundwater sampling kennedy et al 1974 indeed in most cases the direct push samples show higher silicon values than the other sampling techniques by up to 3 mg l especially for the interval between 7 and 12 m for site s1 fig 11b which showed some distinct deviations for e g calcium fig 9b on the other hand both chloride and sulfate were also enriched in this interval at s1 and especially chloride is usually not part of colloids or particles 3 4 dissolved gases the solubility at 10 c of nitrogen and argon in fresh groundwater in equilibrium with the atmosphere is 647 and 17 2 μmol l respectively the measured concentrations of both dissolved gases show that the micro filters yield significantly lower values up to 30 than the observation wells and the direct push samples fig 12 the latter two are actually quite similar at both sites the general trends of concentration over depth at least for the s1 site are visible for all sampling methods fig 12b the solubility of methane in fresh groundwater in equilibrium with the atmosphere air ch4 content of 1 7 ppm is around 70 nl l 3 nmol l at 10 c the concentrations of dissolved methane at the fuhrberg site are significantly higher indicating in aquifer production compared to other groundwater samples from northwestern germany the absolute concentrations are however rather small schloemer et al 2016 concentrations obtained from the micro filters are significantly lower sometimes up to an order of magnitude fig 13 especially when compared to those from direct push the δ13c of the dissolved methane shows a very inconclusive behavior the deviations between the sampling methods at the same depth have a magnitude of several 10 s of in some cases far higher than the analytical uncertainty of around 1 fig 14 this is especially pronounced for the agricultural site fig 14a whereas the spread in the more stable forest environment is distinctly smaller this shows that the carbon isotopic composition of methane can be very sensitive if the initial absolute concentration of methane is low to which degree the strongly enriched δ13c methane of the direct push samples at very shallow depths 4m is a result of sampling procedure or actually reflecting a natural variation cannot be decided although the n5 site is highly dynamic and about 10 days have been elapsed between sampling with intermittent rainfall these variations are probably too large to be simply explained in terms of a microbiologically mediated methane oxidation process moreover this should be accompanied by a decrease in methane concentration which has not been observed for the s1 site observation wells and micro filters show identical values down to 7 m while direct push are slightly depleted in δ 13c by about 5 between 9 and 14 m all methods are matching exactly however below 15 m depth methane extracted from direct push samples is again depleted in the heavier isotope the difference in methane isotopy between the forest and the agricultural side may be an effect of the different photosynthesis types of plants present in both locations c3 plants such as wheat rye but also trees have 13c signatures between 25 and 29 while c4 plants such as corn and some grasses show values ranging between 12 and 16 bender 1968 1971 o leary 1988 while basically all plants in the forest are of the c3 type the c4 plant corn is frequently part of the cropping cycle in the fuhrberger feld the dissolved organic carbon in soil seepage from the agricultural sites with their rotation of c3 and c4 plants should therefore have a higher spread in its carbon isotopy than that from the forest this is indeed visible in fig 14 the measured signatures for both sites are however much more negative than the values mentioned above this indicates additional subsurface bacterial methane production which usually produces signatures lower than 50 whiticar 1999 the forest site lies within the typical range of 50 to 60 for bacterial fermentation of methylated organic substrates whiticar 1999 the very low signatures in the agricultural site could indicate inorganic carbonate as an additional source of methane since methyl fermentation would not produce values below 70 whiticar 1999 the solubility of helium in fresh groundwater in equilibrium at 10 c water temperature with the atmosphere is 4 65 10 5 nml kg nml normal milliliter at t 273 15 k p 1013 25 hpa dissolved helium again shows significantly lower concentrations in the micro filters compared to the other two methods fig 15 this is very pronounced for the older and helium enriched groundwater of site s1 where the micro filter results deviate from those from direct push by factors ranging between two and ten this would seriously affect tritium helium age dating where tritiogenic helium is one of the two key input parameters interestingly the observation wells show values somewhat lower than the direct push samples only for the three deeper direct push samples a nearly constant concentration of 3 10 5 nml kg for radiogenic 4he was found this indicates admixture of older water if this is assumed to be tritium free this explains the reduced tritium concentration in the deepest samples fig 5 and maybe also the deviations in calcium fig 9 the solubility of neon in fresh groundwater at 10 c in equilibrium with the atmosphere is 2 02 10 4 nml kg as neon has only atmospheric sources an excess points to an inclusion of air during recharge typical values are 10 30 excess ne a loss of neon as evident in fig 16 can be explained by degassing gas samples from micro filters have gas concentrations lower by 10 20 compared to direct push as the pumping with a peristaltic pump generates an underpressure except for the deeper direct push samples samples of s1 neon excess undersaturation fig 16 agrees well with helium excess undersaturation respectively fig 15 stripping of dissolved gases by excess nitrogen or methane gas should not affect gas isotope ratios significantly the 3he 4he ratio is triggered by the decay of tritium in these shallow aquifers studies here profiles of δ3he are shown in fig 15 for s1 massive differences between micro filter and direct push samples were detected the general finding that the micro filters tend to yield lower dissolved gas concentrations than the other two methods can probably be attributed to several features of the sampling technique which disrupt the gas water equilibrium the peristaltic pump creates a pulsed flow and locally an underpressure in the tube which can induce significant degassing barcelona et al 1984 smaller additional losses may occur by gas diffusion through the plastic tube during the upward passage of water provided that the concentrations outside are lower due to the small flow rate the fluid travels through the tube for several minutes especially when coming from greater depth the tubes have a high surface area to volume ratio due to their small inner diameter of 3 mm they are also several years old so their gas permeability may have increased over time however we do not consider this to be the dominant process to explain the δ3he differences as it is not supported by the under saturated neon and argon concentrations helium is more likely to get lost by exchange with the atmosphere either induced by the peristaltic pump or the slow filling of the copper tube in the field in practice the low pumping rate of the peristaltic pump may require several minutes to fill the sample bottles during which a new equilibrium might be established with atmospheric air it should be noted however that the measured gas concentrations are with the exception of nitrogen usually lower than the atmospheric equilibrium and thus this last process is also not probable this is confirmed by molofsky et al 2016 who found that methane losses from open sample bottles are small unless effervescence occurs at high concentrations in our case gas concentrations are usually far below equilibrium it should be noted that gas losses from groundwater may also occur under natural conditions leading to concentrations below equilibrium for example in denitrifying environments nitrate is converted into nitrogen gas which may form gas bubbles at least in shallow parts of the aquifer they might escape to the unsaturated zone and ultimately the atmosphere this gas phase can additionally strip other gases from the fluid the fuhrberger feld is known for denitrification böttcher et al 1985 1990 and the measured nitrogen concentrations in fig 12 indeed exceed equilibrium concentrations the ph of the shallow samples is also rather low at ph 4 5 fig 4 indicating that bicarbonate is converted into co2 which might also escape via bubbles formed by other gases these processes would however affect all sampling techniques equally but would be restricted to shallow samples from agricultural sites 4 conclusions depth specific analysis of groundwater is necessary to obtain detailed insights into flow and reactive transport processes in aquifers groundwater samples from observation wells were compared to ones from micro filters and the direct push technique for two sites one a highly dynamical agricultural plot and the other from a more stable forest plot it should be noted that both sites sample an unconfined and unconsolidated sandy aquifer in bedrock aquifers the geochemical zonation can be severely influenced by the location of fractures and their hydraulic properties the geochemical trends reflected in the depth profiles for both sites show that a high resolution of depth specific sampling of at least one meter is needed to actually see these trends and also peaks and outliers with the limited number of observation wells alone many of these features would have gone unnoticed each sampling method has its advantages and disadvantages regarding to cost spatial resolution and susceptibility to steep hydrochemical gradients as table 2 and fig 17 show the pumping rate varies over orders of magnitude the volume of water pumped during a sampling or in other words the volume of aquifer affected influences the sample composition a large volume will even out small scale hydrochemical heterogeneities which might locally bias the micro filter results on the other hand large volumes might lead to a blurring of steep gradients the micro filters are probably the most depth specific as hardly any flow from above or below the inlet is induced they are thus very useful when small scale variations and steep gradients need to be resolved on the other hand they are prone to local effects as they do not average out hydrochemical heterogeneity well screens always induce vertical flow components and thus inflow peaks at their top and bottom houben and hauschild 2011 houben 2015 this results in an admixture of water from above and below the screened interval fig 17 especially if a layer of higher permeability is tapped if the pump is installed above the screen which is commonly the case the peak at the top of the screen is usually more pronounced than that at the bottom korom et al 2003 such screens could therefore have a bias towards more shallow water than indicated by their screened depth for direct push water may additionally come preferentially from below the current screen depth if the borehole did not completely close after lifting the casing to the next sampling depth in this case the water sample would be biased towards deeper water fig 17 unfortunately it is difficult to predict under which circumstances the borehole might not close the forward working dp method of pitkin et al 1999 might be a better choice under such circumstances the micro filters showed a weak performance for dissolved gases because significant concentrations are lost via degassing due to the low flow rate and the pump type barcelona et al 1984 they should thus not be used for the assessment of dissolved gases in groundwater e g in the context of the occurrence of stray gas around shale gas wells for any age dating technique that relies on the measurement of dissolved trace gases e g tritium helium krypton 85 cfc or the determination of paleo temperatures from noble gases the hydrochemical zonation underlying a highly dynamic agricultural environment with seasonally varying hydrological phytological and hydrochemical boundary conditions can be very complex at a small scale different sampling techniques will then easily show much higher deviations from each other than those obtained from a more stable setting such as a forest the differing boundary conditions of the sampling methods described above need to be considered when comparing samples from the same depth e g the depth interval that the screen taps the pumping rate the pump type the travel time the sample spends in the sampling system and the sample preparation e g turbidity filtration of the sample only when all of these influences are considered will we not be comparing apples and oranges acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the state authority for mining energy and geology lbeg of lower saxony especially peter

oxidizing conditions at the xks sb mine as the haso4 2 anion the ca na ratio correlates significantly with hco3 na and sr na ratios indicating that carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling groundwater hydrochemistry the δ34s values of the groundwater indicate that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater is mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals and elevated as concentrations in groundwater are influenced by the mixing of mine water and surface water furthermore the δ34s values are not correlated with dissolved as concentrations and fe concentrations suggesting that the reduction dissolution of fe iii hydroxides is not the dominant process controlling as mobilization the 87sr 86sr ratios imply that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with the stibnite and silicified limestone more specifically the excess na ion the feature of ca na ratio and the spatial association of elevated as concentrations in groundwater collectively suggest that high and anomalous high arsenic groundwater are associated with smelting slags and in particular the arsenic alkali residue in general the hydrochemistry analysis especially the s and sr isotope evidences elucidate that elevated as concentrations and as mobilization are influenced by several geochemical processes including 1 bedrock weathering 2 oxidation of arsenopyrite and the dominant sulfides in the ores 3 mixing of mine drainage and surface water 4 leaching of the arsenic alkali residue and 5 sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides keywords arsenic 34ssulfate 87sr 86sr groundwater hydrochemistry xikuangshan 1 introduction arsenic is a ubiquitous toxic and carcinogenic element in the environment high arsenic concentrations in groundwater have been found in many parts of the world including bangladesh india vietnam china hungary ghana argentina chile mexico and the usa smedley and kinniburgh 2002 elevated arsenic concentrations are usually the result of mobilization under natural conditions and anthropogenesis related to mining activity smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mobilization of as under reducing conditions in alluvial aquifers has been widely documented benner et al 2008 berg et al 2001 busbee et al 2009 charlet and polya 2006 islam et al 2004 kao et al 2013 mcarthur et al 2004 xie et al 2009 xie et al 2013a whereas mobilization under oxidizing conditions is also responsible for as contamination problems in bedrock aquifers heinrichs and udluft 1999 lipfert et al 2007 sidle et al 2001 smedley et al 2002 particularly in groundwater systems affected by mining activity frau and ardau 2003 gemici et al 2008 hiller et al 2012 johannesson and tang 2009 ondrejkova et al 2013 in the world s largest antimony sb mine xikuangshan xks sb mine of hunan province central china groundwater from the magunao aquifer provides an important source of potable water and waterborne arsenic poisoning was first reported in 1961 wu and shui 1984 various studies have examined the extent of the as contamination in soil surface water and mine wastes as well as in organisms fu et al 2016 fu et al 2010 guo et al 2014 mo et al 2013 zhu et al 2009 however less attention has been given to the geochemical behaviors of as in the groundwater environment at the xks sb mine xie et al 2016 the highest value of dissolved as that has been detected in the magunao aquifer groundwater at the xks sb mine is 680 µg l nyirenda et al 2015 our previous study focused on the antimony contamination in the magunao and shetianqiao aquifers from the xks sb mine using the s and sr isotope approach wen et al 2016 it is interesting to note that not only antimony but also arsenic occurs in the two aquifers at concentrations greater than world health organization who guideline and china s drinking water standard moh and sac 2006 who 2004 which represents a significant threat to the local drinking water supplies furthermore there has been an increase in resource development of this mine area thus though the potential sources of arsenic are thought to be the arsenic alkali residues that are produced from the smelting process guo et al 2014 li and liang 2010 it is imperative to identify the processes that control arsenic mobility in groundwater for alleviating the health hazards associated with long term exposure to high arsenic groundwater a number of mechanisms have been suggested to explain elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater including the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydroxides nickson et al 2000 swartz et al 2004 desorption of fe oxides hydroxides casiot et al 2005 smedley et al 2002 and reduction of as v to as iii bose and sharma 2002 as well as the oxidation of as bearing sulfides schreiber et al 2000 verplanck et al 2008 a change in ph or in redox conditions the presence of natural organic matter nom and reactivity of bacteria are known to affect arsenic mobilization in groundwater bauer and blodau 2006 harvey et al 2002 islam et al 2004 mcarthur et al 2001 the biogeochemical cycles of as have been linked to s and sulfur and arsenic often share similar microbial redox transformations fisher et al 2008 tisserand et al 2014 wang et al 2014 sulfur isotopes are help in groundwater studies involving sulfides and varying redox conditions lipfert et al 2007 sidle et al 2001 tisserand et al 2014 xie et al 2013b considerable sulfur isotope fractionation occurs when bacteria reduce sulfate to sulfide bottcher et al 2001 nakai and jensen 1964 while little or no sulfur isotope fractionation occurs when sulfide is oxidized to sulfate strebel et al 1990 taylor et al 1984 strontium isotopes are a sensitivity indicator for high arsenic groundwater sources flow paths mixing processes water rock interaction and anthropogenic contamination in groundwater systems khaska et al 2015 potot et al 2012 vinson et al 2011 xie et al 2013c no measurable strontium isotope fractionation occurs during mineral precipitation and dissolution and the value of the strontium isotope in an aqueous phase is closely related to that of rock and ore barbieri and morotti 2003 naftz et al 1997 negrel et al 2001 therefore sulfur and strontium isotopes are powerful tools for tracing s cycling and the mobilization of arsenic within aquifers the aim of this study was to analyze the groundwater from a historical arsenic anomaly area at the xks sb mine and elucidate the geochemical processes affecting arsenic mobilization in the bedrock aquifer system our approach of identifying the elevated arsenic concentrations by s and sr isotopes may be applicable to other regions with similar conditions 2 study area 2 1 climate and mining the xks sb mine consists of north mine and south mine covers approximately 26 km2 ranges in elevation from 220 m to 823 2 m above mean sea level m s l and lies in a mountainous region the climate is characterized by high annual precipitation hot summers and warm winters for the period 1949 2012 the mean annual temperature was 16 7 c while the average annual precipitation and evaporation were 1381 mm and 903 3 mm respectively several rivers such as xuanshan river qingfeng river feishuiyan stream tanjia stream and batangshan stream are distributed in the study area the xks sb mine is an active mine which was first mined in 1897 hundreds of smelting plants were in the xks area and a large amount of solid waste has been produced by the mining processing and smelting specifically the antimony smelting activities have historically produced 2 00 000 tons of arsenic alkali residue the majority of which was not handled properly and was piled up in the open air guo et al 2014 li and liang 2010 arsenic alkali residue is generated during the antimony refining process in a reverberatory furnace in which any as is removed by the addition of sodium hydroxide guo et al 2014 currently two smelting plants still exist in the xks sb mine area 2 2 geological setting the xks sb deposit follows the axis of a half edge anticline at ne30 and plunges north and south fan et al 2004 the west and east of the anticline are cut by a large fault no 75 and a 10 km long lamprophyre dike respectively the upper devonian xikuangshan and shetianqiao formations occur in the core of the anticline surrounded by the datang and yanguan formations of lower carboniferous fan et al 2004 the shetianqiao formation consists of three sections which are mainly composed of limestone bioclastic micrite chert silicified limestone shale sandstone and dolostone the xks sb deposit occurs as stratiform bodies and veins in the upper part silicified limestone layers of the shetianqiao formation and constitutes 80 of the total sb reserves of the deposit fan et al 2004 in addition a small sb ore bed occurs in the middle devonian qiziqiao formation which is mainly composed of micritic and bioclastic limestone the xks sb deposit is a specific middle low temperature mineralization depression zone with rich deposits of antimony mercury gold zinc lead arsenic and coal fu et al 2016 liu et al 2010 the wallrock alterations are mostly silication and carbonatization yang et al 2006b the mineral and element compositions are simple stibnite sb2s3 is the main ore mineral trace levels of pyrite arsenopyrite pyrrhotite and sphalerite occur in the deposit along with primary gangue minerals quatz and calcite and secondary gangue minerals such as barite fluorite gypsum and pyrophyllite fan et al 2004 yang et al 2006b the average as content of the regional carboniferous and devonian strata is 10 1 and 11 6 ppm respectively zou 1988 in the xks sb mine area the as value of sb ores is 43 6 180 3 ppm zou 1988 the as contents of silicified limestone is 4 5 26 3 ppm while that of non silicified limestone is 0 8 6 1 ppm ma et al 2002 2 3 hydrogeological setting in the xks sb mine area two main groundwater systems are present these are the lower shetianqiao karst aquifer a aquifer and the upper magunao karst aquifer b aquifer systems fig 1 the lamprophyre vein and fault no 75 are considered the east and west impervious boundaries of the groundwater systems respectively the a aquifer consists of micrite limestone silicified limestone and shale with a thickness of 220 m and hosts the sb ore bodies karst caves and fractures develop in this aquifer with an average hydraulic conductivity of 0 041 m d the b aquifer is mainly composed of limestone and sandy limestone with a thickness of 258 m many springs occur in this aquifer with an average hydraulic conductivity of 0 0092 m d the b aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for the community of xks formations between the two major aquifers are aquifuges and composed of calcareous shale argillaceous limestone and a 20 m thick hematite layer with a total thickness of 230 m both a aquifer and b aquifer crop out substantially in the xks sb mine area they are recharged by precipitation and discharged by springs with the groundwater flow direction moving from southeast to northwest in the north mine and from northeast to southwest in the south mine furthermore another groundwater system out of the lamprophyre vein and fault no 75 called carboniferous fracture aquifer c aquifer is present in the datang and yanguan formations of lower carboniferous fig 1 3 sampling and analytical methods 3 1 groundwater sampling hydrochemical and isotopic analyses conducted in november 2013 in the xks sb mine area involved collecting a total of twenty eight water samples including twenty three spring samples from a aquifer a b aquifer b and c aquifer c one mine water sample and four surface water samples sw from qingfeng river tanjia stream feishuiyan stream and xuanshan river the locations of the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 all water samples were filtered on site through 0 45 µm acid washed membrane filters and stored in pre cleaned 500 ml hdpe bottles the samples for major cation trace element and sr isotope measurements were acidified to ph 2 with ultrapure hno3 and one bottle of each water sample was left unacidified

analytical precision for all cation and anion measurements was checked again by calculating the ionic balance errors and the ionic balance errors were generally within 5 field and laboratory blanks were below detection limits for all species the δ34sso4 values were determined at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan the analysis of the sulfur isotope was performed by a thermal conversion element analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometer tc ea irms after the complete conversion of baso4 to so2 via a high temperature combustion with o2 and v2o5 at 1030 c the reproducibility of the δ34sso4 analysis of baso4 was better than 0 2 the sulfur isotope ratios are reported in the usual delta notation in units of and the δ34s values

accuracy of 0 000020 based on repeated analyses of nbs987 blanks for the entire procedure did not exceed 0 12 ng sr 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry groundwater at the xks sb mine is weak alkaline with a ph ranging from 7 04 to 8 51 average 7 78 and total dissolved solids tds of these waters vary from 142 48 to 837 48 mg l table 1 field eh measurements vary from 71 to 280 mv table 1 in comparison with groundwater surface water has a slightly higher ph and tds and the tds values of mine water is the highest overall redox conditions are significantly oxygenated groundwater at the xks sb mine is the ca hco3 so4 to ca so4 hco3 type surface water is ca na so4 hco3 type and the major element compositions are highly variable among springs table 1 the groundwater is characterized by high concentrations of so4 2 ranging from 57 51 to 697 12 mg l with an average of 174 18 mg l and contains large amounts of ca average 95 76 mg l and hco3 average 186 94 mg l table 1 a na normalized ca versus hco3 plot fig 2 a shows that the aquifer samples range from being influenced by carbonate dissolution to silicate weathering gaillardet et al 1999 mukherjee and fryar 2008 additionally the plot of ca na vs sr na in the waters is presented in fig 2b along the mixing line with carbonate and silicate end members obtained by gaillardet et al 1999 it is evidence that the process controlling groundwater hydrochemistry in this study area is dominated by carbonate dissolution the silicate weathering is also an important controlling process especially for the a aquifer fig 2a which is associated with silication and mining activities the dissolved as concentrations in groundwater from the xks sb mine range from 0 to 1274 0 µg l with an average of 164 8 µg l which far exceeds china s and the who guideline s drinking water standard of 10 µg l who 2004 moh and sac 2006 the dissolved as concentration in the mine water is 209 9 µg l whereas the concentrations in surface water range from 152 1 to 2545 0 µg l with an average of 1694 8 µg l indicating that mining and smelting waste water or leaching liquid from the solid wastes have been discharged into the river wang et al 2011 twenty three groundwater samples can be divided into three groups based on dissolved as concentrations in groundwater low arsenic groundwater 0 50 µg l 14 samples high arsenic groundwater 50 1000 µg l 7 samples and anomalous high arsenic groundwater 1000 µg l 2 samples spatial variations in dissolved as concentrations are displayed in fig 1 although the distribution of as in these groundwaters is distinctly variable there is a tendency for the high and anomalous high arsenic concentrations to occur in smelting areas fig 1 unlike many major constituents dissolved as concentrations do not covary with tds fig 3 a furthermore dissolved as concentrations do not covary with dissolved hco3 f or fe fig 3b c and e however there is a positive correlation between dissolved as concentrations and b and v for the b aquifer fig 3f and g arsenic is mainly associated with antimony as a sulfide or oxide hale 1981 unfortunately data on dissolved sb concentrations in these waters were not available during the data analysis while as concentrations correlate with so4 concentrations for some samples from the a aquifer and the b aquifer this indicates that elevated as concentrations seem to be associated with mining activities which can accelerate the dissolution of as sb bearing sulfide minerals under oxidized conditions resulting in the elevated as concentrations as well as dissolved fe concentrations in groundwater in particular for the a aquifer however it is interesting to note that in comparison with the high as groundwater from datong basin wang et al 2014 the groundwaters have relatively low fe concentrations fig 3e most of the groundwater samples 100 µg l in addition to a few water samples though a considerable amount of fe bearing minerals pyrite arsenopyrite pyrrhotite and hematite occur in the strata in this study area yang et al 2006a yang 1986 this should be attributed to the weak alkaline conditions that result in fe iii precipitates fig 3h which leads to the attenuation of dissolved fe concentrations nyirenda et al 2015 in general as a result of the oxidized condition of the groundwaters as ⅴ haso4 2 is the dominant species present robertson 1989 fig 3h 4 2 isotope geochemistry 4 2 1 δ34s of dissolved so4 2 δ34s is commonly utilized to trace the groundwater source of so4 2 and biogeochemistry processes associated with the as iii and as ⅴ oxidation states kao et al 2015 sidle 2002 xie et al 2009 sulfide minerals are a common source of natural geogenic arsenic tisserand et al 2014 previous studies have revealed that little or no sulfur isotope fractionation occurs when sulfide is oxidized to sulfate strebel et al 1990 taylor et al 1984 and the s isotope of sulfate in groundwater from oxidized sulfide minerals is very close to that of the precursor sulfide mineral gammons et al 2013 fig 4 a shows the values of δ34s of various sulfides from the xks sb mine area the δ34s values of stibnite sb2s3 range from 3 3 to 16 8 with a mean of 7 4 while the majority of stibnite has a narrow range 5 to 10 ma et al 2003 yang et al 2006a the average δ34s value of pyrite in limestone strata is 26 4 whereas that of pyrite in the lamprophyre dike is 5 4 yang et al 2006a yang 1986 the δ34s values of arsenopyrite and sphalerite range from 8 85 to 6 91 yang 1986 and the average δ34s value of gypsum is 22 4 in the regional strata jiang et al 1990 data for δ34s in 23 groundwater samples are plotted against 1 so4 2 concentrations in fig 4b the values average 1 75 and show moderate variation 0 7 to 4 7 except for sample b6 in comparison of the δ34s values of sulfides from the xks sb mine area indicates that the δ34s values of the sample b6 is not available δ34s values in groundwater sulfates correlate with those of sulfides from the xks sb mine area as documented in our previous study wen et al 2016 it is evident that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater was mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals stibnite pyrite arsenopyrite and sphalerite a negative correlation between δ34s values and so4 2 concentrations r2 0 54 in the b aquifer may indicate a slight bacterial so4 reduction because this reduction induces dissolved so4 2 to become isotopically enriched in 34s with a decreasing concentration bottcher et al 2001 nakai and jensen 1964 additionally fig 4b shows that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater is mainly influenced by mine water and surface water although end member sources of so4 2 mine water surface water and rainwater from the study area are not distinct from those in the coal mine area gammons et al 2013 and dissolved so4 2 in groundwater may have other end member sources surface water with high so4 2 concentrations may be influenced not only by mine drainage but also by the leaching liquid from the waste rocks and slags of the antimony ore previous studies have documented that δ34s allows a better understanding of as mobilization fisher et al 2008 xie et al 2009 and so4 reducing bacteria preferentially utilize 32s and result in heavier 34s in residual so4 2 bottcher et al 2001 nakai and jensen 1964 the bacteria reduction of fe iii hydroxides can result in heavier δ34s values with elevated arsenic concentrations lipfert et al 2007 xie et al 2013b wang et al 2014 additionally the reduction of amorphous fe iii hydroxides with minor bacteria so4 reduction can also result in heavier δ34s values with elevated total fe concentrations xie et al 2013b fig 4c and d show the variation of δ34s values in dissolved so4 2 with fe and as concentrations respectively in these weak alkaline waters dissolved fe concentrations are controlled by redox conditions and ferrous is the dominant species fig 3h there is no correlation between δ34s values and dissolved fe and as concentrations fig 4c and d and elevated dissolved as concentrations do not generally occur in the relatively lower oxygenated waters table 1 furthermore dissolved as concentrations do not correlate with dissolved fe concentrations fig 3e thus comparison of the variation of δ34s values with fe and as concentrations in the alluvial aquifer xie et al 2013b even in a fractured bedrock aquifer lipfert et al 2007 indicates that the reduction dissolution of fe iii hydroxides is unlikely to be involved in the elevated as concentrations in groundwater and bacterial so4 reduction is weakly correlated with as enrichment in groundwater from the xks sb mine 4 2 2 87sr 86sr ratios sr isotope ratios in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with host aquifer rocks harrington and herczeg 2003 vinson et al 2011 and they can represent the composition of the host aquifer rocks in particular of multiple rock types initial 87sr 86sr ratios can be modified by mixing groundwater as it flows through different rocks and ores the 87sr 86sr ratios of 23 groundwater samples range from 0 70 828 to 0 71 061 fig 5 our previous study suggests that the sr isotope ratios of the host aquifer rocks have three types that include 1 non silicified limestone with high sr concentrations and low sr isotope ratios 2 silicified limestone and stibnite with low sr concentrations and moderate sr isotope ratios and 3 rb rich silicified limestone with moderate sr concentrations and relatively high sr isotope ratios wen et al 2016 radiogenic sr in groundwater may be sourced from silicified limestone and stibnite in the a aquifer while non radiogenic sr may be sourced from the limestone wen et al 2016 prior studies have shown that the influence of carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering on water chemistry can be confirmed in term of 87sr 86sr and ca na ratios gaillardet et al 1999 fig 5a water chemistry from carbonate dissolution is characterized by high ca na ratios and low 87sr 86sr ratios whereas water chemistry from silicate weathering is characterized by low ca na ratios and high 87sr 86sr ratios gaillardet et al 1999 compared with the study conducted by gaillardet et al 1999 and xie et al 2013c the 87sr 86sr vs ca na plot further supports the mixing processes discussed above between carbonates and silicates from the 87sr 86sr vs as plot fig 5b it is interesting to note that non silicified limestone in the b aquifer is characterized by elevated 87sr 86sr ratios in comparison with that of silicified limestone in the a aquifer this is mainly a result of cryptic alteration which leads to variation in some isotopes and trace elements but no variation in mineral composition and rock structure peng et al 2001 additionally it is evident that high and anomalous high as groundwaters are characterized by relatively high 87sr 86sr ratios except for sample c5 between those of non silicified limestone and silicified limestone stibnite the comparison of the as contents of non silicified limestone and silicified limestone and stibnite suggests that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with the stibnite and silicified limestone however from the na vs as and ca na vs as plots fig 6 it is also evident that the high and anomalous high as groundwaters are characterized by distinctively low ca na ratios although na concentrations correlate weakly with as concentrations for these groundwaters according to the study conducted by vinson et al 2011 the relationships between na concentrations and as concentrations fig 6a ca na and as concentrations fig 6b and 87sr 86sr and ca na fig 5a collectively suggest that ca na partially records hydrogeochemical processes along groundwater flows and or the surface charge of sediments in addition to fingerprinting the geologic sources of solutes within the xks sb mine in addition as documented in previous studies a relationship between the lithologic source and the ca na ratio has been observed and na dominated waters could be associated with weathered volcanic material especially ash smedley and kinniburgh 2002 vinson et al 2011 thus considering the mining activities at the xks sb mine the distinctive ca na ratios indicate that elevated as concentrations in groundwater seem to be associated with anthropogenic sources e g mine solid wastes and effluent rather than natural geogenic sources smedley and kinniburgh 2002 in the xks sb mine area as species are highly enriched in arsenic alkali residue primarily in the forms of na3aso4 and na2as4o11 guo et al 2014 leaching infiltration of the arsenic alkali residue can result in the anomalous high as and na concentrations and distinctive ca na ratios in the groundwater 4 3 controls of as mobilization as discussed above for these oxygenated groundwaters from the xks sb mine several geochemical processes have been proposed to reveal the mechanism of as mobilization and account for the elevated as concentrations hydrochemical and sr isotope features indicate that carbonate and silicate weathering are the dominant process controlling groundwater hydrochemistry and one of the sources of as in groundwater the δ34s values imply that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater was mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals in mineralized and mined areas especially affected by ancient mining activity oxidation of as bearing sulfides is a primary source of as frau and ardau 2003 smedley et al 2007 verplanck et al 2008 additionally end member sources of dissolved so4 2 fig 4b evident that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are influenced by mixing of mine water and surface water the feature of ca na ratios figs 5a and 6b coupled with the correlation between as concentrations and na concentrations fig 6a indicate that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are related to mine solid wastes additionally the spatial association of high and anomalous high as concentrations with known smelting plants smelting slags fig 1 is also strong evidence that the high and anomalous high as are ultimately derived from smelting slags in particular the arsenic alkali residue thus in comparison with the dissolution of silicate and carbonates as well as oxidation of sulfides the geological and hydrogeological setting and isotope geochemistry of the xks sb mine including as contents s and sr isotopes composition of rock ore and groundwater collectively demonstrated that leaching of the arsenic alkali residue is the predominant geochemical process controlling as mobilization considering the as species in the arsenic alkali residue guo et al 2014 the leaching may lead to as being present in groundwater as haso4 2 by hydrolysis during the recharge of precipitation fig 7 in addition previous studies indicate that under oxidizing conditions at a high ph approximately 8 5 9 5 as is less strongly bonded to fe oxides hydroxides than at lower ph values smedley et al 2002 under oxidizing conditions and at ph values between 8 and 9 arsenic anions and other elements that form oxyanions f hco3 b and v are released from the desorption of fe mn oxides hydroxides smedley et al 2002 verplanck et al 2008 although the ph value of approximately half of these oxygenated groundwaters from the xks sb mine is 8 dissolved as concentrations are poorly correlated to other anions and elements that form oxyanions except for boron and vanadium in the b aquifer fig 3b c f and g thus the sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides may be a process but not a significant process controlling as mobilization this process needs to be further studied by other methods such as a comparison of as concentrations in filtered and unfiltered groundwater samples verplanck et al 2008 based on the current available knowledge the mobilization and variation of elevated as in groundwater from the xks sb mine can be elucidated by the following models fig 7 1 the bedrock weathering model which includes carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering demonstrates the elevated as concentrations in the low arsenic groundwater samples 0 50 µg l 2 the oxidation model oxidizes arsenopyrite and the dominant sulfides in the ores 3 the mixing of mine water drainage and surface water models account for the elevated as concentrations in the high arsenic groundwater samples 50 1000 µg l 4 the leaching of the arsenic alkali residue model can explain the high arsenic in particular the anomalous high arsenic 1000 µg l found in the three aquifers 5 the sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides model needs to be further studied by other evidences although the ph values seem to be reasonable as shown in the profile of the conceptual model fig 7 the signs with a blue color and different geologic symbols represent the a b and c aquifers respectively and the others represent the aquifuges at the xks sb mine prior to mining groundwater from the three bedrock aquifers characterized by low concentrations of as so4 and fe is sourced from bedrock weathering after mining the sulfides in the host rock and mineralized zones such as stibnite pyrite and arsenopyrite are oxidized with various redox conditions this results in elevated as so4 and fe concentrations as well as local acidification in groundwater particularly in the a aquifer that hosts sb ore bodies however the acid is readily neutralized by carbonates and it causes the weak alkaline groundwater and low concentrations of fe in groundwater hiller et al 2012 nyirenda et al 2015 more specifically the leachate of sb mine spoil including waste rock and slags particularly the arsenic alkali residues aar that originate from sb smelting process is characterized by high concentrations of as so4 and fe the sb mine spoil seeps and discharges cause the significant increase of as and so4 concentrations in the three bedrock aquifers and surface water and the infiltration of surface water and mine drainage that is sourced from the mining process can also result in the elevated as concentrations in groundwater in addition the as mobilization in groundwater can record the s and sr isotopes composition of as sources including rock and ore underground as well as the mine solid wastes piled up in the open air and lead to the variation in the s and sr isotopes composition of groundwater finally it is noteworthy that the as mobilization in groundwater may be influenced by the sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides 4 4 implications of the model the geochemical processes affecting arsenic mobilization in the bedrock aquifer system especially for the mining area are different from those in alluvial aquifers the arsenic mobilization in groundwater from the mining area is closely related to the mine life cycle from mining processing and smelting to the mine closure although further research is required the results of this study are significant for as mobilization in the bedrock aquifer not only at the xks sb mine but also for other metal or coal mines where as bearing minerals are present and subject to changing redox conditions from mining activities except for the bedrock weathering and sulfide oxidation the leaching of as containing mine solid waste in particular may be a significant process for elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater from the mining area in addition the results may be applicable for mine risk assessment and mine management 5 conclusions our previous research on sources migration and transformation of antimony has centered on antimony contamination in bedrock aquifers from the xks sb mine because these aquifers are used by local residents and seriously polluted by mining activity this study in contrast reports the hydrogeochemistry of as rich groundwater from the same region with the appearance of arsenic poisoning and increasing source development understanding the processes that control arsenic mobilization in groundwater becomes more important groundwater at the xks sb mine is a ca hco3 so4 to ca so4 hco3 type and is characterized by high concentrations of so4 2 twenty three groundwater samples can be divided into three types low arsenic groundwater 0 50 µg l high arsenic groundwater 50 1000 µg l and anomalous high arsenic groundwater 1000 µg l the carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering are the dominant process controlling the groundwater hydrochemistry and elevated as concentrations in groundwater may be associated with mining activities the eh ph diagram demonstrates that arsenic occurs under oxidizing conditions in the xks sb mine area as the haso4 2 anion the δ34s values of the groundwater indicate that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater is mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals and elevated as concentrations in groundwater are influenced by the mixing of mine water and surface water the relationships between δ34s values and dissolved as fe concentrations suggest that reduction dissolution of fe iii hydroxides is not the dominant process controlling as mobilization and not responsible for the elevated as the 87sr 86sr ratios further support the mixing processes between carbonates and silicates and imply that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with the stibnite and silicified limestone the distinctive ca na ratios and spatial distribution of as collectively suggest that high arsenic groundwater especially the anomalous high arsenic groundwater are associated with the smelting slags in particular the arsenic alkali residue in general the hydrochemistry analysis especially the s and sr isotope evidences elucidate that elevated as concentrations and as mobilization are influenced by several geochemical processes including 1 the bedrock weathering which explains elevated as concentrations in the low arsenic groundwater samples 2 the oxidation of arsenopyrite and the dominant sulfides in the ores and the mixing of mine drainage and surface water which can account for elevated as concentrations in the high arsenic groundwater samples 3 the leaching of the arsenic alkali residue which can explain the high especially the anomalous high arsenic found in the three aquifers and 4 the sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides which needs to be further studied in future research acknowledgements the authors wish to thank hao chuming phd from the china institute of geo environmental monitoring for helping to collect the water

7489,the xikuangshan xks mine the world s largest antimony mine was chosen for a detailed arsenic hydrogeochemical study because of the elevated arsenic in bedrock aquifers used by local residents hydrochemical data δ34s values of dissolved so4 2 and 87sr 86sr ratios have been analyzed to identify the predominant geochemical processes that control the arsenic mobilization within the aquifers groundwater samples can be divided into three major types low arsenic groundwater 0 50 µg l high arsenic groundwater 50 1000 µg l and anomalous high arsenic groundwater 1000 µg l arsenic occurs under oxidizing conditions at the xks sb mine as the haso4 2 anion the ca na ratio correlates significantly with hco3 na and sr na ratios indicating that carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling groundwater hydrochemistry the δ34s values of the groundwater indicate that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater is mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals and elevated as concentrations in groundwater are influenced by the mixing of mine water and surface water furthermore the δ34s values are not correlated with dissolved as concentrations and fe concentrations suggesting that the reduction dissolution of fe iii hydroxides is not the dominant process controlling as mobilization the 87sr 86sr ratios imply that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with the stibnite and silicified limestone more specifically the excess na ion the feature of ca na ratio and the spatial association of elevated as concentrations in groundwater collectively suggest that high and anomalous high arsenic groundwater are associated with smelting slags and in particular the arsenic alkali residue in general the hydrochemistry analysis especially the s and sr isotope evidences elucidate that elevated as concentrations and as mobilization are influenced by several geochemical processes including 1 bedrock weathering 2 oxidation of arsenopyrite and the dominant sulfides in the ores 3 mixing of mine drainage and surface water 4 leaching of the arsenic alkali residue and 5 sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides keywords arsenic 34ssulfate 87sr 86sr groundwater hydrochemistry xikuangshan 1 introduction arsenic is a ubiquitous toxic and carcinogenic element in the environment high arsenic concentrations in groundwater have been found in many parts of the world including bangladesh india vietnam china hungary ghana argentina chile mexico and the usa smedley and kinniburgh 2002 elevated arsenic concentrations are usually the result of mobilization under natural conditions and anthropogenesis related to mining activity smedley and kinniburgh 2002 mobilization of as under reducing conditions in alluvial aquifers has been widely documented benner et al 2008 berg et al 2001 busbee et al 2009 charlet and polya 2006 islam et al 2004 kao et al 2013 mcarthur et al 2004 xie et al 2009 xie et al 2013a whereas mobilization under oxidizing conditions is also responsible for as contamination problems in bedrock aquifers heinrichs and udluft 1999 lipfert et al 2007 sidle et al 2001 smedley et al 2002 particularly in groundwater systems affected by mining activity frau and ardau 2003 gemici et al 2008 hiller et al 2012 johannesson and tang 2009 ondrejkova et al 2013 in the world s largest antimony sb mine xikuangshan xks sb mine of hunan province central china groundwater from the magunao aquifer provides an important source of potable water and waterborne arsenic poisoning was first reported in 1961 wu and shui 1984 various studies have examined the extent of the as contamination in soil surface water and mine wastes as well as in organisms fu et al 2016 fu et al 2010 guo et al 2014 mo et al 2013 zhu et al 2009 however less attention has been given to the geochemical behaviors of as in the groundwater environment at the xks sb mine xie et al 2016 the highest value of dissolved as that has been detected in the magunao aquifer groundwater at the xks sb mine is 680 µg l nyirenda et al 2015 our previous study focused on the antimony contamination in the magunao and shetianqiao aquifers from the xks sb mine using the s and sr isotope approach wen et al 2016 it is interesting to note that not only antimony but also arsenic occurs in the two aquifers at concentrations greater than world health organization who guideline and china s drinking water standard moh and sac 2006 who 2004 which represents a significant threat to the local drinking water supplies furthermore there has been an increase in resource development of this mine area thus though the potential sources of arsenic are thought to be the arsenic alkali residues that are produced from the smelting process guo et al 2014 li and liang 2010 it is imperative to identify the processes that control arsenic mobility in groundwater for alleviating the health hazards associated with long term exposure to high arsenic groundwater a number of mechanisms have been suggested to explain elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater including the reductive dissolution of fe iii hydroxides nickson et al 2000 swartz et al 2004 desorption of fe oxides hydroxides casiot et al 2005 smedley et al 2002 and reduction of as v to as iii bose and sharma 2002 as well as the oxidation of as bearing sulfides schreiber et al 2000 verplanck et al 2008 a change in ph or in redox conditions the presence of natural organic matter nom and reactivity of bacteria are known to affect arsenic mobilization in groundwater bauer and blodau 2006 harvey et al 2002 islam et al 2004 mcarthur et al 2001 the biogeochemical cycles of as have been linked to s and sulfur and arsenic often share similar microbial redox transformations fisher et al 2008 tisserand et al 2014 wang et al 2014 sulfur isotopes are help in groundwater studies involving sulfides and varying redox conditions lipfert et al 2007 sidle et al 2001 tisserand et al 2014 xie et al 2013b considerable sulfur isotope fractionation occurs when bacteria reduce sulfate to sulfide bottcher et al 2001 nakai and jensen 1964 while little or no sulfur isotope fractionation occurs when sulfide is oxidized to sulfate strebel et al 1990 taylor et al 1984 strontium isotopes are a sensitivity indicator for high arsenic groundwater sources flow paths mixing processes water rock interaction and anthropogenic contamination in groundwater systems khaska et al 2015 potot et al 2012 vinson et al 2011 xie et al 2013c no measurable strontium isotope fractionation occurs during mineral precipitation and dissolution and the value of the strontium isotope in an aqueous phase is closely related to that of rock and ore barbieri and morotti 2003 naftz et al 1997 negrel et al 2001 therefore sulfur and strontium isotopes are powerful tools for tracing s cycling and the mobilization of arsenic within aquifers the aim of this study was to analyze the groundwater from a historical arsenic anomaly area at the xks sb mine and elucidate the geochemical processes affecting arsenic mobilization in the bedrock aquifer system our approach of identifying the elevated arsenic concentrations by s and sr isotopes may be applicable to other regions with similar conditions 2 study area 2 1 climate and mining the xks sb mine consists of north mine and south mine covers approximately 26 km2 ranges in elevation from 220 m to 823 2 m above mean sea level m s l and lies in a mountainous region the climate is characterized by high annual precipitation hot summers and warm winters for the period 1949 2012 the mean annual temperature was 16 7 c while the average annual precipitation and evaporation were 1381 mm and 903 3 mm respectively several rivers such as xuanshan river qingfeng river feishuiyan stream tanjia stream and batangshan stream are distributed in the study area the xks sb mine is an active mine which was first mined in 1897 hundreds of smelting plants were in the xks area and a large amount of solid waste has been produced by the mining processing and smelting specifically the antimony smelting activities have historically produced 2 00 000 tons of arsenic alkali residue the majority of which was not handled properly and was piled up in the open air guo et al 2014 li and liang 2010 arsenic alkali residue is generated during the antimony refining process in a reverberatory furnace in which any as is removed by the addition of sodium hydroxide guo et al 2014 currently two smelting plants still exist in the xks sb mine area 2 2 geological setting the xks sb deposit follows the axis of a half edge anticline at ne30 and plunges north and south fan et al 2004 the west and east of the anticline are cut by a large fault no 75 and a 10 km long lamprophyre dike respectively the upper devonian xikuangshan and shetianqiao formations occur in the core of the anticline surrounded by the datang and yanguan formations of lower carboniferous fan et al 2004 the shetianqiao formation consists of three sections which are mainly composed of limestone bioclastic micrite chert silicified limestone shale sandstone and dolostone the xks sb deposit occurs as stratiform bodies and veins in the upper part silicified limestone layers of the shetianqiao formation and constitutes 80 of the total sb reserves of the deposit fan et al 2004 in addition a small sb ore bed occurs in the middle devonian qiziqiao formation which is mainly composed of micritic and bioclastic limestone the xks sb deposit is a specific middle low temperature mineralization depression zone with rich deposits of antimony mercury gold zinc lead arsenic and coal fu et al 2016 liu et al 2010 the wallrock alterations are mostly silication and carbonatization yang et al 2006b the mineral and element compositions are simple stibnite sb2s3 is the main ore mineral trace levels of pyrite arsenopyrite pyrrhotite and sphalerite occur in the deposit along with primary gangue minerals quatz and calcite and secondary gangue minerals such as barite fluorite gypsum and pyrophyllite fan et al 2004 yang et al 2006b the average as content of the regional carboniferous and devonian strata is 10 1 and 11 6 ppm respectively zou 1988 in the xks sb mine area the as value of sb ores is 43 6 180 3 ppm zou 1988 the as contents of silicified limestone is 4 5 26 3 ppm while that of non silicified limestone is 0 8 6 1 ppm ma et al 2002 2 3 hydrogeological setting in the xks sb mine area two main groundwater systems are present these are the lower shetianqiao karst aquifer a aquifer and the upper magunao karst aquifer b aquifer systems fig 1 the lamprophyre vein and fault no 75 are considered the east and west impervious boundaries of the groundwater systems respectively the a aquifer consists of micrite limestone silicified limestone and shale with a thickness of 220 m and hosts the sb ore bodies karst caves and fractures develop in this aquifer with an average hydraulic conductivity of 0 041 m d the b aquifer is mainly composed of limestone and sandy limestone with a thickness of 258 m many springs occur in this aquifer with an average hydraulic conductivity of 0 0092 m d the b aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for the community of xks formations between the two major aquifers are aquifuges and composed of calcareous shale argillaceous limestone and a 20 m thick hematite layer with a total thickness of 230 m both a aquifer and b aquifer crop out substantially in the xks sb mine area they are recharged by precipitation and discharged by springs with the groundwater flow direction moving from southeast to northwest in the north mine and from northeast to southwest in the south mine furthermore another groundwater system out of the lamprophyre vein and fault no 75 called carboniferous fracture aquifer c aquifer is present in the datang and yanguan formations of lower carboniferous fig 1 3 sampling and analytical methods 3 1 groundwater sampling hydrochemical and isotopic analyses conducted in november 2013 in the xks sb mine area involved collecting a total of twenty eight water samples including twenty three spring samples from a aquifer a b aquifer b and c aquifer c one mine water sample and four surface water samples sw from qingfeng river tanjia stream feishuiyan stream and xuanshan river the locations of the sampling sites are shown in fig 1 all water samples were filtered on site through 0 45 µm acid washed membrane filters and stored in pre cleaned 500 ml hdpe bottles the samples for major cation trace element and sr isotope measurements were acidified to ph 2 with ultrapure hno3 and one bottle of each water sample was left unacidified for anion determination for sulfur isotope analyses so4 2 was precipitated as baso4 s with bacl2 aq and the baso4 precipitates were purified using the ddarp method bao 2006 on site measurements of temperature ph eh and electric conductivity ec were determined using an hach portable water quality analyzer hach hq40d alkalinity was measured using the titration method within 24 h after sampling 3 2 analytical methods major cation k na ca and mg concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes anion f and so4 concentrations were measured by ion chromatography ics 1100 the analysis precision of cations and anions was 0 1 mg l trace elements including as fe sr b and v concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms with a precision better than 3 the cation anion and trace element measurements were conducted at the school of environmental studies china university of geosciences wuhan the analytical precision for all cation and anion measurements was checked again by calculating the ionic balance errors and the ionic balance errors were generally within 5 field and laboratory blanks were below detection limits for all species the δ34sso4 values were determined at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan the analysis of the sulfur isotope was performed by a thermal conversion element analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometer tc ea irms after the complete conversion of baso4 to so2 via a high temperature combustion with o2 and v2o5 at 1030 c the reproducibility of the δ34sso4 analysis of baso4 was better than 0 2 the sulfur isotope ratios are reported in the usual delta notation in units of and the δ34s values in were determined using the following equation 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where r 34s 32s δ34s is reported relative to the vienna canyon diablo troilite standard v cdt the 87sr 86sr values were determined using a finnigan mat triton thermal ionization mass spectrometer tims at the state key laboratory of geological processes and mineral resources china university of geosciences wuhan the 87sr 86sr results were reported as sr ratios relative to a value of 0 7 10 250 based on the standard reference material nbs987 srco3 the sr isotope analysis featured a precision of 0 000010 and an accuracy of 0 000020 based on repeated analyses of nbs987 blanks for the entire procedure did not exceed 0 12 ng sr 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry groundwater at the xks sb mine is weak alkaline with a ph ranging from 7 04 to 8 51 average 7 78 and total dissolved solids tds of these waters vary from 142 48 to 837 48 mg l table 1 field eh measurements vary from 71 to 280 mv table 1 in comparison with groundwater surface water has a slightly higher ph and tds and the tds values of mine water is the highest overall redox conditions are significantly oxygenated groundwater at the xks sb mine is the ca hco3 so4 to ca so4 hco3 type surface water is ca na so4 hco3 type and the major element compositions are highly variable among springs table 1 the groundwater is characterized by high concentrations of so4 2 ranging from 57 51 to 697 12 mg l with an average of 174 18 mg l and contains large amounts of ca average 95 76 mg l and hco3 average 186 94 mg l table 1 a na normalized ca versus hco3 plot fig 2 a shows that the aquifer samples range from being influenced by carbonate dissolution to silicate weathering gaillardet et al 1999 mukherjee and fryar 2008 additionally the plot of ca na vs sr na in the waters is presented in fig 2b along the mixing line with carbonate and silicate end members obtained by gaillardet et al 1999 it is evidence that the process controlling groundwater hydrochemistry in this study area is dominated by carbonate dissolution the silicate weathering is also an important controlling process especially for the a aquifer fig 2a which is associated with silication and mining activities the dissolved as concentrations in groundwater from the xks sb mine range from 0 to 1274 0 µg l with an average of 164 8 µg l which far exceeds china s and the who guideline s drinking water standard of 10 µg l who 2004 moh and sac 2006 the dissolved as concentration in the mine water is 209 9 µg l whereas the concentrations in surface water range from 152 1 to 2545 0 µg l with an average of 1694 8 µg l indicating that mining and smelting waste water or leaching liquid from the solid wastes have been discharged into the river wang et al 2011 twenty three groundwater samples can be divided into three groups based on dissolved as concentrations in groundwater low arsenic groundwater 0 50 µg l 14 samples high arsenic groundwater 50 1000 µg l 7 samples and anomalous high arsenic groundwater 1000 µg l 2 samples spatial variations in dissolved as concentrations are displayed in fig 1 although the distribution of as in these groundwaters is distinctly variable there is a tendency for the high and anomalous high arsenic concentrations to occur in smelting areas fig 1 unlike many major constituents dissolved as concentrations do not covary with tds fig 3 a furthermore dissolved as concentrations do not covary with dissolved hco3 f or fe fig 3b c and e however there is a positive correlation between dissolved as concentrations and b and v for the b aquifer fig 3f and g arsenic is mainly associated with antimony as a sulfide or oxide hale 1981 unfortunately data on dissolved sb concentrations in these waters were not available during the data analysis while as concentrations correlate with so4 concentrations for some samples from the a aquifer and the b aquifer this indicates that elevated as concentrations seem to be associated with mining activities which can accelerate the dissolution of as sb bearing sulfide minerals under oxidized conditions resulting in the elevated as concentrations as well as dissolved fe concentrations in groundwater in particular for the a aquifer however it is interesting to note that in comparison with the high as groundwater from datong basin wang et al 2014 the groundwaters have relatively low fe concentrations fig 3e most of the groundwater samples 100 µg l in addition to a few water samples though a considerable amount of fe bearing minerals pyrite arsenopyrite pyrrhotite and hematite occur in the strata in this study area yang et al 2006a yang 1986 this should be attributed to the weak alkaline conditions that result in fe iii precipitates fig 3h which leads to the attenuation of dissolved fe concentrations nyirenda et al 2015 in general as a result of the oxidized condition of the groundwaters as ⅴ haso4 2 is the dominant species present robertson 1989 fig 3h 4 2 isotope geochemistry 4 2 1 δ34s of dissolved so4 2 δ34s is commonly utilized to trace the groundwater source of so4 2 and biogeochemistry processes associated with the as iii and as ⅴ oxidation states kao et al 2015 sidle 2002 xie et al 2009 sulfide minerals are a common source of natural geogenic arsenic tisserand et al 2014 previous studies have revealed that little or no sulfur isotope fractionation occurs when sulfide is oxidized to sulfate strebel et al 1990 taylor et al 1984 and the s isotope of sulfate in groundwater from oxidized sulfide minerals is very close to that of the precursor sulfide mineral gammons et al 2013 fig 4 a shows the values of δ34s of various sulfides from the xks sb mine area the δ34s values of stibnite sb2s3 range from 3 3 to 16 8 with a mean of 7 4 while the majority of stibnite has a narrow range 5 to 10 ma et al 2003 yang et al 2006a the average δ34s value of pyrite in limestone strata is 26 4 whereas that of pyrite in the lamprophyre dike is 5 4 yang et al 2006a yang 1986 the δ34s values of arsenopyrite and sphalerite range from 8 85 to 6 91 yang 1986 and the average δ34s value of gypsum is 22 4 in the regional strata jiang et al 1990 data for δ34s in 23 groundwater samples are plotted against 1 so4 2 concentrations in fig 4b the values average 1 75 and show moderate variation 0 7 to 4 7 except for sample b6 in comparison of the δ34s values of sulfides from the xks sb mine area indicates that the δ34s values of the sample b6 is not available δ34s values in groundwater sulfates correlate with those of sulfides from the xks sb mine area as documented in our previous study wen et al 2016 it is evident that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater was mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals stibnite pyrite arsenopyrite and sphalerite a negative correlation between δ34s values and so4 2 concentrations r2 0 54 in the b aquifer may indicate a slight bacterial so4 reduction because this reduction induces dissolved so4 2 to become isotopically enriched in 34s with a decreasing concentration bottcher et al 2001 nakai and jensen 1964 additionally fig 4b shows that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater is mainly influenced by mine water and surface water although end member sources of so4 2 mine water surface water and rainwater from the study area are not distinct from those in the coal mine area gammons et al 2013 and dissolved so4 2 in groundwater may have other end member sources surface water with high so4 2 concentrations may be influenced not only by mine drainage but also by the leaching liquid from the waste rocks and slags of the antimony ore previous studies have documented that δ34s allows a better understanding of as mobilization fisher et al 2008 xie et al 2009 and so4 reducing bacteria preferentially utilize 32s and result in heavier 34s in residual so4 2 bottcher et al 2001 nakai and jensen 1964 the bacteria reduction of fe iii hydroxides can result in heavier δ34s values with elevated arsenic concentrations lipfert et al 2007 xie et al 2013b wang et al 2014 additionally the reduction of amorphous fe iii hydroxides with minor bacteria so4 reduction can also result in heavier δ34s values with elevated total fe concentrations xie et al 2013b fig 4c and d show the variation of δ34s values in dissolved so4 2 with fe and as concentrations respectively in these weak alkaline waters dissolved fe concentrations are controlled by redox conditions and ferrous is the dominant species fig 3h there is no correlation between δ34s values and dissolved fe and as concentrations fig 4c and d and elevated dissolved as concentrations do not generally occur in the relatively lower oxygenated waters table 1 furthermore dissolved as concentrations do not correlate with dissolved fe concentrations fig 3e thus comparison of the variation of δ34s values with fe and as concentrations in the alluvial aquifer xie et al 2013b even in a fractured bedrock aquifer lipfert et al 2007 indicates that the reduction dissolution of fe iii hydroxides is unlikely to be involved in the elevated as concentrations in groundwater and bacterial so4 reduction is weakly correlated with as enrichment in groundwater from the xks sb mine 4 2 2 87sr 86sr ratios sr isotope ratios in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with host aquifer rocks harrington and herczeg 2003 vinson et al 2011 and they can represent the composition of the host aquifer rocks in particular of multiple rock types initial 87sr 86sr ratios can be modified by mixing groundwater as it flows through different rocks and ores the 87sr 86sr ratios of 23 groundwater samples range from 0 70 828 to 0 71 061 fig 5 our previous study suggests that the sr isotope ratios of the host aquifer rocks have three types that include 1 non silicified limestone with high sr concentrations and low sr isotope ratios 2 silicified limestone and stibnite with low sr concentrations and moderate sr isotope ratios and 3 rb rich silicified limestone with moderate sr concentrations and relatively high sr isotope ratios wen et al 2016 radiogenic sr in groundwater may be sourced from silicified limestone and stibnite in the a aquifer while non radiogenic sr may be sourced from the limestone wen et al 2016 prior studies have shown that the influence of carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering on water chemistry can be confirmed in term of 87sr 86sr and ca na ratios gaillardet et al 1999 fig 5a water chemistry from carbonate dissolution is characterized by high ca na ratios and low 87sr 86sr ratios whereas water chemistry from silicate weathering is characterized by low ca na ratios and high 87sr 86sr ratios gaillardet et al 1999 compared with the study conducted by gaillardet et al 1999 and xie et al 2013c the 87sr 86sr vs ca na plot further supports the mixing processes discussed above between carbonates and silicates from the 87sr 86sr vs as plot fig 5b it is interesting to note that non silicified limestone in the b aquifer is characterized by elevated 87sr 86sr ratios in comparison with that of silicified limestone in the a aquifer this is mainly a result of cryptic alteration which leads to variation in some isotopes and trace elements but no variation in mineral composition and rock structure peng et al 2001 additionally it is evident that high and anomalous high as groundwaters are characterized by relatively high 87sr 86sr ratios except for sample c5 between those of non silicified limestone and silicified limestone stibnite the comparison of the as contents of non silicified limestone and silicified limestone and stibnite suggests that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with the stibnite and silicified limestone however from the na vs as and ca na vs as plots fig 6 it is also evident that the high and anomalous high as groundwaters are characterized by distinctively low ca na ratios although na concentrations correlate weakly with as concentrations for these groundwaters according to the study conducted by vinson et al 2011 the relationships between na concentrations and as concentrations fig 6a ca na and as concentrations fig 6b and 87sr 86sr and ca na fig 5a collectively suggest that ca na partially records hydrogeochemical processes along groundwater flows and or the surface charge of sediments in addition to fingerprinting the geologic sources of solutes within the xks sb mine in addition as documented in previous studies a relationship between the lithologic source and the ca na ratio has been observed and na dominated waters could be associated with weathered volcanic material especially ash smedley and kinniburgh 2002 vinson et al 2011 thus considering the mining activities at the xks sb mine the distinctive ca na ratios indicate that elevated as concentrations in groundwater seem to be associated with anthropogenic sources e g mine solid wastes and effluent rather than natural geogenic sources smedley and kinniburgh 2002 in the xks sb mine area as species are highly enriched in arsenic alkali residue primarily in the forms of na3aso4 and na2as4o11 guo et al 2014 leaching infiltration of the arsenic alkali residue can result in the anomalous high as and na concentrations and distinctive ca na ratios in the groundwater 4 3 controls of as mobilization as discussed above for these oxygenated groundwaters from the xks sb mine several geochemical processes have been proposed to reveal the mechanism of as mobilization and account for the elevated as concentrations hydrochemical and sr isotope features indicate that carbonate and silicate weathering are the dominant process controlling groundwater hydrochemistry and one of the sources of as in groundwater the δ34s values imply that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater was mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals in mineralized and mined areas especially affected by ancient mining activity oxidation of as bearing sulfides is a primary source of as frau and ardau 2003 smedley et al 2007 verplanck et al 2008 additionally end member sources of dissolved so4 2 fig 4b evident that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are influenced by mixing of mine water and surface water the feature of ca na ratios figs 5a and 6b coupled with the correlation between as concentrations and na concentrations fig 6a indicate that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are related to mine solid wastes additionally the spatial association of high and anomalous high as concentrations with known smelting plants smelting slags fig 1 is also strong evidence that the high and anomalous high as are ultimately derived from smelting slags in particular the arsenic alkali residue thus in comparison with the dissolution of silicate and carbonates as well as oxidation of sulfides the geological and hydrogeological setting and isotope geochemistry of the xks sb mine including as contents s and sr isotopes composition of rock ore and groundwater collectively demonstrated that leaching of the arsenic alkali residue is the predominant geochemical process controlling as mobilization considering the as species in the arsenic alkali residue guo et al 2014 the leaching may lead to as being present in groundwater as haso4 2 by hydrolysis during the recharge of precipitation fig 7 in addition previous studies indicate that under oxidizing conditions at a high ph approximately 8 5 9 5 as is less strongly bonded to fe oxides hydroxides than at lower ph values smedley et al 2002 under oxidizing conditions and at ph values between 8 and 9 arsenic anions and other elements that form oxyanions f hco3 b and v are released from the desorption of fe mn oxides hydroxides smedley et al 2002 verplanck et al 2008 although the ph value of approximately half of these oxygenated groundwaters from the xks sb mine is 8 dissolved as concentrations are poorly correlated to other anions and elements that form oxyanions except for boron and vanadium in the b aquifer fig 3b c f and g thus the sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides may be a process but not a significant process controlling as mobilization this process needs to be further studied by other methods such as a comparison of as concentrations in filtered and unfiltered groundwater samples verplanck et al 2008 based on the current available knowledge the mobilization and variation of elevated as in groundwater from the xks sb mine can be elucidated by the following models fig 7 1 the bedrock weathering model which includes carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering demonstrates the elevated as concentrations in the low arsenic groundwater samples 0 50 µg l 2 the oxidation model oxidizes arsenopyrite and the dominant sulfides in the ores 3 the mixing of mine water drainage and surface water models account for the elevated as concentrations in the high arsenic groundwater samples 50 1000 µg l 4 the leaching of the arsenic alkali residue model can explain the high arsenic in particular the anomalous high arsenic 1000 µg l found in the three aquifers 5 the sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides model needs to be further studied by other evidences although the ph values seem to be reasonable as shown in the profile of the conceptual model fig 7 the signs with a blue color and different geologic symbols represent the a b and c aquifers respectively and the others represent the aquifuges at the xks sb mine prior to mining groundwater from the three bedrock aquifers characterized by low concentrations of as so4 and fe is sourced from bedrock weathering after mining the sulfides in the host rock and mineralized zones such as stibnite pyrite and arsenopyrite are oxidized with various redox conditions this results in elevated as so4 and fe concentrations as well as local acidification in groundwater particularly in the a aquifer that hosts sb ore bodies however the acid is readily neutralized by carbonates and it causes the weak alkaline groundwater and low concentrations of fe in groundwater hiller et al 2012 nyirenda et al 2015 more specifically the leachate of sb mine spoil including waste rock and slags particularly the arsenic alkali residues aar that originate from sb smelting process is characterized by high concentrations of as so4 and fe the sb mine spoil seeps and discharges cause the significant increase of as and so4 concentrations in the three bedrock aquifers and surface water and the infiltration of surface water and mine drainage that is sourced from the mining process can also result in the elevated as concentrations in groundwater in addition the as mobilization in groundwater can record the s and sr isotopes composition of as sources including rock and ore underground as well as the mine solid wastes piled up in the open air and lead to the variation in the s and sr isotopes composition of groundwater finally it is noteworthy that the as mobilization in groundwater may be influenced by the sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides 4 4 implications of the model the geochemical processes affecting arsenic mobilization in the bedrock aquifer system especially for the mining area are different from those in alluvial aquifers the arsenic mobilization in groundwater from the mining area is closely related to the mine life cycle from mining processing and smelting to the mine closure although further research is required the results of this study are significant for as mobilization in the bedrock aquifer not only at the xks sb mine but also for other metal or coal mines where as bearing minerals are present and subject to changing redox conditions from mining activities except for the bedrock weathering and sulfide oxidation the leaching of as containing mine solid waste in particular may be a significant process for elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater from the mining area in addition the results may be applicable for mine risk assessment and mine management 5 conclusions our previous research on sources migration and transformation of antimony has centered on antimony contamination in bedrock aquifers from the xks sb mine because these aquifers are used by local residents and seriously polluted by mining activity this study in contrast reports the hydrogeochemistry of as rich groundwater from the same region with the appearance of arsenic poisoning and increasing source development understanding the processes that control arsenic mobilization in groundwater becomes more important groundwater at the xks sb mine is a ca hco3 so4 to ca so4 hco3 type and is characterized by high concentrations of so4 2 twenty three groundwater samples can be divided into three types low arsenic groundwater 0 50 µg l high arsenic groundwater 50 1000 µg l and anomalous high arsenic groundwater 1000 µg l the carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering are the dominant process controlling the groundwater hydrochemistry and elevated as concentrations in groundwater may be associated with mining activities the eh ph diagram demonstrates that arsenic occurs under oxidizing conditions in the xks sb mine area as the haso4 2 anion the δ34s values of the groundwater indicate that dissolved so4 2 in groundwater is mainly sourced from the oxidation of sulfide minerals and elevated as concentrations in groundwater are influenced by the mixing of mine water and surface water the relationships between δ34s values and dissolved as fe concentrations suggest that reduction dissolution of fe iii hydroxides is not the dominant process controlling as mobilization and not responsible for the elevated as the 87sr 86sr ratios further support the mixing processes between carbonates and silicates and imply that elevated as concentrations in groundwater are primarily derived from the interaction with the stibnite and silicified limestone the distinctive ca na ratios and spatial distribution of as collectively suggest that high arsenic groundwater especially the anomalous high arsenic groundwater are associated with the smelting slags in particular the arsenic alkali residue in general the hydrochemistry analysis especially the s and sr isotope evidences elucidate that elevated as concentrations and as mobilization are influenced by several geochemical processes including 1 the bedrock weathering which explains elevated as concentrations in the low arsenic groundwater samples 2 the oxidation of arsenopyrite and the dominant sulfides in the ores and the mixing of mine drainage and surface water which can account for elevated as concentrations in the high arsenic groundwater samples 3 the leaching of the arsenic alkali residue which can explain the high especially the anomalous high arsenic found in the three aquifers and 4 the sorption desorption from fe mn oxides hydroxides which needs to be further studied in future research acknowledgements the authors wish to thank hao chuming phd from the china institute of geo environmental monitoring for helping to collect the water
