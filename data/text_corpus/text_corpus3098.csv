15490,radioactive iodine 129 has been released from the la hague nuclear fuel reprocessing facility nrf into the english channel but the distribution and transformation of the isotope species and environmental consequences have not been fully characterized in the channel here we present data on iodine isotopes 129i and 127i species in surface water of the english channel and the southern celtic sea compared to 127i species the concentrations of 129i and 129io3 show more variations but iodate is the major species for both 129i and 127i our data provide new information regarding iodide iodate inter conversion showing that water dilution and mixing are the main factors affecting the 127i and 129i species distribution in the channel some reduction of iodate occurs within the english channel and mainly in the west part because of biotic processes the 129i species transformation is overall insignificant especially in the eastern channel where a constant value of 129io3 129i is observed which might characterize the la hague wastewater signal in the celtic sea oxidation of iodide can be traced by 127i and 129i species on a larger scale 129i generally experienced an oxidation process in the atlantic ocean while in the coast of shallow shelf seas new produced 129i can be identified especially in the german bight and the baltic sea the data of 129i species in the english channel can provide estimate of redox rates in a much broader marine areas if the transit time of 129i from la hague is well defined furthermore estimate of inventories for 129i and its species in the channel and fluxes of 129i species from the english channel to the north sea add important information to the geochemical cycle of 129i graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 129i english channel iodine species iodine isotopes seawater data availability data will be made available on request introduction the world s two largest commercial nuclear reprocessing facilities nrfs namely la hague france and sellafield uk contribute 97 of 129i half life 1 57 107 years in the environment to date with releases from la hague representing about 2 3 fig s1 the la hague derived 129i commonly resides in the english channel before its further transport to mainly the north sea in view of its low energy radiation 129i is currently considered radiologically not hazardous and is applied as an environmental tracer and for the iodine biogeochemistry casacuberta et al 2018 castrillejo et al 2018 humphrey et al 2020 qiao et al 2021 as a result a large amount of 129i measurements have been undertaken globally but only a few considering the speciation of the isotope simultaneously the marine geochemical cycle of iodine species is essential for marine ecosystem and the tropospheric ozone depletion iodine in seawaters mainly exists as inorganic forms iodate and iodide and significant quantities of dissolved organic iodine doi are often observed in some coastal inshore and estuarine waters wong et al 2008a iodine species exhibit different behaviours i e mobility and bioavailability in marine environment therefore chemical speciation analysis of iodine is of major concern which provides insight into iodine fixation conversion and migration patterns however it is difficult to distinguish locally produced iodine species from advected elsewhere because their sources and transport pathways are usually not well defined on a regional scale this problem can be solved by 129i speciation which has overwhelmed sources from the la hague and the sellafield marine discharges a few studies have reported a higher iodide iodate value for 129i in seawater compared to 127i and they related this discrepancy to specific sources and exchanges of oceanic water masses hou et al 2013 liu et al 2016 xing et al 2020 conversions between iodine species may also alter the values but the process is sluggish and thermodynamically unfavorable which may alternatively mediate through biological or photochemical effects truesdale et al 2007 because of the dominant anthropogenic source the nuclear reprocessing facilities theoretically 129i is a powerful tool to estimate iodate reduction rate or iodide oxidation rate in ocean surface with a well defined transit time therefore it is vital to investigate 129i species and in particular in the english channel as it serves as a starting point in this respect yi et al 2012 suggested that the annual 129io3 reduction rate is 5 10 in surface water from english channel to skagerrak this estimate based on very small numbers of measurements however does not consider variation of 129i species in the english channel the english channel is a shallow narrow waterway that connects the celtic sea in the west and the north sea in the east the west and east parts of the english channel have different environmental and hydrographic conditions which may result in different 129i behaviours for example 129i from la hague mainly flows eastward which means the residence time of 129i in the eastern channel is expected short compared to the west another point is that in the western english channel the impact of sellafield should be considered as part of the sellafield release 1 may enter the channel via the celtic sea bailly du bois et al 1999 additionally the western part of the channel is wider and deeper and the water is more saline with a seasonal thermocline 15 25 m established in april may and eroded in september november pingree et al 1975 how 129i speciation is affected by these factors in the channel is interesting and remains unclear the transformation of iodine species in particular the 129i species can reflect the change of marine primary production and marine environment since bacteria enzyme and plankton activity could control the formation of iodide bluhm et al 2011 furthermore 129i speciation in the eastern channel represents key signal of la hague discharge which is valuable for 129i source identification knowing that 129i species data are few and sparse in this region only four measurements hou et al 2007 the english channel represents one of the most 129i contaminated waters and with the well documented release record of la hague it provides an excellent point source for tracer applications of the 129i species here we present extensive results of iodine isotopes species iodide and iodate in the english channel that aim at revealing sources distribution patterns and transformation dynamic of the isotopes species within and beyond the english channel this work combined with earlier investigations in the neighboring areas will add significant information on iodine biogeochemistry in the marine environment samples and analytical methods samples and reagents surface seawater samples were collected from 34 sites that covering the english channel and the celtic sea during 2010 2011 icebreaker oden antarctica cruise in october november 2010 fig 1 real time meteorological and water ctd data were simultaneously measured along the transect seawater of 0 5 l from the eastern channel and 2 0 l from the western channel and the celtic sea were used for analysis of species of iodine isotopes after filtration immediately onboard through a 0 45 μm membrane sartorius ag gottingen germany all water samples were stored in polyethylene bottles hydro bios under cold and dark conditions before chemical analysis 129i standard nist srm 4949c of the national institute of standard and technology gaithersburg md usa carrier free 125i from amersham pharmacia biotech little chalfout buckinghamshire uk and carrier 127i woodward iodine mical specialty chemicals new jersey usa were used in the analysis a 50 100 mesh of bio rad ag1 4 anion exchange resin bio rad laboratories richmond ca was used for iodine species separation because of different affinities of iodide and iodate on the resin all chemical reagents used were of analytical grade and all solutions were prepared with deionized water 18 2 mω separation of iodine species iodine species separation were strictly followed the protocol set up by hou et al 2007 the filtered seawater mixed with 0 1 ml of 125i tracer 250 bq was loaded to an ag1 4 anion exchange column no3 form ø 1 0 20 cm after loading seawater the column was washed with 30 ml deionized water and 50 ml of 0 2 mol l nano3 the effluent and two washes were collected for separation of iodate iodide adsorbed on the resin was eluated by 60 ml of 10 naclo solution and further separated by solvent extraction to the fractions of 129io3 1 0 ml iodine carrier 2 mg ml and 0 1 ml tracer 125io3 250 bq were added 1 0 ml of 1 mol l na2s2o5 and 10 ml 3 mol l hno3 were added to adjust ph 2 to reduce iodine to iodide 20 50 ml chcl3 was added to extract iodine as i2 by using 2 5 ml of 1 0 mol l nano2 repeated this procedure several times until no i2 in chcl3 phase a similar procedure was used to separate total 129i from original seawater samples for the 129i fraction in the eluate 1 0 ml iodine carrier was added followed by 3 0 mol l hno3 to remove the excessive naclo iodine as i2 was extracted by adding of 20 50 ml chcl3 followed by 1 0 mol l nh2oh hcl solution to reducing formed io3 by naclo to molecular iodine i2 repeated this procedure several times until no i2 in chcl3 phase in the experiment five procedure blanks were prepared at the same time to monitor the cross contamination and the laboratory background the recoveries of iodine species after separation and solvent extraction measured by 125i using gamma radiation detector were 72 84 for 129i and 87 99 for 129io3 determination of 127i and 129i 1 0 ml of each fraction seawater iodate effluent and iodide eluate was mixed with cs internal standard 200 ppb and then diluted for 10 times using 1 nh3 h2o solution the concentration of iodine 127i was determined using an x seriesⅱ icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry the detection limit calculated as 3sd of blanks was 0 02 ppb for 129i determination 1 0 mol l agno3 was added to form agi precipitate that was centrifuged and washed with 1 0 mol l hno3 and water to remove ag2so3 and agcl formed in this process and finally dried at 70 c the dried precipitation as agi was mixed with nb powder and the mixture was pressed into a cathode for ams accelerator mass spectrometry measurement under terminal voltage of 3 5 mev at the tandem laboratory uppsala university the 129i 127i isotopic ratio in standard was 1 1 0 1 10 11 and the background of the ams system was 4 10 14 the statistical error 1sd of the 129i measurements was 10 results water temperature in the transect ranges from 13 7 c to 14 8 c where the relatively higher temperature appears in the middle of the english channel and decreases towards both ends alternatively a clear increase trend is observed for salinity from the north sea to the celtic sea fig s2 ranges and distributions of iodine species 127i 129i 127io3 129io3 are presented in figs 2 and s3 respectively all analytical data are shown in table s1 in general 127i concentrations do not show a pronounced variation 0 42 0 04 μm while 129i exhibits a large spread at 2 87 4670 108 atoms l for iodine species we observe relatively small variations of both 127i and 127io3 in surface seawaters with average concentrations of 0 11 0 04 μm and 0 31 0 04 μm respectively however concentrations of 129i species vary dramatically ranging from 1 44 0 04 108 to 1773 106 108 atoms l for 129i and 1 69 0 03 108 to 2746 111 108 atoms l for 129io3 clear features of longitude dependence of 127i species are observed as the atlantic water flows toward the north sea through the english channel there is a downward trend of 127io3 r2 0 51 p 0 01 along the transect from west to east while 127i concentration goes up slightly r2 0 71 p 0 01 the dominate iodine species is iodate for both 127i and 129i and the english channel shows higher level of iodide 0 13 0 01 μm than the celtic sea 0 04 0 02 μm in contrast 129i 127i ratios for iodide are generally higher than that of iodate nevertheless species of 129i 129i 129io3 and 129i 127i 129i 127i 129io3 127io3 show similar patterns in the studied area with three orders of magnitude increase from the celtic sea to the dover strait whereas high levels occur between the dover strait and cap de la hague although dissolved organic iodine may exist but it should not constitute a substantial component in the studied waters as conversion of iodine to organic form in ocean seawater was not an essential process doi was mainly reported in the coastal estuary and fresh waters and consequently we expect only a negligible amount of doi for both 127i and 129i in our samples that should not drastically influence data interpretation in the study area see supplementary materials for details discussion 129i and its species can be implemented as sensitive oceanographic tracers to provide insight into seawater exchange and transport and environmental processes of stable iodine in the marine environment since the major sources of 129i are a priori known changes of 129i and its species are indicatives of in situ iodine redox processes as well as the mixing of water masses with different speciation characteristics distribution and conversion of iodine species in the english channel strong to moderate positive correlations between salinity and 127i r 0 71 p 0 01 and 127io3 r 0 59 p 0 01 depict a dilution effect of the eastward movement of atlantic water within the english channel by continental runoff fig s4 this feature is also indicated by considerable increase of 129i and its species from la hague moving eastwards fig 2 however 127i concentrations remain nearly constant and do not display clear correlation with salinity it appears that the freshwater dilution cannot fully explain variation of iodine and its species in the channel to eliminate the dilution effect the iodine values are corrected to salinity 35 which is expressed as rationalized value rv 1 rv iodine concentration salinity 35 the linear relationship between rationalized iodide r 127i and iodate r 127io3 is presented in fig 3 a the negative correlation of r 127i and r 127io3 r 0 53 p 0 01 reflects occurrence of iodate iodide conversion in the channel water there is not a 1 1 conversion between r 127io3 and r 127i which is inconsistence with earlier investigations in the open oceans where iodide formation was almost quantitatively comparable to iodate supply wong et al 2001 this feature suggests that part of 127io3 is not converted to 127i considering negligible organic iodine in our samples some iodate is more likely to be scavenged as particulate iodine or other inorganic volatile species fig 4 additionally bio utilization is another possible explanation as probably more iodate is consumed and intracellularly stored but a lesser iodide is produced and released by some algal species chance et al 2007 the strong positive correlation between 129i and 129io3 concentrations r 0 99 p 0 01 fig 3b implies that either the reduction of 129io3 or the oxidation of 129i in the surface water is insignificant comparing to the advection and consequent dilution although iodate is the major species of 129i and 127i there is a large discrepancy of iodide to iodate molecular ratios i io3 between 129i and 127i observed in the channel fig s5a pointing out the influence of the different sources on iodine isotopes speciation 129i is commonly produced by fission of uranium and plutonium in the nuclear fuel in nuclear reprocessing plant spent fuel is chopped and dissolved under high temperature where 95 of radioactive iodine is volatilized as molecular iodine i2 with a minor fraction 3 remains particulate iodine in solution umadevi et al 2021 the released i2 then undergoes iodine trapping processes to prevent gaseous emission mainly as caustic scrubbing process the main reaction equation is shown below 2 3i2 g 6oh aq 5i aq io3 aq 3h2o l this means that iodine in the trap solution contains extremely high 129i with a 129i 129io3 ratio of 5 unfortunately no measured 129i 129io3 data either in the iodine emission control system or liquid discharge pipeline from la hague plant are available nevertheless the la hague derived 129i species signal is clearly reflected in channel waters with high 129i 129io3 0 77 0 13 ratios compare to 127i 127io3 0 41 0 13 specifically the average 129i 129io3 ratio in the eastern channel is 0 71 0 11 and we have not found marked change between cape la hague and the dover strait which suggests an insignificant conversion between 129i and 129io3 in this region the ratio in the west part 0 86 0 12 is however 17 higher than that in the east fig s5b a two tailed t test indicates that the 129i 129io3 ratios in the western channel are statistically different from the east p 0 01 this feature implies that the western channel waters are labelled with an older la hague signal that underwent reduction of 129io3 fig 4 the reduction may be a result of biological intermediated processes because high chlorophyll α with seasonal variations is particularly common in the western english channel where intense summer algae blooms were recorded in 2009 and 2010 barnes et al 2015 thus bio mediated production of 129i is likely to proceed although transformation of iodate to iodide seems not straightforward in terms of phytoplankton biomass wong et al 2002 besides 129i 129io3 ratio as high as 3 56 was reported in german bight under anoxic environment demonstrates a notable 129io3 reduction in estuary areas where the water is more reductive with expected longer residence time hou et al 2007 therefore in the western english channel reduction of 129io3 in shallow coastal estuarine waters and later mixing with atlantic water is another possible mechanism that contributes to high 129i 129io3 ratio high ratio of iodide to iodate is however not well reflected in 127i 127io3 because compared to 127i 129i is more sensitive to water masses mixing process photochemical production of iodide is possible in ocean surface under strong solar irradiation but this reaction seems to be fast with order of hours hou et al 2007 reported a 129i 129io3 of 0 51 in the western channel in summer which was substantially lower compared to our observations in winter therefore 129i produced by photochemical process is expected to be insignificant in this area characterization of iodine isotopes 129i and 127i species in the celtic sea and the dover strait the celtic sea is directly open to the atlantic ocean and 127i concentrations in this area 0 35 0 41 μm fig 2 are lower than the open ocean 0 45 μm but comparable to the british coast and the irish sea truesdale et al 1994 schnabel et al 2007 this phenomenon suggests that in the celtic sea atlantic water labeled with high 127i has been partly modified by low 127i water from the irish sea it is interesting that although the irish sea is generally characterized with high 127i content 127i 127io3 0 18 0 43 127i 127io3 ratios in the celtic sea have not been apparently altered during the mixing which are consistent with typical atlantic water 0 1 consequently iodide oxidation process is probably involved in the celtic surface water but the conversion mechanisms of iodide to iodate are still unclear in the presence of strong oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide and or ozone abiotic processes are suggested for iodide oxidation via several intermediate stages such as i2 and hoi wong et al 2008b moreno et al 2020 3 2i h2o2 2h i2 2h2o 4 i2 h2o hoi i h 5 i h o3 hoi o2 6 i hoi h i2 h2o the later steps concerning iodate formation from hoi and i2 are poorly understood which may be biologically mediated bluhm et al 2011 or abiotically as suggested in the reactions below 7 3hoi io3 2i 3h 8 hoi o3 io2 o2 h 9 io2 o3 io3 o2 however currently we do not have information about dissolved h2o2 or o3 in this area nevertheless oxidation of iodide must be an extremely slow process because 129i 129io3 ratios in the celtic sea are not statistically different from the western english channel this feature also suggests that the la hague 129i speciation discharges play a major role in the celtic sea it is worth noting that as shown in fig 2 127i concentration observed in the celtic sea is lower than that in the western channel an abrupt increase of 127i and 127i were observed in the area off the south cornwall coast uk where celtic seawater characterized by high salinity 35 3 and low 129i 127i 1 5 10 8 is mixed with the fresher 35 1 and high 129i 127i 12 5 10 8 channel water conversely 127io3 values between the channel water and the open sea shows little change and demonstrate that the elevated 127i stock in the western english channel is directly linked to net replenishment of 127i a possible explanation is that this extra 127i reflects the upwelling of iodine rich bottom water which is driven by occurrence of winter turnover große et al 2015 in this case 127i may be released from decomposition of organic matter in sediment under anoxic environment or formed in situ from 127io3 as bottom water ascends chapman et al 2011 further investigations in this transition region are needed to address iodine speciation in water column and sediment an interesting observation is found in station 31 in the celtic sea where the surface water shows relatively high 129i 127i 129i 129io3 and 127i 127io3 compared to surrounding waters figs 2 and s2 this might be attributed to local reduction of iodate and or a southward transport of 129i rich irish water this region represents the front of winter breakdown of thermocline which may result in high primary productivity and thereby initiates biological reduction of iodate pingree et al 1975 however considering exceptionally high 129i 129io3 transport of irish sea water with sellafield bearing 129i signal to this area seems to have occurred to our knowledge the 129i species have never been described in sellafield releases but it is reasonable to assume a high and distinctive 129i 129io3 ratios in the irish sea in this sense sample 31 reflects the influence of sellafield plume that was modified during its transport consequently how the sellafield labeled 129i transport southwards and subsequently affects 129i speciation in the celtic sea western english channel area is vital in future investigations thus our data will serve as a basis for understanding long term 129i transport and the origins of water masses coming into the celtic sea and entering the western english channel it has long been recognized that radionuclides discharged from la hague plant transport along inshore french coast toward the southern north sea therefore compared to other sample collections sampled stations 2 5 located in the vicinity of dover strait should capture and reflect major la hague 129i plume because they are close to the french coast 129i 127i atomic ratios in these waters vary a lot and could reach as high as 1 88 10 6 an increasing trend that was followed by a slight decrease of 129i 129io3 was observed from stations 2 to 5 fig s6 this feature mainly describes water masses mixing rather than iodate iodide conversion processes because the changes of 129i and 127i and their species have the same simultaneous trends furthermore a high speed water flow 0 5 m s observed through the dover strait indicates an insufficient reaction time for iodine species conversion although presently we do not have information about 129i species in the thames river estuary the region is likely characterized with relatively high 129i 129io3 and low 127i content because river waters are mainly recharged by meteoric water with high fraction of 129i aldahan et al 2006 hou et al 2009 therefore the mixing process can be expressed by incursion of low 129i and 127i concentration and high 129i 129io3 ratio coastal water from the british east coast probably the thames river estuary into the english channel fig 4 however the influence of coast water mixing must be limited because 129i and its species have overwhelmingly determined by marine discharges from la hague facility fate of 129i species in surface seawater reduction of la hague derived 129io3 has been previously reported on its journey from the english channel to the baltic sea yi et al 2012 within the eastern channel however we have not observed any apparent relationship between 129io3 129i and the distance from la hague p 0 28 fig s7 this confirms an insignificant 129io3 reduction during its transport from la hague to the dover strait with a transit time about 4 9 months guéguéniat et al 1994 salomon et al 1995 besides 129io3 129i in eastern channel seawater measured in 2005 0 61 0 02 hou et al 2007 was comparable with our results 0 60 0 04 measured in 2010 moreover the release history and treatment of spent fuel for 129i from la hague have not dramatically changed over the years 2011 2020 compared with 2010 fig s1 these observations support speciation ratios to be comparable in the discharged water accordingly if the speciation ratio remains constant 129io3 129i of 0 60 then this value can be used in the future as a characteristic tag from the eastern english channel to trace water masses within and beyond the channel nevertheless to explore 129io3 reduction rate in ocean surface water we assume that 1 there is no annual or interannual variation of initial 129io3 129i in the eastern english channel and 2 the dilution and reduction are the only two considerations leading to 129io3 decrease in water column this is because the effect of 129i bio assimilation and subsequent scavenging as 129i contained organic particles from water column is insignificant comparing large amounts of 129i released from nrfs thus 129io3 reduction rate r can be calculated by the differences of 129io3 129i between a source a and specific site b after a transit time t 10 r v a v b v a t 100 where v represents value of 129io3 129i ratio water currents and transit time of 129i plume from la hague to the baltic sea along the continental coast have been well documented guéguéniat et al 1994 salomon et al 1995 given transit time of one year for 129i transports from la hague to central north sea an annual 129io3 reduction rate of 16 7 is obtained this percentage does not seem very plausible because 129io3 129i remains nearly unchanged during its first 4 9 months transport from la hague to the dover strait accordingly 129io3 129i in the north sea is significantly influenced by dispersal of very low 129io3 129i from the continental coast towards the central part therefore water masses mixing and dilution rather than conversion are the major factors that regulate 129i species distribution in the north sea interior since the eastward movement of water in the channel 129i conveyed from la hague to the south cornwall coast uk should have longer time than that flows to the dover strait consequently in the western english channel about 5 of 129io3 is annually reduced when the transit time is assumed as one year from la hague to the westmost channel this feature again confirms a rather sluggish 129io3 reduction in ocean surface water the 129io3 129i data in surface seawater fig 5 suggest that regardless of sampling period different behaviours of 129i species are observed in the shelf seas and the open ocean during its journey from la hague to the baltic region three fast 129io3 reduction events occur in areas of estuary or semi enclosed marine system where relatively long residence time is expected with large amounts of freshwater input this pattern may be explained as the development of anoxic circumstance generated by continental runoff that contains nutrients and reducing agents coastal tidal current and winter turnover may enhance 129io3 reduction when mixing with anoxic sediment pore waters the la hague originated 129io3 is firstly reduced in the rhine river estuary of the dutch coast where the 129io3 129i suddenly reduced from 0 60 to 0 39 within 11 months after another 3 months transport 129io3 is further reduced in the elbe river estuary of the german bight because even lower 129io3 129i values 0 22 0 37 were observed in this region since oxidation process is proved slow once iodide is produced hughes et al 2021 increase of 129io3 129i along the jutland coast towards the skagerrak demonstrates fast mixing process with the north sea water during water transport in the baltic sea 129io3 129i is dramatically dropped to 0 05 0 07 indicating a remarkable reductive environment in the transition zone of kattegat however the low 129io3 129i mainly reflects mixing process according to the depth profiles information yi et al 2012 in the open ocean high values 0 64 0 84 are observed off the portugal coast specifically this water shows comparable iodide iodate ratio for both 127i and 129i indicating that equilibrium is established it is difficult to estimate 129i oxidation rate because transit times from la hague and sellafield to this area are not documented 129i from these nrfs mainly moves to the arctic ocean followed by returned plume across denmark strait towards northwestern atlantic orre et al 2010 therefore it is reasonable to expect long transit times in the range of decades with this in mind an annual 129i oxidation rate of 5 can be deduced if we assume the transit time is 15 years hou et al 2000 this situation becomes even more complicated if we consider atmospheric 129i deposition in this region as moving further south to 30 40 n three zones of low 129io3 129i values occur which may response to local formation of 129i or link to mixing of water mass from the mediterranean sea he et al 2013 inventory of 129i in the english channel discharges from the la hague facility which have been reflected in seaweeds nearby are expected to remain at the level of 200 kg year fig s1 this feature indicates that the north atlantic the nordic seas and the arctic ocean will continue receiving relatively high amount of 129i during the coming future therefore it is important to estimate 129i inventory under la hague release rate of 200 kg year which can be served as a benchmark for future studies unfortunately surface waters along the french coast that reflects the main 129i flow were not collected during the 2010 expedition however fiévet et al 2020 reported 129i in fucus serratus were 4 17 bq kg dry 10 6 in 129i 127i in the proximity of la hague plant in 2010 despite seasonal variations these biological samples are used for 129i evaluation in coastal water besides considering comparable la hague 129i discharges data in 2005 and 2016 were also involved for a better channel coverage fig s1 and references therein a box model was applied to estimate 129i inventory the entire english channel is divided into western and eastern parts and gridded into 10 km 10 km the shallow eastern channel is considered as a well mixed region whereas the deeper west part is stratified in summer and mixed in winter smyth et al 2010 große et al 2015 thus 129i in the western english channel is also assumed homogenously distributed throughout water column the calculation in each grid is performed by multiplying 129i concentration and its corresponding water volume fig s8 as shown in fig 6 the inventory of 129i in the english channel is 145 19 kg in which around 90 resides in the east part our estimate is in excellent agreement with previous numerical model outcome of about 123 kg in 2010 villa et al 2015 also the estimate agrees with the corresponding amount of la hague discharges in half a year the residence time in the east part of channel as discussed before 129i species conversion is insignificant and therefore the average 129io3 129i ratios in the west and east part of the english channel are adopted to estimate inventories of 129i species the results reveal about 79 kg 129io3 and 66 kg 129i in the channel additionally if mean flux of 1 26 105 m3 s through the dover strait is considered bailly du bois et al 2005 the annual transport of 129i and 129io3 from the english channel to the north sea are 119 kg and 167 kg respectively although relatively large uncertainty exists this result provides a base to evaluate 129i species fluxes originated from the english channel marine sediment is another 129i reservoir but presently we have no data on 129i in the sediment of the region considered a rough estimate of 120 kg of 129i in the english channel was made by analyzing ocean sediment cores elsewhere aldahan et al 2007 nevertheless compared to the la hague release record the combined estimation indicates that only 5 of 129i resides in the channel the predictive modeling by snyder et al 2010 suggests an increase in the 129i dispersion from the nrfs to the nordic seas the arctic and the north atlantic in the future among the reasons for the increased dispersion of the isotope is the warming of the north atlantic water due to climate change and related upwelling from deeper water of the nordic seas and labrador seas since 129i is generally oxidized in the oxygenated open seawater during its large scale transport the differences between iodide iodate ratio for 129i and 127i are expected to gradually decrease and become equal over the years this may happen in most remote places such as the south atlantic ocean 129i from the western europe may migrate into the southern hemisphere through the global thermohaline circulation but presently there is no direct measurement from the south atlantic ocean xing et al 2017 reported 129i speciation in surface seawater collected from the antarctic shelf seas these waters exhibited a remarkable discrepancy between iodide iodate ratios for 129i and 127i fig s9 this feature does not support the idea that 129i discharged from nrfs will eventually arrive the antarctic region though global ocean current system alternatively the major source of 129i in antarctic may be originated from stratospheric 129i fallout which deserves further investigation by analyzing 129i speciation in ice core consequently data of 129i speciation will add significant information about oceanwater circulation and iodine geochemistry conclusions and outlook we observed the reduction and depletion of 127io3 in the english channel which were most likely due to bio associated processes meanwhile 129io3 is reduced in the western channel at a rather slow rate whereas in the eastern channel 129i species transformation is insignificant with an overall constant value of 129io3 129i the estimated 129i inventory in the channel water is 145 19 kg far less than the accumulative releases from la hague regional water masses mixing around the dover strait as well as winter convection in the celtic sea western english channel transition zone can be traced by 127i and 129i species most of 129i from nrfs that undergoes long distance dispersion will profoundly influence global redistribution of 129i and its species the general conservative nature of 129i in open ocean means that the distinct 129io3 129i ratio that reflects la hague wastewater signal might be traced far beyond the channel this signal can also be used for oceanographic model verification and calibration in studying details of spatial and temporal evolution of iodine in ocean water in the celtic sea the sources of 129i may partly be the water masses originated from the irish sea which may eventually enter the english channel future work should include a more detailed time and depth related iodine isotope speciation data to identify better the sources and transport pathways and biogeochemistry of 129i in the celtic sea western english channel transition zone since all reprocessing activities at sellafield plant

15490,radioactive iodine 129 has been released from the la hague nuclear fuel reprocessing facility nrf into the english channel but the distribution and transformation of the isotope species and environmental consequences have not been fully characterized in the channel here we present data on iodine isotopes 129i and 127i species in surface water of the english channel and the southern celtic sea compared to 127i species the concentrations of 129i and 129io3 show more variations but iodate is the major species for both 129i and 127i our data provide new information regarding iodide iodate inter conversion showing that water dilution and mixing are the main factors affecting the 127i and 129i species distribution in the channel some reduction of iodate occurs within the english channel and mainly in the west part because of biotic processes the 129i species transformation is overall insignificant especially in the eastern channel where a constant value of 129io3 129i is observed which might characterize the la hague wastewater signal in the celtic sea oxidation of iodide can be traced by 127i and 129i species on a larger scale 129i generally experienced an oxidation process in the atlantic ocean while in the coast of shallow shelf seas new produced 129i can be identified especially in the german bight and the baltic sea the data of 129i species in the english channel can provide estimate of redox rates in a much broader marine areas if the transit time of 129i from la hague is well defined furthermore estimate of inventories for 129i and its species in the channel and fluxes of 129i species from the english channel to the north sea add important information to the geochemical cycle of 129i graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 129i english channel iodine species iodine isotopes seawater data availability data will be made available on request introduction the world s two largest commercial nuclear reprocessing facilities nrfs namely la hague france and sellafield uk contribute 97 of 129i half life 1 57 107 years in the environment to date with releases from la hague representing about 2 3 fig s1 the la hague derived 129i commonly resides in the english channel before its further transport to mainly the north sea in view of its low energy radiation 129i is currently considered radiologically not hazardous and is applied as an environmental tracer and for the iodine biogeochemistry casacuberta et al 2018 castrillejo et al 2018 humphrey et al 2020 qiao et al 2021 as a result a large amount of 129i measurements have been undertaken globally but only a few considering the speciation of the isotope simultaneously the marine geochemical cycle of iodine species is essential for marine ecosystem and the tropospheric ozone depletion iodine in seawaters mainly exists as inorganic forms iodate and iodide and significant quantities of dissolved organic iodine doi are often observed in some coastal inshore and estuarine waters wong et al 2008a iodine species exhibit different behaviours i e mobility and bioavailability in marine environment therefore chemical speciation analysis of iodine is of major concern which provides insight into iodine fixation conversion and migration patterns however it is difficult to distinguish locally produced iodine species from advected elsewhere because their sources and transport pathways are usually not well defined on a regional scale this problem can be solved by 129i speciation which has overwhelmed sources from the la hague and the sellafield marine discharges a few studies have reported a higher iodide iodate value for 129i in seawater compared to 127i and they related this discrepancy to specific sources and exchanges of oceanic water masses hou et al 2013 liu et al 2016 xing et al 2020 conversions between iodine species may also alter the values but the process is sluggish and thermodynamically unfavorable which may alternatively mediate through biological or photochemical effects truesdale et al 2007 because of the dominant anthropogenic source the nuclear reprocessing facilities theoretically 129i is a powerful tool to estimate iodate reduction rate or iodide oxidation rate in ocean surface with a well defined transit time therefore it is vital to investigate 129i species and in particular in the english channel as it serves as a starting point in this respect yi et al 2012 suggested that the annual 129io3 reduction rate is 5 10 in surface water from english channel to skagerrak this estimate based on very small numbers of measurements however does not consider variation of 129i species in the english channel the english channel is a shallow narrow waterway that connects the celtic sea in the west and the north sea in the east the west and east parts of the english channel have different environmental and hydrographic conditions which may result in different 129i behaviours for example 129i from la hague mainly flows eastward which means the residence time of 129i in the eastern channel is expected short compared to the west another point is that in the western english channel the impact of sellafield should be considered as part of the sellafield release 1 may enter the channel via the celtic sea bailly du bois et al 1999 additionally the western part of the channel is wider and deeper and the water is more saline with a seasonal thermocline 15 25 m established in april may and eroded in september november pingree et al 1975 how 129i speciation is affected by these factors in the channel is interesting and remains unclear the transformation of iodine species in particular the 129i species can reflect the change of marine primary production and marine environment since bacteria enzyme and plankton activity could control the formation of iodide bluhm et al 2011 furthermore 129i speciation in the eastern channel represents key signal of la hague discharge which is valuable for 129i source identification knowing that 129i species data are few and sparse in this region only four measurements hou et al 2007 the english channel represents one of the most 129i contaminated waters and with the well documented release record of la hague it provides an excellent point source for tracer applications of the 129i species here we present extensive results of iodine isotopes species iodide and iodate in the english channel that aim at revealing sources distribution patterns and transformation dynamic of the isotopes species within and beyond the english channel this work combined with earlier investigations in the neighboring areas will add significant information on iodine biogeochemistry in the marine environment samples and analytical methods samples and reagents surface seawater samples were collected from 34 sites that covering the english channel and the celtic sea during 2010 2011 icebreaker oden antarctica cruise in october november 2010 fig 1 real time meteorological and water ctd data were simultaneously measured along the transect seawater of 0 5 l from the eastern channel and 2 0 l from the western channel and the celtic sea were used for analysis of species of iodine isotopes after filtration immediately onboard through a 0 45 μm membrane sartorius ag gottingen germany all water samples were stored in polyethylene bottles hydro bios under cold and dark conditions before chemical analysis 129i standard nist srm 4949c of the national institute of standard and technology gaithersburg md usa carrier free 125i from amersham pharmacia biotech little chalfout buckinghamshire uk and carrier 127i woodward iodine mical specialty chemicals new jersey usa were used in the analysis a 50 100 mesh of bio rad ag1 4 anion exchange resin bio rad laboratories richmond ca was used for iodine species separation because of different affinities of iodide and iodate on the resin all chemical reagents used were of analytical grade and all solutions were prepared with deionized water 18 2 mω separation of iodine species iodine species separation were strictly followed the protocol set up by hou et al 2007 the filtered seawater mixed with 0 1 ml of 125i tracer 250 bq was loaded to an ag1 4 anion exchange column no3 form ø 1 0 20 cm after loading seawater the column was washed with 30 ml deionized water and 50 ml of 0 2 mol l nano3 the effluent and two washes were collected for separation of iodate iodide adsorbed on the resin was eluated by 60 ml of 10 naclo solution and further separated by solvent extraction to the fractions of 129io3 1 0 ml iodine carrier 2 mg ml and 0 1 ml tracer 125io3 250 bq were added 1 0 ml of 1 mol l na2s2o5 and 10 ml 3 mol l hno3 were added to adjust ph 2 to reduce iodine to iodide 20 50 ml chcl3 was added to extract iodine as i2 by using 2 5 ml of 1 0 mol l nano2 repeated this procedure several times until no i2 in chcl3 phase a similar procedure was used to separate total 129i from original seawater samples for the 129i fraction in the eluate 1 0 ml iodine carrier was added followed by 3 0 mol l hno3 to remove the excessive naclo iodine as i2 was extracted by adding of 20 50 ml chcl3 followed by 1 0 mol l nh2oh hcl solution to reducing formed io3 by naclo to molecular iodine i2 repeated this procedure several times until no i2 in chcl3 phase in the experiment five procedure blanks were prepared at the same time to monitor the cross contamination and the laboratory background the recoveries of iodine species after separation and solvent extraction measured by 125i using gamma radiation detector were 72 84 for 129i and 87 99 for 129io3 determination of 127i and 129i 1 0 ml of each fraction seawater iodate effluent and iodide eluate was mixed with cs internal standard 200 ppb and then diluted for 10 times using 1 nh3 h2o solution the concentration of iodine 127i was determined using an x seriesⅱ icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry the detection limit calculated as 3sd of blanks was 0 02 ppb for 129i determination 1 0 mol l agno3 was added to form agi precipitate that was centrifuged and washed with 1 0 mol l hno3 and water to remove ag2so3 and agcl formed in this process and finally dried at 70 c the dried precipitation as agi was mixed with nb powder and the mixture was pressed into a cathode for ams accelerator mass spectrometry measurement under terminal voltage of 3 5 mev at the tandem laboratory uppsala university the 129i 127i isotopic ratio in standard was 1 1 0 1 10 11 and the background of the ams system was 4 10 14 the statistical error 1sd of the 129i measurements was 10 results water temperature in the transect ranges from 13 7 c to 14 8 c where the relatively higher temperature appears in the middle of the english channel and decreases towards both ends alternatively a clear increase trend is observed for salinity from the north sea to the celtic sea fig s2 ranges and distributions of iodine species 127i 129i 127io3 129io3 are presented in figs 2 and s3 respectively all analytical data are shown in table s1 in general 127i concentrations do not show a pronounced variation 0 42 0 04 μm while 129i exhibits a large spread at 2 87 4670 108 atoms l for iodine species we observe relatively small variations of both 127i and 127io3 in surface seawaters with average concentrations of 0 11 0 04 μm and 0 31 0 04 μm respectively however concentrations of 129i species vary dramatically ranging from 1 44 0 04 108 to 1773 106 108 atoms l for 129i and 1 69 0 03 108 to 2746 111 108 atoms l for 129io3 clear features of longitude dependence of 127i species are observed as the atlantic water flows toward the north sea through the english channel there is a downward trend of 127io3 r2 0 51 p 0 01 along the transect from west to east while 127i concentration goes up slightly r2 0 71 p 0 01 the dominate iodine species is iodate for both 127i and 129i and the english channel shows higher level of iodide 0 13 0 01 μm than the celtic sea 0 04 0 02 μm in contrast 129i 127i ratios for iodide are generally higher than that of iodate nevertheless species of 129i 129i 129io3 and 129i 127i 129i 127i 129io3 127io3 show similar patterns in the studied area with three orders of magnitude increase from the celtic sea to the dover strait whereas high levels occur between the dover strait and cap de la hague although dissolved organic iodine may exist but it should not constitute a substantial component in the studied waters as conversion of iodine to organic form in ocean seawater was not an essential process doi was mainly reported in the coastal estuary and fresh waters and consequently we expect only a negligible amount of doi for both 127i and 129i in our samples that should not drastically influence data interpretation in the study area see supplementary materials for details discussion 129i and its species can be implemented as sensitive oceanographic tracers to provide insight into seawater exchange and transport and environmental processes of stable iodine in the marine environment since the major sources of 129i are a priori known changes of 129i and its species are indicatives of in situ iodine redox processes as well as the mixing of water masses with different speciation characteristics distribution and conversion of iodine species in the english channel strong to moderate positive correlations between salinity and 127i r 0 71 p 0 01 and 127io3 r 0 59 p 0 01 depict a dilution effect of the eastward movement of atlantic water within the english channel by continental runoff fig s4 this feature is also indicated by considerable increase of 129i and its species from la hague moving eastwards fig 2 however 127i concentrations remain nearly constant and do not display clear correlation with salinity it appears that the freshwater dilution cannot fully explain variation of iodine and its species in the channel to eliminate the dilution effect the iodine values are corrected to salinity 35 which is expressed as rationalized value rv 1 rv iodine concentration salinity 35 the linear relationship between rationalized iodide r 127i and iodate r 127io3 is presented in fig 3 a the negative correlation of r 127i and r 127io3 r 0 53 p 0 01 reflects occurrence of iodate iodide conversion in the channel water there is not a 1 1 conversion between r 127io3 and r 127i which is inconsistence with earlier investigations in the open oceans where iodide formation was almost quantitatively comparable to iodate supply wong et al 2001 this feature suggests that part of 127io3 is not converted to 127i considering negligible organic iodine in our samples some iodate is more likely to be scavenged as particulate iodine or other inorganic volatile species fig 4 additionally bio utilization is another possible explanation as probably more iodate is consumed and intracellularly stored but a lesser iodide is produced and released by some algal species chance et al 2007 the strong positive correlation between 129i and 129io3 concentrations r 0 99 p 0 01 fig 3b implies that either the reduction of 129io3 or the oxidation of 129i in the surface water is insignificant comparing to the advection and consequent dilution although iodate is the major species of 129i and 127i there is a large discrepancy of iodide to iodate molecular ratios i io3 between 129i and 127i observed in the channel fig s5a pointing out the influence of the different sources on iodine isotopes speciation 129i is commonly produced by fission of uranium and plutonium in the nuclear fuel in nuclear reprocessing plant spent fuel is chopped and dissolved under high temperature where 95 of radioactive iodine is volatilized as molecular iodine i2 with a minor fraction 3 remains particulate iodine in solution umadevi et al 2021 the released i2 then undergoes iodine trapping processes to prevent gaseous emission mainly as caustic scrubbing process the main reaction equation is shown below 2 3i2 g 6oh aq 5i aq io3 aq 3h2o l this means that iodine in the trap solution contains extremely high 129i with a 129i 129io3 ratio of 5 unfortunately no measured 129i 129io3 data either in the iodine emission control system or liquid discharge pipeline from la hague plant are available nevertheless the la hague derived 129i species signal is clearly reflected in channel waters with high 129i 129io3 0 77 0 13 ratios compare to 127i 127io3 0 41 0 13 specifically the average 129i 129io3 ratio in the eastern channel is 0 71 0 11 and we have not found marked change between cape la hague and the dover strait which suggests an insignificant conversion between 129i and 129io3 in this region the ratio in the west part 0 86 0 12 is however 17 higher than that in the east fig s5b a two tailed t test indicates that the 129i 129io3 ratios in the western channel are statistically different from the east p 0 01 this feature implies that the western channel waters are labelled with an older la hague signal that underwent reduction of 129io3 fig 4 the reduction may be a result of biological intermediated processes because high chlorophyll α with seasonal variations is particularly common in the western english channel where intense summer algae blooms were recorded in 2009 and 2010 barnes et al 2015 thus bio mediated production of 129i is likely to proceed although transformation of iodate to iodide seems not straightforward in terms of phytoplankton biomass wong et al 2002 besides 129i 129io3 ratio as high as 3 56 was reported in german bight under anoxic environment demonstrates a notable 129io3 reduction in estuary areas where the water is more reductive with expected longer residence time hou et al 2007 therefore in the western english channel reduction of 129io3 in shallow coastal estuarine waters and later mixing with atlantic water is another possible mechanism that contributes to high 129i 129io3 ratio high ratio of iodide to iodate is however not well reflected in 127i 127io3 because compared to 127i 129i is more sensitive to water masses mixing process photochemical production of iodide is possible in ocean surface under strong solar irradiation but this reaction seems to be fast with order of hours hou et al 2007 reported a 129i 129io3 of 0 51 in the western channel in summer which was substantially lower compared to our observations in winter therefore 129i produced by photochemical process is expected to be insignificant in this area characterization of iodine isotopes 129i and 127i species in the celtic sea and the dover strait the celtic sea is directly open to the atlantic ocean and 127i concentrations in this area 0 35 0 41 μm fig 2 are lower than the open ocean 0 45 μm but comparable to the british coast and the irish sea truesdale et al 1994 schnabel et al 2007 this phenomenon suggests that in the celtic sea atlantic water labeled with high 127i has been partly modified by low 127i water from the irish sea it is interesting that although the irish sea is generally characterized with high 127i content 127i 127io3 0 18 0 43 127i 127io3 ratios in the celtic sea have not been apparently altered during the mixing which are consistent with typical atlantic water 0 1 consequently iodide oxidation process is probably involved in the celtic surface water but the conversion mechanisms of iodide to iodate are still unclear in the presence of strong oxidants e g hydrogen peroxide and or ozone abiotic processes are suggested for iodide oxidation via several intermediate stages such as i2 and hoi wong et al 2008b moreno et al 2020 3 2i h2o2 2h i2 2h2o 4 i2 h2o hoi i h 5 i h o3 hoi o2 6 i hoi h i2 h2o the later steps concerning iodate formation from hoi and i2 are poorly understood which may be biologically mediated bluhm et al 2011 or abiotically as suggested in the reactions below 7 3hoi io3 2i 3h 8 hoi o3 io2 o2 h 9 io2 o3 io3 o2 however currently we do not have information about dissolved h2o2 or o3 in this area nevertheless oxidation of iodide must be an extremely slow process because 129i 129io3 ratios in the celtic sea are not statistically different from the western english channel this feature also suggests that the la hague 129i speciation discharges play a major role in the celtic sea it is worth noting that as shown in fig 2 127i concentration observed in the celtic sea is lower than that in the western channel an abrupt increase of 127i and 127i were observed in the area off the south cornwall coast uk where celtic seawater characterized by high salinity 35 3 and low 129i 127i 1 5 10 8 is mixed with the fresher 35 1 and high 129i 127i 12 5 10 8 channel water conversely 127io3 values between the channel water and the open sea shows little change and demonstrate that the elevated 127i stock in the western english channel is directly linked to net replenishment of 127i a possible explanation is that this extra 127i reflects the upwelling of iodine rich bottom water which is driven by occurrence of winter turnover große et al 2015 in this case 127i may be released from decomposition of organic matter in sediment under anoxic environment or formed in situ from 127io3 as bottom water ascends chapman et al 2011 further investigations in this transition region are needed to address iodine speciation in water column and sediment an interesting observation is found in station 31 in the celtic sea where the surface water shows relatively high 129i 127i 129i 129io3 and 127i 127io3 compared to surrounding waters figs 2 and s2 this might be attributed to local reduction of iodate and or a southward transport of 129i rich irish water this region represents the front of winter breakdown of thermocline which may result in high primary productivity and thereby initiates biological reduction of iodate pingree et al 1975 however considering exceptionally high 129i 129io3 transport of irish sea water with sellafield bearing 129i signal to this area seems to have occurred to our knowledge the 129i species have never been described in sellafield releases but it is reasonable to assume a high and distinctive 129i 129io3 ratios in the irish sea in this sense sample 31 reflects the influence of sellafield plume that was modified during its transport consequently how the sellafield labeled 129i transport southwards and subsequently affects 129i speciation in the celtic sea western english channel area is vital in future investigations thus our data will serve as a basis for understanding long term 129i transport and the origins of water masses coming into the celtic sea and entering the western english channel it has long been recognized that radionuclides discharged from la hague plant transport along inshore french coast toward the southern north sea therefore compared to other sample collections sampled stations 2 5 located in the vicinity of dover strait should capture and reflect major la hague 129i plume because they are close to the french coast 129i 127i atomic ratios in these waters vary a lot and could reach as high as 1 88 10 6 an increasing trend that was followed by a slight decrease of 129i 129io3 was observed from stations 2 to 5 fig s6 this feature mainly describes water masses mixing rather than iodate iodide conversion processes because the changes of 129i and 127i and their species have the same simultaneous trends furthermore a high speed water flow 0 5 m s observed through the dover strait indicates an insufficient reaction time for iodine species conversion although presently we do not have information about 129i species in the thames river estuary the region is likely characterized with relatively high 129i 129io3 and low 127i content because river waters are mainly recharged by meteoric water with high fraction of 129i aldahan et al 2006 hou et al 2009 therefore the mixing process can be expressed by incursion of low 129i and 127i concentration and high 129i 129io3 ratio coastal water from the british east coast probably the thames river estuary into the english channel fig 4 however the influence of coast water mixing must be limited because 129i and its species have overwhelmingly determined by marine discharges from la hague facility fate of 129i species in surface seawater reduction of la hague derived 129io3 has been previously reported on its journey from the english channel to the baltic sea yi et al 2012 within the eastern channel however we have not observed any apparent relationship between 129io3 129i and the distance from la hague p 0 28 fig s7 this confirms an insignificant 129io3 reduction during its transport from la hague to the dover strait with a transit time about 4 9 months guéguéniat et al 1994 salomon et al 1995 besides 129io3 129i in eastern channel seawater measured in 2005 0 61 0 02 hou et al 2007 was comparable with our results 0 60 0 04 measured in 2010 moreover the release history and treatment of spent fuel for 129i from la hague have not dramatically changed over the years 2011 2020 compared with 2010 fig s1 these observations support speciation ratios to be comparable in the discharged water accordingly if the speciation ratio remains constant 129io3 129i of 0 60 then this value can be used in the future as a characteristic tag from the eastern english channel to trace water masses within and beyond the channel nevertheless to explore 129io3 reduction rate in ocean surface water we assume that 1 there is no annual or interannual variation of initial 129io3 129i in the eastern english channel and 2 the dilution and reduction are the only two considerations leading to 129io3 decrease in water column this is because the effect of 129i bio assimilation and subsequent scavenging as 129i contained organic particles from water column is insignificant comparing large amounts of 129i released from nrfs thus 129io3 reduction rate r can be calculated by the differences of 129io3 129i between a source a and specific site b after a transit time t 10 r v a v b v a t 100 where v represents value of 129io3 129i ratio water currents and transit time of 129i plume from la hague to the baltic sea along the continental coast have been well documented guéguéniat et al 1994 salomon et al 1995 given transit time of one year for 129i transports from la hague to central north sea an annual 129io3 reduction rate of 16 7 is obtained this percentage does not seem very plausible because 129io3 129i remains nearly unchanged during its first 4 9 months transport from la hague to the dover strait accordingly 129io3 129i in the north sea is significantly influenced by dispersal of very low 129io3 129i from the continental coast towards the central part therefore water masses mixing and dilution rather than conversion are the major factors that regulate 129i species distribution in the north sea interior since the eastward movement of water in the channel 129i conveyed from la hague to the south cornwall coast uk should have longer time than that flows to the dover strait consequently in the western english channel about 5 of 129io3 is annually reduced when the transit time is assumed as one year from la hague to the westmost channel this feature again confirms a rather sluggish 129io3 reduction in ocean surface water the 129io3 129i data in surface seawater fig 5 suggest that regardless of sampling period different behaviours of 129i species are observed in the shelf seas and the open ocean during its journey from la hague to the baltic region three fast 129io3 reduction events occur in areas of estuary or semi enclosed marine system where relatively long residence time is expected with large amounts of freshwater input this pattern may be explained as the development of anoxic circumstance generated by continental runoff that contains nutrients and reducing agents coastal tidal current and winter turnover may enhance 129io3 reduction when mixing with anoxic sediment pore waters the la hague originated 129io3 is firstly reduced in the rhine river estuary of the dutch coast where the 129io3 129i suddenly reduced from 0 60 to 0 39 within 11 months after another 3 months transport 129io3 is further reduced in the elbe river estuary of the german bight because even lower 129io3 129i values 0 22 0 37 were observed in this region since oxidation process is proved slow once iodide is produced hughes et al 2021 increase of 129io3 129i along the jutland coast towards the skagerrak demonstrates fast mixing process with the north sea water during water transport in the baltic sea 129io3 129i is dramatically dropped to 0 05 0 07 indicating a remarkable reductive environment in the transition zone of kattegat however the low 129io3 129i mainly reflects mixing process according to the depth profiles information yi et al 2012 in the open ocean high values 0 64 0 84 are observed off the portugal coast specifically this water shows comparable iodide iodate ratio for both 127i and 129i indicating that equilibrium is established it is difficult to estimate 129i oxidation rate because transit times from la hague and sellafield to this area are not documented 129i from these nrfs mainly moves to the arctic ocean followed by returned plume across denmark strait towards northwestern atlantic orre et al 2010 therefore it is reasonable to expect long transit times in the range of decades with this in mind an annual 129i oxidation rate of 5 can be deduced if we assume the transit time is 15 years hou et al 2000 this situation becomes even more complicated if we consider atmospheric 129i deposition in this region as moving further south to 30 40 n three zones of low 129io3 129i values occur which may response to local formation of 129i or link to mixing of water mass from the mediterranean sea he et al 2013 inventory of 129i in the english channel discharges from the la hague facility which have been reflected in seaweeds nearby are expected to remain at the level of 200 kg year fig s1 this feature indicates that the north atlantic the nordic seas and the arctic ocean will continue receiving relatively high amount of 129i during the coming future therefore it is important to estimate 129i inventory under la hague release rate of 200 kg year which can be served as a benchmark for future studies unfortunately surface waters along the french coast that reflects the main 129i flow were not collected during the 2010 expedition however fiévet et al 2020 reported 129i in fucus serratus were 4 17 bq kg dry 10 6 in 129i 127i in the proximity of la hague plant in 2010 despite seasonal variations these biological samples are used for 129i evaluation in coastal water besides considering comparable la hague 129i discharges data in 2005 and 2016 were also involved for a better channel coverage fig s1 and references therein a box model was applied to estimate 129i inventory the entire english channel is divided into western and eastern parts and gridded into 10 km 10 km the shallow eastern channel is considered as a well mixed region whereas the deeper west part is stratified in summer and mixed in winter smyth et al 2010 große et al 2015 thus 129i in the western english channel is also assumed homogenously distributed throughout water column the calculation in each grid is performed by multiplying 129i concentration and its corresponding water volume fig s8 as shown in fig 6 the inventory of 129i in the english channel is 145 19 kg in which around 90 resides in the east part our estimate is in excellent agreement with previous numerical model outcome of about 123 kg in 2010 villa et al 2015 also the estimate agrees with the corresponding amount of la hague discharges in half a year the residence time in the east part of channel as discussed before 129i species conversion is insignificant and therefore the average 129io3 129i ratios in the west and east part of the english channel are adopted to estimate inventories of 129i species the results reveal about 79 kg 129io3 and 66 kg 129i in the channel additionally if mean flux of 1 26 105 m3 s through the dover strait is considered bailly du bois et al 2005 the annual transport of 129i and 129io3 from the english channel to the north sea are 119 kg and 167 kg respectively although relatively large uncertainty exists this result provides a base to evaluate 129i species fluxes originated from the english channel marine sediment is another 129i reservoir but presently we have no data on 129i in the sediment of the region considered a rough estimate of 120 kg of 129i in the english channel was made by analyzing ocean sediment cores elsewhere aldahan et al 2007 nevertheless compared to the la hague release record the combined estimation indicates that only 5 of 129i resides in the channel the predictive modeling by snyder et al 2010 suggests an increase in the 129i dispersion from the nrfs to the nordic seas the arctic and the north atlantic in the future among the reasons for the increased dispersion of the isotope is the warming of the north atlantic water due to climate change and related upwelling from deeper water of the nordic seas and labrador seas since 129i is generally oxidized in the oxygenated open seawater during its large scale transport the differences between iodide iodate ratio for 129i and 127i are expected to gradually decrease and become equal over the years this may happen in most remote places such as the south atlantic ocean 129i from the western europe may migrate into the southern hemisphere through the global thermohaline circulation but presently there is no direct measurement from the south atlantic ocean xing et al 2017 reported 129i speciation in surface seawater collected from the antarctic shelf seas these waters exhibited a remarkable discrepancy between iodide iodate ratios for 129i and 127i fig s9 this feature does not support the idea that 129i discharged from nrfs will eventually arrive the antarctic region though global ocean current system alternatively the major source of 129i in antarctic may be originated from stratospheric 129i fallout which deserves further investigation by analyzing 129i speciation in ice core consequently data of 129i speciation will add significant information about oceanwater circulation and iodine geochemistry conclusions and outlook we observed the reduction and depletion of 127io3 in the english channel which were most likely due to bio associated processes meanwhile 129io3 is reduced in the western channel at a rather slow rate whereas in the eastern channel 129i species transformation is insignificant with an overall constant value of 129io3 129i the estimated 129i inventory in the channel water is 145 19 kg far less than the accumulative releases from la hague regional water masses mixing around the dover strait as well as winter convection in the celtic sea western english channel transition zone can be traced by 127i and 129i species most of 129i from nrfs that undergoes long distance dispersion will profoundly influence global redistribution of 129i and its species the general conservative nature of 129i in open ocean means that the distinct 129io3 129i ratio that reflects la hague wastewater signal might be traced far beyond the channel this signal can also be used for oceanographic model verification and calibration in studying details of spatial and temporal evolution of iodine in ocean water in the celtic sea the sources of 129i may partly be the water masses originated from the irish sea which may eventually enter the english channel future work should include a more detailed time and depth related iodine isotope speciation data to identify better the sources and transport pathways and biogeochemistry of 129i in the celtic sea western english channel transition zone since all reprocessing activities at sellafield plant has been announced to cease in 2020 sellafield ltd 2017 our work provides unique 129i data for future prediction of the propagation of isotope signal in the celtic sea and the north sea declaration of

15491,quantitatively and accurately analyzing nonpoint source nps pollution is essential for efficiently preventing the input of nps loads into inland waters however the accuracy of previous nps pollution models is limited by the accuracy of ground parameter data in addition there are few effective methods that thoroughly verify modeling results at large scales this paper presents a framework for accurate nps pollution estimation by coupling satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle uav monitoring data and the results are verified by both field sampling and a newly developed inlet nps pollution observation simulation method fractional vegetation coverage fvc data obtained by satellite were used to improve the accuracy of the runoff module of the framework satellite and uav data were coupled to acquire livestock data determine inlets and identify reservoir buffer zones and vegetation types these new data were then used to improve the accuracy of the livestock and runoff modules in the framework the results show that the estimation accuracy of total nitrogen total phosphorus ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand with fvc were improved by 39 96 69 29 54 05 and 47 22 in relative error respectively the high resolution livestock data acquisition improved the estimation accuracy of the nps pollution load by 7 53 the high resolution inlet extraction improved the accuracy by 3 24 the high resolution buffer zone identification improved the accuracy with the estimated nps pollutant concentration into reservoir decreasing by 60 99 finally the high resolution vegetation type identification improved the accuracy by 10 72 the framework performs satisfactorily which was verified based on the simulated nps observations with an average relative error of 11 54 24 31 we found that the fvc livestock number and inlet number are key parameters for nps pollution modeling the introduction of monthly variation in the fvc makes the modeled nps pollution load much higher in areas with mature complex forested ecosystems or densely distributed vegetation but much lower in areas with sparsely distributed vegetation the above methods provide a scientific reference for high efficiency nps pollution prevention in inland waters laying a solid basis for decision making regarding water quality management in data scarce regions around the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nonpoint source pollution modeling water quality hydrology unmanned aerial vehicle satellite miyun reservoir data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction globally water pollution directly affects and restricts the sustainable development of human beings grant et al 2018 yu et al 2019 nonpoint source nps pollution has been recognized as a key problem that significantly affects water quality around the world liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020a flood et al 2022 in the united states 80 of rivers and 85 of lakes are affected by nps pollution and five of the top six identified sources of river and stream quality impairments were nonpoint sources niraula et al 2013 usepa 2016 in china human activities have resulted in widespread water quality deterioration directly impacting the overall ecological environment and socioeconomic development ju et al 2009 the ratios of nps nitrogen n and phosphorus p pollution to total water pollution in china range up to 81 and 93 respectively for these two types of pollution the contribution of agricultural nps pollution varies from 40 to 60 ouyang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 compared with point source pollution nps pollution is difficult to measure and control liu et al 2020 in addition it is characterized by uncertainty randomness complexity intermittence and variability increasing the difficulty of quantitative estimation governance and management liu et al 2020 at present many methods have been developed to estimate nps pollution loads the nps pollution models include empirical models such as the export coefficient model ecm johnes 1996 and improved export coefficient model iecm ding et al 2017 and mechanism models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat model zhang et al 2019a agricultural nonpoint source agnps model haregeweyn and yohannes 2003 and chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model knisel et al 1980 most models are widely used but their performance varies for almost all models the calibration of a large number of parameters requires a large body of input data and the low accuracy of the input data increases the uncertainties of the nps pollution estimation yen et al 2015 for example vegetation can hinder nps nutrient pollution transport as a major factor contributing to watershed nps nutrient movement fractional vegetation cover fvc is not uniformly distributed within each hydrological unit ouyang et al 2009 however fvc has not received sufficient attention in previous models such as the swat model which regards fvc as homogeneous or ignores it when estimating nps pollution in runoff which further increases the uncertainty of the results zhang et al 2019a in addition as livestock is one of the major sources of nps pollution loads applying inaccurate livestock data will lead to poor nps pollution estimates chen et al 2013 cui et al 2021 previous methods estimate farmland runoff pollution based only on land use type without distinguishing vegetation types which increases the uncertainty of nps pollution estimation because vegetation type determines the type and application rate of fertilizer n p etc zhang et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 the roles of inlets and buffer zones in nps pollutant estimation have also been previously ignored which has resulted in underestimation of the amount of nps pollution in reservoirs if the number of inlets was neglected and overestimation if the buffer zones were ignored as buffer zones always reduce nps pollution from land to reservoir wang et al 2020a wu and lu 2021 satellites are commonly used to obtain ground data e g land use required by nps pollution models and can provide data over large areas cheng et al 2022 however satellites are not flexible enough as they are often constrained by cloud cover and view angle in contrast unmanned aerial vehicles uavs are able to produce high resolution images and are frequently used due to their acquisition flexibility emilien et al 2021 uavs are intelligent digital and automated and are often used together with satellites to monitor environmental risks jiang et al 2021 in addition uavs have been widely used for surveying and mapping agricultural plant protection environmental monitoring sudden pollution incident responses and so on however uav data have rarely been used in nps pollution models the coupling of satellite and uav data has promising potential as much more accurate data become available for nps pollution modeling zheng et al 2021 in addition to nps pollution estimation the verification of modeling results is difficult the simulated nps pollution load in rivers is often verified by measured water quality data these data are mainly obtained by researchers through field sampling and water quality testing adu et al 2018 however it is difficult to obtain field monitoring data because water quality sampling and monitoring are time consuming and labor intensive and it is challenging to validate models in areas where data are lacking li et al 2016 therefore there is an urgent need to find a proxy for measurements of nps pollution in waters to improve the simulation accuracy of nps pollution models in data scarce areas this paper aims to improve the accuracy of nps pollution modeling by coupling satellite and uav images and developing a new method for nps pollution modeling verification based on large scale field surveys and nps pollution sampling data in 2018 throughout beijing this study 1 used satellites to obtain the fvc 2 coupled uav and satellite images to capture high accuracy ground parameters vegetation type livestock number number of inlets etc and 3 developed a new method as a proxy for nps measurements to verify the nps pollution simulations to improve the accuracy of nps pollution modeling this will significantly improve the accuracy of nps pollution modeling enriching the theories of nps pollution estimation and therefore providing a solid basis for decision making regarding water quality management in data scarce regions around the world 2 study area beijing is the capital of china and its largest surface drinking water source is the miyun reservoir the miyun reservoir 116 47 117 05 e 40 26 40 35 n has a total capacity of 4 355 billion m3 and is located at the junction of the chao river and the bai river fig 1 cinnamon soil brown soil meadow soil and chestnut soil are the four principal soil types in the study area shi et al 2004 the miyun reservoir plays an important role in supplying drinking water to beijing liang et al 2016 and provides 78 8 of the beijing surface water supply 1 1 beijing water affairs statistical yearbook 2011 overall its water quality is categorized as class ii of the national environmental standard for surface water nessw gb3838 2002 most of the time however due to the influence of human activities the ecological environment of the miyun reservoir watershed has changed dramatically consequently the pollutant concentration of the inflowing runoff has increased and the pollution risk of the whole reservoir has greatly increased in the upper reach of the reservoir watershed frequent agricultural activities on sloping fields have led to vegetation destruction soil erosion and nutrient losses li et al 2016 a large amount of n p and other contaminants are released into the waters due to the massive application of fertilizers and the effluents of untreated sewage qiu et al 2018 nps pollution is the main water use impairment in the upper watershed of the miyun reservoir and poses large threats to the water quality of the reservoir geng et al 2019 protecting the water quality of the miyun reservoir is urgently needed jiang et al 2021 cai et al 2022 previous uncertainties in nps pollution estimation led to the increased risk of water eutrophication and toxicity in the miyun reservoir qiu et al 2018 therefore accurately modeling nps pollution in this area is highly necessary to ensure a source of safe drinking water for beijing however uncertainties resulting from the lack of data and low resolution satellite images hinder informed policy making therefore it is urgently necessary to couple satellite and uav images to accurately estimate nps pollution for the miyun reservoir due to the advantages of uavs such as high resolution flexibility and automation in addition the miyun reservoir watershed has few datasets of historical observations and represents a data scarce region thus the rain induced flooding and nps pollution processes in the miyun reservoir watershed can be simulated only by using a model suitable for data scarce regions 3 data and methods 3 1 data 3 1 1 satellite data landsat 8 oli level 2 data atmospherically corrected using the lasrc algorithm usgs 2019 with a ground spatial resolution of 30 m were downloaded from the earth explorer usgs united states geological survey web service http earthexplorer usgs gov landsat 8 acquires data over the earth s surface every 16 days ke et al 2015 digital elevation model dem images were downloaded from gs cloud http www gscloud cn the data on land use types were obtained through fusion of tm multispectral images and spot panchromatic band data and the accuracy of the land use types was further improved by combining field survey results and human computer interaction interpretation in addition to the satellite data soil data from 2018 were obtained from sis china soil information system of china by shi et al 2004 and rainfall data were provided by the beijing hydrology general station china for details refer to table 1 3 1 2 uav data the uav employed in this study is a phantom 3 standard dji the uav flew at 200 m above the ground at a speed of 10 m s at 16 sites in fig 1 in 2020 and collected a total of 924 photographs the same flight parameters table 2 were used for all sites and all flights were conducted under sunny sky conditions as shown in fig 2 photogrammetry was designed to acquire 70 80 forward overlap and lateral overlap to ensure the accuracy of the subsequent software generated data such as stereo image pair point cloud and digital surface model dsm datasets which were generated in pix4dmapper software https www pix4d com 3 1 3 ground survey data the main streams and representable tributaries were investigated in the miyun reservoir watershed among which 16 survey sites were deployed to sample and record ground information along with uav flight in 2020 fig 2 and table 3 accordingly soil samples and questionnaires were collected for model parameter calibration and verification data on population livestock farming and agriculture were obtained from statistical data and questionnaire surveys the population livestock and fertilizer usage data are from the beijing statistical yearbook 2018 then we interpolated the above data at all sites to the entire watershed by using an inverse distance interpolation approach in arcgis 10 6 for nps pollution modeling 3 2 methods by coupling satellite and uav data a high accuracy framework was established to estimate and verify the load and inflow of nps pollution in areas with scarce ground data the framework consists of three parts eco rudim runoff dispersion modeling ecohat nps and nps land river transition model first eco rudim was used to simulate the storm runoff flow process second the ecohat nps model was used to estimate the nps pollutant load inland additionally vegetation coverage data obtained by satellite were used to estimate nps pollution from runoff and livestock data retrieved from satellite and uav images were used to estimate nps pollution from livestock the inlets extracted from satellite and uav images were used to estimate the amount of nps pollution tn total nitrogen tp total phosphorus nh3 n ammonia nitrogen cod chemical oxygen demand transported into the miyun reservoir and the buffer zones identified in satellite and uav images were used to estimate the nps pollutant concentrations in reservoirs furthermore the vegetation types identified in the satellite and uav images were used to determine the fertilizer types and application amounts finally the nps pollutant load of each pixel inland was effectively transformed into the pollutant concentration entering the rivers through a newly developed land river transition model in addition a second new method was developed to inversely calculate the observations of nps pollutant concentrations entering rivers based on water quality observations to verify the results of the above nps pollutant modeling 3 2 1 using satellites to obtain the fvc to improve the accuracy of nps estimation to retrieve the fvc operational land imager olt images between june 1 and october 31 2018 that had a quality flag of nine and were at least partially cloud free were downloaded from the u s geological survey usgs global visualization viewer glovis website http glovis usgs gov bands 4 red visible and 5 near infrared were radiometrically corrected to at sensor reflectance to correct for seasonal reflectance variances caused by the sun angle and distance and reprojected to universal transverse mercator at a 30 meter spatial resolution the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated with the method of gao et al 2000 based on which the fvc was calculated by using the method from gutman and ignatov 1998 3 2 2 coupling satellites and uav images to obtain a wide range of high resolution data on river inlets buffer zones vegetation types and livestock higher accuracy river inlet buffer zone vegetation type and livestock data can significantly improve the accuracy of nps pollution modeling however the lack of high accuracy data always results in large uncertainties in nps pollution modeling in previous studies slope and slope length were usually obtained from a 30 m dem and inlet information was obtained by extraction of the water system based on a 30 m dem xu et al 2016 resulting in the extracted inlet number being lower than the actual inlet number satellite images coupled with uav images can profoundly improve the estimation accuracy of the parameters through this method as well as ground surveys we therefore obtain high accuracy datasets related to the above parameters this same technique can be applied in data scarce regions around the world where the above parameters are difficult to collect 3 2 2 1 identifying inlets in a reservoir in this paper the initial location of the inlet was visually extracted according to the landsat 8 images the potential inlet location based on terrain was extracted by dem using the hydrology toolbox of arcgis a series of processes including filling the dem to make it devoid of sinks and generating a flow direction map by using the filled dem as an input raster were conducted to generate a flow accumulation map based on the map a stream network which represents the natural course of runoff water and inlets was obtained then the satellite determined potential inlets were verified and densified by a uav derived digital orthophoto map dom with which the final inlets were determined hence the exact number of reservoir inlets eq 1 was obtained by coupling satellite and uav images 1 n f n s n u a v where nf is the number of final inlets ns is the number of satellite determined potential inlets and nuav is the number of uav determined inlets the software pix4d https www pix4d com was adopted to splice uav photos to the dsm with a spatial resolution of 8 75 cm when flying at an altitude of 200 m zhang et al 2018 the dsm reflects the high precision terrain information of the study area 3 2 2 2 determining reservoir buffer zones and vegetation types conventional satellites cannot clearly identify vegetation types in buffer zones which greatly lowers the nps pollution modeling accuracy in small and medium scale areas therefore this paper adopts satellite images coupled with uav images to extract reservoir buffer zones and identify vegetation types in the study area satellite images dem elevation data land use were used to delimit the reservoir buffer area based on which the buffer zone width was preliminarily determined by considering the official protected area where the elevation was less than 155 m a s l in the miyun reservoir mcpgb 2014 then uavs flew along the boundaries to generate a dom using pix4dmapper software https www pix4d com to refine the buffer zone boundary by excluding roads and construction land to identify vegetation types the vegetation type attributes within a satellite image were artificially assigned to pixels through visual interpretation these pixels are divided into different types according to which typical sites are determined then the visually interpreted vegetation types were refined based on the typical sites with the help of high resolution uav imagery by using a semantic segmentation approach u net schiefer et al 2020 or visual interpretation whereby vegetation types and species changes in the miyun reservoir watershed were monitored and analyzed taking the areas with both satellite images and uav flights as templates prior knowledge of the vegetation types was applied and the vegetation type attributes within the satellite image were modified based on the uav identified vegetation type at typical sites then based on the modified vegetation type at typical sites the vegetation type identified by satellite images across the whole area was refined this method combines the advantages of object oriented classification and human computer interaction recognition so the classification accuracy and efficiency can be greatly improved 3 2 2 3 recognizing basic livestock type number and location livestock are important external sources of nps pollution in waters godfray et al 2018 it is particularly important to obtain accurate distributed livestock data for nps pollution estimation therefore we first analyzed the type and scale of farms based on satellite imagery and statistical data and selected representative farms with sizes ranging from small to large then we used uavs to obtain high resolution images to obtain the number of livestock in the representative farms directly finally based on the information on representative farms from uav images we used a formula eq 2 to obtain the number of livestock on all farms within our study area 2 l n i a i a 0 l n 0 where lni is the livestock number of the ith farm ai is the area of the ith farm a0 is the area of the standard farm measured by the uav and ln0 is the livestock number of the standard farm determined by the uav 3 2 3 nps pollution estimation and verification 3 2 3 4 eco rudim to simulate storm runoff processes eco rudim was used to analyze the runoff yield and confluence processes and to determine the location where the rainwater enters the reservoir zhao et al 2022 the formulas of the model are as follows 3 q t k α f t c j 1 t c i t k 1 δ t 4 q t q 1 t m 1 q 2 t m 2 q n t m n 5 m i l i v i where q tk is the runoff at time tk itk 1 is the net rain intensity at time tk j f is the catchment area controlled by a road α is the unit conversion coefficient qt is the discharge of the i th road catchment at the waterlogging point at time t n is the number of road catchment areas i is the road catchment number ranging from 1 to n li is the flow of the outlet of the i road catchment to a low lying point and mi is the number of time periods required by runoff in the outlet of the i th road catchment to reach the low lying point 3 2 3 5 ecohat nps to estimate nps pollution load ecohat nps yang et al 2011 divides the yield and migration of nps pollution into dissolved and adsorbed pollution loads the dissolved pollution modeling is classified into four types urban runoff rural life livestock and poultry breeding and cropland runoff the adsorbed pollution modeling is undertaken by the soil erosion module the spatial scale of the ecohat nps model is flexible and the model is suitable for nps estimation in complex mixed watersheds with agricultural and urban areas the model can work at multiple temporal scales such as daily monthly and yearly notably the addition of fvc as an input factor can make the estimation of runoff nps more accurate zheng et al 2009 in addition the ecohat nps model is in line with the characteristics of china in terms of simulating the relationship between rainfall and runoff the reason is because the rainfall characteristics in china are monsoonal which is different from those in the usa as china receives most of its annual rainfall in summer therefore the empirical relationship for estimating the initial abstraction and runoff in other widely used models such as swat us is not suitable for the chinese geographical and hydrometeorological conditions therefore we selected the ecohat nps model to simulate nps pollution 3 2 3 6 land river transition model to transform the inland pollutant load into the pollutant concentration in rivers we developed a novel land river transition model that can effectively convert the nps pollution load of each pixel inland into the pollutant concentration in rivers previous models have usually estimated land nps pollution without considering the process by which it enters the river in fact only part of the nps pollution load generated on land reaches the river so it is important to link the land and river settings together to form an integrated simulation system our land river transition model is able to complete this linkage this model couples satellite and uav data to find the inlets and obtain the detailed underlying conditions and it considers the effect of the reservoir riparian belt on pollutant reduction well as shown in eq 6 6 ρ j n j i i o i j w where i is the grid number i is the total number of catchment grids oij is the load of the j th pollutant in the i th grid nj is the solubility coefficient of the j th pollutant w is the amount of water at an inlet and ρj is the concentration of the j th pollutant at the inlet in brief the three models of eco rudim ecohat nps and the land river transition model can fully describe the nps pollution process from the land derived load to the concentration in waters the data required by the three models are listed in table 4 3 2 3 7 verification of nps pollution estimates flowing into waters by developing an inlet nps observation simulation method based on onsite monitored water quality data coupled with a one dimensional river water quality model a novel method eqs 7 9 was proposed to quickly determine the observation of nps pollutants flowing into rivers from land and this model was then used to verify the accuracy of nps pollution estimates from the above three models based on the concentration of pollutants and the water discharge monitored at upstream and downstream water quality stations the concentration of nps pollutants entering the river at each inlet is determined iteratively with the error between the measured and modeled concentrations of pollutants at the downstream stations less than 10 7 c s d i i c i 0 e k x i u x i w i j j c j 0 e k x j u x j w j c a u w a u i i w i j j w j w a u 8 c i 0 α a i l i x i c a d c b 9 c b j j c j 0 e k x j u x j w j c a u w a u j

simply need to find a few typical river sections and monitor water quality indicators tn tp nh3 n cod a few times to determine the parameters of the water quality model and then the observation of nps pollution into the river can be deduced based on this the parameters of the nps pollution model could be further calibrated to ensure the estimation accuracy 3 2 3 8 calibration of model parameters based on ground investigation coupled with uavs and satellites using a questionnaire and field sampling method the investigation and sampling of nps pollution information were carried out to calibrate the model parameters first we identified the main land use types in the study area e g forest grassland cropland river rural area through the fusion of tm multispectral images and spot panchromatic band data based on the land use type data representative sites were selected second high resolution images were generated by uav flights at these sites using high resolution image analysis and a questionnaire survey we obtained information on these sites including the land use types vegetation types agricultural activity information the situation of waste disposal in rural areas and the situation of livestock production additionally other adjustable parameters garbage disposal rate garbage inflow rate etc were determined by coupling the literature and a questionnaire survey soil samples 0 20 cm depth at representative sites were also collected and four indices tn tp cod and nh3 n were determined in the laboratory finally the representative ground information obtained above was applied to the whole watershed and parameters in ecohat nps garbage disposal rate of livestock rural city garbage inflow rate garbage accumulation rate of livestock rural city were calibrated using the pollutant concentrations measured from the above soil samples at the representative sites 4 results 4 1 using satellites to obtain the fvc to improve the modeling accuracy of nps pollution from agricultural runoff based on landsat images we calculated the fvc of the miyun watershed as an input parameter for the ecohat nps model using the runoff module as an example and with the measured nps pollution we compared the results with and without considering the fvc fig 3 a shows that the average estimate of nps pollution tn tp nh3 n and cod without the fvc is higher than that with the fvc fig 3b shows that the average relative errors of nps pollution tn tp nh3 n and cod without the fvc is 24 57 84 18 68 48 and 47 21 higher than those with the fvc 15 39 14 89 14 43 and 0 01 the accuracy of the nps pollution estimates was significantly improved especially in the estimation of tp nh3 n and cod which improved by 69 29 54 05 and 47 22 respectively after the fvc was introduced fig 3b ignoring the fvc made the model estimated nps pollution much higher 4 2 coupling satellite and uav images to obtain a wide range of high resolution data on reservoir inlets buffer zones vegetation types and livestock for nps pollution modeling accuracy improvement 4 2 1 inlet extraction improved the nps estimation accuracy by 3 24 landsat remote sensing images dem data and uav images were used to identify the inlets of reservoirs fig 4 shows that 10 inlets of the reservoir can be identified through landsat remote sensing images while 18 inlets of the miyun reservoir were extracted from coupled satellite and uav images fig 4 the coupling method makes the inlet extraction more accurate based on the remote sensing image recognized inlets the estimated amounts of nps pollution tn tp nh3 n and cod transported into the miyun reservoir annually are 3023 75 57 29 555 43 and 12 494 23 t respectively the amounts estimated based on the inlets extracted from coupled satellite uav data are 3109 97 75 23 586 73 and 12 645 47 t respectively the nps pollution estimates with the coupling method identified inlets were 2 77 23 84 5 33 and 1 20 higher than those with only satellite identified inlets the reason is that the nps pollution flowing into rivers in subwatersheds failed to be modeled because fewer inlets were identified in the satellite images consequently the amount of nps pollution in the reservoir is severely underestimated these findings indicate that coupling satellite and uav images to obtain inlets greatly improves the simulation accuracy of nps pollution in reservoirs 4 2 2 buffer zone identification decreases the estimated nps pollutant concentration in the reservoir by 60 99 compared with estimates without considering the role of the buffer zone based on the satellite and uav images the buffer zone of the miyun reservoir was identified and the width of the buffer zone and the distribution of land use cover were obtained the buffer zone ranges from 48 to 4500 m with the widest section in the northeast and the narrowest section in the west fig 5 ten types of land use cover were identified and classified consisting of 24 61 forestland 0 30 shrub land 1 71 open forestland 2 27 other woodland 16 60 natural grassland 2 36 river 3 66 bottomland 1 81 artificial grassland 6 50 montane dry cropland 6 17 hilly dry cropland and 34 01 plain dry cropland fig 5 as shown in fig 6 when considering the existence of the buffer zone the concentration of tn transported into the miyun reservoir significantly decreased with a large reduction range of 60 99 the actual removal efficiency is determined by various factors including the physical and chemical properties of the soil the width and slope of the lakeside zone and the decontamination ability of the vegetation wang et al 2020b in other words considering buffer zones decreases the estimated nps pollutant concentration in the reservoir by 60 99 4 2 3 livestock data acquisition improved the estimation accuracy of the nps pollution load by 7 53 the accuracy of the livestock data significantly affects the precision of nps pollution estimation based on statistical yearbook data one can obtain the number of livestock in each region the smallest region is the district level to estimate the total amount of nps pollution but one cannot obtain the distribution of nps pollution at a more detailed level coupling satellite and uav images can accurately locate livestock locations fig 7 and interpolation analysis can be conducted in these areas to obtain a more accurate spatial distribution of nps pollution we compared the results of nps pollution estimation in the miyun area based on livestock data from only statistical yearbooks with those based on the integrated data from uav and satellite images and statistical yearbooks the results show that the nps pollution load estimated by the former is higher fig 8 a the relative error between the estimated and measured values tn tp nh3 n cod is 67 06 43 12 57 21 and 18 55 respectively the relative error between the estimates by the latter and the measured values is 13 82 35 83 11 92 and 2 32 the estimates by the latter are 53 24 7 29 45 29 and 16 23 more accurate than those by the former fig 8b 4 2 4 vegetation type identification improved the accuracy of nps pollutant estimation by 10 72 through the uav images we obtained vegetation types on the ground fig 9 which were used for the estimation of the nps pollution load in the miyun watershed fig 10 a shows that the average estimates of nps pollution load tn tp nh3 n and cod with vegetation type identification are lower than those without vegetation type identification after identifying vegetation types the relative errors for the estimation of the four pollutants tn tp nh3 n and cod are 15 39 14 89 14 43 and 2 50 respectively while those without vegetation type identification are 25 20 86 19 69 33 and 44 27 fig 10b the identification of vegetation types by coupling satellite and uav images improved the accuracy of nps pollution estimation by 10 72 with the tp estimation having the most improvement 72 and the tn estimation having the least improvement 10 moreover the spatial distribution of the nps pollution load changes greatly after identifying vegetation types because of the spatial distribution of fertilizer and pesticide dependent plants such as castanea mollissima which is mostly distributed on the northwest side of the miyun reservoir resulting in a large nps pollution load in the northwest areas fig 9 4 3 using the newly developed method to verify the ecohat nps model to calibrate the parameters in ecohat nps the concentrations of tn tp nh3 n and cod in the soil sampled within the miyun reservoir watershed were measured fig 11 based on which the parameters of ecohat nps were calibrated the ecohat nps model with the calibrated parameters was then used to simulate the nps pollutant load in rivers within the watershed through inlets since there are no observations at the inlets to verify the model simulations the newly developed method eqs 7 9 was employed to invert observations from the water quality observation of the nps pollutant load in rivers through the inlets based on the water quality data at monitoring sections in the miyun reservoir watershed then the cross validation method was adopted to verify the model based on the observations as seen from table 5 the coefficients of determination r2 of the four pollutants tn tp nh3 n and cod are 0 82 0 94 0 94 and 0 83 respectively and the average relative errors are 24 31 11 58 14 76 and 21 71 respectively the ecohat nps performs satisfactorily when verified by the nps pollutant observations inverted with the new method the new method successfully solves the problem of nps pollution model verification in large scale areas 5 discussion 5 1 influence of monthly variation in fvc on nps pollution estimation in our framework the accuracy of nps pollution estimation was significantly improved after the fvc was introduced in addition considering the fvc caused the model estimated nps pollution results to be much lower the research of ouyang et al 2009 in the upper stream of the yellow river catchment china found that the temporal variation in the fvc was negatively correlated with nps nutrient loading and concluded that vegetation reduces nps nutrient pollution transport poor and mcdonnell 2007 studied the effects of land use on nitrate dynamics in streams in the oak creek watershed usa and found that vegetation especially in the riparian zone can act as a filter and keep pollutants from entering the stream through leaching or biological fixation these studies support the rationality of the findings of our study in contrast with the results in this study gorsevski et al 2008 applied a distributed process based model to define suitable buffer widths in the clearwater national forest cnf in central idaho usa and found that increases in the fvc were positively correlated with reductions in organic nutrient pollution the reason is that their study area is full of mature forest shrubs and grass with a very high fvc 75 100 resulting in the residue in the forest degrading and acting as organic nutrient source which increases the nps pollutant load after being flushed by runoff this suggests that the introduction of the fvc causes the modeled nps pollution load to be much higher in areas with mature complex forested ecosystems or densely distributed vegetation but much lower in areas with sparsely distributed vegetation our study shows that vegetation coverage affects the generation of cropland runoff and then affects the generation and migration of nps pollution influencing the estimation of adsorbed nitrogen and phosphorus in the ecohat nps model this is in accordance with the research of ouyang et al 2009 if only based on land use type without considering the fvc the estimation of nps pollution involves considerable error it can be seen from fig 12 a 1 and b 1 that the area classified as countryside also has a fvc of 40 98 and the forest area that is considered homogeneous in the land use map has different degrees of fvc 22 06 69 95 in this situation land use data were produced at an annual scale while the fvc of the same land use type varies in different seasons if this difference is neglected there could exist varying degrees of uncertainties in nps pollutant estimation seasonally for example the average fvc in june through september ranges from 72 48 to 84 62 showing good vegetation coverage in the miyun reservoir watershed fig 12a but the annual fvc is 53 38 which differs greatly from the actual values neglect of the monthly variation in fvc will inevitably increase the uncertainties in nps estimation to various degrees to avoid this we used finer scale fvc data at the monthly scale in this study to precisely reflect the effect of fvc variation on the generation of runoff and nps pollution thereby improving the accuracy of the nps pollution estimation the introduction of monthly variation in fvc in our study greatly improved the accuracy of nps estimation most models such as the widely used swat also consider the influence of monthly vegetation variation cover management factor without using satellite imagery for nps pollution estimation zhang et al 2019b they mainly consider the effect of monthly vegetation variation on soil conservation but ignore the filtering effect of vegetation on nps pollutants the swat model used a simplified version of the environmental policy integrated climate model epic to simulate a single vegetation growth pattern but it could not express the changing vegetation density as it assumes that the vegetation type is unified so it was difficult to reflect the influence of changing vegetation cover on the nps pollution load ma et al 2019 to summarize the use of fvc parameters in our study obtained by satellite greatly improved the accuracy of nps estimation in the runoff module as it overcame the shortcomings of both uneven vegetation distribution in space and monthly vegetation variation over time while most models assumed a unified vegetation type instead of a diversified vegetation type our study introduced satellite derived fvc which can reflect the actual diversified vegetation type and significantly improved the accuracy of nps estimation 5 2 influence of the resolution of ground parameters on nps pollution estimation 5 2 1 inlet extraction in our framework inlet extraction was based on coupled satellite and uav images and this process improved the nps estimation accuracy by 3 24 as the coupling allows for the inlet extraction to be much more accurate cheng et al 2022 investigated an optimized solution of village relocation selection under the flooding risk of lake growth on the basis of satellite and uav data in angzi co china and found that a uav dem achieves excellent advantages in depicting details of lake shoreline variations this is similar to our results in addition it can be found in this paper that the amount of nps pollution is underestimated when identifying inlets based only on landsat remote sensing images because some nps pollutants were ignored due to incomplete subwatershed extraction from satellite data xu et al 2016 showed that the dem resolution influences watershed delineations and affects the nps pollution estimation accuracy in the xiangxi river watershed china chen et al 2021 also found that refined detailed input data improved the accuracy of the swat model during runoff and tn simulation in the chao river watershed china these results are consistent with our results 5 2 2 livestock data acquisition this study also shows that livestock data acquisition in our framework based on the integrated data from uav and satellite images and statistical yearbook data improved the estimation accuracy of the nps pollution load by 7 53 as coupling satellite and uav images can accurately locate livestock locations and reflect the spatial heterogeneity within a town li et al 2019 studied the challenge of deploying a group of uavs to track and monitor livestock such as cattle and sheep in a pasture of china and found that uavs can acquire the initial locations of all targeted animals this result is in accordance with our results moreover livestock farming accounts for a large proportion of the estimated nps pollutants additionally cui et al 2021 discussed the influences of the spatial scale of the livestock and poultry amount data on estimations of the phosphorus load using the swat model and found that applying refined small scale data of livestock and poultry amounts allows the model to perform better nse 0 76 and re 12 4 than using large scale data nse 0 54 and re 11 11 when estimating phosphorus loads this outcome supports our results furthermore the research of chen et al 2013 suggests that livestock is one of the major sources of nps pollution in the jinjiang river basin china zhang and lou 2011 reported that nps pollutants from agriculture and livestock husbandry are considerably greater than those from industrial wastes and domestic raw sewage these findings also support our results therefore the determination of the number and location of livestock on the ground using high resolution uav imagery can profoundly improve the accuracy of nps pollution estimation 5 2 3 vegetation type identification our study found that vegetation type identification improved the accuracy of nps pollutant estimation by 10 72 compared with that without vegetation type identification the reason is that vegetation type determines the type and application rate of fertilizer application n p etc which affects the accuracy of nps pollution estimation and especially significantly affects the estimation of n and p losses through runoff water in cropland soils gaudinier et al 2018 stackpoole et al 2019 e g the amount of fertilizer applied to poplar and chestnut trees is different zeng et al 2007 yielding different amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in the form of nps our study also shows that the average estimation of the nps pollution load with vegetation type identification is lower than that without vegetation type identification this is because vegetation type with low fertilizer requirements accounted for a large proportion resulting in a lower nps load estimate with vegetation type identification than without vegetation type identification moreover in satellite images with medium spatial resolution such as landsat it is usually difficult to distinguish between different types of vegetation plants so the use of uavs can fill this gap emilien et al 2021 in our study satellite and uav images were coupled to produce new images with high spatial temporal and spectral resolution to determine the type of each crop and tree then the fertilizer rate of the different vegetation species can be determined and these data can be used to estimate runoff contaminants previous methods estimate farmland runoff pollution based only on the land use type without distinguishing vegetation types which increases the uncertainty of nps pollution estimation zhang et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 in contrast our framework involving coupling satellite and uav images to estimate nps pollution can produce a higher accuracy nps pollution estimate 5 3 influence of buffer zone identification on nps pollution estimation reservoir buffer zones play an essential role in maintaining the sustainability of water quality reducing sediment accumulation regulating surface runoff and protecting biodiversity wang et al 2020b in our framework buffer zone identification decreases the estimated nps pollutant concentrations in the reservoir by 60 99 when the buffer zone slope is 5 the width is 5 m and the vegetation type is herbaceous in beijing the average reduction rate of nitrogen is 4 and the average reduction rate of phosphorus is 86 moreover the removal efficiency is positively correlated with the buffer width wang et al 2020b the research of heathwaite et al 1998 in south devon uk showed that the lakeside buffer zone had a good controlling effect on nps pollution and the average removal rates of total n and total p were 70 95 and 70 98 respectively cui et al 2021 estimated n loss before and after the construction of the cropland buffer zone cbz along the west bank of erhai lake china and found that with a 100 m wide cbz n loss was reduced by 87 additionally lyu et al 2021 summarized 123 publications between 1980 and 2020 and found that the average removal efficiency of nitrogen with buffer widths of 16 50 m was 79 1 these results are all consistent with our results buffer zones reduce the loading of nps pollutants because of 1 assimilation of inorganic compounds including nitrogen and phosphorus by plants and their transformation into biomass lyu et al 2021 2 biogeochemical processes occurring as a result of microorganism activity such as denitrification which contribute to nitrogen removal lyu et al 2021 3 sorption and precipitation of soluble phosphorus forms through soil li et al 2019 and 4 processes of sedimentation of soil particles transported in the form of surface runoff which reduces the erosion of soil and transport of insoluble forms of phosphorus dindaroğlu et al 2015 the removal efficiency is controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the soil the width and slope of the lakeside zone and the decontamination ability of vegetation wang et al 2020b thus identifying vegetation types and the width of buffer zones by coupling satellite and uav images in our framework can improve the accuracy of nps pollutant concentration estimation in reservoirs rivers 5 4 the implication of the newly developed verification method for data scarce areas in our framework water quality data at monitoring sections in the miyun reservoir watershed the concentrations of nps pollution flowing into rivers through different inlets were calculated via an inverse method the results were then used as nps pollutant observations to verify the ecohat nps model since there were no observations at the inlets to verify the model simulations xue et al 2021 stated that the verification of nps pollution estimation depends on the monitoring values of river water quality monitoring stations or the values measured during field sampling xue et al 2022 reviewed the research status of nps pollution modeling for the urban rural transitional areas in china and found that the lack of monitoring data limits the development and validations of nps pollution modeling in view of this problem hong and li 2000 established a correlation model based on surface runoff monitoring data in the hanjiang river and heihe river china to simulate nps loads for the verification of their land nps pollution modeling the tn and tp loads simulated by their correlation model were very close to the simulated results by their land nps pollution model this finding supports our method that inverts the observations of nps pollutant loads entering rivers based on observations from routine water quality monitoring stations min et al 2022 simulated the relationships between cultivated land use patterns and nps pollutant loads at the township scale in the chaohu lake basin china and the swat model results were verified using flow data from hydrological stations and tp data measured in field samples however this type of consumes large amounts of time money and labor commonly resulting in a scarcity of monitored data thus this style of monitoring can be ineffective and limit the thorough verification of all land nps pollution simulations at a large scale our method can be applied to large scale areas and thoroughly verifies all simulated land nps loads entering rivers through inlets as routine water quality monitoring stations can cover much larger areas and larger time spans than field sampling therefore our framework namely verifying land nps loads in soil and rivers based on field soil samples and inverted observations ensures the rationality and accuracy of our results as with most studies there are some limitations in this study that could be addressed in the future first more measured water quality data should be collected to verify the newly developed inlet nps observation simulation method to further improve its accuracy second this study evaluated only the accuracy improvement at the monthly scale yet the accuracy at other time scales such as daily and hourly scales needs further study to further test the practicability of our framework at these scales third much more intelligent algorithms such as convolutional neural networks should be used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of vegetation type identification based on satellite and uav images 6 conclusion the present study improved the accuracy of nps pollution modeling by coupling satellite and uav images to obtain the fvc and detailed ground parameters vegetation types livestock numbers inlets etc and a new method for nps pollution modeling verification was developed results show that 1 the introduction of monthly variation in the fvc in this study greatly improved the accuracy of the nps estimation considering the fvc parameters obtained by satellite in the nps pollutant estimation improves the accuracy of tn tp nh3 n and cod estimates by 39 96 69 29 54 05 and 47 22 respectively the introduction of the fvc makes the modeled nps pollution load much higher in areas with a mature complex forested ecosystem or densely distributed vegetation but much lower in areas with sparsely distributed vegetation 2 under the synergistic effect of dem data and uav images 18 inlets were extracted which improved the nps estimation accuracy by 3 24 3 the determination of the number and location of livestock on the ground using high resolution uav imagery can profoundly improve the accuracy of nps pollution estimation the use of such imagery improves the accuracy of the nps pollution load estimates by 7 53 4 satellites and uavs can be used to simultaneously produce images with high spatial temporal and spectral resolutions to determine the type of each crop and tree which improves the estimation accuracy of tn tp nh3 n and cod by 10 72 5 the ecohat nps model performs satisfactorily as was verified using the newly developed method with an average relative error of 11 58 24 31 our framework involving verifying the land nps loads in soil and rivers based on field soil samples and inverted observations ensures the rationality and accuracy of our results and can potentially solve the problem of nps pollution model verification these results can guide decision making in the water environment management of the miyun reservoir as well as other similar regions worldwide owing to the complexity of the nps pollution process uncertainties are unavoidable to reduce the uncertainties it is necessary to conduct more appropriate geospatial processing on the fine

15491,quantitatively and accurately analyzing nonpoint source nps pollution is essential for efficiently preventing the input of nps loads into inland waters however the accuracy of previous nps pollution models is limited by the accuracy of ground parameter data in addition there are few effective methods that thoroughly verify modeling results at large scales this paper presents a framework for accurate nps pollution estimation by coupling satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle uav monitoring data and the results are verified by both field sampling and a newly developed inlet nps pollution observation simulation method fractional vegetation coverage fvc data obtained by satellite were used to improve the accuracy of the runoff module of the framework satellite and uav data were coupled to acquire livestock data determine inlets and identify reservoir buffer zones and vegetation types these new data were then used to improve the accuracy of the livestock and runoff modules in the framework the results show that the estimation accuracy of total nitrogen total phosphorus ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand with fvc were improved by 39 96 69 29 54 05 and 47 22 in relative error respectively the high resolution livestock data acquisition improved the estimation accuracy of the nps pollution load by 7 53 the high resolution inlet extraction improved the accuracy by 3 24 the high resolution buffer zone identification improved the accuracy with the estimated nps pollutant concentration into reservoir decreasing by 60 99 finally the high resolution vegetation type identification improved the accuracy by 10 72 the framework performs satisfactorily which was verified based on the simulated nps observations with an average relative error of 11 54 24 31 we found that the fvc livestock number and inlet number are key parameters for nps pollution modeling the introduction of monthly variation in the fvc makes the modeled nps pollution load much higher in areas with mature complex forested ecosystems or densely distributed vegetation but much lower in areas with sparsely distributed vegetation the above methods provide a scientific reference

1 introduction globally water pollution directly affects and restricts the sustainable development of human beings grant et al 2018 yu et al 2019 nonpoint source nps pollution has been recognized as a key problem that significantly affects water quality around the world liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020a flood et al 2022 in the united states 80 of rivers and 85 of lakes are affected by nps pollution and five of the top six identified sources of river and stream quality impairments were nonpoint sources niraula et al 2013 usepa 2016 in china human activities have resulted in widespread water quality deterioration directly impacting the overall ecological environment and socioeconomic development ju et al 2009 the ratios of nps nitrogen n and phosphorus p pollution to total water pollution in china range up to 81 and 93 respectively for these two types of pollution the contribution of agricultural nps pollution varies from 40 to 60 ouyang et al 2018 yu et al 2019 compared with point source pollution nps pollution is difficult to measure and control liu et al 2020 in addition it is characterized by uncertainty randomness complexity intermittence and variability increasing the difficulty of quantitative estimation governance and management liu et al 2020 at present many methods have been developed to estimate nps pollution loads the nps pollution models include empirical models such as the export coefficient model ecm johnes 1996 and improved export coefficient model iecm ding et al 2017 and mechanism models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat model zhang et al 2019a agricultural nonpoint source agnps model haregeweyn and yohannes 2003 and chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams model knisel et al 1980 most models are widely used but their performance varies for almost all models the calibration of a large number of parameters requires a large body of input data and the low accuracy of the input data increases the uncertainties of the nps pollution estimation yen et al 2015 for example vegetation can hinder nps nutrient pollution transport as a major factor contributing to watershed nps nutrient movement fractional vegetation cover fvc is not uniformly distributed within each hydrological unit ouyang et al 2009 however fvc has not received sufficient attention in previous models such as the swat model which regards fvc as homogeneous or ignores it when estimating nps pollution in runoff which further increases the uncertainty of the results zhang et al 2019a in addition as livestock is one of the major sources of nps pollution loads applying inaccurate livestock data will lead to poor nps pollution estimates chen et al 2013 cui et al 2021 previous methods estimate farmland runoff pollution based only on land use type without distinguishing vegetation types which increases the uncertainty of nps pollution estimation because vegetation type determines the type and application rate of fertilizer n p etc zhang et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 the roles of inlets and buffer zones in nps pollutant estimation have also been previously ignored which has resulted in underestimation of the amount of nps pollution in reservoirs if the number of inlets was neglected and overestimation if the buffer zones were ignored as buffer zones always reduce nps pollution from land to reservoir wang et al 2020a wu and lu 2021 satellites are commonly used to obtain ground data e g land use required by nps pollution models and can provide data over large areas cheng et al 2022 however satellites are not flexible enough as they are often constrained by cloud cover and view angle in contrast unmanned aerial vehicles uavs are able to produce high resolution images and are frequently used due to their acquisition flexibility emilien et al 2021 uavs are intelligent digital and automated and are often used together with satellites to monitor environmental risks jiang et al 2021 in addition uavs have been widely used for surveying and mapping agricultural plant protection environmental monitoring sudden pollution incident responses and so on however uav data have rarely been used in nps pollution models the coupling of satellite and uav data has promising potential as much more accurate data become available for nps pollution modeling zheng et al 2021 in addition to nps pollution estimation the verification of modeling results is difficult the simulated nps pollution load in rivers is often verified by measured water quality data these data are mainly obtained by researchers through field sampling and water quality testing adu et al 2018 however it is difficult to obtain field monitoring data because water quality sampling and monitoring are time consuming and labor intensive and it is challenging to validate models in areas where data are lacking li et al 2016 therefore there is an urgent need to find a proxy for measurements of nps pollution in waters to improve the simulation accuracy of nps pollution models in data scarce areas this paper aims to improve the accuracy of nps pollution modeling by coupling satellite and uav images and developing a new method for nps pollution modeling verification based on large scale field surveys and nps pollution sampling data in 2018 throughout beijing this study 1 used satellites to obtain the fvc 2 coupled uav and satellite images to capture high accuracy ground parameters vegetation type livestock number number of inlets etc and 3 developed a new method as a proxy for nps measurements to verify the nps pollution simulations to improve the accuracy of nps pollution modeling this will significantly improve the accuracy of nps pollution modeling enriching the theories of nps pollution estimation and therefore providing a solid basis for decision making regarding water quality management in data scarce regions around the world 2 study area beijing is the capital of china and its largest surface drinking water source is the miyun reservoir the miyun reservoir 116 47 117 05 e 40 26 40 35 n has a total capacity of 4 355 billion m3 and is located at the junction of the chao river and the bai river fig 1 cinnamon soil brown soil meadow soil and chestnut soil are the four principal soil types in the study area shi et al 2004 the miyun reservoir plays an important role in supplying drinking water to beijing liang et al 2016 and provides 78 8 of the beijing surface water supply 1 1 beijing water affairs statistical yearbook 2011 overall its water quality is categorized as class ii of the national environmental standard for surface water nessw gb3838 2002 most of the time however due to the influence of human activities the ecological environment of the miyun reservoir watershed has changed dramatically consequently the pollutant concentration of the inflowing runoff has increased and the pollution risk of the whole reservoir has greatly increased in the upper reach of the reservoir watershed frequent agricultural activities on sloping fields have led to vegetation destruction soil erosion and nutrient losses li et al 2016 a large amount of n p and other contaminants are released into the waters due to the massive application of fertilizers and the effluents of untreated sewage qiu et al 2018 nps pollution is the main water use impairment in the upper watershed of the miyun reservoir and poses large threats to the water quality of the reservoir geng et al 2019 protecting the water quality of the miyun reservoir is urgently needed jiang et al 2021 cai et al 2022 previous uncertainties in nps pollution estimation led to the increased risk of water eutrophication and toxicity in the miyun reservoir qiu et al 2018 therefore accurately modeling nps pollution in this area is highly necessary to ensure a source of safe drinking water for beijing however uncertainties resulting from the lack of data and low resolution satellite images hinder informed policy making therefore it is urgently necessary to couple satellite and uav images to accurately estimate nps pollution for the miyun reservoir due to the advantages of uavs such as high resolution flexibility and automation in addition the miyun reservoir watershed has few datasets of historical observations and represents a data scarce region thus the rain induced flooding and nps pollution processes in the miyun reservoir watershed can be simulated only by using a model suitable for data scarce regions 3 data and methods 3 1 data 3 1 1 satellite data landsat 8 oli level 2 data

a speed of 10 m s at 16 sites in fig 1 in 2020 and collected a total of 924 photographs the same flight parameters table 2 were used for all sites and all flights were conducted under sunny sky conditions as shown in fig 2 photogrammetry was designed to acquire 70 80 forward overlap and lateral overlap to ensure the accuracy of the subsequent software generated data such as stereo image pair point cloud and digital surface model dsm datasets which were generated in pix4dmapper software https www pix4d com 3 1 3 ground survey data the main streams and representable tributaries were investigated in the miyun reservoir watershed among which 16 survey sites were deployed to sample and record ground information along with uav flight in 2020 fig 2 and table 3 accordingly soil samples and questionnaires were collected for model parameter calibration and verification data on population livestock farming and agriculture were obtained from statistical data and questionnaire surveys the population livestock and fertilizer usage data are from the beijing statistical yearbook 2018 then we interpolated the above data at all sites to the entire watershed by using an inverse distance interpolation approach in arcgis 10 6 for nps pollution modeling 3 2 methods by coupling satellite and uav data a high accuracy framework was established to estimate and verify the load and inflow of nps pollution in areas with scarce ground data the framework consists of three parts eco rudim runoff dispersion modeling ecohat nps and nps land river transition model first eco rudim was used to simulate the storm runoff flow process second the ecohat nps model was used to estimate the nps pollutant load inland additionally vegetation coverage data obtained by satellite were used to estimate nps pollution from runoff and livestock data retrieved from satellite and uav images were used to estimate nps pollution from livestock the inlets extracted from satellite and uav images were used to estimate the amount of nps pollution tn total nitrogen tp total phosphorus nh3 n ammonia nitrogen cod chemical oxygen demand transported into the miyun reservoir and the buffer zones identified in satellite and uav images were used to estimate the nps pollutant concentrations in reservoirs furthermore the vegetation types identified in the satellite and uav images were used to determine the fertilizer types and application amounts finally the nps pollutant load of each pixel inland was effectively transformed into the pollutant concentration entering the rivers through a newly developed land river transition model in addition a second new method was developed to inversely calculate the observations of nps pollutant concentrations entering rivers based on water quality observations to verify the results of the above nps pollutant modeling 3 2 1 using satellites to obtain the fvc to improve the accuracy of nps estimation to retrieve the fvc operational land imager olt images between june 1 and october 31 2018 that had a quality flag of nine and were at least partially cloud free were downloaded from the u s geological survey usgs global visualization viewer glovis website http glovis usgs gov bands 4 red visible and 5 near infrared were radiometrically corrected to at sensor reflectance to correct for seasonal reflectance variances caused by the sun angle and distance and reprojected to universal transverse mercator at a 30 meter spatial resolution the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was calculated with the method of gao et al 2000 based on which the fvc was calculated by using the method from gutman and ignatov 1998 3 2 2 coupling satellites and uav images to obtain a wide range of high resolution data on river inlets buffer zones vegetation types and livestock higher accuracy river inlet buffer zone vegetation type and livestock data can significantly improve the accuracy of nps pollution modeling however the lack of high accuracy data always results in large uncertainties in nps pollution modeling in previous studies slope and slope length were usually obtained from a 30 m dem and inlet information was obtained by extraction of the water system based on a 30 m dem xu et al 2016 resulting in the extracted inlet number being lower than the actual inlet number satellite images coupled with uav images can profoundly improve the estimation accuracy of the parameters through this method as well as ground surveys we therefore obtain high accuracy datasets related to the above parameters this same technique can be applied in data scarce regions around the world where the above parameters are difficult to collect 3 2 2 1 identifying inlets in a reservoir in this paper the initial location of the inlet was visually extracted according to the landsat 8 images the potential inlet location based on terrain was extracted by dem using the hydrology toolbox of arcgis a series of processes including filling the dem to make it devoid of sinks and generating a flow direction map by using the filled dem as an input raster were conducted to generate a flow accumulation map based on the map a stream network which represents the natural course of runoff water and inlets was obtained then the satellite determined potential inlets were verified and densified by a uav derived digital orthophoto map dom with which the final inlets were determined hence the exact number of reservoir inlets eq 1 was obtained by coupling satellite and uav images 1 n f n s n u a v where nf is the number of final inlets ns is the number of satellite determined potential inlets and nuav is the number of uav determined inlets the software pix4d https www pix4d com was adopted to splice uav photos to the dsm with a spatial resolution of 8 75 cm when flying at an altitude of 200 m zhang et al 2018 the dsm reflects the high precision terrain information of the study area 3 2 2 2 determining reservoir buffer zones and vegetation types conventional satellites cannot clearly identify vegetation types in buffer zones which greatly lowers the nps pollution modeling accuracy in small and medium scale areas therefore this paper adopts satellite images coupled with uav images to extract reservoir buffer zones and identify vegetation types in the study area satellite images dem elevation data land use were used to delimit the reservoir buffer area based on which the buffer zone width was preliminarily determined by considering the official protected area where the elevation was less than 155 m a s l in the miyun reservoir mcpgb 2014 then uavs flew along the boundaries to generate a dom using pix4dmapper software https www pix4d com to refine the buffer zone boundary by excluding roads and construction land to identify vegetation types the vegetation type attributes within a satellite image were artificially assigned to pixels through visual interpretation these pixels are divided into different types according to which typical sites are determined then the visually interpreted vegetation types were refined based on the typical sites with the help of high resolution uav imagery by using a semantic segmentation approach u net schiefer et al 2020 or visual interpretation whereby vegetation types and species changes in the miyun reservoir watershed were monitored and analyzed taking the areas with both satellite images and uav flights as templates prior knowledge of the vegetation types was applied and the vegetation type attributes within the satellite image were modified based on the uav identified vegetation type at typical sites then based on the modified vegetation type at typical sites the vegetation type identified by satellite images across the whole area was refined this method combines the advantages of object oriented classification and human computer interaction recognition so the classification accuracy and efficiency can be greatly improved 3 2 2 3 recognizing basic livestock type number and location livestock are important external sources of nps pollution in waters godfray et al 2018 it is particularly important to obtain accurate distributed livestock data for nps pollution estimation therefore we first analyzed the type and scale of farms based on satellite imagery and statistical data and selected representative farms with sizes ranging from small to large then we used uavs to obtain high resolution images to obtain the number of livestock in the representative farms directly finally based on the information on representative farms from uav images we used a formula eq 2 to obtain the number of livestock on all farms within our study area 2 l n i a i a 0 l n 0 where lni is the livestock number of the ith farm ai is the area of the ith farm a0 is the area of the standard farm measured by the uav and ln0 is the livestock number of the standard farm determined by the uav 3 2 3 nps pollution estimation and verification 3 2 3 4 eco rudim to simulate storm runoff processes eco rudim was used to analyze the runoff yield and confluence processes and to determine the location where the rainwater enters the reservoir zhao et al 2022 the formulas of the model are as follows 3 q t k α f t c j 1 t c i t k 1 δ t 4 q t q 1 t m 1 q 2 t m 2 q n t m n 5 m i l i v i where q tk is the runoff at time tk itk 1 is the net rain intensity at time tk j f is the catchment area controlled by a road α is the unit conversion coefficient qt is the discharge of the i th road catchment at the waterlogging point at time t n is the number of road catchment areas i is the road catchment number ranging from 1 to n li is the flow of the outlet of the i road catchment to a low lying point and mi is the number of time periods required by runoff in the outlet of the i th road catchment to reach the low lying point 3 2 3 5 ecohat nps to estimate nps pollution load ecohat nps yang et al 2011 divides the yield and migration of nps pollution into dissolved and adsorbed pollution loads the dissolved pollution modeling is classified into four types urban runoff rural life livestock and poultry breeding and cropland runoff the adsorbed pollution modeling is undertaken by the soil erosion module the spatial scale of the ecohat nps model is flexible and the model is suitable for nps estimation in complex mixed watersheds with agricultural and urban areas the model can work at multiple temporal scales such as daily monthly and yearly notably the addition of fvc as an input factor can make the estimation of runoff nps more accurate zheng et al 2009 in addition the ecohat nps model is in line with the characteristics of china in terms of simulating the relationship between rainfall and runoff the reason is because the rainfall characteristics in china are monsoonal which is different from those in the usa as china receives most of its annual rainfall in summer therefore the empirical relationship for estimating the initial abstraction and runoff in other widely used models such as swat us is not suitable for the chinese geographical and hydrometeorological conditions therefore we selected the ecohat nps model to simulate nps pollution 3 2 3 6 land river transition model to transform the inland pollutant load into the pollutant concentration in rivers we developed a novel land river transition model that can effectively convert the nps pollution load of each pixel inland into the pollutant concentration in rivers previous models have usually estimated land nps pollution without considering the process by which it enters the river in fact only part of the nps pollution load generated on land reaches the river so it is important to link the land and river settings together to form an integrated simulation system our land river transition model is able to complete this linkage this model couples satellite and uav data to find the inlets and obtain the detailed underlying conditions and it considers the effect of the reservoir riparian belt on pollutant reduction well as shown in eq 6 6 ρ j n j i i o i j w where i is the grid number i is the total number of catchment grids oij is the load of the j th pollutant in the i th grid nj is the solubility coefficient of the j th pollutant w is the amount of water at an inlet and ρj is the concentration of the j th pollutant at the inlet in brief the three models of eco rudim ecohat nps and the land river transition model can fully describe the nps pollution process from the land derived load to the concentration in waters the data required by the three models are listed in table 4 3 2 3 7 verification of nps pollution estimates flowing into waters by developing an inlet nps observation simulation method based on onsite monitored water quality data coupled with a one dimensional river water quality model a novel method eqs 7 9 was proposed to quickly determine the observation of nps pollutants flowing into rivers from land and this model was then used to verify the accuracy of nps pollution estimates from the above three models based on the concentration of pollutants and the water discharge monitored at upstream and downstream water quality stations the concentration of nps pollutants entering the river at each inlet is determined iteratively with the error between the measured and modeled concentrations of pollutants at the downstream stations less than 10 7 c s d i i c i 0 e k x i u x i w i j j c j 0 e k x j u x j w j c a u w a u i i w i j j w j w a u 8 c i 0 α a i l i x i c a d c b 9 c b j j c j 0 e k x j u x j w j c a u w a u j

cad is the measured pollutant concentration at the downstream station and cb is the pollution concentration of downstream station mg l 1 when we apply the method to data scarce regions elsewhere we simply need to find a few typical river sections and monitor water quality indicators tn tp nh3 n cod a few times to determine the parameters of the water quality model and then the observation of nps pollution into the river can be deduced based on this the parameters of the nps pollution model could be further calibrated to ensure the estimation accuracy 3 2 3 8 calibration of model parameters based on ground investigation coupled with uavs and satellites using a questionnaire and field sampling method the investigation and sampling of nps pollution information were carried out to calibrate the model parameters first we identified the main land use types in the study area e g forest grassland cropland river rural area through the fusion of tm multispectral images and spot panchromatic band data based on the land use type data representative sites were selected second high resolution images were generated by uav flights at these sites using high resolution image analysis and a questionnaire survey we obtained information on these sites including the land use types vegetation types agricultural activity information the situation of waste disposal in rural areas and the situation of livestock production additionally other adjustable parameters garbage disposal rate garbage inflow rate etc were determined by coupling the literature and a questionnaire survey soil samples 0 20 cm depth at representative sites were also collected and four indices tn tp cod and nh3 n were determined in the laboratory finally the representative ground information obtained above was applied to the whole watershed and parameters in ecohat nps garbage disposal rate of livestock rural city garbage inflow rate garbage accumulation rate of livestock rural city were calibrated using the pollutant concentrations measured from the above soil samples at the representative sites 4 results 4 1 using satellites to obtain the fvc to improve the modeling accuracy of nps pollution from agricultural runoff based on landsat images we calculated the fvc of the miyun watershed as an input parameter for the ecohat nps model using the runoff module as an example and with the measured nps pollution we compared the results with and without considering the fvc fig 3 a shows that the average estimate of nps pollution tn tp nh3 n and cod without the fvc is higher than that with the fvc fig 3b shows that the average relative errors of nps pollution tn tp nh3 n and cod without the fvc is 24 57 84 18 68 48 and 47 21 higher than those with the fvc 15 39 14 89 14 43 and 0 01 the accuracy of the nps pollution estimates was significantly improved especially in the estimation of tp nh3 n and cod which improved by 69 29 54 05 and 47 22 respectively after the fvc was introduced fig 3b ignoring the fvc made the model estimated nps pollution much higher 4 2 coupling satellite and uav images to obtain a wide range of high resolution data on reservoir inlets buffer zones vegetation types and livestock for nps pollution modeling accuracy improvement 4 2 1 inlet extraction improved the nps estimation accuracy by 3 24 landsat remote sensing images dem data and uav images were used to identify the inlets of reservoirs fig 4 shows that 10 inlets of the reservoir can be identified through landsat remote sensing images while 18 inlets of the miyun reservoir were extracted from coupled satellite and uav images fig 4 the coupling method makes the inlet extraction more accurate based on the remote sensing image recognized inlets the estimated amounts of nps pollution tn tp nh3 n and cod transported into the miyun reservoir annually are 3023 75 57 29 555 43 and 12 494 23 t respectively the amounts estimated based on the inlets extracted from coupled satellite uav data are 3109 97 75 23 586 73 and 12 645 47 t respectively the nps pollution estimates with the coupling method identified inlets were 2 77 23 84 5 33 and 1 20 higher than those with only satellite identified inlets the reason is that the nps pollution flowing into rivers in subwatersheds failed to be modeled because fewer inlets were identified in the satellite images consequently the amount of nps pollution in the reservoir is severely underestimated these findings indicate that coupling satellite and uav images to obtain inlets greatly improves the simulation accuracy of nps pollution in reservoirs 4 2 2 buffer zone identification decreases the estimated nps pollutant concentration in the reservoir by 60 99 compared with estimates without considering the role of the buffer zone based on the satellite and uav images the buffer zone of the miyun reservoir was identified and the width of the buffer zone and the distribution of land use cover were obtained the buffer zone ranges from 48 to 4500 m with the widest section in the northeast and the narrowest section in the west fig 5 ten types of land use cover were identified and classified consisting of 24 61 forestland 0 30 shrub land 1 71 open forestland 2 27 other woodland 16 60 natural grassland 2 36 river 3 66 bottomland 1 81 artificial grassland 6 50 montane dry cropland 6 17 hilly dry cropland and 34 01 plain dry cropland fig 5 as shown in fig 6 when considering the existence of the buffer zone the concentration of tn transported into the miyun reservoir significantly decreased with a large reduction range of 60 99 the actual removal efficiency is determined by various factors including the physical and chemical properties of the soil the width and slope of the lakeside zone and the decontamination ability of the vegetation wang et al 2020b in other words considering buffer zones decreases the estimated nps pollutant concentration in the reservoir by 60 99 4 2 3 livestock data acquisition improved the estimation accuracy of the nps pollution load by 7 53 the accuracy of the livestock data significantly affects the precision of nps pollution estimation based on statistical yearbook data one can obtain the number of livestock in each region the smallest region is the district level to estimate the total amount of nps pollution but one cannot obtain the distribution of nps pollution at a more detailed level coupling satellite and uav images can accurately locate livestock locations fig 7 and interpolation analysis can be conducted in these areas to obtain a more accurate spatial distribution of nps pollution we compared the results of nps pollution estimation in the miyun area based on livestock data from only statistical yearbooks with those based on the integrated data from uav and satellite images and statistical yearbooks the results show that the nps pollution load estimated by the former is higher fig 8 a the relative error between the estimated and measured values tn tp nh3 n cod is 67 06 43 12 57 21 and 18 55 respectively the relative error between the estimates by the latter and the measured values is 13 82 35 83 11 92 and 2 32 the estimates by the latter are 53 24 7 29 45 29 and 16 23 more accurate than those by the former fig 8b 4 2 4 vegetation type identification improved the accuracy of nps pollutant estimation by 10 72 through the uav images we obtained vegetation types on the ground fig 9 which were used for the estimation of the nps pollution load in the miyun watershed fig 10 a shows that the average estimates of nps pollution load tn tp nh3 n and cod with vegetation type identification are lower than those without vegetation type identification after identifying vegetation types the relative errors for the estimation of the four pollutants tn tp nh3 n and cod are 15 39 14 89 14 43 and 2 50 respectively while those without vegetation type identification are 25 20 86 19 69 33 and 44 27 fig 10b the identification of vegetation types by coupling satellite and uav images improved the accuracy of nps pollution estimation by 10 72 with the tp estimation having the most improvement 72 and the tn estimation having the least improvement 10 moreover the spatial distribution of the nps pollution load changes greatly after identifying vegetation types because of the spatial distribution of fertilizer and pesticide dependent plants such as castanea mollissima which is mostly distributed on the northwest side of the miyun reservoir resulting in a large nps pollution load in the northwest areas fig 9 4 3 using the newly developed method to verify the ecohat nps model to calibrate the parameters in ecohat nps the concentrations of tn tp nh3 n and cod in the soil sampled within the miyun reservoir watershed were measured fig 11 based on which the parameters of ecohat nps were calibrated the ecohat nps model with the calibrated parameters was then used to simulate the nps pollutant load in rivers within the watershed through inlets since there are no observations at the inlets to verify the model simulations the newly developed method eqs 7 9 was employed to invert observations from the water quality observation of the nps pollutant load in rivers through the inlets based on the water quality data at monitoring sections in the miyun reservoir watershed then the cross validation method was adopted to verify the model based on the observations as seen from table 5 the coefficients of determination r2 of the four pollutants tn tp nh3 n and cod are 0 82 0 94 0 94 and 0 83 respectively and the average relative errors are 24 31 11 58 14 76 and 21 71 respectively the ecohat nps performs satisfactorily when verified by the nps pollutant observations inverted with the new method the new method successfully solves the problem of nps pollution model verification in large scale areas 5 discussion 5 1 influence of monthly variation in fvc on nps pollution estimation in our framework the accuracy of nps pollution estimation was significantly improved after the fvc was introduced in addition considering the fvc caused the model estimated nps pollution results to be much lower the research of ouyang et al 2009 in the upper stream of the yellow river catchment china found that the temporal variation in the fvc was negatively correlated with nps nutrient loading and concluded that vegetation reduces nps nutrient pollution transport poor and mcdonnell 2007 studied the effects of land use on nitrate dynamics in streams in the oak creek watershed usa and found that vegetation especially in the riparian zone can act as a filter and keep pollutants from entering the stream through leaching or biological fixation these studies support the rationality of the findings of our study in contrast with the results in this study gorsevski et al 2008 applied a distributed process based model to define suitable buffer widths in the clearwater national forest cnf in central idaho usa and found that increases in the fvc were positively correlated with reductions in organic nutrient pollution the reason is that their study area is full of mature forest shrubs and grass with a very high fvc 75 100 resulting in the residue in the forest degrading and acting as organic nutrient source which increases the nps pollutant load after being flushed by runoff this suggests that the introduction of the fvc causes the modeled nps pollution load to be much higher in areas with mature complex forested ecosystems or densely distributed vegetation but much lower in areas with sparsely distributed vegetation our study shows that vegetation coverage affects the generation of cropland runoff and then affects the generation and migration of nps pollution influencing the estimation of adsorbed nitrogen and phosphorus in the ecohat nps model this is in accordance with the research of ouyang et al 2009 if only based on land use type without considering the fvc the estimation of nps pollution involves considerable error it can be seen from fig 12 a 1 and b 1 that the area classified as countryside also has a fvc of 40 98 and the forest area that is considered homogeneous in the land use map has different degrees of fvc 22 06 69 95 in this situation land use data were produced at an annual scale while the fvc of the same land use type varies in different seasons if this difference is neglected there could exist varying degrees of uncertainties in nps pollutant estimation seasonally for example the average fvc in june through september ranges from 72 48 to 84 62 showing good vegetation coverage in the miyun reservoir watershed fig 12a but the annual fvc is 53 38 which differs greatly from the actual values neglect of the monthly variation in fvc will inevitably increase the uncertainties in nps estimation to various degrees to avoid this we used finer scale fvc data at the monthly scale in this study to precisely reflect the effect of fvc variation on the generation of runoff and nps pollution thereby improving the accuracy of the nps pollution estimation the introduction of monthly variation in fvc in our study greatly improved the accuracy of nps estimation most models such as the widely used swat also consider the influence of monthly vegetation variation cover management factor without using satellite imagery for nps pollution estimation zhang et al 2019b they mainly consider the effect of monthly vegetation variation on soil conservation but ignore the filtering effect of vegetation on nps pollutants the swat model used a simplified version of the environmental policy integrated climate model epic to simulate a single vegetation growth pattern but it could not express the changing vegetation density as it assumes that the vegetation type is unified so it was difficult to reflect the influence of changing vegetation cover on the nps pollution load ma et al 2019 to summarize the use of fvc parameters in our study obtained by satellite greatly improved the accuracy of nps estimation in the runoff module as it overcame the shortcomings of both uneven vegetation distribution in space and monthly vegetation variation over time while most models assumed a unified vegetation type instead of a diversified vegetation type our study introduced satellite derived fvc which can reflect the actual diversified vegetation type and significantly improved the accuracy of nps estimation 5 2 influence of the resolution of ground parameters on nps pollution estimation 5 2 1 inlet extraction in our framework inlet extraction was based on coupled satellite and uav images and this process improved the nps estimation accuracy by 3 24 as the coupling allows for the inlet extraction to be much more accurate cheng et al 2022 investigated an optimized solution of village relocation selection under the flooding risk of lake growth on the basis of satellite and uav data in angzi co china and found that a uav dem achieves excellent advantages in depicting details of lake shoreline variations this is similar to our results in addition it can be found in this paper that the amount of nps pollution is underestimated when identifying inlets based only on landsat remote sensing images because some nps pollutants were ignored due to incomplete subwatershed extraction from satellite data xu et al 2016 showed that the dem resolution influences watershed delineations and affects the nps pollution estimation accuracy in the xiangxi river watershed china chen et al 2021 also found that refined detailed input data improved the accuracy of the swat model during runoff and tn simulation in the chao river watershed china these results are consistent with our results 5 2 2 livestock data acquisition this study also shows that livestock data acquisition in our framework based on the integrated data from uav and satellite images and statistical yearbook data improved the estimation accuracy of the nps pollution load by 7 53 as coupling satellite and uav images can accurately locate livestock locations and reflect the spatial heterogeneity within a town li et al 2019 studied the challenge of deploying a group of uavs to track and monitor livestock such as cattle and sheep in a pasture of china and found that uavs can acquire the initial locations of all targeted animals this result is in accordance with our results moreover livestock farming accounts for a large proportion of the estimated nps pollutants additionally cui et al 2021 discussed the influences of the spatial scale of the livestock and poultry amount data on estimations of the phosphorus load using the swat model and found that applying refined small scale data of livestock and poultry amounts allows the model to perform better nse 0 76 and re 12 4 than using large scale data nse 0 54 and re 11 11 when estimating phosphorus loads this outcome supports our results furthermore the research of chen et al 2013 suggests that livestock is one of the major sources of nps pollution in the jinjiang river basin china zhang and lou 2011 reported that nps pollutants from agriculture and livestock husbandry are considerably greater than those from industrial wastes and domestic raw sewage these findings also support our results therefore the determination of the number and location of livestock on the ground using high resolution uav imagery can profoundly improve the accuracy of nps pollution estimation 5 2 3 vegetation type identification our study found that vegetation type identification improved the accuracy of nps pollutant estimation by 10 72 compared with that without vegetation type identification the reason is that vegetation type determines the type and application rate of fertilizer application n p etc which affects the accuracy of nps pollution estimation and especially significantly affects the estimation of n and p losses through runoff water in cropland soils gaudinier et al 2018 stackpoole et al 2019 e g the amount of fertilizer applied to poplar and chestnut trees is different zeng et al 2007 yielding different amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in the form of nps our study also shows that the average estimation of the nps pollution load with vegetation type identification is lower than that without vegetation type identification this is because vegetation type with low fertilizer requirements accounted for a large proportion resulting in a lower nps load estimate with vegetation type identification than without vegetation type identification moreover in satellite images with medium spatial resolution such as landsat it is usually difficult to distinguish between different types of vegetation plants so the use of uavs can fill this gap emilien et al 2021 in our study satellite and uav images were coupled to produce new images with high spatial temporal and spectral resolution to determine the type of each crop and tree then the fertilizer rate of the different vegetation species can be determined and these data can be used to estimate runoff contaminants previous methods estimate farmland runoff pollution based only on the land use type without distinguishing vegetation types which increases the uncertainty of nps pollution estimation zhang et al 2019b zhu et al 2020 in contrast our framework involving coupling satellite and uav images to estimate nps pollution can produce a higher accuracy nps pollution estimate 5 3 influence of buffer zone identification on nps pollution estimation reservoir buffer zones play an essential role in maintaining the sustainability of water quality reducing sediment accumulation regulating surface runoff and protecting biodiversity wang et al 2020b in our framework buffer zone identification decreases the estimated nps pollutant concentrations in the reservoir by 60 99 when the buffer zone slope is 5 the width is 5 m and the vegetation type is herbaceous in beijing the average reduction rate of nitrogen is 4 and the average reduction rate of phosphorus is 86 moreover the removal efficiency is positively correlated with the buffer width wang et al 2020b the research of heathwaite et al 1998 in south devon uk showed that the lakeside buffer zone had a good controlling effect on nps pollution and the average removal rates of total n and total p were 70 95 and 70 98 respectively cui et al 2021 estimated n loss before and after the construction of the cropland buffer zone cbz along the west bank of erhai lake china and found that with a 100 m wide cbz n loss was reduced by 87 additionally lyu et al 2021 summarized 123 publications between 1980 and 2020 and found that the average removal efficiency of nitrogen with buffer widths of 16 50 m was 79 1 these results are all consistent with our results buffer zones reduce the loading of nps pollutants because of 1 assimilation of inorganic compounds including nitrogen and phosphorus by plants and their transformation into biomass lyu et al 2021 2 biogeochemical processes occurring as a result of microorganism activity such as denitrification which contribute to nitrogen removal lyu et al 2021 3 sorption and precipitation of soluble phosphorus forms through soil li et al 2019 and 4 processes of sedimentation of soil particles transported in the form of surface runoff which reduces the erosion of soil and transport of insoluble forms of phosphorus dindaroğlu et al 2015 the removal efficiency is controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the soil the width and slope of the lakeside zone and the decontamination ability of vegetation wang et al 2020b thus identifying vegetation types and the width of buffer zones by coupling satellite and uav images in our framework can improve the accuracy of nps pollutant concentration estimation in reservoirs rivers 5 4 the implication of the newly developed verification method for data scarce areas in our framework water quality data at monitoring sections in the miyun reservoir watershed the concentrations of nps pollution flowing into rivers through different inlets were calculated via an inverse method the results were then used as nps pollutant observations to verify the ecohat nps model since there were no observations at the inlets to verify the model simulations xue et al 2021 stated that the verification of nps pollution estimation depends on the monitoring values of river water quality monitoring stations or the values measured during field sampling xue et al 2022 reviewed the research status of nps pollution modeling for the urban rural transitional areas in china and found that the lack of monitoring data limits the development and validations of nps pollution modeling in view of this problem hong and li 2000 established a correlation model based on surface runoff monitoring data in the hanjiang river and heihe river china to simulate nps loads for the verification of their land nps pollution modeling the tn and tp loads simulated by their correlation model were very close to the simulated results by their land nps pollution model this finding supports our method that inverts the observations of nps pollutant loads entering rivers based on observations from routine water quality monitoring stations min et al 2022 simulated the relationships between cultivated land use patterns and nps pollutant loads at the township scale in the chaohu lake basin china and the swat model results were verified using flow data from hydrological stations and tp data measured in field samples however this type of consumes large amounts of time money and labor commonly resulting in a scarcity of monitored data thus this style of monitoring can be ineffective and limit the thorough verification of all land nps pollution simulations at a large scale our method can be applied to large scale areas and thoroughly verifies all simulated land nps loads entering rivers through inlets as routine water quality monitoring stations can cover much larger areas and larger time spans than field sampling therefore our framework namely verifying land nps loads in soil and rivers based on field soil samples and inverted observations ensures the rationality and accuracy of our results as with most studies there are some limitations in this study that could be addressed in the future first more measured water quality data should be collected to verify the newly developed inlet nps observation simulation method to further improve its accuracy second this study evaluated only the accuracy improvement at the monthly scale yet the accuracy at other time scales such as daily and hourly scales needs further study to further test the practicability of our framework at these scales third much more intelligent algorithms such as convolutional neural networks should be used to improve the efficiency and accuracy of vegetation type identification based on satellite and uav images 6 conclusion the present study improved the accuracy of nps pollution modeling by coupling satellite and uav images to obtain the fvc and detailed ground parameters vegetation types livestock numbers inlets etc and a new method for nps pollution modeling verification was developed results show that 1 the introduction of monthly variation in the fvc in this study greatly improved the accuracy of the nps estimation considering the fvc parameters obtained by satellite in the nps pollutant estimation improves the accuracy of tn tp nh3 n and cod estimates by 39 96 69 29 54 05 and 47 22 respectively the introduction of the fvc makes the modeled nps pollution load much higher in areas with a mature complex forested ecosystem or densely distributed vegetation but much lower in areas with sparsely distributed vegetation 2 under the synergistic effect of dem data and uav images 18 inlets were extracted which improved the nps estimation accuracy by 3 24 3 the determination of the number and location of livestock on the ground using high resolution uav imagery can profoundly improve the accuracy of nps pollution estimation the use of such imagery improves the accuracy of the nps pollution load estimates by 7 53 4 satellites and uavs can be used to simultaneously produce images with high spatial temporal and spectral resolutions to determine the type of each crop and tree which improves the estimation accuracy of tn tp nh3 n and cod by 10 72 5 the ecohat nps model performs satisfactorily as was verified using the newly developed method with an average relative error of 11 58 24 31 our framework involving verifying the land nps loads in soil and rivers based on field soil samples and inverted observations ensures the rationality and accuracy of our results and can potentially solve the problem of nps pollution model verification these results can guide decision making in the water environment management of the miyun reservoir as well as other similar regions worldwide owing to the complexity of the nps pollution process uncertainties are unavoidable to reduce the uncertainties it is necessary to conduct more appropriate geospatial processing on the fine

15492,the global spread of antibiotic resistance genes args has wreaked havoc with the treatment efficiency of antibiotics and ultimately anti microbial chemotherapy and has been conventionally attributed to the abuse and misuse of antibiotics however the ancient args have alterative functions in bacterial physiology and thus they could be co regulated by non antibiotic conditions recent research has demonstrated that many non antibiotic chemicals such as microplastics metallic nanoparticles and non antibiotic drugs as well as some non antibiotic conditions can accelerate the dissemination of args these results suggested that the role of antibiotics might have been previously overestimated whereas the effects of non antibiotic conditions were possibly ignored thus in an attempt to fully understand the fate and behavior of args in the eco system it is urgent to critically highlight the role and mechanisms of non antibiotic chemicals and related environmental factors in the spread of args to this end this timely review assessed the evolution of args especially its function alteration summarized the non antibiotic chemicals promoting the spread of args evaluated the non antibiotic conditions related to arg dissemination and analyzed the molecular mechanisms related to spread of args induced by the non antibiotic factors finally this review then provided several critical perspectives for future research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes non antibiotic chemicals horizontal gene transfer vertical gene transfer mobile gene elements data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the inappropriate and even abusive use of antibiotics in the clinical environment has given rise to an alarming situation in which multidrug resistance bacterial pathogens are now threatening the continued effectiveness of the infection treatment yoon et al 2021 how antibiotic resistance genes args arise and develop are very fundamental questions in managing and controlling the trouble of args and antibiotic resistance bacteria arb generally args can emerge either from the mutation in the pre existing functional genes by duplication divergence or gene fusion fission and non coding sequence de novo mutation in the bacterial genome or from the gene elements of another organism horizontal gene transfer hgt andersson et al 2015 pazda et al 2019 mutations indeed occur and become fixed in the species by vertical gene transfer vgt after exposure to the antibiotic in recent years it is no doubt that antibiotics have entirely changed the preconditions for the dissemination and development of args due to its usage in infection treatment jiang et al 2017 in addition this selective pressure has also enhanced the mobilization and transfer of args to pathogenic bacteria ultimately causing a well known consequence of the invalid infection treatment lopatkin et al 2016 however the dissemination of today s resistance may not be all down to the misuse of antibiotics there are two main aspects i e the environmental concentration of residual antibiotics and the alternative function of args to draw above conclusions which will be explained below there is no doubt that the selective pressure of antibiotics has caused resistance spread in recent years however except for some industrially polluted sites i e antibiotic manufacturing the residual concentration of antibiotics in the environment is much lower than that shown or predicted in the laboratory for the selection of arb bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 although considerable studies showed that arg abundance is significantly associated with the concentration of antibiotics chow et al 2021 in many cases this is because human excreta are a source of both antibiotic and resistance karkman et al 2019 in addition distinguishing whether this is from the taxonomic changes or is a result of direct selection by these antibiotics in the environment is difficult in addition some results point to the opposite for example a negative correlation between args and antibiotics was observed in some environment medium ohore et al 2020 recent research related to sterile filtered wastewaters also provided no support for selection of resistance by antibiotics flach et al 2018 these results indicated that there must present other selective agents rather than antibiotics therein to exert the selective pressure on args in addition most args have probably evolved gradually from genes with other functions andersson et al 2015 for example several structures of β lactamases are similar with cell wall metabolizing enzymes indicating β lactamases shares function with cell wall metabolism and general peptidase activities morar and wright 2010 some macrolide glycosyltransferases inactivates macrolides are also reported to associate with the glycosyltransferase 1 family zhang et al 2020a in this case both antibiotics and args might have different ecological functions in the pre antibiotic era compared with that in modern settings sengupta et al 2013 the intrinsic characteristic of resistance is not associated with mges demonstrating these genes may not be dedicated and have functional roles in other metabolic processes for example aminoglycoside acetyltransferase aac enzymes containing loose conservation of tertiary and quaternary structure endow the aacs with a very broad substrate specificity morar and wright 2010 accordingly they might be co regulated by some non antibiotic conditions and thus offset the fitness costs of resistance genes many non antibiotic chemicals have recently been demonstrated to promote the transfer of args such as metallic nanoparticles yu et al 2020 microplastics laganà et al 2019 and some other pollutants lu and lu 2020 as such the role of antibiotics in the spread of resistance genes might have been previously overestimated whereas the effects of such chemicals were possibly ignored moreover non antibiotic conditions such as environmental media can also affect the growth of bacterial thereby influencing the fate of arb the previous reports in observation of enhanced spread of args by non antibiotic conditions raise an intriguing and profound question about the role of contaminants other than antibiotics in spreading args therefore there need a comprehensive and systematical discussion to understand the evolution of args in the presence of non antibiotic factors under wider mechanisms especially the mutation and vgt to this end we attempt to systematically understand how non antibiotic chemicals and conditions influence the decimation of args under various mechanisms i e mutation co selection hgt and vgt specifically this review aims to 1 evaluate the ecological functions of antibiotics and args since some non antibiotic chemicals could serve as the co regulator to exert selective pressure to args 2 summarize various non antibiotic chemicals that could accelerate the dissemination of args 3 discuss the key non antibiotic conditions influencing the migration of args and 4 analyze the molecular mechanisms in the development of args by non antibiotic conditions eventually several important perspectives for further work are then proposed based on this review 2 the antibiotic is not the only selector to spread args 2 1 from proto resistance to args where args come from is a fundamental question in understanding the ecological function of args proto resistance also called pre resistances in literature provided the possible interpretation for the evolution of args the proto resistances genes are not phenotype resistance but could become real args once exerting suitable stress which is analogous to the proto oncogenes of the cancer field galán et al 2013 perry et al 2014 some research predicted the housekeeping genes with a common ancestor to antibiotic resistance according to the mechanistic and structural similarity for instance ant 2 ia and ant 4 resistance enzyme a kind of aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase have similar enzyme fold to dna polymerase β and virginiamycin b lyase is similar to the muconate lactonizing enzyme in the structure and catalytic function morar and wright 2010 based on the concept of proto resistance the ancestor of args had a housekeeping function but this function has altered under selective pressure for args various examples were summarized to support the origin of resistance see ref waglechner et al 2021 the bayesian phylogeny of the oxa b lactamase genes indicated that oxa genes arose over 2 ga and were mobilized to plasmids hundreds of millions of years ago barlow and hall 2002 this observation contradicts the commonly held notion that the mobilization of args is in response to clinical antibiotic use although antibiotics released from antibiotic producers may also lead to the development of resistance given the environmental concentrations of antibiotics at that time we prefer to believe that there may be other factors other than antibiotics resulting in emerging antibiotic resistance 2 2 a previous fallacy in resistance research in reaction to the rapid spread of args and invalid infection treatment researchers previously endeavoured to reverse this problem by limiting antibiotic usage a reasonable expectation was that the resistant species would be replaced by sensitive ones as antibiotic usage declined however results showed that resistance persisted on both small and large scales even without antibiotics tamminen et al 2011 moreover recent studies related to the human gut microbiomes observed the same results that plasmid transfer is pervasive and frequent even under antibiotic free conditions gumpert et al 2017 león sampedro et al 2021 the previous expectation is based on the fitness cost of resistance generally one of the vital resistance mechanisms is associated with modifying the target enzyme to prohibit antibiotic binding this mutation confers antibiotic resistance but drops the efficiency of the target enzyme in physiological leading to burdens on cellular metabolism and function for instance fluoroquinolone resistance brings impaired motility to pseudomonads stickland et al 2010 while aminoglycoside ones change the ribosome structure thereby limiting the cellular functions holberger and hayes 2009 therefore the linkage of resistance with decreased fitness raised the opinion that a reduction in antibiotic use would benefit the susceptible bacteria by outcompeting the resistant ones evidently the strategy of limiting antibiotic usage is not sufficient and effective at totally eliminating resistance two mechanisms are responsible for maintaining the resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection firstly second site mutations can compensate for the fitness costs of resistance this compensatory evolution is already observed in various studies melnyk et al 2015 alternately genetic co selection induced by the genetic linkage between args and selected loci prohibit resistance eliminating borrell et al 2013 in this case other chemicals rather than antibiotics could also provide the selection pressure for arb such as heavy metal and disinfectants 2 3 more than the spear the function of antibiotics in the natural environment the clinical usage of antibiotics is based upon the assumption that bacterial producing antibiotics is aimed to stand out from various species in the natural environment in other words antibiotics are the spear by one species to hinder another s growth interestingly the function of antibiotics in human society is more than clinical therapeutics as early as the 1940s scientists found that the growth of livestock could be stimulated by low doses of antibiotics jukes 1972 in view of the functional discrepancy of antibiotics it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the real function in the natural environment and more importantly the linkage of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance up to now antibiotics are mostly isolated from soil antibiotic producing organisms nesme and simonet 2015 scientists initially speculated that inhibiting the growth of their competitors is the primary function of these chemicals notably the activity of antibiotics is also dose dependent fajardo and martínez 2008 as several previous reviews pointed out antibiotics have a dual ecological role i e signals at low concentrations and weapons at high counterparts fajardo and martínez 2008 a concentrate analysis conducted by spagnolo et al showed that there is a concentration gradient of antibiotics around the producer and its amount decreases with distance spagnolo et al 2021 however it is still unclear whether the overall antibiotic concentration in the soil environment can reach the lethal concentration conversely a non lethal dose of antibiotics may stimulate the interactions among microbial communities because these signaling molecules i e antibiotics could be involved in quorum sensing sengupta et al 2013 other scientists also pointed out that antibiotics play a crucial role in the microbial community assembly spagnolo et al 2021 2 4 antibiotic resistance is the tip of the iceberg previously researchers conjectured args is the shield to protect the microorganisms from the spear antibiotics in the soil environment however the dual ecological role of antibiotics arises the hesitation whether the function of args is only the resistance it is a fact that antibiotic resistance widely exists even in the totally uninhabited and thinly populated places in which the concentration of antibiotics is close to baseline levels warinner et al 2014 a reasonable hypothesis is that args have more functions than detoxification in this case some factors other than antibiotics might offset the fitness cost of these genes since they might play a role in the other functions of args moreover the intrinsic characteristic of resistance is not associated with mges demonstrating these genes may not be dedicated and have functional roles in other metabolic processes remarkably the multidrug resistance mdr pumps associated with quinolone resistance were isolated before the invention of such antibiotics alonso et al 1999 mdr pumps are also involved in other processes rather than a solo function of antibiotic resistance such as detoxification of some metabolic intermediates ruiz and levy 2014 and resistance to resemble antibiotic resistance heavy metals ranjitkar et al 2019 biocides eda et al 2011 and solvents blanco et al 2016 the efflux pumps are reported to be associate with the quorum sensing response alcalde rico et al 2020 aside from mdr the modification to the target by some enzymes also protects the host from these antibiotics for example the modification enzyme 2 n acetyltransferase of providencia stuartii can inactivate gentamycin however its original function was to modify the peptidoglycan layer macinga and rather 1999 other similar antibiotic modifying enzymes like β lactamases are also involved in synthesizing peptidoglycan and its activity against beta lactams is considered as an additional effect meroueh et al 2003 2 5 non antibiotic factors inducing the dissemination of args so far we have discussed args are origin from some function genes and some args might have alterative functions in bacterial physiology in this case such args could be co regulated by non antibiotic conditions related to the alterative functions thereby accelerating the transfer frequency over the eons the probable origin of args has been developed from other functional genes by duplication divergence roth et al 2007 or even evolved from noncoding sequences i e de novo mutations andersson et al 2015 in addition the organisms can also acquire args from another one via hgt i e conjugation transformation and transduction arnold et al 2022 fig 1 the relative importance of these mechanisms depends on various factors it is no doubt that hgt is the dominant process in developing args over recent time scales however the first two mechanisms explain how args actually emerge obviously the recently clinical application of antibiotics is the principal power force in the emergence of resistance this drive forces are associated with the enhanced hgt and mutation induced by antibiotic itself the spread of args among different species involved several steps firstly args was linked to gene cassettes in integrons or insertion sequences to move with the genome then the relocation of args to a mobile element such as plasmid or integrative conjugative element finally a mobilized resistance gene was transferred to another species via hgt and further integrated into its own genome thereby ensuring the retention of resistance genes within the species by vgt it is obvious that these steps could be promoted by antibiotics and current overuse of antibiotics have fueled the evolution to accelerate antibiotic resistance notably although most of steps also occur under antibiotic free conditions the rates are different with antibiotic induced reaction aminov 2011 knöppel et al 2017 in addition these non antibiotic factors may also lead to accumulation of mutations thereby conferring decreased antibiotic susceptibility except for directly selecting resistance species antibiotics also affect the frequency of mutation cellular sos and oxidative stress response to enhance the spread of resistance however this effect is not specific to antibiotics it is reported that some disinfection byproducts chlorite and iodoacetic acid significantly increased the expression of stress response genes and dna damage and repair genes li et al 2016 there are many more chemicals like this with antibiotic like effects see section 3 3 various non antibiotic chemicals driving the disseminations of antibiotic resistance 3 1 metals and their compounds metal was the earliest investigated substance accelerating the spread of args the field investigation also verified that metals confer persistent selection pressures for args in soils environment while co selection is the main mechanism in the metal rich environment table s1 summarizes the metals and their compounds promoting the spread of args nano alumina al2o3 was the initially investigated compound that promoted the hgt of args qiu et al 2012 plenty of metal nano particles and nano metal oxide could significantly enhance the hgt of args via conjugation and transformation the main contributor of metal compounds to stimulating the dissemination of args is attributed to their dissolved ions sirelkhatim et al 2015 metal ions e g zn2 and ag etc could promote args spread by oxidative stress or inducing the co selection to antibiotics and metal resistance except for the effects of dissolved ions some research highlighted the role metal component itself some nanoparticles like nano al2o3 ding et al 2021 and nano zno wang et al 2018 could directly exert selective pressure on both non resistance and resistance species to enhance the transfer frequency without the participation of ions additionally nanoparticles seem to have different effects on extracellular dna and bacteria from their corresponding ionic counterparts for instance albeit nano al2o3 increased the permeability of cell membrane thereby promoting uptake of plasmid dna aluminum ions have no significant effects on its uptake ding et al 2021 comparison research between nano ag and ag also obtained the similar result that the abundances of args significantly various with substances ma et al 2016 although the microbial structure changes could explain the different abundance of args more efforts to reveal the mechanisms accounting for the discrepancy are needed 3 2 disinfectants table s2 exhibited the common disinfectants stimulating the migration of args as early as 1981 armstrong et al found that despite reduction in total microbial number the percentage of arb increased after chlorination armstrong et al 1981 subsequent research indicated that the change of microbial structure is responsible for the dissemination of args shi et al 2013 this enrichment was due to the mdr pumps mediated co resistance however this effect of chlorination on args is also dose dependence the transfer frequency of args could be promoted by 2 5 fold at 40 mg cl min l while the high doses of chlorine 80 mg cl min l would inhibit the spread of args guo et al 2015 chlorination the most widely used method unfortunately would generate various disinfection by products dbps these unwilling chemicals seem to significantly impact the cell behavior such as cell permeability and inducing sos response the production of chloramine at low doses decreased the disinfectant ability and improved the permeability of cell membrane thereby stimulating the spread of resistance in addition chlorite bromoacetic acid and iodoacetic acid also exhibited antibiotic like effects on species and strains promoting args spread subsequently li et al 2016 mantilla calderon et al 2019 3 3 microplastics microplastics mps could also lead to the enhanced spread of args table s3 li et al 2021a wang et al 2017 one reason is that mps could directly adsorb args on the surface and args are greatly enriched by 5000 fold zhang et al 2020c mps could also favor the propagation of antibiotic resistance by improving the hgt frequency via bacterial response and increasing the cell permeability cheng et al 2022 notably the types of microplastics showed significant association with the resistome and transfer frequency of resistance gene li et al 2021a a rough fixed surface is considered more favorable for conjugation gu et al 2017 mps or plastic debris provide a surface for microbial colonization which assembles various microorganisms resulting in the promoted hgt of args due to the direct contact consequently plastics colonized by bacterial hitchhikers could transport args to distant places due to plastics possessing higher durability and buoyancy than natural co occurring materials wright et al 2020 previous studies indicated that microbial structure closely correlates with arg profiles in this relationship stochastic processes are believed to play a role in structuring the args fang et al 2019 microplastics could significantly influenced the microbial communities by creating the plastisphere communities or releasing the leachate in this case lu and chen 2022 reported that the phthalates leaching from microplastics altered the bacterial communities leading to the raised abundance of args by increasing the arg hosts microplastics as a vector for various pathogenic bacteria might be the most hazardous pollutant for the migration of args in addition the microplastic related species exhibit a higher transfer frequency of args than the background environment in this case the transmission route of args will overlap with microplastics the aquatic environment is the hugest microplastic reservoir which also provides a perfect hotspot for transmitting args pathogens presenting in these aquatic environments may acquire args thus reaching to human body via food chain or activity ingested microplastics may exacerbate the hgt among gut microbiomes and then these resistance species could enter the acoustic ecosystem again via excrement therefore we must take necessary action to manage either microplastics or args effectively 3 4 inorganics as shown in table s4 the spread of args could also be stimulated by various inorganic chemicals such as ionic liquid ammonia selenate and carbon dioxide similar to metal oxide and microplastics these substrates were able to damage the cell membrane and increase the permeability of the cell membrane thereby raising the transfer efficiency of both conjugation and transformation the ionic liquid was the earliest investigated inorganic chemical that promoted the transfer of args a series of experiments conducted by mao et al verified the enhancement of hgt by ionic liquid under both simulated and actual conditions wang et al 2015b 2020a except for the change of cell membrane the fortuitous selection for efflux pump genes is also responsible for this promotion wang et al 2020a free ammonia and selenate harbor the same effects on cell response ros production induced by selenate and selenite stimulated the change of membrane permeability and pilus formation is the primary mechanism of enhanced hgt shi et al 2021 in comparison carbon dioxide benefitted the cell to cell contact by improving the surface hydrophobicity and changing the charge of cell surface liao et al 2019 in addition the release of ca2 enhanced by co2 also provided more power for dna uptake 3 5 non antibiotic pharmaceuticals various non antibiotic pharmaceuticals also enhanced arg transmission through transformation and conjugation table s5 these chemicals could cause antibiotic like effects on bacteria including activating sos response inducing universal stress and stimulating the efflux pump wang et al 2021b interestingly acetaminophen had different roles in promoting ros production since it only provoked ros production in donors rather than recipient bacteria jia et al 2021 although acetaminophen may be specific for plasmid bearing cells more efforts are needed to verify this hypothesis in transformation experiments such pharmaceuticals elevated the percentage of transformants this promoted competence ability induced by these chemicals is the primary mechanism for the args spread notably research also found that exposure to such pharmaceuticals triggered the significant increase of tonb protein abundances wang et al 2020b this protein is closely associated with virulence abdollahi et al 2018 however future work should provide more details and evidence to illustrate the association between enhanced virulence and the accelerated spread of args 3 6 aromatic compounds albeit co selection mechanisms well explained how above compounds accelerate args spreading the increased dissemination risk of args by organic pollutants e g aromatic compounds could not be fully elucidated some research revealed that aromatic compounds caused args spreading in both lab scale and field study wang et al 2017 xia et al 2019 however the specific mechanisms are still unclear early research suggested that the free antibiotic resistant plasmids could interact with various pollutants by noncovalent bind interactions thereby inhibiting the spread of args johnson et al 2010 kang et al 2010 kang et al found that the noncovalent binding of aromatic compounds with free dna reduced the hgt of args due to the inhibition of transcription from the ampicillin resistance gene to its mrna kang et al 2015 therein noncovalent interactions destroying the hydrogen bonds between genetic bases are associated with π electrons in pahs serving as inhibitors palek and fojta 2001 however the physicochemical property of the aromatic nucleus varies with the different substituents therefore a possible explanation for this different performance is that the bonds alteration between the aromatics and plasmids changed the role of aromatics in the dissemination of args i e inhibitors or facilitators kang et al 2015 shou et al 2019 it is verified that the aromatic plasmid complex inhibited plasmid damage from dna hydrolase in extracellular polymeric substances shou et al 2019 aromatic compounds ensure the completeness of plasmid thereby indirectly promoting the efficiency of hgt overall the prospect of being able to identify this relationship between aromatic compounds and args serves as a continuous incentive for future research 3 7 others as shown in table s6 artificial sweeteners herbicides preservatives dye and other chemicals could also elevate the transfer efficiency of args among cells the enhanced mechanisms are the same as the aforementioned non antibiotic chemicals including sos response membrane permeability and altered gene expression despite the mechanisms well explaining the improved spread of args the specific relationships of these bacterial responses remain obscure moreover different chemicals seem to exhibit similar enhanced performance on the arg transformation but driving mechanisms vary with distinct components and dosage it is worth mentioning the spread pathway of args containing vgts and hgts however current studies are more concentrated on the enhanced hgts by non antibiotic chemicals while limited efforts have been made to elucidate the impact of these factors on vgt 4 non antibiotic conditions affecting the spread of args 4 1 general environmental parameters it is reported that the plasmid transfer efficiency could be influenced by various environmental parameters e g temperature and ph pallares vega et al 2021 however this optimal temperature and other parameters on the conjugative transfer frequency of args provided limited data for the natural spread of args this conclusion is based on the following two facts 1 current studies involved in conjugative transfer frequency of args are all performed by pure strains 2 the microbes in the natural environment are generally agglomerate together to a microbial guild in this case the temperature or ph facilitated args spread for specific strains could be not optimal for the microbial community in the natural environment despite that specific temperature data is currently lacking scientists still get a rough idea from the fate of args under various temperatures in anaerobic digestion generally a high temperature would cause the decrease of args abundances in anaerobic digestion pallares vega et al 2021 tian et al 2016 firstly multiple pollutants e g antibiotics and pesticides were degraded in this temperature relieving the selective pressure on args secondly higher temperatures eliminated some arg hosts finally hgt is inhibited under this temperature however huang et al obtained the opposite result i e thermophilic digestion had a low removal performance on args because of the enhanced abundance of streptococcus pathogen huang et al 2019 the seasonal variations in args in the natural environment could also indicate that temperature played an important role in the spread of args harnisz et al 2015 higher temperature is more favorable for the growth of microorganisms and secondary pollutants production due to the faster chemical reactions lu and lu 2020 however general stress responses from low temperature nutrient limitation and higher oxygen concentrations could promote hgt of args son et al 2018 in this situation various studies tend to obtain divergent results in terms of ph research also observed the opposite situation some studies found that acidic conditions may promote the potential of gene transfer facilitating the spread of args subsequently huang et al 2016 while others pointed out that some antibiotics such as sulfonamide may be favorable to be degraded at acidic phs and provided lower selective pressure in args lin et al 2020 soil research indicated that microbial structure is the primary determinant of arg content instead of hgt forsberg et al 2014 su et al 2015 herein the above different results are reasonable because the microbial compositions vary with the location and habitat however future studies should aim at elucidating whether the vertical transfer takes precedence over the hgt in the natural environment in addition there is an urgent need to develop a technique to evaluate the role of vertical and horizontal transfer in spreading args 4 2 environmental media characteristics it is challenging to investigate the specific mechanism due to the complexity of microbial structure and physical and chemical characteristics in different media procrustes analysis indirectly verified that the media characteristics e g ph nutritional conditions contents of contamination etc played an essential role in the evolution of args zhang et al 2018a some substrates stimulate the args expression and bacteria growth can also promote the dissemination of args in aquatic environments for example some nutrient components c n p etc stimulated the growth of arb carriers facilitating the spread of args sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2021 the sediment properties including toc instead of the microbial structure had a high relevance with the abundance of args e g mdtb arna and rpob zhao et al 2019 research indicated that nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients might to some extent mediate the spread of args by affecting the bacterial synthesis process he et al 2014 lin et al 2021 a possible reason is that the nutrients improve the abundance the functional bacteria thus indirectly enriching the arb in the environment on the contrary higher concentration of ammonia and nitrate could also eliminate the hosts of meg reducing the frequency of args zhu et al 2019 these results confirm the significance of the physical and chemical properties of the environment in the diffusion of args 4 3 additional electric and sound fields the additional electric and sound fields were also reported to stimulate resistance spreading li et al 2021b song et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 high voltages 0 7 v enormously increased the args in the anaerobic electrochemical membrane bioreactor both vgt and hgt are possible mechanisms for promoting arg transfer it is verified that the bacterial density under the condition of 10 v increased by 1 48 times indicating that the abundances of arb would increase with the higher voltages li et al 2018 this enrichment might be attributed to the facilitated respiration of arb by anode electrode or and electron shuttles excreted by exoelectrogens yuan et al 2016 hgt is another reason for the increased args via conjugation and or transformation on the one hand additional voltages are able to encourage generating ros and altering the expression of related transfer genes li et al 2021b on the other hand args could release into the environment after being damaged by voltages under electrical stimulation recipient cells are easily transformed into competent cells and thus direct uptake of args zhang et al 2020b song et al 2018 observed that ultrasound with the intensity below 0 05 w cm2 increased the transfer efficiency of resistance genes this enhanced transfer is due to the acoustic cavitation effect sonoporation triggered by ultrasound elevated membrane permeability resulting in gene exchange and even args song et al 2007 additionally ultrasound raised the contact rate between the donor and recipient cell and also up regulated the expression of conjugation genes and global regulatory genes to promote the hgt of args considering the importance of vgt in arg dissemination more efforts are needed to reveal whether ultrasound could influence the growth of arb 5 molecular mechanisms driving development of antibiotic resistance under non antibiotics stress 5 1 mutation some chemicals can increase the mutation rate to enhance the development of antibiotic resistance in different ways including sos response jia et al 2021 stress response li et al 2022 and nucleotide pool misbalancing blázquez et al 2012 one of the fundamental mechanisms for obtaining args is chromosomal mutation which involved in the base substitution or frameshift in gene sequences to induce resistance andersson and hughes 2014 apart from sub lethal levels of antibiotics kohanski et al 2010 heavy metal and disinfectants can also triggered to these mutations lemire et al 2013 the mutation mechanisms induced by non antibiotic chemicals are similar to those by antibiotics on certain pathways heavy metals are used as antimicrobial agents to inhibit bacterial growth via bringing oxidative stress and dna damage thus promoting mutagenesis and genotoxicity subsequently morones ramirez jose et al 2013 exposure of copper and zinc impelled a point mutation from serine to phenylalanine at residue 464 of the gyrb gene xu et al 2022 this mutation is recognized as an important cause of increased quinolone resistance after antibiotic treatment since the modification of β subunit domain reduced the affinity of ciprofloxacin thereby inducing resistance kohanski et al 2010 the same effects were also observed in the quaternary ammonium compounds treatment jia et al 2022 in addition some non antibiotic chemicals could engender acute ros generation by reducing the expression of cellular antioxidant encoding genes which brought mutations in some key functional lu et al 2018 some mutation stimulated the overexpression of adjoining genes and impelled the expression of repressed genes by the mutations in repressor genes in this case some args such as local and global multidrug resistance regulator genes and beta lactamase coding gene might be enhanced expression and initiate the multidrug efflux pumps and produced beta lactamase decreasing the antibiotic sensitivity consequently jin et al 2018 in addition reduced expression of phoe a gene encoding a pore protein for cell membrane permeability was observed after exposure of triclosan lu et al 2018 as a result enhanced resistance might occur by restricting the entrance of antibiotics a primary type of mutated genes were regulators of mdr pumps the mutation in marr was the most frequent this gene is repressor of the marorab operon which control intrinsic susceptibility and resistance to various antibiotics via the acrab tolc efflux pump rensch et al 2013 specifically the mutation in marr cause the enhanced expression of the marrab operon thereby initiating the acrab tolc pump to efflux antibiotics another mutation occurred in drug transporter genes after exposure of non antibiotic chemicals it was reported that the mutation in the msba gene cause the damage of inner membrane atp binding cassette transporter charging for extruding antibiotics alexander mary et al 2018 jia et al 2022 the mutation in this gene might indirectly influence the resistance ability effecting on the transport of antibiotics means the accumulation of the antibiotic in the intracellular thereby trigger the bacterial sos response and increasing the potential of the hgt of args in this case the mutations in the msba gene might be related to antibiotic resistance 5 2 co selection as early as the last century scientists have realized that metal resistance genes are linked with args particular in plasmids a recent study systematically demonstrated the genetic association between args and metal resistance genes at the molecular level via genomic analyses li et al 2017 this genetic linkage elucidated the process of co selection at the macro level the primary mechanisms of co selection include co cross resistance and co regulation fig 2 the term co resistance usually refers to the selection of two or more types of resistance genes physically co located on the same genetic element e g plasmid or transposon in contrast cross resistance provides resistance to the various toxins by a single mechanism such as an efflux pump in other words co resistance makes the bacteria resistant to at least two different stresses via different genes while cross resistance occurs when resistance genes of one antibiotic are simultaneously resistant to another antibiotic or heavy metals especially a sole regulatory gene controls the expression of multiple resistance genes which triggers the co regulation mechanism notably the cross resistance mechanism is mainly responsible for the efflux of structurally dissimilar compounds a striking example is the multiple drug resistance pump of listeria monocytogenes which could export metals as well as antibiotics mata et al 2000 so far it has been reported that the mechanisms related to bacterial cross resistance to various toxicants are involved in membrane adaptation sonbol et al 2019 changing the enzyme expression and gene repressors cândido et al 2019 khan et al 2018 recent research indicated that treating klebsiella pneumoniae strains with chlorhexidine gave rise to adaptation due to the expression of efflux pump genes such as smvr and smva wand matthew et al 2016 notably chlorhexidine also resulted in cross resistance to colistin other researchers also observed the same phenomenon whereas most of the related mechanisms are directly associated with modifications in the bacterial membrane chen and groisman 2013 fleitas and franco 2016 kumari et al 2014 except for cross and co resistance the co regulation was also reported to increase antibiotic resistance by co selection for example copper and zinc cause the expression of acrd and mdtabc genes encoding the mdr pumps acrd and mdtabc in the presence of baer response regulator nishino et al 2007 in addition cadmium and copper could serve as an inducer to depress the multiple antibiotic resistance regulatory operon marrab kaur et al 2021 in this case the antibiotic resistance triggered by depressing the antibiotic resistance regulator through oxidative damage to envelope proteins like nadh dehydrogenase 2 was enhanced hao et al 2014 5 3 horizontal gene transfer and recombination aside from mutation bacteria could also acquire heritable args via hgt from other organisms or intragenomic reshuffling of genomic sequences by recombination arenas et al 2018 pu et al 2021 although such mechanisms play an important role in species evolution to provide antibiotic resistance hgt are recognized as the major pathway rodríguez beltrán et al 2021 non antibiotic chemicals were verified to promote the spread of args via hgt which is attributed to various kind of bacterial stress responses albeit the enhanced mechanisms vary from different chemicals the primary bacterial responses induced by non antibiotic chemicals are the generation of reactive oxygen species ros damage on cell membrane dna or protein as well as bacterial sos response fig 3 the higher level of ros is an important factor enabling promoted the transfer frequencies of args for example sweeteners increased ros production by 1 5 fold in the recipient cell yu et al 2021 worth to note is that these elevated conjugative frequencies could be reversed by introducing ros scavenger like thiourea wang et al 2019 the excess ros would damage cell structure because hydroxyl radical cannot be eliminated by any enzymatic reaction thus reacting with various macromolecules such as nucleic acids lipids and protein in this case the cell membrane consisting of these molecules would be damaged weakening the hydrophobic lipid bilayer barrier and increasing gene transfer wang et al 2015a in addition a high level of ros could also induce bacterial sos stress response which could also serve to promote hgt of resistance genes sos response is associated with various gene expressions of dna repair and cell cycle control initial research showed that setr an integrating conjugative element encoded repressor repressed the expression of transfer activators but bacterial sos response alleviated this repression and increased the expression of transfer related gene beaber et al 2004 in addition to promoting the transfer of mges sos response also stimulates integrase expression of class 1 integrons for example the bacterial sos response result in genomic rearrangements mediated by the site specific integron integrase baharoglu et al 2010 strugeon et al 2016 current research demonstrated that non antibiotic pharmaceuticals triggered antibiotic like bacterial responses i e promoting the expression of sos response genes proteins lexa umuc umud and soxr wang et al 2021a similarly cuo nanoparticles or cu2 also caused the sos response for both donor and recipient bacteria zhang et al 2019 these genes play vital roles in dna damage in bacterial sos response specifically umuc and umud genes were reported to tolerate and repair dna damage in e coli increasing mutation rate and promoting the conjugation frequency of args at the same time zhang et al 2018b the recombination reaction is commonly associated the integrons which are assembly genetic platforms that contain exogenous open reading frames orfs as shown in fig 4 the integron structure consists of a stable functional platform ensuring the correct expression of follow up genes and an alterable cassette array cambray et al 2010 the functional platform includes three elements i e inti genes encoding the integrase atti site and a promoter pc cambray et al 2010 mazel 2006 the detailed information and process of the unique recombination reaction of integrons can be found in the references escudero josé et al 2015 here it should be highlighted that the inti1 gene expression is regulated by the sos response guerin et al 2009 in this case some chemicals other than antibiotics e g microplastics nano particles etc inducing sos response could trigger the expression of integrase gene thereby regulating the structure of cassettes however no available data are presented the role of recombination in the spread of args induced by non antibiotic factors 5 4 vertical gene transfer vgt also plays significant role in the development of antibiotic resistance in anthropogenically influenced environments fang et al 2018 li et al 2019 the antarctic uncontaminated soil sample also showed that args have been vertically inherited over generations and have a strong phylogenetic signal to form a monophyletic group this result indicated that vgt is the most likely to be the dominant pathway in the dissemination of args in pre antibiotic era van goethem et al 2018 although resistance genes and taxonomic composition significantly altered the host phyla of chromosomal arg remained consistent suggesting that vgt by organism growth is the crucial role in arg dissemination in sludge system of wastewater treatment dai et al 2022 vertical transfer ensures the retention of resistance genes within the species while the macroscopic manifestation of genetic inheritance is the change in community structure it is no doubt that the abundance of args is associated with the characteristics of microbial communities sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however it is unclear the role of selective agents in the environment transmission of args although some environment factors could stimulate the growth of specific species for most this growth influence is often limited in this case there might be a small growth differences between resistant and non resistant strains induced by non antibiotic chemicals other environment factors including temperature nutrients and environment media unrelated directly to the resistance profile are likely to be more significant for retention of resistance genes within the species 6 conclusion and perspectives args have been recognized as the novel pollutants in the aquatic environment which not only harms the microorganisms living in the aquatic eco system but also has extremely serious consequences for the treatment of bacterial infections in the human body initially scientists believed that the spread of args was mainly attributed to the misuse and abuse of antibiotics currently some researches indicated that the activity of antibiotics showed a dose dependent effect i e a dual ecological role of antibiotics the ancient function of args also does not seem to be antibiotic resistance which participates in various bacterial metabolisms this dual role of antibiotics and args raises suspicion about previous spread pathways of args because some non antibiotic chemicals that are related to the real function of args may stimulate the dissemination of args however the preconceived belief of args being the mean by which bacteria resist antibiotics has made us overlook the contribution of many non antibiotic chemicals in promoting the migration of resistance genes recent studies revealed that various types of non antibiotic chemicals could elevate the dissemination of args including heavy metals microplastics metal nanoparticles and various organic substances these non antibiotic chemicals could trigger various bacterial responses antibiotic like effects including stress and sos response and regulating gene expression these responses either increase the frequency of gene mutation or promote the transfer frequency of hgt in addition some substrates e g metals and disinfectants could also be the selective stress to args by co selection in terms of non antibiotic environmental conditions the optimal environment parameters stimulated the growth of arb thereby increasing the risk of args generally environmental conditions directly influence the microbial structure thus altering the distribution of args similarly environmental media and media characteristics including nutrition and the contents of contamination also impact the vgt of args additional electric and sound fields have the same mechanisms of the above non antibiotic substrates the molecular mechanisms involved mutation co selection horizontal gene transfer and vertical gene transfer de novo mutation is an important part of microbial acquisition of resistance genes these mutations are attributed to various mechanisms such as sos response and stress response in addition some non antibiotic chemicals can fuel mutagenesis and hgt thereby increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance these non antibiotic chemicals enhance the ros formation or inducing sos response vertical gene transfer further ensure the retention of heritable resistance genes induced by mutation or hgt within the species this review also has given rise to many questions in need of further investigation 1 albeit current researches revealed some non antibiotic chemicals could promote the spread of args more chemicals should be further tested to show whether they possess the same performance 2 stimulated ros production by non antibiotic chemicals seems to be the main reason for the promoted hgt but these results are only verified by ros quenching tests ros could change the permeability of the cell membrane and could induce bacterial sos response sos response is a crucial factor to trigger the combination reaction of integrons however there is no research focus on investigating the role of non antibiotic chemicals in the combination reaction of integrons 3 the molecular mechanism of promoted hgt in pure culture is well documented but it is recommended that future studies should focus on the population and community level effects in addition there is a lack of data on the long term impacts of these non antibiotic chemicals on the spread of args considering that these chemicals may result in an accumulative effect similar to heavy metals and antibiotics on the dissemination of args after chronic exposure investigating the long term effects of these chemicals on the actual environment including eco system and human microbiomes is a significant and urgent to estimate the risk of these chemicals to the spread of args 4 in order to understand the spread pathway of args induced by non antibiotic chemicals it is necessary to evaluate the contribution rate of these chemicals in the dissemination of args for example we could determine the discrepancy of different gene elements including intracellular chromosomes plasmids and other mges and free dna sequences outside the cell in this case scientists are able to estimate which resistance gene elements should be paid more attention to controlling the spread of args 5 vgt also plays an important role in spreading args however current investigations are mostly based on the mating assays e g filter mating flasks or plate culture based mating in this case it is difficult to distinguish the contributions between hgt and vgt therefore developing an evaluation manner is urgently to reveal the discover dynamic variations in hgt and vgt 6 as was discussed research indicated that the effects of environmental conditions on the spread of args were often contradictory albeit obtaining some rough results a large number of data is warranted to fully understand the spread pathway of args in the natural environment further work should concentrate on constructing a standard experiment method to ensure comparability and usability of different

15492,the global spread of antibiotic resistance genes args has wreaked havoc with the treatment efficiency of antibiotics and ultimately anti microbial chemotherapy and has been conventionally attributed to the abuse and misuse of antibiotics however the ancient args have alterative functions in bacterial physiology and thus they could be co regulated by non antibiotic conditions recent research has demonstrated that many non antibiotic chemicals such as microplastics metallic nanoparticles and non antibiotic drugs as well as some non antibiotic conditions can accelerate the dissemination of args these results suggested that the role of antibiotics might have been previously overestimated whereas the effects of non antibiotic conditions were possibly ignored thus in an attempt to fully understand the fate and behavior of args in the eco system it is urgent to critically highlight the role and mechanisms of non antibiotic chemicals and related environmental factors in the spread of args to this end this timely review assessed the evolution of args especially its function alteration summarized the non antibiotic chemicals promoting the spread of args evaluated the non antibiotic conditions related to arg dissemination and analyzed the molecular mechanisms related to spread of args induced by the non antibiotic factors finally this review then provided several critical perspectives for future research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotic resistance genes non antibiotic chemicals horizontal gene transfer vertical gene transfer mobile gene elements data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the inappropriate and even abusive use of antibiotics in the clinical environment has given rise to an alarming situation in which multidrug resistance bacterial pathogens are now threatening the continued effectiveness of the infection treatment yoon et al 2021 how antibiotic resistance genes args arise and develop are very fundamental questions in managing and controlling the trouble of args and antibiotic resistance bacteria arb generally args can emerge either from the mutation in the pre existing functional genes by duplication divergence or gene fusion fission and non coding sequence de novo mutation in the bacterial genome or from the gene elements of another organism horizontal gene transfer hgt andersson et al 2015 pazda et al 2019 mutations indeed occur and become fixed in the species by vertical gene transfer vgt after exposure to the antibiotic in recent years it is no doubt that antibiotics have entirely changed the preconditions for the dissemination and development of args due to its usage in infection treatment jiang et al 2017 in addition this selective pressure has also enhanced the mobilization and transfer of args to pathogenic bacteria ultimately causing a well known consequence of the invalid infection treatment lopatkin et al 2016 however the dissemination of today s resistance may not be all down to the misuse of antibiotics there are two main aspects i e the environmental concentration of residual antibiotics and the alternative function of args to draw above conclusions which will be explained below there is no doubt that the selective pressure of antibiotics has caused resistance spread in recent years however except for some industrially polluted sites i e antibiotic manufacturing the residual concentration of antibiotics in the environment is much lower than that shown or predicted in the laboratory for the selection of arb bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 although considerable studies showed that arg abundance is significantly associated with the concentration of antibiotics chow et al 2021 in many cases this is because human excreta are a source of both antibiotic and resistance karkman et al 2019 in addition distinguishing whether this is from the taxonomic changes or is a result of direct selection by these antibiotics in the environment is difficult in addition some results point to the opposite for example a negative correlation between args and antibiotics was observed in some environment medium ohore et al 2020 recent research related to sterile filtered wastewaters also provided no support for selection of resistance by antibiotics flach et al 2018 these results indicated that there must present other selective agents rather than antibiotics therein to exert the selective pressure on args in addition most args have probably evolved gradually from genes with other functions andersson et al 2015 for example several structures of β lactamases are similar with cell wall metabolizing enzymes indicating β lactamases shares function with cell wall metabolism and general peptidase activities morar and wright 2010 some macrolide glycosyltransferases inactivates macrolides are also reported to associate with the glycosyltransferase 1 family zhang et al 2020a in this case both antibiotics and args might have different ecological functions in the pre antibiotic era compared with that in modern settings sengupta et al 2013 the intrinsic characteristic of resistance is not associated with mges demonstrating these genes may not be dedicated and have functional roles in other metabolic processes for example aminoglycoside acetyltransferase aac enzymes containing loose conservation of tertiary and quaternary structure endow the aacs with a very broad substrate specificity morar and wright 2010 accordingly they might be co regulated by some non antibiotic conditions and thus offset the fitness costs of resistance genes many non antibiotic chemicals have recently been demonstrated to promote the transfer of args such as metallic nanoparticles yu et al 2020 microplastics laganà et al 2019 and some other pollutants lu and lu 2020 as such the role of antibiotics in the spread of resistance genes might have been previously overestimated whereas the effects of such chemicals were possibly ignored moreover non antibiotic conditions such as environmental media can also affect the growth of bacterial thereby influencing the fate of arb the previous reports in observation of enhanced spread of args by non antibiotic conditions raise an intriguing and profound question about the role of contaminants other than antibiotics in spreading args therefore there need a comprehensive and systematical discussion to understand the evolution of args in the presence of non antibiotic factors under wider mechanisms especially the mutation and vgt to this end we attempt to systematically understand how non antibiotic chemicals and conditions influence the decimation of args under various mechanisms i e mutation co selection hgt and vgt specifically this review aims to 1 evaluate the ecological functions of antibiotics and args since some non antibiotic chemicals could serve as the co regulator to exert selective pressure to args 2 summarize various non antibiotic chemicals that could accelerate the dissemination of args 3 discuss the key non antibiotic conditions influencing the migration of args and 4 analyze the molecular mechanisms in the development of args by non antibiotic conditions eventually several important perspectives for further work are then proposed based on this review 2 the antibiotic is not the only selector to spread args 2 1 from proto resistance to args where args come from is a fundamental question in understanding the ecological function of args proto resistance also called pre resistances in literature provided the possible interpretation for the evolution of args the proto resistances genes are not phenotype resistance but could become real args once exerting suitable stress which is analogous to the proto oncogenes of the cancer field galán et al 2013 perry et al 2014 some research predicted the housekeeping genes with a common ancestor to antibiotic resistance according to the mechanistic and structural similarity for instance ant 2 ia and ant 4 resistance enzyme a kind of aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase have similar enzyme fold to dna polymerase β and virginiamycin b lyase is similar to the muconate lactonizing enzyme in the structure and catalytic function morar and wright 2010 based on the concept of proto resistance the ancestor of args had a housekeeping function but this function has altered under selective pressure for args various examples were summarized to support the origin of resistance see ref waglechner et al 2021 the bayesian phylogeny of the oxa b lactamase genes indicated that oxa genes arose over 2 ga and were mobilized to plasmids hundreds of millions of years ago barlow and hall 2002 this observation contradicts the commonly held notion that the mobilization of args is in response to clinical antibiotic use although antibiotics released from antibiotic producers may also lead to the development of resistance given the environmental concentrations of antibiotics at that time we prefer to believe that there may be other factors other than antibiotics resulting in emerging antibiotic resistance 2 2 a previous fallacy in resistance research in reaction to the rapid spread of args and invalid infection treatment researchers previously endeavoured to reverse this problem by limiting antibiotic usage a reasonable expectation was that the resistant species would be replaced by sensitive ones as antibiotic usage declined however results showed that resistance persisted on both small and large scales even without antibiotics tamminen et al 2011 moreover recent studies related to the human gut microbiomes observed the same results that plasmid transfer is pervasive and frequent even under antibiotic free conditions gumpert et al 2017 león sampedro et al 2021 the previous expectation is based on the fitness cost of resistance generally one of the vital resistance mechanisms is associated with modifying the target enzyme to prohibit antibiotic binding this mutation confers antibiotic resistance but drops the efficiency of the target enzyme in physiological leading to burdens on cellular metabolism and function for instance fluoroquinolone resistance brings impaired motility to pseudomonads stickland et al 2010 while aminoglycoside ones change the ribosome structure thereby limiting the cellular functions holberger and hayes 2009 therefore the linkage of resistance with decreased fitness raised the opinion that a reduction in antibiotic use would benefit the susceptible bacteria by outcompeting the resistant ones evidently the strategy of limiting antibiotic usage is not sufficient and effective at totally eliminating resistance two mechanisms are responsible for maintaining the resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection firstly second site mutations can compensate for the fitness costs of resistance this compensatory evolution is already observed in various studies melnyk et al 2015 alternately genetic co selection induced by the genetic linkage between args and selected loci prohibit resistance eliminating borrell et al 2013 in this case other chemicals rather than antibiotics could also provide the selection pressure for arb such as heavy metal and disinfectants 2 3 more than the spear the function of antibiotics in the natural environment the clinical usage of antibiotics is based upon the assumption that bacterial producing antibiotics is aimed to stand out from various species in the natural environment in other words antibiotics are the spear by one species to hinder another s growth interestingly the function of antibiotics in human society is more than clinical therapeutics as early as the 1940s scientists found that the growth of livestock could be stimulated by low doses of antibiotics jukes 1972 in view of the functional discrepancy of antibiotics it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the real function in the natural environment and more importantly the linkage of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance up to now antibiotics are mostly isolated from soil antibiotic producing organisms nesme and simonet 2015 scientists initially speculated that inhibiting the growth of their competitors is the primary function of these chemicals notably the activity of antibiotics is also dose dependent fajardo and martínez 2008 as several previous reviews pointed out antibiotics have a dual ecological role i e signals at low concentrations and weapons at high counterparts fajardo and martínez 2008 a concentrate analysis conducted by spagnolo et al showed that there is a concentration gradient of antibiotics around the producer and its amount decreases with distance spagnolo et al 2021 however it is still unclear whether the overall antibiotic concentration in the soil environment can reach the lethal concentration conversely a non lethal dose of antibiotics may stimulate the interactions among microbial communities because these signaling molecules i e antibiotics could be involved in quorum sensing sengupta et al 2013 other scientists also pointed out that antibiotics play a crucial role in the microbial community assembly spagnolo et al 2021 2 4 antibiotic resistance is the tip of the iceberg previously researchers conjectured args is the shield to protect the microorganisms from the spear antibiotics in the soil environment however the dual ecological role of antibiotics arises the hesitation whether the function of args is only the resistance it is a fact that antibiotic resistance widely exists even in the totally uninhabited and thinly populated places in which the concentration of antibiotics is close to baseline levels warinner et al 2014 a reasonable hypothesis is that args have more functions than detoxification in this case some factors other than antibiotics might offset the fitness cost of these genes since they might play a role in the other functions of args moreover the intrinsic characteristic of resistance is not associated with mges demonstrating these genes may not be dedicated and have functional roles in other metabolic processes remarkably the multidrug resistance mdr pumps associated with quinolone resistance were isolated before the invention of such antibiotics alonso et al 1999 mdr pumps are also involved in other processes rather than a solo function of antibiotic resistance such as detoxification of some metabolic intermediates ruiz and levy 2014 and resistance to resemble antibiotic resistance heavy metals ranjitkar et al 2019 biocides eda et al 2011 and solvents blanco et al 2016 the efflux pumps are reported to be associate with the quorum sensing response alcalde rico et al 2020 aside from mdr the modification to the target by some enzymes also protects the host from these antibiotics for example the modification enzyme 2 n acetyltransferase of providencia stuartii can inactivate gentamycin however its original function was to modify the peptidoglycan layer macinga and rather 1999 other similar antibiotic modifying enzymes like β lactamases are also involved in synthesizing peptidoglycan and its activity against beta lactams is considered as an additional effect meroueh et al 2003 2 5 non antibiotic factors inducing the dissemination of args so far we have discussed args are origin from some function genes and some args might have alterative functions in bacterial physiology in this case such args could be co regulated by non antibiotic conditions related to the alterative functions thereby accelerating the transfer frequency over the eons the probable origin of args has been developed from other functional genes by duplication divergence roth et al 2007 or even evolved from noncoding sequences i e de novo mutations andersson et al 2015 in addition the organisms can also acquire args from another one via hgt i e conjugation transformation and transduction arnold et al 2022 fig 1 the relative importance of these mechanisms depends on various factors it is no doubt that hgt is the dominant process in developing args over recent time scales however the first two mechanisms explain how args actually emerge obviously the recently clinical application of antibiotics is the principal power force in the emergence of resistance this drive forces are associated with the enhanced hgt and mutation induced by antibiotic itself the spread of args among different species involved several steps firstly args was linked to gene cassettes in integrons or insertion sequences to move with the genome then the relocation of args to a mobile element such as plasmid or integrative conjugative element finally a mobilized resistance gene was transferred to another species via hgt and further integrated into its own genome thereby ensuring the retention of resistance genes within the species by vgt it is obvious that these steps could be promoted by antibiotics and current overuse of antibiotics have fueled the evolution to accelerate antibiotic resistance notably although most of steps also occur under antibiotic free conditions the rates are different with antibiotic induced reaction aminov 2011 knöppel et al 2017 in addition these non antibiotic factors may also lead to accumulation of mutations thereby conferring decreased antibiotic susceptibility except for directly selecting resistance species antibiotics also affect the frequency of mutation cellular sos and oxidative stress response to enhance the spread of resistance however this effect is not specific to antibiotics it is reported that some disinfection byproducts chlorite and iodoacetic acid significantly increased the expression of stress response genes and dna damage and repair genes li et al 2016 there are many more chemicals like this with antibiotic like effects see section 3 3 various non antibiotic chemicals driving the disseminations of antibiotic resistance 3 1 metals and their compounds metal was the earliest investigated substance accelerating the spread of args the field investigation also verified that metals confer persistent selection pressures for args in soils environment while co selection is the main mechanism in the metal rich environment table s1 summarizes the metals and their compounds promoting the spread of args nano alumina al2o3 was the initially investigated compound that promoted the hgt of args qiu et al 2012 plenty of metal nano particles and nano metal oxide could significantly enhance the hgt of args via conjugation and transformation the main contributor of metal compounds to stimulating the dissemination of args is attributed to their dissolved ions sirelkhatim et al 2015 metal ions e g zn2 and ag etc could promote args spread by oxidative stress or inducing the co selection to antibiotics and metal resistance except for the effects of dissolved ions some research highlighted the role metal component itself some nanoparticles like nano al2o3 ding et al 2021 and nano zno wang et al 2018 could directly exert selective pressure on both non resistance and resistance species to enhance the transfer frequency without the participation of ions additionally nanoparticles seem to have different effects on extracellular dna and bacteria from their corresponding ionic counterparts for instance albeit nano al2o3 increased the permeability of cell membrane thereby promoting uptake of plasmid dna aluminum ions have no significant effects on its uptake ding et al 2021 comparison research between nano ag and ag also obtained the similar result that the abundances of args significantly various with substances ma et al 2016 although the microbial structure changes could explain the different abundance of args more efforts to reveal the mechanisms accounting for the discrepancy are needed 3 2 disinfectants table s2 exhibited the common disinfectants stimulating the migration of args as early as 1981 armstrong et al found that despite reduction in total microbial number the percentage of arb increased after chlorination armstrong et al 1981 subsequent research indicated that the change of microbial structure is responsible for the dissemination of args shi et al 2013 this enrichment was due to the mdr pumps mediated co resistance however this effect of chlorination on args is also dose dependence the transfer frequency of args could be promoted by 2 5 fold at 40 mg cl min l while the high doses of chlorine 80 mg cl min l would inhibit the spread of args guo et al 2015 chlorination the most widely used method unfortunately would generate various disinfection by products dbps these unwilling chemicals seem to significantly impact the cell behavior such as cell permeability and inducing sos response the production of chloramine at low doses decreased the disinfectant ability and improved the permeability of cell membrane thereby stimulating the spread of resistance in addition chlorite bromoacetic acid and iodoacetic acid also exhibited antibiotic like effects on species and strains promoting args spread subsequently li et al 2016 mantilla calderon et al 2019 3 3 microplastics microplastics mps could also lead to the enhanced spread of args table s3 li et al 2021a wang et al 2017 one reason is that mps could directly adsorb args on the surface and args are greatly enriched by 5000 fold zhang et al 2020c mps could also favor the propagation of antibiotic resistance by improving the hgt frequency via bacterial response and increasing the cell permeability cheng et al 2022 notably the types of microplastics showed significant association with the resistome and transfer frequency of resistance gene li et al 2021a a rough fixed surface is considered more favorable for conjugation gu et al 2017 mps or plastic debris provide a surface for microbial colonization which assembles various microorganisms resulting in the promoted hgt of args due to the direct contact consequently plastics colonized by bacterial hitchhikers could transport args to distant places due to plastics possessing higher durability and buoyancy than natural co occurring materials wright et al 2020 previous studies indicated that microbial structure closely correlates with arg profiles in this relationship stochastic processes are believed to play a role in structuring the args fang et al 2019 microplastics could significantly influenced the microbial communities by creating the plastisphere communities or releasing the leachate in this case lu and chen 2022 reported that the phthalates leaching from microplastics altered the bacterial communities leading to the raised abundance of args by increasing the arg hosts microplastics as a vector for various pathogenic bacteria might be the most hazardous pollutant for the migration of args in addition the microplastic related species exhibit a higher transfer frequency of args than the background environment in this case the transmission route of args will overlap with microplastics the aquatic environment is the hugest microplastic reservoir which also provides a perfect hotspot for transmitting args pathogens presenting in these aquatic environments may acquire args thus reaching to human body via food chain or activity ingested microplastics may exacerbate the hgt among gut microbiomes and then these resistance species could enter the acoustic ecosystem again via excrement therefore we must take necessary action to manage either microplastics or args effectively 3 4 inorganics as shown in table s4 the spread of args could also be stimulated by various inorganic chemicals such as ionic liquid ammonia selenate and carbon dioxide similar to metal oxide and microplastics these substrates were able to damage the cell membrane and increase the permeability of the cell membrane thereby raising the transfer efficiency of both conjugation and transformation the ionic liquid was the earliest investigated inorganic chemical that promoted the transfer of args a series of experiments conducted by mao et al verified the enhancement of hgt by ionic liquid under both simulated and actual conditions wang et al 2015b 2020a except for the change of cell membrane the fortuitous selection for efflux pump genes is also responsible for this promotion wang et al 2020a free ammonia and selenate harbor the same effects on cell response ros production induced by selenate and selenite stimulated the change of membrane permeability and pilus formation is the primary mechanism of enhanced hgt shi et al 2021 in comparison carbon dioxide benefitted the cell to cell contact by improving the surface hydrophobicity and changing the charge of cell surface liao et al 2019 in addition the release of ca2 enhanced by co2 also provided more power for dna uptake 3 5 non antibiotic pharmaceuticals various non antibiotic pharmaceuticals also enhanced arg transmission through transformation and conjugation table s5 these chemicals could cause antibiotic like effects on bacteria including activating sos response inducing universal stress and stimulating the efflux pump wang et al 2021b interestingly acetaminophen had different roles in promoting ros production since it only provoked ros production in donors rather than recipient bacteria jia et al 2021 although acetaminophen may be specific for plasmid bearing cells more efforts are needed to verify this hypothesis in transformation experiments such pharmaceuticals elevated the percentage of transformants this promoted competence ability induced by these chemicals is the primary mechanism for the args spread notably research also found that exposure to such pharmaceuticals triggered the significant increase of tonb protein abundances wang et al 2020b this protein is closely associated with virulence abdollahi et al 2018 however future work should provide more details and evidence to illustrate the association between enhanced virulence and the accelerated spread of args 3 6 aromatic compounds albeit co selection mechanisms well explained how above compounds accelerate args spreading the increased dissemination risk of args by organic pollutants e g aromatic compounds could not be fully elucidated some research revealed that aromatic compounds caused args spreading in both lab scale and field study wang et al 2017 xia et al 2019 however the specific mechanisms are still unclear early research suggested that the free antibiotic resistant plasmids could interact with various pollutants by noncovalent bind interactions thereby inhibiting the spread of args johnson et al 2010 kang et al 2010 kang et al found that the noncovalent binding of aromatic compounds with free dna reduced the hgt of args due to the inhibition of transcription from the ampicillin resistance gene to its mrna kang et al 2015 therein noncovalent interactions destroying the hydrogen bonds between genetic bases are associated with π electrons in pahs serving as inhibitors palek and fojta 2001 however the physicochemical property of the aromatic nucleus varies with the different substituents therefore a possible explanation for this different performance is that the bonds alteration between the aromatics and plasmids changed the role of aromatics in the dissemination of args i e inhibitors or facilitators kang et al 2015 shou et al 2019 it is verified that the aromatic plasmid complex inhibited plasmid damage from dna hydrolase in extracellular polymeric substances shou et al 2019 aromatic compounds ensure the completeness of plasmid thereby indirectly promoting the efficiency of hgt overall the prospect of being able to identify this relationship between aromatic compounds and args serves as a continuous incentive for future research 3 7 others as shown in table s6 artificial sweeteners herbicides preservatives dye and other chemicals could also elevate the transfer efficiency of args among cells the enhanced mechanisms are the same as the aforementioned non antibiotic chemicals including sos response membrane permeability and altered gene expression despite the mechanisms well explaining the improved spread of args the specific relationships of these bacterial responses remain obscure moreover different chemicals seem to exhibit similar enhanced performance on the arg transformation but driving mechanisms vary with distinct components and dosage it is worth mentioning the spread pathway of args containing vgts and hgts however current studies are more concentrated on the enhanced hgts by non antibiotic chemicals while limited efforts have been made to elucidate the impact of these factors on vgt 4 non antibiotic conditions affecting the spread of args 4 1 general environmental parameters it is reported that the plasmid transfer efficiency could be influenced by various environmental parameters e g temperature and ph pallares vega et al 2021 however this optimal temperature and other parameters on the conjugative transfer frequency of args provided limited data for the natural spread of args this conclusion is based on the following two facts 1 current studies involved in conjugative transfer frequency of args are all performed by pure strains 2 the microbes in the natural environment are generally agglomerate together to a microbial guild in this case the temperature or ph facilitated args spread for specific strains could be not optimal for the microbial community in the natural environment despite that specific temperature data is currently lacking scientists still get a rough idea from the fate of args under various temperatures in anaerobic digestion generally a high temperature would cause the decrease of args abundances in anaerobic digestion pallares vega et al 2021 tian et al 2016 firstly multiple pollutants e g antibiotics and pesticides were degraded in this temperature relieving the selective pressure on args secondly higher temperatures eliminated some arg hosts finally hgt is inhibited under this temperature however huang et al obtained the opposite result i e thermophilic digestion had a low removal performance on args because of the enhanced abundance of streptococcus pathogen huang et al 2019 the seasonal variations in args in the natural environment could also indicate that temperature played an important role in the spread of args harnisz et al 2015 higher temperature is more favorable for the growth of microorganisms and secondary pollutants production due to the faster chemical reactions lu and lu 2020 however general stress responses from low temperature nutrient limitation and higher oxygen concentrations could promote hgt of args son et al 2018 in this situation various studies tend to obtain divergent results in terms of ph research also observed the opposite situation some studies found that acidic conditions may promote the potential of gene transfer facilitating the spread of args subsequently huang et al 2016 while others pointed out that some antibiotics such as sulfonamide may be favorable to be degraded at acidic phs and provided lower selective pressure in args lin et al 2020 soil research indicated that microbial structure is the primary determinant of arg content instead of hgt forsberg et al 2014 su et al 2015 herein the above different results are reasonable because the microbial compositions vary with the location and habitat however future studies should aim at elucidating whether the vertical transfer takes precedence over the hgt in the natural environment in addition there is an urgent need to develop a technique to evaluate the role of vertical and horizontal transfer in spreading args 4 2 environmental media characteristics it is challenging to investigate the specific mechanism due to the complexity of microbial structure and physical and chemical characteristics in different media procrustes analysis indirectly verified that the media characteristics e g ph nutritional conditions contents of contamination etc played an essential role in the evolution of args zhang et al 2018a some substrates stimulate the args expression and bacteria growth can also promote the dissemination of args in aquatic environments for example some nutrient components c n p etc stimulated the growth of arb carriers facilitating the spread of args sun et al 2015 zheng et al 2021 the sediment properties including toc instead of the microbial structure had a high relevance with the abundance of args e g mdtb arna and rpob zhao et al 2019 research indicated that nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients might to some extent mediate the spread of args by affecting the bacterial synthesis process he et al 2014 lin et al 2021 a possible reason is that the nutrients improve the abundance the functional bacteria thus indirectly enriching the arb in the environment on the contrary higher concentration of ammonia and nitrate could also eliminate the hosts of meg reducing the frequency of args zhu et al 2019 these results confirm the significance of the physical and chemical properties of the environment in the diffusion of args 4 3 additional electric and sound fields the additional electric and sound fields were also reported to stimulate resistance spreading li et al 2021b song et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 high voltages 0 7 v enormously increased the args in the anaerobic electrochemical membrane bioreactor both vgt and hgt are possible mechanisms for promoting arg transfer it is verified that the bacterial density under the condition of 10 v increased by 1 48 times indicating that the abundances of arb would increase with the higher voltages li et al 2018 this enrichment might be attributed to the facilitated respiration of arb by anode electrode or and electron shuttles excreted by exoelectrogens yuan et al 2016 hgt is another reason for the increased args via conjugation and or transformation on the one hand additional voltages are able to encourage generating ros and altering the expression of related transfer genes li et al 2021b on the other hand args could release into the environment after being damaged by voltages under electrical stimulation recipient cells are easily transformed into competent cells and thus direct uptake of args zhang et al 2020b song et al 2018 observed that ultrasound with the intensity below 0 05 w cm2 increased the transfer efficiency of resistance genes this enhanced transfer is due to the acoustic cavitation effect sonoporation triggered by ultrasound elevated membrane permeability resulting in gene exchange and even args song et al 2007 additionally ultrasound raised the contact rate between the donor and recipient cell and also up regulated the expression of conjugation genes and global regulatory genes to promote the hgt of args considering the importance of vgt in arg dissemination more efforts are needed to reveal whether ultrasound could influence the growth of arb 5 molecular mechanisms driving development of antibiotic resistance under non antibiotics stress 5 1 mutation some chemicals can increase the mutation rate to enhance the development of antibiotic resistance in different ways including sos response jia et al 2021 stress response li et al 2022 and nucleotide pool misbalancing blázquez et al 2012 one of the fundamental mechanisms for obtaining args is chromosomal mutation which involved in the base substitution or frameshift in gene sequences to induce resistance andersson and hughes 2014 apart from sub lethal levels of antibiotics kohanski et al 2010 heavy metal and disinfectants can also triggered to these mutations lemire et al 2013 the mutation mechanisms induced by non antibiotic chemicals are similar to those by antibiotics on certain pathways heavy metals are used as antimicrobial agents to inhibit bacterial growth via bringing oxidative stress and dna damage thus promoting mutagenesis and genotoxicity subsequently morones ramirez jose et al 2013 exposure of copper and zinc impelled a point mutation from serine to phenylalanine at residue 464 of the gyrb gene xu et al 2022 this mutation is recognized as an important cause of increased quinolone resistance after antibiotic treatment since the modification of β subunit domain reduced the affinity of ciprofloxacin thereby inducing resistance kohanski et al 2010 the same effects were also observed in the quaternary ammonium compounds treatment jia et al 2022 in addition some non antibiotic chemicals could engender acute ros generation by reducing the expression of cellular antioxidant encoding genes which brought mutations in some key functional lu et al 2018 some mutation stimulated the overexpression of adjoining genes and impelled the expression of repressed genes by the mutations in repressor genes in this case some args such as local and global multidrug resistance regulator genes and beta lactamase coding gene might be enhanced expression and initiate the multidrug efflux pumps and produced beta lactamase decreasing the antibiotic sensitivity consequently jin et al 2018 in addition reduced expression of phoe a gene encoding a pore protein for cell membrane permeability was observed after exposure of triclosan lu et al 2018 as a result enhanced resistance might occur by restricting the entrance of antibiotics a primary type of mutated genes were regulators of mdr pumps the mutation in marr was the most frequent this gene is repressor of the marorab operon which control intrinsic susceptibility and resistance to various antibiotics via the acrab tolc efflux pump rensch et al 2013 specifically the mutation in marr cause the enhanced expression of the marrab operon thereby initiating the acrab tolc pump to efflux antibiotics another mutation occurred in drug transporter genes after exposure of non antibiotic chemicals it was reported that the mutation in the msba gene cause the damage of inner membrane atp binding cassette transporter charging for extruding antibiotics alexander mary et al 2018 jia et al 2022 the mutation in this gene might indirectly influence the resistance ability effecting on the transport of antibiotics means the accumulation of the antibiotic in the intracellular thereby trigger the bacterial sos response and increasing the potential of the hgt of args in this case the mutations in the msba gene might be related to antibiotic resistance 5 2 co selection as early as the last century scientists have realized that metal resistance genes are linked with args particular in plasmids a recent study systematically demonstrated the genetic association between args and metal resistance genes at the molecular level via genomic analyses li et al 2017 this genetic linkage elucidated the process of co selection at the macro level the primary mechanisms of co selection include co cross resistance and co regulation fig 2 the term co resistance usually refers to the selection of two or more types of resistance genes physically co located on the same genetic element e g plasmid or transposon in contrast cross resistance provides resistance to the various toxins by a single mechanism such as an efflux pump in other words co resistance makes the bacteria resistant to at least two different stresses via different genes while cross resistance occurs when resistance genes of one antibiotic are simultaneously resistant to another antibiotic or heavy metals especially a sole regulatory gene controls the expression of multiple resistance genes which triggers the co regulation mechanism notably the cross resistance mechanism is mainly responsible for the efflux of structurally dissimilar compounds a striking example is the multiple drug resistance pump of listeria monocytogenes which could export metals as well as antibiotics mata et al 2000 so far it has been reported that the mechanisms related to bacterial cross resistance to various toxicants are involved in membrane adaptation sonbol et al 2019 changing the enzyme expression and gene repressors cândido et al 2019 khan et al 2018 recent research indicated that treating klebsiella pneumoniae strains with chlorhexidine gave rise to adaptation due to the expression of efflux pump genes such as smvr and smva wand matthew et al 2016 notably chlorhexidine also resulted in cross resistance to colistin other researchers also observed the same phenomenon whereas most of the related mechanisms are directly associated with modifications in the bacterial membrane chen and groisman 2013 fleitas and franco 2016 kumari et al 2014 except for cross and co resistance the co regulation was also reported to increase antibiotic resistance by co selection for example copper and zinc cause the expression of acrd and mdtabc genes encoding the mdr pumps acrd and mdtabc in the presence of baer response regulator nishino et al 2007 in addition cadmium and copper could serve as an inducer to depress the multiple antibiotic resistance regulatory operon marrab kaur et al 2021 in this case the antibiotic resistance triggered by depressing the antibiotic resistance regulator through oxidative damage to envelope proteins like nadh dehydrogenase 2 was enhanced hao et al 2014 5 3 horizontal gene transfer and recombination aside from mutation bacteria could also acquire heritable args via hgt from other organisms or intragenomic reshuffling of genomic sequences by recombination arenas et al 2018 pu et al 2021 although such mechanisms play an important role in species evolution to provide antibiotic resistance hgt are recognized as the major pathway rodríguez beltrán et al 2021 non antibiotic chemicals were verified to promote the spread of args via hgt which is attributed to various kind of bacterial stress responses albeit the enhanced mechanisms vary from different chemicals the primary bacterial responses induced by non antibiotic chemicals are the generation of reactive oxygen species ros damage on cell membrane dna or protein as well as bacterial sos response fig 3 the higher level of ros is an important factor enabling promoted the transfer frequencies of args for example sweeteners increased ros production by 1 5 fold in the recipient cell yu et al 2021 worth to note is that these elevated conjugative frequencies could be reversed by introducing ros scavenger like thiourea wang et al 2019 the excess ros would damage cell structure because hydroxyl radical cannot be eliminated by any enzymatic reaction thus reacting with various macromolecules such as nucleic acids lipids and protein in this case the cell membrane consisting of these molecules would be damaged weakening the hydrophobic lipid bilayer barrier and increasing gene transfer wang et al 2015a in addition a high level of ros could also induce bacterial sos stress response which could also serve to promote hgt of resistance genes sos response is associated with various gene expressions of dna repair and cell cycle control initial research showed that setr an integrating conjugative element encoded repressor repressed the expression of transfer activators but bacterial sos response alleviated this repression and increased the expression of transfer related gene beaber et al 2004 in addition to promoting the transfer of mges sos response also stimulates integrase expression of class 1 integrons for example the bacterial sos response result in genomic rearrangements mediated by the site specific integron integrase baharoglu et al 2010 strugeon et al 2016 current research demonstrated that non antibiotic pharmaceuticals triggered antibiotic like bacterial responses i e promoting the expression of sos response genes proteins lexa umuc umud and soxr wang et al 2021a similarly cuo nanoparticles or cu2 also caused the sos response for both donor and recipient bacteria zhang et al 2019 these genes play vital roles in dna damage in bacterial sos response specifically umuc and umud genes were reported to tolerate and repair dna damage in e coli increasing mutation rate and promoting the conjugation frequency of args at the same time zhang et al 2018b the recombination reaction is commonly associated the integrons which are assembly genetic platforms that contain exogenous open reading frames orfs as shown in fig 4 the integron structure consists of a stable functional platform ensuring the correct expression of follow up genes and an alterable cassette array cambray et al 2010 the functional platform includes three elements i e inti genes encoding the integrase atti site and a promoter pc cambray et al 2010 mazel 2006 the detailed information and process of the unique recombination reaction of integrons can be found in the references escudero josé et al 2015 here it should be highlighted that the inti1 gene expression is regulated by the sos response guerin et al 2009 in this case some chemicals other than antibiotics e g microplastics nano particles etc inducing sos response could trigger the expression of integrase gene thereby regulating the structure of cassettes however no available data are presented the role of recombination in the spread of args induced by non antibiotic factors 5 4 vertical gene transfer vgt also plays significant role in the development of antibiotic resistance in anthropogenically influenced environments fang et al 2018 li et al 2019 the antarctic uncontaminated soil sample also showed that args have been vertically inherited over generations and have a strong phylogenetic signal to form a monophyletic group this result indicated that vgt is the most likely to be the dominant pathway in the dissemination of args in pre antibiotic era van goethem et al 2018 although resistance genes and taxonomic composition significantly altered the host phyla of chromosomal arg remained consistent suggesting that vgt by organism growth is the crucial role in arg dissemination in sludge system of wastewater treatment dai et al 2022 vertical transfer ensures the retention of resistance genes within the species while the macroscopic manifestation of genetic inheritance is the change in community structure it is no doubt that the abundance of args is associated with the characteristics of microbial communities sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however it is unclear the role of selective agents in the environment transmission of args although some environment factors could stimulate the growth of specific species for most this growth influence is often limited in this case there might be a small growth differences between resistant and non resistant strains induced by non antibiotic chemicals other environment factors including temperature nutrients and environment media unrelated directly to the resistance profile are likely to be more significant for retention of resistance genes within the species 6 conclusion and perspectives args have been recognized as the novel pollutants in the aquatic environment which not only harms the microorganisms living in the aquatic eco system but also has extremely serious consequences for the treatment of bacterial infections in the human body initially scientists believed that the spread of args was mainly attributed to the misuse and abuse of antibiotics currently some researches indicated that the activity of antibiotics showed a dose dependent effect i e a dual ecological role of antibiotics the ancient function of args also does not seem to be antibiotic resistance which participates in various bacterial metabolisms this dual role of antibiotics and args raises suspicion about previous spread pathways of args because some non antibiotic chemicals that are related to the real function of args may stimulate the dissemination of args however the preconceived belief of args being the mean by which bacteria resist antibiotics has made us overlook the contribution of many non antibiotic chemicals in promoting the migration of resistance genes recent studies revealed that various types of non antibiotic chemicals could elevate the dissemination of args including heavy metals microplastics metal nanoparticles and various organic substances these non antibiotic chemicals could trigger various bacterial responses antibiotic like effects including stress and sos response and regulating gene expression these responses either increase the frequency of gene mutation or promote the transfer frequency of hgt in addition some substrates e g metals and disinfectants could also be the selective stress to args by co selection in terms of non antibiotic environmental conditions the optimal environment parameters stimulated the growth of arb thereby increasing the risk of args generally environmental conditions directly influence the microbial structure thus altering the distribution of args similarly environmental media and media characteristics including nutrition and the contents of contamination also impact the vgt of args additional electric and sound fields have the same mechanisms of the above non antibiotic substrates the molecular mechanisms involved mutation co selection horizontal gene transfer and vertical gene transfer de novo mutation is an important part of microbial acquisition of resistance genes these mutations are attributed to various mechanisms such as sos response and stress response in addition some non antibiotic chemicals can fuel mutagenesis and hgt thereby increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance these non antibiotic chemicals enhance the ros formation or inducing sos response vertical gene transfer further ensure the retention of heritable resistance genes induced by mutation or hgt within the species this review also has given rise to many questions in need of further investigation 1 albeit current researches revealed some non antibiotic chemicals could promote the spread of args more chemicals should be further tested to show whether they possess the same performance 2 stimulated ros production by non antibiotic chemicals seems to be the main reason for the promoted hgt but these results are only verified by ros quenching tests ros could change the permeability of the cell membrane and could induce bacterial sos response sos response is a crucial factor to trigger the combination reaction of integrons however there is no research focus on investigating the role of non antibiotic chemicals in the combination reaction of integrons 3 the molecular mechanism of promoted hgt in pure culture is well documented but it is recommended that future studies should focus on the population and community level effects in addition there is a lack of data on the long term impacts of these non antibiotic chemicals on the spread of args considering that these chemicals may result in an accumulative effect similar to heavy metals and antibiotics on the dissemination of args after chronic exposure investigating the long term effects of these chemicals on the actual environment including eco system and human microbiomes is a significant and urgent to estimate the risk of these chemicals to the spread of args 4 in order to understand the spread pathway of args induced by non antibiotic chemicals it is necessary to evaluate the contribution rate of these chemicals in the dissemination of args for example we could determine the discrepancy of different gene elements including intracellular chromosomes plasmids and other mges and free dna sequences outside the cell in this case scientists are able to estimate which resistance gene elements should be paid more attention to controlling the spread of args 5 vgt also plays an important role in spreading args however current investigations are mostly based on the mating assays e g filter mating flasks or plate culture based mating in this case it is difficult to distinguish the contributions between hgt and vgt therefore developing an evaluation manner is urgently to reveal the discover dynamic variations in hgt and vgt 6 as was discussed research indicated that the effects of environmental conditions on the spread of args were often contradictory albeit obtaining some rough results a large number of data is warranted to fully understand the spread pathway of args in the natural environment further work should concentrate on constructing a standard experiment method to ensure comparability and usability of different

15493,anoxic ammonium oxidation anammox is an energy efficient nitrogen removal process for wastewater treatment however the unstable nitrite supply and residual nitrate in the anammox process have limited its wide application recent studies have proven coupling of sulfur based denitrification with anammox sda can achieve an effective nitrogen removal owing to stable provision of substrate nitrite from the sulfur based denitrification thus making its process control more efficient in comparison with that of partial nitrification and anammox process meanwhile the anammox produced nitrate can be eliminated through sulfur based denitrification thereby enhancing sda s overall nitrogen removal efficiency nonetheless this process is governed by a complex microbial system that involves both complicated sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms as well as multiple interactions among sulfur oxidising bacteria and anammox bacteria a comprehensive understanding of the principles of the sda process is the key to facilitating the development and application of this novel process hence this review is conducted to systematically summarise various findings on the sda process including its associated biochemistry biokinetic reactions reactor performance and application the dominant functional bacteria and microbial interactions in the sda process are further discussed finally the advantages challenges and future research perspectives of sda are outlined overall this work gives an in depth insight into the coupling mechanism of sda and its potential application in biological nitrogen removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological nitrogen removal sulfur based denitrification partial denitrification anammox sulfur oxidising bacteria anammox bacteria data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the excess discharge of nitrogen compounds into water bodies has disrupted the nitrogen cycle and caused severe environmental issues anoxic ammonium oxidation anammox which can convert nitrite and ammonium into nitrogen gas in the absence of organics is one of the most efficient nitrogen removal processes van de graaf et al 1996 over the past two decades the combined partial nitrification and anammox pna process has been extensively investigated ali and okabe 2015 the pna process has been adopted for nitrogen removal from ammonium rich wastewater such as rejected water landfill leachate and food processing wastewater lackner et al 2014 van hulle et al 2010 nonetheless the complex microbial community and the necessity of preventing nitrite oxidation make the pna process unstable in long term operations cao et al 2017 lackner et al 2014 moreover the residual nitrate and nitrite in the pna process limit the nitrogen removal efficiency to below 89 vlaeminck et al 2012 nitrite is a common intermediate in denitrification and could be utilised by anammox compared with pna coupling heterotrophic denitrification and anammox is easier to maintain as both denitrification and anammox occur under anoxic conditions such coupled process has been successfully established by using various organics du et al 2014 sumino et al 2006 takekawa et al 2014 trukhina et al 2011 they have shown excellent total nitrogen tn removal efficiencies 93 6 96 7 for the treatment of both low and high strength nitrogen wastewaters du et al 2019 however heterotrophic denitrification is more thermodynamically feasible than anammox and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria have a higher growth rate and biomass yield than anammox bacteria kumar and lin 2010 the excessive influent organics can result in the overgrowth of heterotrophic denitrifiers i e cod n 2 5 deteriorating the nitrogen removal efficiency of this combined process du et al 2017b on the other hand reduced sulfur compounds such as s2 s0 and s2o3 2 can serve as alternative electron donors for denitrification via sulfur oxidising bacteria sob lin et al 2018 pokorna and zabranska 2015 nitrite accumulation has been frequently observed in sulfur based denitrification due to an imbalance of denitratation and denitritation rate furumai et al 1996 gadekar et al 2006 kimura et al 2002 pan et al 2018 the accumulated nitrite in the sulfur based denitrification is highly toxic to the sob thereby inhibiting or even preventing their denitrifying activities mora et al 2014 sun and nemati 2012 although a high nitrite concentration is toxic to sob in sulfur based denitrification nitrite could be the potential substrate for anammox bacteria sob are autotrophic and their growth rate and biomass yield are comparable with those of anammox bacteria ali et al 2015 mora et al 2014 the coculture of sob and anammox bacteria can be stably maintained because the risk of sob overgrowth is relatively low thus nitrogen removal can be better achieved through coupling sulfur based denitrification with anammox sda process zhang et al 2020b sda occurs in nature and plays a crucial role in the global nitrogen and sulfur cycles canfield et al 2010 however its application in environmental engineering is still limited li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 2020b the sda process has the potential to extend the application of anammox based microbial biotechnology it can simultaneously remove nitrate and ammonium from wastewater in a one stage system kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 in addition residual nitrate and nitrite from anammox process can be eliminated through sulfur based denitrification which improves the nitrogen removal efficiency dasgupta et al 2017 guo et al 2016 however the sda process is a complex biosystem owing to the following characteristics 1 a variety of components e g s2 s0 s2o3 2 s4o6 2 so3 2 so4 2 nh4 n2 no2 and no3 are transformed 2 sulfur metabolism is highly diversified because of the presence of different oxidative enzymes and metabolic pathways in sob and 3 complicated interactions occur between sob and anammox bacteria to elucidate the coupling mechanism of sda and facilitate its development and application this paper therefore comprehensively reviews the principle and current development of the sda process that have not been included in previous literature specifically performance biokinetics coupling mechanism metabolic interactions potential applications advantages challenges and future research of the sda process were summarized 2 biochemistry and natural occurrence of the sda process 2 1 sulfur based denitrification sulfur based denitrification is conducted by sob which can grow chemolithotrophically on reduced sulfur compounds with nitrogen oxides e g nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors sob are highly diversified in taxonomy while the majority of sob organisms belong to the phylum proteobacteria dahl 2017 sob are mainly distributed in four classes α proteobacteria e g paracoccus β proteobacteria e g thiobacillus γ proteobacteria e g thioalkalivibrio and ε proteobacteria e g sulfurimonas these microorganisms are widely distributed in natural habitats and artificial environments and most of them are mesophilic and neutrophilic shao et al 2010 syed et al 2006 sulfur based denitrification considerably contributes to the oxidative side of the sulfur cycle in which reduced sulfur compounds are oxidised to elemental sulfur or sulfate in anoxic water lens and kuenen 2001 inorganic sulfur compounds have various oxidation states ranging from 2 i e sulfide and reduced organic sulfur to 6 i e sulfate sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is more complicated than heterotrophic denitrification because sulfur transformation is associated with a variety of redox enzymes metabolic pathways and mechanisms dahl and friedrich 2008 thiosulfate is a common substrate for sob and thiosulfate oxidation is the central pathway in biochemical sulfur oxidation the oxidations of sulfide elemental sulfur tetrathionate and sulfite are linked to thiosulfate oxidation there are at least three pathways through which sob oxidise thiosulfate sulfur oxidation sox pathway tetrathionate intermediate s4i pathway and branched thiosulfate oxidation bto pathway as shown in fig 1 ghosh and dam 2009 lens and pol 2000 and the bioreactions related enzymes and genes are presented in table 1 the first pathway is established in paracoccus pantotrophus where two sulfur atoms in thiosulfate are directly oxidised to sulfate without releasing any sulfur related intermediates via the sox pathway and 8 molecules of cytochrome are reduced simultaneously friedrich et al 2001 other sulfur species such as sulfide elemental sulfur and sulfite can also be fed into the sox pathway the multienzyme complex in the sox pathway are periplasmic proteins composed of soxxa soxyz soxb and soxcd and the putatively conserved operon has been identified by genetic studies friedrich et al 2005 the second pathway was established in thermithiobacillus tepidarius acidithiobacillus caldus and tetrathiobacter kashmirensis where thiosulfate is oxidised to sulfate via the s4i pathway dam et al 2007 ghosh and dam 2009 the thiosulfate is firstly oxidized to tetrathionate in periplasm and then tetrathionate is oxidized to sulfite and sulfate in cytoplasm or in close vicinity of the inside of the cell membrane however to date the proposed enzymatic reactions associated with the s4i pathway remain postulations and the genomic basis of the pathway has only been minimally verified the third pathway was established in thiobacillus denitrificans thiocapsa roseopersicina and thiothrix dahl and prange 2006 thiosulfate is initially transformed into sulfate and elemental sulfur and the elemental sulfur is reduced to sulfide level and finally sulfide is oxidised to sulfite and sulfate either by sulfite acceptor oxidoreductase saor or aps reductase apr and atp sulfate adenylyl transferase atp sulfurylase dahl and friedrich 2008 it should be noted that more than one sulfur oxidation pathway are proposed even within a specie because the variation of environmental conditions could lead to an induction of related sulfur oxidising gene transcription beller et al 2006 electrons released during sulfur oxidation are delivered by electron transfer chains to reduce nitrogen oxides nitrate reduction in sulfur based denitrification is a four step reaction rittmann and mccarty 2001 1 nitrate reduction to nitrite by nitrate reductase 2 nitrite reduction to nitric oxide by nitrite reductase 3 nitric oxide reduction to nitrous oxide by nitric oxide reductases and 4 nitrous oxide reduction to nitrogen gas by nitrous oxide reductase nitrate reduction is mediated by membrane bound nitrate reductase in the cytoplasm while the other three denitrification steps occur in the periplasm or periplasmic boundaries zumft 1997 2 2 anammox anammox is regarded as one of the major sinks of inorganic nitrogen in freshwater and marine ecosystems oshiki et al 2016 anammox bacteria are present in different natural environments such as soil groundwater wastewater treatment plants wwtps lakes estuaries continental shelves in the marine system hot springs and deep sea hydrothermal vents kartal et al 2013 anammox bacteria are slow growing microorganisms kartal et al 2012 belonging to the planctomycetales phylum and are composed of six genera among them ca kuenenia ca brocadia ca anammoxoglobus and ca jettenia have been detected in wastewater treatment facilities kartal et al 2013 khramenkov et al 2013 while ca scalindua and ca anammoximicrobium have been detected in marine environments and river silt kuypers et al 2005 li et al 2018 in the anammox process ammonium and nitrite are converted into nitrogen gas with nitric oxide no and hydrazine n2h4 as intermediates kartal et al 2011 the nitrogen transformation in the anammox process comprises three consecutive redox bioreactions nitrite is first reduced to nitric oxide by nitrite reductase nir then ammonium and nitric oxide are converted into hydrazine by hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine is finally transformed into nitrogen gas the enzymes catalysing these three bioreactions are located in the anammoxosome an intracytoplasmic compartment in anammox bacteria bounded mostly by dense ladderane lipids de almeida et al 2015 these ladderanes are less permeable than common cell membranes protecting the other cellular components from highly toxic intermediates i e no n2h4 van niftrik et al 2004 in the anammox process nitrite accepts electrons to oxidise ammonium but it is also oxidised to nitrate as it donates electrons for carbon fixation kartal et al 2011 2 3 natural occurrence of the sda process anammox plays a significant role in releasing fixed nitrogen in oxygen minimum zones omzs in the marine ecosystem dalsgaard et al 2005 kuypers et al 2005 omzs in aquatic environments are vital for global nitrogen sulfur and carbon cycles in particular omzs in the marine system account for 30 50 of the global nitrogen loss codispoti et al 2001 gruber and sarmiento 1997 over 67 of the nitrite used by anammox in omzs is from nitrate reduction while less than 33 is from aerobic ammonium oxidation lam et al 2009 the nitrogen cycle in omzs is described in fig 2 in the upper part of the omzs aerobic ammonium oxidation via aob ammonia oxidising archaea aoa and complete ammonia oxidising comammox bacteria provide anammox with nitrite for nitrogen removal in the lower part nitrate reduction provides anammox with nitrite lam et al 2009 van kessel et al 2015 the electrons for denitrification generally originate from organics and reduced sulfur compounds sulfide is a necessary reductant produced by the sulfate reduction process in anoxic water sulfate reduction accounts for over 50 of organic carbon mineralisation in marine sediments and sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation contribute to energy flux and elemental cycling in omzs canfield et al 2010 wenk et al 2013 examined potential electron donors i e glucose acetate mn ii fe ii and sulfide for denitrification in the omzs finding that sulfide rather than organics was the electron donor for denitrification sda occurs in the lower part of omzs where anammox is dependent on the nitrite released as an intermediate in sulfide based denitrification through the isotope pairing technique hamersley et al 2007 proved that anammox instead of denitrification was mainly responsible for nitrogen loss in the peruvian omz waters similarly the anammox was the predominant pathway for sinking fixed nitrogen in the black sea and heterotrophic denitrification was not detected jensen et al 2008 moreover the sulfide oxidation was strongly related to nitrate reduction to nitrite in omzs and that anammox was the dominant pathway for fixed nitrogen removal 0 43 0 29 nmol l h considerably outpacing sulfide based denitrification 0 042 0 079 nmol l h therefore sda was critical for removing fixed nitrogen from omzs canfield et al 2010 the above findings were also reported in a meromictic south alpine lake and an east african great lake roland et al 2018 wenk et al 2013 3 biokinetics and mechanism of sda

configurations and operational strategies have been explored table 2 here we firstly discussed factors resulting in nitrite accumulation in sulfur based denitrification i e s2 scn s0 and s2o3 2 then the reactor performance biokinetics and coupling mechanisms of sda process are reviewed 3 1 sulfide based denitrification and anammox process sulfide is the main product of sulfate respiration by sulfate reducing organisms under anaerobic conditions delgado vela et al 2015 pokorna and zabranska 2015 in which sulfate or other oxidised sulfur compounds are terminal electron acceptors and hydrogen ethanol propionate and lactate are electron donors tang et al 2009 the produced sulfide is an efficient electron donor for denitrification the sulfide based denitrification comprises four bioreactions as shown in eqs 1 4 reyes avila et al 2004 xu et al 2016 the sulfide is initially oxidised to biologically produced elemental sulfur bps0 which is further oxidised to sulfate stable nitrite accumulation in sulfide based denitrification is a prerequisite for the implementation of the sulfide based denitrification and anammox s2 sda process however studies have reported contradicting findings on nitrite accumulation in sulfide based denitrification the nitrite accumulation was detected in both two steps with sulfide and bps0 as electron donors gadekar et al 2006 in contrast other studies did not detect nitrite accumulation in the presence of sulfide cui et al 2019b xu et al 2016 and authors found that bps0 was used as an electron donor after sulfide depletion and nitrite was remarkably accumulated in the reactor 1 no 3 s 2 2 h s 0 no 2 h 2 o 2 no 2 1 5 s 2 4 h 1 5 s 0 0 5 n 2 2 h 2 o 3 s 0 3 no 3 h 2 o so 4 2 3 no 2 2 h 4 s 0 2 no 2 so 4 2 n 2 several studies have investigated s2 sda for the simultaneous removal of nitrate ammonium and sulfide from wastewater the s n ratio of the influent is a crucial parameter that affects the final sulfide oxidation product and contributions of denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal the coexistence of sulfide based denitrification and anammox was first observed in a fluidised bed reactor and 32 160 mgs l of sulfide could enhance anammox activity van de graaf et al 1996 the s2 sda was applied to treat high strength nitrogenous and sulfide bearing wastewater and the reactor achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 90 after a long start up period table 2 kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 influent nox nh4 and s n ratios higher than 1 2 gn gn and 0 57 gs gn respectively were the optimal operating conditions for the s2 sda process however as the s2 sda reactor consumed about 30 organics heterotrophic denitrification may also be responsible for nitrogen removal russ et al 2014 implemented sulfide based denitrification and then inoculated anammox biomass into the reactor to start up s2 sda the experimental results showed that sulfide based denitrification supplied nitrite for anammox and the anammox process accounted for 65 75 of nitrogen removal the s2 sda was the above mentioned studies have focused on implementing s2 sda for the simultaneous removal of nitrate ammonium and sulfide additionally sulfide based denitrification can be introduced into the anammox reactor to eliminate anammox produced nitrate under an influent nh4 no2 s2 mass ratio of 1 74 2 2 1 gn gn gs the nitrogen removal efficiency of the reactor was stable and bps0 was formed and retained in the uasb reactor guo et al 2016 the pna process under mainstream conditions was initially started up with an effluent nitrate concentration of 22 mgn l yuan et al 2020 after introducing sulfide based denitrification into this pna reactor with sulfide concentration below 40 0 mgs l the effluent nitrate concentration considerably decreased to 5 mgn l under mainstream conditions although anammox could be the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in s2 sda the coupled process has two different mechanisms it was reported that sulfur based denitrification in the s2 sda was a two step process under nitrate limiting conditions liu et al 2015 nitrate was firstly reduced to nitrite combined sulfide oxidation to bps0 then most of produced nitrite was utilized by anammox and a small portion of nitrite was slowly reduced to nitrogen gas combined bps0 oxidation to sulfate the nitrogen removal pathway of the s2 sda process under nitrate limiting conditions is shown in fig 3 a the authors suggested that excess sulfide was required to produce nitrite for feeding anammox in contrast the kinetics of the s2 sda process was investigated under sulfide limiting conditions and results showed that no nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction with sulfide as the electron donor deng et al 2021b nitrite accumulation occurred when the formed bps0 was used as the electron donor for nitrate reduction in this period the produced nitrite was available for anammox which became the dominant nitrogen removal pathway the nitrogen removal mechanism of the s2 sda process under sulfide limiting conditions is depicted in fig 3b 3 2 thiocyanate based denitrification and anammox process thiocyanate nc s is one of the major contaminants in industrial wastewater for coal gasification and it is widely used in insecticide and herbicide manufacturing mining electroplating and chemical synthesis the conventional activated sludge process is usually used for thiocyanate removal thiocyanate is a relatively chemically stable compound and its degradation requires enzymatic catalysis by a limited number of sob e g thiobacillus denitrificans thiobacillus thioparus and thialkalivibrio thiocyanodenitrificans kelly and wood 2000 sorokin et al 2004 thiocyanate can also be used as a nitrogen source by some heterotrophic bacteria bezsudnova et al 2007 thiocyanate is degraded via the carbonyl sulfide cos or cyanate cno pathway bezsudnova et al 2007 ebbs 2004 h2s is formed as an intermediate

denitrification in a sequencing batch reactor sbr could stably produce ammonium 200 mgn l and nitrite 110 mgn l pan et al 2018 the influent no3 n scn n ratio considerably influenced the nitrite accumulation ratio in the reactor with an increase in the no3 n scn n ratio from 1 0 to 3 0 gn gn the nitrite accumulation ratio increased from 44 6 to 86 1 furthermore at an influent no3 n scn n ratio of 1 5 gn gn the ratio of produced nitrite to ammonium was 1 1 which is close to that of the substrate of the anammox process to the best of our knowledge there is no report on anammox using nitrite from thiocyanate based denitrification however the thiocyanate based denitrification and anammox scn sda process was established in a batch test pan et al 2019 in which autotrophic denitrifying biomass 38 of the thiobacillus was mixed with anammox biomass 14 4 ca kuenenia in this combined process the reactor was provided with sufficient nitrite a part of nitrite reacted with scn to produce nh4 by sob and then the residual nitrite and produced nh4 were converted into nitrogen gas by anammox bacteria the coupled system achieved a tn removal efficiency of 98 with the nitrite to thiocyanate ratio of 3 g no2 n g scn n the overall reaction is described in eq 11 and the proposed mechanism is illustrated in fig 4 a a kinetic model to describe the removal of thiocyanate and nitrite in the scn sda process pan et al 2019 the model contained three processes 1 thiocyanate reacts with nitrite to produce nitrogen gas ammonium and sulfate 2 thiocyanate reacts with nitrate to generate nitrogen gas ammonium and sulfate 3 nitrite reacts with ammonium to produce nitrogen gas and nitrate after model calibration the effects of the nh4 scn ratio and the biomass concentration of anammox bacteria and sob on nitrogen removal efficiency were estimated this developed model was further improved to describe sulfur transformations chen et al 2019b such that thiocyanate oxidation to sulfate involved two steps with elemental sulfur as an intermediate fig 4b however the developed model did not consider the potential inhibitory effect of thiocyanate on anammox 11 3 s c n 11 n o 2 8

mineral or an industrial byproduct e g petroleum industries syed et al 2006 tang et al 2009 as an effective and economical electron donor for denitrification elemental sulfur is widely used for treating nitrate contaminated water including drinking water secondary wastewater effluent and industrial wastewater zhu and getting 2012 elemental sulfur based denitrification is a two step process with nitrite as an intermediate as shown in eqs 3 and 4 with the overloading of nitrogen nitrite reduction became the rate limiting step that resulted in nitrite accumulation sahinkaya et al 2011 vidal et al 2002 the nitrite formed in elemental sulfur based denitrification inhibits denitrification owing to the toxicity of free nitrous acid cui et al 2019b sun and nemati 2012 the ph condition is another factor that influences nitrite accumulation during elemental sulfur based denitrification the optimum ph for nitrite and nitrate reduction was 7 0 and 8 5 respectively and that sulfur based denitrification under controlled ph resulted in the accumulation of over 95 of nitrite chen et al 2019a the elemental sulfur based denitrification and anammox s0 sda was applied to treat nitrate and ammonium containing wastewaters and achieved a tn removal efficiency of 98 li et al 2019 the experimental results revealed that the tn removal rate reached 4 1 kgn m3 d of which anammox and sulfur based denitrification accounted for 3 1 and 1 0 kgn m3 d respectively moreover elemental sulfur based denitrification can remove nitrate and nitrite from anammox process to enhance nitrogen removal efficiency a separated elemental sulfur packed bed reactor was used to polish the effluent from a pna reactor dasgupta et al 2017 in the integrated system 99 of the nitrate was removed through elemental sulfur based denitrification and an overall tn removal efficiency of 97 was achieved with a nitrogen removal rate of 0 6 kgn m3 d similarly wang et al 2019 used a separated elemental sulfur granule supported reactor for polishing the effluent from an anammox reactor and achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 99 the elemental sulfur based denitrification was also applied to remove nox i e 45 mg no2 n l and 145 no3 n l produced from pna treating mature landfill leachate and achieved a nox removal efficiency of 96 6 in the denitrification reactor zeng et al 2021 the polishing anammox effluent by elemental sulfur based denitrification can be conducted in anammox reactor the autotrophic denitrification biomass was inoculated into an anammox reactor and elemental sulfur was supplied as the electron donor to remove anammox produced nitrate chen et al 2019a the tn removal efficiency was stabilised at over 95 with an effluent nitrate concentration below 10 mgn l as elemental sulfur preferentially reacts with nitrate the combined process can mitigate the competition between denitrification and anammox for nitrite in the combined system sob was mainly responsible for reducing nitrate to nitrite the result slightly differed from those of separate polishing reactors in which anammox produced nitrate was completely reduced to nitrogen gas in the separated reactor dasgupta et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 the elemental sulfur based denitrification was introduced into a pna reactor and achieved a tn removal efficiency of 98 with an influent ammonium concentration of 600 mgn l zhang et al 2020a the nitrite uptake rate of anammox was 34 5 times higher than that in elemental sulfur based denitrification indicating that sob only reduced nitrate to nitrite in the s0 sda process this novel process not only simplifies the coupled system but also saves 60 of elemental sulfur compared with systems with a separate polishing process 3 4 thiosulfate based denitrification and anammox process thiosulfate is generally discharged from several industries including the petrochemical pharmaceutical and mining industries owing to its nontoxicity and ready bioavailability thiosulfate is also used as an external electron donor for denitrification cui et al 2019a di capua et al 2019 thiosulfate based denitrification is a two step process with nitrite as an intermediate mora et al 2014 as shown in eqs 12 and 13 12 s 2 o 3 2 4 n o 3 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 4 n o 2 2 h 13 s 2 o 3 2 1 6 n o 2 0 2 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 0 8 n 2 0 4 h thiosulfate based denitrification is an efficient and stable biological nitrogen removal process however nitrite accumulation has been observed under unfavourable conditions the nitrite was formed in a thiosulfate based denitrification system with ph below 7 4 because nitrite reduction was severely inhibited at low ph conditions while nitrate reduction was less impacted furumai et al 1996 it was reported that a lower nitrite reduction rate than nitrate reduction rate caused nitrite accumulation in thiosulfate based denitrification and the formed nitrite was retained in the reactor with insufficient thiosulfate campos et al 2008 nitrite accumulation in the thiosulfate based denitrification system is influenced by the initial nitrate concentration and the denitrifying bacterial population mora et al 2014 deng et al 2019 started up a thiosulfate based denitrification and anammox s2o3 2 sda process in a uasb reactor the tn removal efficiency and removal rate reached 82 5 and 0 33 kg n m³ d respectively and anammox accounted for 90 of nitrogen removal then a kinetic model was developed to evaluate the s2o3 2 sda system deng et al 2021a and the nitrogen removal pathway is shown in fig 5 the modelling results and metagenomic analysis demonstrated that bps0 is an important intermediate in thiosulfate oxidation this finding differs from those of previous experimental studies in which thiosulfate was found to be directly oxidised to sulfate mora et al 2014 yang et al 2020 also implemented the s2o3 2 sda process in a single system achieving a maximum tn removal efficiency of 99 4 moreover the authors found that the bps0 produced from thiosulfate oxidation could be an efficient electron buffer for denitrification in addition the authors proposed that in the s2o3 2 sda system sob provided anammox bacteria with not only nitrite but also nitric oxide however this proposition should be experimentally verified through nitric oxide dynamics analysis the s2o3 2 sda process was used to remove high strength nitrogen from wastewater lin et al 2022 a considerable amount of bps0 was formed in the reactor and bps0 on the granular surface could protect the anammox in the core from the inhibitory effects of free ammonia free nitrous acid and dissolved oxygen furthermore introducing thiosulfate based denitrification into an anammox system can eliminate nitrate and nitrite the s2o3 2 sda system was established in a uasb reactor fed with nitrite ammonium and thiosulfate qian et al 2018 the s2o3 2 sda process was implemented to treat the effluent containing nitrate nitrite and ammonium from a partial nitrification process and achieved a tn removal efficiency of 98 1 sun et al 2018 4 application and stoichiometry of the sda process the sda process has two potential applications for nitrogen removal from wastewater in nitrate and ammonium containing wastewater treatment the nitrate is first reduced to nitrite through sulfur based denitrification and then the produced nitrite is utilised by anammox to oxidise ammonium in the treatment of high strength ammonium wastewater sda can enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox and the anammox produced nitrate is eliminated through sulfur based denitrification 4 1 treatment of nitrate and ammonium containing wastewater industrial wastewaters containing nitrate and ammonium are produced in the mining milling fertiliser and semiconductor industries deng et al 2019 li et al 2022 the two stage nitrification denitrification process is generally applied to treat such wastewaters which requires external organics hirata et al 2001 shivaraman et al 2001 zaitsev et al 2008 sda is a more efficient and economical approach for treating nitrate and ammonium containing wastewaters the operational cost of the sda process is remarkably lower than that of nitrification denitrification because of the following 1 reduced sulfur compounds e g s2 s0 and s2o3 2 are much cheaper than organic matter e g ch3oh 2 oxygen is not required in sda 3 nitrate and ammonium can be removed using a single reactor 4 the low biomass yields and growth rates of sob and anammox bacteria considerably reduce sludge production sda also has potential application in nitrogen removal from sewage anammox implementation in mainstream sewage treatment allows for the decoupling of carbon and nitrogen removal resulting in energy neutral or positive wwtps jetten et al 1997 siegrist et al 2008 nonetheless sewage is characterised by low temperature and low nitrogen concentration and the lack of a stable nitrite source from pn is the bottleneck limiting the mainstream application of anammox cao et al 2017 partial denitrification could stably supply anammox with nitrite under low temperature and nitrogen concentration conditions du et al 2017a the sda system can be operated in a one stage reactor as shown in fig 6 a to evaluate the interactions between denitrification and anammox and their effects on nitrogen removal pathways and electron donor consumption the stoichiometry of the coupled process was further analysed in this study based on the stoichiometries of anammox and denitrification lotti et al 2014 rittmann and mccarty 2001 nitrogen gas production via denitrification and anammox are described in eqs 14 and 15 respectively the electrons e in the equation are assumed to originate from the reduced sulfur compounds γ ranging from 0 to 1 denotes the proportion of nitrite from nitrate reduction used by anammox 1 γ equals the proportion of nitrite reduced to nitrogen gas used by sob γ indicates the cooperation between sob and anammox bacteria where a high value indicates effective cooperation this parameter is vital in the stoichiometry of the sda process 14 1 γ no 3 1 γ 5 e 6 1 γ h 0 5 1 γ n 2 3 1 γ h 2 o 15 0 873 γ nh 4 0 860 γ no 3 0 062 γ hco 3 2 05 γ h 2 γ e 0 86 γ n 2 0 0062 γ c h 1 74 o 0 31 n 0 20 2 747 γ h 2 o in the absence of anammox in the reactor γ 0 nitrite produced from nitrate reduction is entirely reduced to nitrogen gas through denitrification fig 6b and the removal of 1 mol of tn requires 5 mol of electrons fig 6c in this case nitrogen removal is entirely due to denitrification and ammonium is not consumed consequently the ratio of consumed ammonium to nitrate is 0 with increasing γ the contribution of anammox to tn removal increases whereas that of denitrification to tn removal decreases with increasing γ the electron consumption per mol of removed nitrogen diminishes while the ratio of removed ammonium to nitrate increases when the nitrite from nitrate reduction is fully utilised by anammox γ 1 only anammox contributes to nitrogen removal and the ratio of removed ammonium to nitrate increases to 1 0 in addition the electron consumption associated with the removal of 1 mol of tn remarkably decreases by 77 1 16 mol e removed tn in previous studies the γ value for the combined system generally varied from 0 65 to 0 9 deng et al 2019 li et al 2019 russ et al 2014 therefore the sda process can simultaneously remove nitrate and ammonium nh4 no3 1 0 from wastewater and save electron donors compared with complete denitrification 4 2 treatment of high strength ammonium wastewater in practical applications the maximum nitrogen removal efficiency of the anammox system is normally less than 89 owing to nitrite nitrate accumulation vlaeminck et al 2012 for industrial wastewater treatment the anammox reactor effluent is transferred to wwtps or polished by additional units such as nitrification denitrification desloover et al 2011 tokutomi et al 2011 integrating sulfur based denitrification into the anammox system can improve the nitrogen removal efficiency by eliminating the nitrate intrinsically produced by anammox in the coupled process the pn effluent is supplied to the sda reactor fig 7 a moreover pn and sda can be performed in a single reactor yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a nitrogen removal pathways via denitrification and anammox in the combined system are described in eqs 16 and 17 where γ denotes the percentage of nitrite from nitrate reduction utilised by anammox and 1 γ denotes the percentage of nitrite reduced to nitrogen gas during denitrification 16 0 161 1 γ no 3 0 805 1 γ e 0 966 γ h 0 0805 1 γ n 2 0 483 1 γ h 2 o 17 nh 4 1 146 0 161 γ no 2 0 071 hco 3 0 057 0 322 γ h 0 322 γ e 0 986 n 2

removed tn is 0 38 mol e mol tn the contributions of anammox and denitrification to tn removal are 92 5 and 7 5 respectively and the ratio of consumed ammonium to nitrite is 0 87 such denitrification anammox interaction occurs in separate polishing systems dasgupta et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 with increasing γ anammox contribution to tn removal slightly increases but the contribution of denitrification decreases moreover electron consumption per mol of removed nitrogen declines while the ratio of removed ammonium to removed nitrite slightly increases when the produced nitrate by anammox is only reduced to nitrite γ 1 by denitrification the ratio of electron consumption to nitrate consumption decreases by 58 0 16 mol e mol n thus only anammox contributes to nitrogen removal and the ratio of consumed ammonium to nitrite increases to 1 0 5 microorganisms and metabolic interactions in the sda process anammox bacteria have different niches owing to the physiological properties of individual species or groups of species zhang and okabe 2020 anammox bacteria populations have been observed to vary with environmental conditions e g temperature salinity and substrate concentration three anammox genera have generally been identified in the sda system namely ca brocadia ca kuenenia and ca jettenia and the relative abundance of anammox bacteria varies considerably among reactors table 2 the maximum growth rate and half saturation constants are two important kinetic parameters for anammox bacteria growth oshiki et al 2016 which can be used in the monod model to assess the bacteria growth behaviour and microbial dynamics ca kuenenia exhibited a higher nitrite affinity 3 μm than ca brocadia 34 μm and ca jettenia 35 6 μm in contrast ca brocadia exhibited a higher maximum growth rate 0 34 d than ca kuenenia 0 23 d and ca jettenia 0 18 d oshiki et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 therefore ca brocadia and ca kuenenia are considered r and k strategists respectively the impact of ammonium limitation on anammox bacteria growth in the sda system is not considered here owing to the presence of abundant ammonium however nitrite availability is a more important factor that impacts the abundance and biodiversity of anammox bacteria in the combined system in the treatment of nitrate and ammonium containing wastewaters via sda anammox bacteria rely on sob for nitrite thus the sda system is operated under nitrite limiting conditions studies have found that the dominant anammox bacteria in the combined system was ca kuenenia deng et al 2021b lin et al 2022 qin et al 2019 russ et al 2014 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 these findings are consistent with the physiological characteristics of ca kuenenia which has a high affinity for nitrite in applying sda for treating high strength ammonium wastewater the reactor is fed with nitrite and ammonium in studies in which the reactor was operated in a nitrite rich environment the dominant genus of anammox was ca brocadia chen et al 2019a guo et al 2016 sun et al 2018 yan et al 2020 this indicates that ca brocadia is more likely to outcompete other anammox bacteria genera in the sda process owing to its higher growth rate in the nitrite rich reactor nitrite availability is a possible primary factor in determining the genera of anammox bacteria in the sda system currently enriched anammox culture is commonly used as an inoculum for establishing the sda process therefore selecting the appropriate seeding sludge could be beneficial for the fast start up of the sda process the genus thiobacillus has been identified as the dominant sob in most sda systems table 2 thiobacillus bacteria can grow under various environmental stress conditions such as oxygen deficiency and acidic conditions the genus thiobacillus comprises thiobacillus aquaesulis thiobacillus denitrificans and thiobacillus thioparus which belongs to a subclass of β proteobacteria kelly and wood 2000 both thiobacillus aquaesulis and thiobacillus denitrificans are facultative anaerobes that can use nitrate nitrite and oxygen as electron acceptors with thiosulfate tetrathionate thiocyanate sulfide and elemental sulfur as electron donors kelly and wood 2000 thiobacillus thioparus can reduce nitrate only to nitrite kelly et al 2006 the physiology of thiobacillus denitrificans the representative of thiobacillus sp is shown in table 3 the optimal conditions for thiobacillus are neutrophilic and mesophilic environments consistent with the sda system sulfurimonas is the second most abundant sob in the sda system the majority of sulfurimonas can oxidise sulfide elemental sulfur thiosulfate and sulfite all of the sulfurimonas species can use nitrate as the electron acceptor however only sulfurimonas denitrificans and sulfurimonas gotlandica can use nitrite as electron acceptors han and perner 2015 the optimal temperature and ph of sulfurimonas are slightly lower than that of thiobacillus denitrificans table 3 the proposed metabolic interactions between sob and anammox bacteria in the sda system are shown in fig 8 the sob produced nitrite is an essential substrate for anammox bacteria and anammox bacteria produced nitrate is an efficient electron acceptor for sob both thiobacillus and sulfurimonas can perform complete denitrification sulfurimonas has complete sox related enzymes and it can oxidise sulfide or thiosulfate without elemental sulfur accumulation however thiobacillus is deficient in soxcd which could be the reason for elemental sulfur accumulation in the sda system deng et al 2019 lin et al 2022 the relative abundances of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas in the sda process considerably influence sulfur metabolism nitrogen removal performance and the process dynamics therefore the effects of environmental factors on the abundance of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas in the sda system need to be further explored sob and anammox bacteria can grow chemolithotrophically on reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds respectively and they use carbon dioxide as the carbon source moreover sob and anammox bacteria use different metabolic pathways for co2 fixation i e calvin cycle reverse tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and the wood ljungdahl pathway hernandez et al 1996 sievert et al 2008 strous et al 2006 6 advantages of the sda process the application of sda for nitrogen removal from wastewater has several advantages first the combined system can alleviate the inhibitory effects of reduced sulfur compounds i e s2 and scn on anammox sulfide is a well known inhibitor of various microorganisms including anammox bacteria dapena mora et al 2007 studies have reported a half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of total dissolved sulfide for anammox was 5 0 9 6 mgs l dapena mora et al 2007 wu et al 2016 russ et al 2014 found that sulfide could inhibit anammox biomass over a long period by inducing cell lysis and the ic50 was as low as 0 32 mgs l however the mechanism of sulfide toxicity to anammox biomass remains unclear the authors attributed the high sensitivity of anammox to sulfide to the inhibitory effect of sulfide on heme containing proteins such as nitrite reductase and hydrazine dehydrogenase these heme proteins are crucial in the biochemical reactions of anammox metabolism kartal and keltjens 2016 h2s can ligate to ferric heme in globins eq 18 and even reduce the iron centre producing ferrous heme and hydrogen persulfide as shown in eq 19 kabil and banerjee 2010 18 heme fe iii h 2 s heme fe iii h 2 s 19 fe iii h 2 s h 2 s heme fe ii hs sh 2 h e sulfide has strong inhibitory effects on anammox activity nonetheless anammox bacteria have been found to survive in reactors with a continuous influx of sulfide and they even dominated the nitrogen removal pathway in the sda system deng et al 2021b kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 liu et al 2015 qin et al 2019 russ et al 2014 these results indicate that sulfide toxicity to anammox bacteria can be mitigated in the s2 sda process sulfide can be detoxified by sob russ et al 2014 which creates a suitable environment for anammox bacteria deng et al 2021b further investigated the reaction kinetics of the s2 sda system in a fed batch test and observed that the sulfide level in the s2 sda reactor was below the detection limit moreover anammox accounted for 87 2 of nitrogen removal and nitrate reduction to nitrite was the rate limiting step in nitrogen removal the mechanism of thiocyanate toxicity to anammox is not fully clear but it was probably related to the inhibition of adenosine triphosphatase mg2 atpases in anammox bacteria it was reported that the thiocyanate has inhibitory effects on mg2 atpases thus inhibiting the metabolic processes in cells douglas gould et al 2012 katz and epstein 1971 chen et al 2017 determined the ic50 of thiocyanate for anammox as 127 mgn l in a batch test the inhibitory effects of thiocyanate on anammox were enhanced in the continuous reactor where the anammox activity decreased by 43 at a thiocyanate concentration of 26 8 mgn l however pan et al 2019 implemented the scn sda process using an initial thiocyanate concentration of 57 mgs l and the tn removal efficiency reached 98 indicating that thiocyanate inhibition of anammox can be mitigated in the scn sda process second the sda process enables the elimination of toxic sulfur compounds i e s2 and scn from wastewater and simplifies wastewater treatment although sulfide could cause problems in wastewater treatment owing to its toxicity malodour and corrosive effect s2 sda could convert sulfide into nontoxic substances i e bps0 and sulfate sulfide is present in the industrial wastewater from petrochemical plants tanneries and coal gasification plants lens et al 1998 the s2 sda process can be applied for nitrogen removal from industrial wastewater without an external sulfur source in addition the sewer and effluent of anaerobic sewage treatment contain sulfide delgado vela et al 2015 wang et al 2009 zan et al 2021 which allows for the application of s2 sda for mainstream nitrogen removal furthermore bps0 is an intermediate of sulfide oxidation liu et al 2015 russ et al 2014 which is nontoxic noncorrosive and contains a high sulfur concentration could be recovered as a mineral source in s2 sda the recovered bps can be used as industrial raw material and it is an efficient donor for denitrification di capua et al 2016 bps can also be used to produce sulfide for heavy metal removal wang et al 2022 bps0 accumulation has been observed in s2 sda guo et al 2016 qin et al 2019 and liu et al 2015 found that over 99 of sulfide was converted into bps0 and retained in the reactor the general reaction for treating thiocyanate containing wastewater is described in eq 20 hung and pavlostathis 1997 the nitrogen in thiocyanate is converted into ammonium which cannot be removed during thiocyanate degradation the scn sda process can degrade thiocyanate and the produced ammonium can further be oxidised by anammox representing an economical and efficient treatment process 20 s c n 2 o 2 3 h 2 o h c o 3 s o 4 2 n h 4 h third the sda system is robust and the process control is simple the nitrite in the sulfur based denitrification stably accumulates under sulfur limiting conditions sulfur based denitrification preferentially uses nitrate instead of nitrite as the electron acceptor moreover anammox outcompetes sulfur based denitrification in nitrite consumption for example studies have found that with elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as the electron donor the nitrite uptake rates of anammox were 1 8 34 5 times that of sulfur based denitrification deng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a thus anammox can cooperate with sulfur based denitrification for effective nitrogen removal in an sda system the growth rate and biomass yield of sob are comparable to those of anammox bacteria and the overgrowth risk of sob in the sda system can be considerably reduced in addition both anammox and sulfur based denitrification occur under anoxic conditions and the process control of sda is more efficient in contrast pna should be conducted under limited oxygen conditions to maintain a delicate balance between ammonium oxidising bacteria and anammox bacteria moreover anammox could partially compensate for alkalinity consumption for elemental sulfur based denitrification insufficient alkalinity deteriorates the performance of elemental sulfur based denitrification and the nitrogen removal performance is severely inhibited under ph conditions lower than 5 5 liu and koenig 2002 to control ph in the sulfur based denitrification reactor limestone was added or heterotrophic denitrification was introduced into the reactor liu et al 2009 the anammox reaction consumes 0 057 mol of protons per mol of ammonium removed lotti et al 2014 which could increase the buffering capacity of the sda system sda is an economical and energy efficient biological process in sda nitrate is reduced to nitrite and electron donor consumption is 60 less than that of denitrification the sda process can be applied for treating wastewater containing ammonium and sulfide thiocyanate for wastewater containing a limited amount of reduced sulfur compounds external reduced sulfur compounds i e thiosulfate and elemental sulfur can be introduced into the sda process thiosulfate is nontoxic and readily bioavailable for sob and it is an efficient external sulfur source in autotrophic denitrification cardoso et al 2006 found that the denitrification rate in the presence of thiosulfate was 4 6 and 9 5 times higher than those in the presence of sulfide and elemental sulfur respectively furthermore thiosulfate 1 4 1 7 usd kg no3 n is less costly than organics i e methanol 1 8 2 3 usd kg no3 n di capua et al 2019 elemental sulfur is widely used in nitrate nitrite removal from wastewater guo et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the cost of elemental sulfur is only 0 26 usd kg no3 n which accounts for only 15 19 of the cost of thiosulfate di capua et al 2019 besides the sda process has advantages in terms of co2 emission in wastewater treatment conventional nitrification and denitrification process has a large amount of carbon emission liu et al 2021 which is the primary driver of global climate change in contrast sda biotechnology considerably decreases carbon emissions because organics are not required in this autotrophic nitrogen removal system 7 challenges associated with the sda process despite the development of the sda process several challenges still limit its further implementation one major challenge is the fluctuation in substrate concentration which may cause sulfide or thiocyanate accumulation in the reactor thereby inhibiting anammox activity anammox bacteria are chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms with a low growth rate and biomass yield oshiki et al 2016 anammox bacteria inhibition in the combined system results in prolonged reactor recovery the sulfide loading rate of the reactor plays the most significant role in preventing anammox bacteria from the inhibitory effects of sulfide to prevent such effects the sda process should be conducted under sulfide limiting conditions deng et al 2021b russ et al 2014 other toxic compounds in industrial wastewater may also inhibit anammox which can cause a synergistic inhibition on anammox bacteria jin et al 2012 oshiki et al 2018 found that phenol and thiocyanate had a synergistic inhibitory effect on anammox and the specific anammox activity decreased by 90 under thiocyanate and phenol concentrations of 55 mgs l and 100 mg l respectively bps0 accumulation is another challenge associated with the sda process bps0 is an intermediate of sulfide thiocyanate and thiosulfate oxidation and a high concentration of bps0 accumulation in the reactor can influence the sda performance kleerebezem and mendez 2002 suggested that elemental sulfur accumulation may reduce biomass retention efficiency and the sulfide removal rate accumulated bps can also cause pipe blockage and secondary pollution chen et al 2016 moreover accumulated bps0 in sda reactors can hamper the mass transfer of substrates thereby limiting the denitrification and anammox activities in biological sulfide oxidation the produced bps0 exists as globules deposited inside or outside bacteria cells janssen et al 1996 and originates from different sulfide oxidation pathways in sob visser et al 1997 when s2 sda is operated under a high s n ratio complete elimination of sulfur pollution from wastewater can be achieved thus sulfide oxidation to bps0 is preferred in this case accumulated bps0 needs to be separated from the wastewater the bps0 is generally colloidal and hydrophilic which limits bps0 recovery sedimentation centrifugation membrane separation extraction and coagulation are effective techniques for bps0 recovery but they may increase the process complexity and operational cost cai et al 2017 the high sulfate production in the sda process is undesirable sulfate is generally considered nontoxic but discharged sulfate into freshwater is likely biologically reduced to toxic sulfide which could harm the ecosystem if the sulfate containing effluent does not elevate the background concentration such as in a marine environment the effects of the discharged sulfate can be ignored however when the effluent of the sda process is discharged into freshwater the sulfate concentration should be controlled and the sulfate discharge limits in industrial wastewater treatment typically vary from 250 to 1000 mg l runtti et al 2018 for treating high strength nitrogen wastewater by sda process incomplete sulfide oxidation is preferable thus bps0 can be recovered and sulfate is removed from wastewater besides elemental sulfur is more favourable than thiosulfate as the external sulfur source for sda process since sulfate production from elemental sulfur is 33 less than that from thiosulfate additionally the low solubility of elemental sulfur limits the application of the sda process elemental sulfur is particularly hydrophobic with a solubility as low as 5 ug l at 20 c and the dissolution rate of solid sulfur is the limiting step in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification koenig and liu 2001 however li et al 2019 reported that the nitrogen removal rate in the s0 sda reactor reached 4 1 kgn m3 d further research is needed to explore the relationship between the low solubility of elemental sulfur and the efficient nitrogen removal in s0 sda moreover elemental sulfur disproportionation may occur in the s0 sda system owing to the low solubility of elemental sulfur the reactor is normally packed with excessive elemental sulfur biological disproportionation is a chemolithotrophic process in which elemental sulfur is converted into sulfate and sulfide with a ratio of 1 3 as shown in eq 21 finster et al 1998 the disproportionation is conducted by sulfate reducing bacteria such as desulfovibrio sulfodismutans desulfocapsa thiozymogenes and desulfocapsa sulfoexigens finster 2008 disproportionation in s0 sda results in the consumption of more elemental sulfur in the reactor and the produced sulfide may inhibit anammox bacteria the produced sulfide may be present in the reactor effluent and cause environmental pollution 21 4 s 0 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 3 h s 5 h 8 future perspectives the sda process is an efficient and economical technique for nitrogen removal the feasibility and stability of the process have been investigated at a laboratory scale for the future development of this process kinetic investigation microbial analysis model evaluation and larger scale study are required investigating the diffusional limitation substrate distribution in aggregates and reaction kinetics will further elucidate the complicated bioreactions and underlying principles of the sda process which is essential for effective sda reactor design and optimisation although the functional bacteria in the sda process have been identified the metabolic properties interactions and spatial distribution of sob and anammox bacteria remain poorly understood further genomic and molecular studies such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics can provide useful information about the microbial community genetics physiology and biochemistry these studies will also link environmental factors with the microbial community structure functional gene abundance and the nitrogen and sulfur metabolic pathways of the sda process the sda process is a complex system involving various substrates and bacterial populations developing mathematical models for the process is vital to further clarify the process dynamics design and operating conditions the metabolic pathways and molecular mechanisms of anammox have been well established kartal et al 2012 and mathematical models of the anammox process have been developed and widely applied to evaluate the process baeten et al 2019 however sulfur based denitrification modelling is yet to be fully achieved some sulfur oxidation metabolisms are still unclear and the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters of sulfur based denitrification are unavailable to develop a comprehensive spda model more efforts should be devoted to determining the metabolic pathways kinetic parameters and stoichiometric coefficients of sulfur based denitrification and the interactions between sob and anammox bacteria previous studies on the sda process have been performed at a laboratory scale with different reactor configurations and synthetic wastewater the performance of the sda process for larger scale practical wastewater treatment needs to be evaluated to verify its applicability careful control of the reactor to retain anammox bacteria and maintain a high anammox activity is crucial for the successful operation of the sda process biofilm or granular reactors have the advantage of enriching microorganisms owing to their high biomass concentrations efficient biomass retention resilience to toxicity and fluctuating loads and high nitrogen removal rate therefore such reactors are preferable for engineering application of spda process furthermore anammox bacteria are sensitive to various inhibitory substances in practical wastewater especially industrial wastewater the impacts of these toxic substances on sda should be explored 9 conclusions sda is an effective biological nitrogen removal process and it has the potential to extend the application of anammox based biotechnology in sewage and industrial wastewater treatment the sda system is robust because sob and anammox bacteria have a comparable growth rate and biomass yield and both bioprocesses occur in anoxic conditions the sda process successfully mitigates the toxicity of reduced sulfur compounds e g s2 and scn to anammox the sda process is an economical and sustainable approach for nitrogen removal because it can considerably save electron donor consumption reduce carbon emission simplify the treatment process and control system and recover mineral sources from wastewater despite these advantages the sda process also has some limitations in engineering application i the operational strategies should be optimized to reduce the effects of fluctuating influent and accumulated intermediates on reactor performance ii the elevated sulfate concentration in sda effluent is undesirable when it is discharged into freshwater more studies on the related kinetics genetics modelling and process scaling of the sda are required to better understand process dynamics and optimize the operating conditions in the future full scale implementation of the sda process will lead to significant savings in energy and better management of nutrient removal from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15493,anoxic ammonium oxidation anammox is an energy efficient nitrogen removal process for wastewater treatment however the unstable nitrite supply and residual nitrate in the anammox process have limited its wide application recent studies have proven coupling of sulfur based denitrification with anammox sda can achieve an effective nitrogen removal owing to stable provision of substrate nitrite from the sulfur based denitrification thus making its process control more efficient in comparison with that of partial nitrification and anammox process meanwhile the anammox produced nitrate can be eliminated through sulfur based denitrification thereby enhancing sda s overall nitrogen removal efficiency nonetheless this process is governed by a complex microbial system that involves both complicated sulfur and nitrogen metabolisms as well as multiple interactions among sulfur oxidising bacteria and anammox bacteria a comprehensive understanding of the principles of the sda process is the key to facilitating the development and application of this novel process hence this review is conducted to systematically summarise various findings on the sda process including its associated biochemistry biokinetic reactions reactor performance and application the dominant functional bacteria and microbial interactions in the sda process are further discussed finally the advantages challenges and future research perspectives of sda are outlined overall this work gives an in depth insight into the coupling mechanism of sda and its potential application in biological nitrogen removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biological nitrogen removal sulfur based denitrification partial denitrification anammox sulfur oxidising bacteria anammox bacteria data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the excess discharge of nitrogen compounds into water bodies has disrupted the nitrogen cycle and caused severe environmental issues anoxic ammonium oxidation anammox which can convert nitrite and ammonium into nitrogen gas in the absence of organics is one of the most efficient nitrogen removal processes van de graaf et al 1996 over the past two decades the combined partial nitrification and anammox pna process has been extensively investigated ali and okabe 2015 the pna process has been adopted for nitrogen removal from ammonium rich wastewater such as rejected water landfill leachate and food processing wastewater lackner et al 2014 van hulle et al 2010 nonetheless the complex microbial community and the necessity of preventing nitrite oxidation make the pna process unstable in long term operations cao et al 2017 lackner et al 2014 moreover the residual nitrate and nitrite in the pna process limit the nitrogen removal efficiency to below 89 vlaeminck et al 2012 nitrite is a common intermediate in denitrification and could be utilised by anammox compared with pna coupling heterotrophic denitrification and anammox is easier to maintain as both denitrification and anammox occur under anoxic conditions such coupled process has been successfully established by using various organics du et al 2014 sumino et al 2006 takekawa et al 2014 trukhina et al 2011 they have shown excellent total nitrogen tn removal efficiencies 93 6 96 7 for the treatment of both low and high strength nitrogen wastewaters du et al 2019 however heterotrophic denitrification is more thermodynamically feasible than anammox and heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria have a higher growth rate and biomass yield than anammox bacteria kumar and lin 2010 the excessive influent organics can result in the overgrowth of heterotrophic denitrifiers i e cod n 2 5 deteriorating the nitrogen removal efficiency of this combined process du et al 2017b on the other hand reduced sulfur compounds such as s2 s0 and s2o3 2 can serve as alternative electron donors for denitrification via sulfur oxidising bacteria sob lin et al 2018 pokorna and zabranska 2015 nitrite accumulation has been frequently observed in sulfur based denitrification due to an imbalance of denitratation and denitritation rate furumai et al 1996 gadekar et al 2006 kimura et al 2002 pan et al 2018 the accumulated nitrite in the sulfur based denitrification is highly toxic to the sob thereby inhibiting or even preventing their denitrifying activities mora et al 2014 sun and nemati 2012 although a high nitrite concentration is toxic to sob in sulfur based denitrification nitrite could be the potential substrate for anammox bacteria sob are autotrophic and their growth rate and biomass yield are comparable with those of anammox bacteria ali et al 2015 mora et al 2014 the coculture of sob and anammox bacteria can be stably maintained because the risk of sob overgrowth is relatively low thus nitrogen removal can be better achieved through coupling sulfur based denitrification with anammox sda process zhang et al 2020b sda occurs in nature and plays a crucial role in the global nitrogen and sulfur cycles canfield et al 2010 however its application in environmental engineering is still limited li et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 2020b the sda process has the potential to extend the application of anammox based microbial biotechnology it can simultaneously remove nitrate and ammonium from wastewater in a one stage system kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 in addition residual nitrate and nitrite from anammox process can be eliminated through sulfur based denitrification which improves the nitrogen removal efficiency dasgupta et al 2017 guo et al 2016 however the sda process is a complex biosystem owing to the following characteristics 1 a variety of components e g s2 s0 s2o3 2 s4o6 2 so3 2 so4 2 nh4 n2 no2 and no3 are transformed 2 sulfur metabolism is highly diversified because of the presence of different oxidative enzymes and metabolic pathways in sob and 3 complicated interactions occur between sob and anammox bacteria to elucidate the coupling mechanism of sda and facilitate its development and application this paper therefore comprehensively reviews the principle and current development of the sda process that have not been included in previous literature specifically performance biokinetics coupling mechanism metabolic interactions potential applications advantages challenges and future research of the sda process were summarized 2 biochemistry and natural occurrence of the sda process 2 1 sulfur based denitrification sulfur based denitrification is conducted by sob which can grow chemolithotrophically on reduced sulfur compounds with nitrogen oxides e g nitrate and nitrite as electron acceptors sob are highly diversified in taxonomy while the majority of sob organisms belong to the phylum proteobacteria dahl 2017 sob are mainly distributed in four classes α proteobacteria e g paracoccus β proteobacteria e g thiobacillus γ proteobacteria e g thioalkalivibrio and ε proteobacteria e g sulfurimonas these microorganisms are widely distributed in natural habitats and artificial environments and most of them are mesophilic and neutrophilic shao et al 2010 syed et al 2006 sulfur based denitrification considerably contributes to the oxidative side of the sulfur cycle in which reduced sulfur compounds are oxidised to elemental sulfur or sulfate in anoxic water lens and kuenen 2001 inorganic sulfur compounds have various oxidation states ranging from 2 i e sulfide and reduced organic sulfur to 6 i e sulfate sulfur based autotrophic denitrification is more complicated than heterotrophic denitrification because sulfur transformation is associated with a variety of redox enzymes metabolic pathways and mechanisms dahl and friedrich 2008 thiosulfate is a common substrate for sob and thiosulfate oxidation is the central pathway in biochemical sulfur oxidation the oxidations of sulfide elemental sulfur tetrathionate and sulfite are linked to thiosulfate oxidation there are at least three pathways through which sob oxidise thiosulfate sulfur oxidation sox pathway tetrathionate intermediate s4i pathway and branched thiosulfate oxidation bto pathway as shown in fig 1 ghosh and dam 2009 lens and pol 2000 and the bioreactions related enzymes and genes are presented in table 1 the first pathway is established in paracoccus pantotrophus where two sulfur atoms in thiosulfate are directly oxidised to sulfate without releasing any sulfur related intermediates via the sox pathway and 8 molecules of cytochrome are reduced simultaneously friedrich et al 2001 other sulfur species such as sulfide elemental sulfur and sulfite can also be fed into the sox pathway the multienzyme complex in the sox pathway are periplasmic proteins composed of soxxa soxyz soxb and soxcd and the putatively conserved operon has been identified by genetic studies friedrich et al 2005 the second pathway was established in thermithiobacillus tepidarius acidithiobacillus caldus and tetrathiobacter kashmirensis where thiosulfate is oxidised to sulfate via the s4i pathway dam et al 2007 ghosh and dam 2009 the thiosulfate is firstly oxidized to tetrathionate in periplasm and then tetrathionate is oxidized to sulfite and sulfate in cytoplasm or in close vicinity of the inside of the cell membrane however to date the proposed enzymatic reactions associated with the s4i pathway remain postulations and the genomic basis of the pathway has only been minimally verified the third pathway was established in thiobacillus denitrificans thiocapsa roseopersicina and thiothrix dahl and prange 2006 thiosulfate is initially transformed into sulfate and elemental sulfur and the elemental sulfur is reduced to sulfide level and finally sulfide is oxidised to sulfite and sulfate either by sulfite acceptor oxidoreductase saor or aps reductase apr and atp sulfate adenylyl transferase atp sulfurylase dahl and friedrich 2008 it should be noted that more than one sulfur oxidation pathway are proposed even within a specie because the variation of environmental conditions could lead to an induction of related sulfur oxidising gene transcription beller et al 2006 electrons released during sulfur oxidation are delivered by electron transfer chains to reduce nitrogen oxides nitrate reduction in sulfur based denitrification is a four step reaction rittmann and mccarty 2001 1 nitrate reduction to nitrite by nitrate reductase 2 nitrite reduction to nitric oxide by nitrite reductase 3 nitric oxide reduction to nitrous oxide by nitric oxide reductases and 4 nitrous oxide reduction to nitrogen gas by nitrous oxide reductase nitrate reduction is mediated by membrane bound nitrate reductase in the cytoplasm while the other three denitrification steps occur in the periplasm or periplasmic boundaries zumft 1997 2 2 anammox anammox is regarded as one of the major sinks of inorganic nitrogen in freshwater and marine ecosystems oshiki et al 2016 anammox bacteria are present in different natural environments such as soil groundwater wastewater treatment plants wwtps lakes estuaries continental shelves in the marine system hot springs and deep sea hydrothermal vents kartal et al 2013 anammox bacteria are slow growing microorganisms kartal et al 2012 belonging to the planctomycetales phylum and are composed of six genera among them ca kuenenia ca brocadia ca anammoxoglobus and ca jettenia have been detected in wastewater treatment facilities kartal et al 2013 khramenkov et al 2013 while ca scalindua and ca anammoximicrobium have been detected in marine environments and river silt kuypers et al 2005 li et al 2018 in the anammox process ammonium and nitrite are converted into nitrogen gas with nitric oxide no and hydrazine n2h4 as intermediates kartal et al 2011 the nitrogen transformation in the anammox process comprises three consecutive redox bioreactions nitrite is first reduced to nitric oxide by nitrite reductase nir then ammonium and nitric oxide are converted into hydrazine by hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine is finally transformed into nitrogen gas the enzymes catalysing these three bioreactions are located in the anammoxosome an intracytoplasmic compartment in anammox bacteria bounded mostly by dense ladderane lipids de almeida et al 2015 these ladderanes are less permeable than common cell membranes protecting the other cellular components from highly toxic intermediates i e no n2h4 van niftrik et al 2004 in the anammox process nitrite accepts electrons to oxidise ammonium but it is also oxidised to nitrate as it donates electrons for carbon fixation kartal et al 2011 2 3 natural occurrence of the sda process anammox plays a significant role in releasing fixed nitrogen in oxygen minimum zones omzs in the marine ecosystem dalsgaard et al 2005 kuypers et al 2005 omzs in aquatic environments are vital for global nitrogen sulfur and carbon cycles in particular omzs in the marine system account for 30 50 of the global nitrogen loss codispoti et al 2001 gruber and sarmiento 1997 over 67 of the nitrite used by anammox in omzs is from nitrate reduction while less than 33 is from aerobic ammonium oxidation lam et al 2009 the nitrogen cycle in omzs is described in fig 2 in the upper part of the omzs aerobic ammonium oxidation via aob ammonia oxidising archaea aoa and complete ammonia oxidising comammox bacteria provide anammox with nitrite for nitrogen removal in the lower part nitrate reduction provides anammox with nitrite lam et al 2009 van kessel et al 2015 the electrons for denitrification generally originate from organics and reduced sulfur compounds sulfide is a necessary reductant produced by the sulfate reduction process in anoxic water sulfate reduction accounts for over 50 of organic carbon mineralisation in marine sediments and sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation contribute to energy flux and elemental cycling in omzs canfield et al 2010 wenk et al 2013 examined potential electron donors i e glucose acetate mn ii fe ii and sulfide for denitrification in the omzs finding that sulfide rather than organics was the electron donor for denitrification sda occurs in the lower part of omzs where anammox is dependent on the nitrite released as an intermediate in sulfide based denitrification through the isotope pairing technique hamersley et al 2007 proved that anammox instead of denitrification was mainly responsible for nitrogen loss in the peruvian omz waters similarly the anammox was the predominant pathway for sinking fixed nitrogen in the black sea and heterotrophic denitrification was not detected jensen et al 2008 moreover the sulfide oxidation was strongly related to nitrate reduction to nitrite in omzs and that anammox was the dominant pathway for fixed nitrogen removal 0 43 0 29 nmol l h considerably outpacing sulfide based denitrification 0 042 0 079 nmol l h therefore sda was critical for removing fixed nitrogen from omzs canfield et al 2010 the above findings were also reported in a meromictic south alpine lake and an east african great lake roland et al 2018 wenk et al 2013 3 biokinetics and mechanism of sda process recent works have investigated the feasibility and performance of sda for nitrogen removal the suitable influent characteristics e g sulfur source sulfur to nitrogen s n ratio reactor configurations and operational strategies have been explored table 2 here we firstly discussed factors resulting in nitrite accumulation in sulfur based denitrification i e s2 scn s0 and s2o3 2 then the reactor performance biokinetics and coupling mechanisms of sda process are reviewed 3 1 sulfide based denitrification and anammox process sulfide is the main product of sulfate respiration by sulfate reducing organisms under anaerobic conditions delgado vela et al 2015 pokorna and zabranska 2015 in which sulfate or other oxidised sulfur compounds are terminal electron acceptors and hydrogen ethanol propionate and lactate are electron donors tang et al 2009 the produced sulfide is an efficient electron donor for denitrification the sulfide based denitrification comprises four bioreactions as shown in eqs 1 4 reyes avila et al 2004 xu et al 2016 the sulfide is initially oxidised to biologically produced elemental sulfur bps0 which is further oxidised to sulfate stable nitrite accumulation in sulfide based denitrification is a prerequisite for the implementation of the sulfide based denitrification and anammox s2 sda process however studies have reported contradicting findings on nitrite accumulation in sulfide based denitrification the nitrite accumulation was detected in both two steps with sulfide and bps0 as electron donors gadekar et al 2006 in contrast other studies did not detect nitrite accumulation in the presence of sulfide cui et al 2019b xu et al 2016 and authors found that bps0 was used as an electron donor after sulfide depletion and nitrite was remarkably accumulated in the reactor 1 no 3 s 2 2 h s 0 no 2 h 2 o 2 no 2 1 5 s 2 4 h 1 5 s 0 0 5 n 2 2 h 2 o 3 s 0 3 no 3 h 2 o so 4 2 3 no 2 2 h 4 s 0 2 no 2 so 4 2 n 2 several studies have investigated s2 sda for the simultaneous removal of nitrate ammonium and sulfide from wastewater the s n ratio of the influent is a crucial parameter that affects the final sulfide oxidation product and contributions of denitrification and anammox to nitrogen removal the coexistence of sulfide based denitrification and anammox was first observed in a fluidised bed reactor and 32 160 mgs l of sulfide could enhance anammox activity van de graaf et al 1996 the s2 sda was applied to treat high strength nitrogenous and sulfide bearing wastewater and the reactor achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 90 after a long start up period table 2 kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 influent nox nh4 and s n ratios higher than 1 2 gn gn and 0 57 gs gn respectively were the optimal operating conditions for the s2 sda process however as the s2 sda reactor consumed about 30 organics heterotrophic denitrification may also be responsible for nitrogen removal russ et al 2014 implemented sulfide based denitrification and then inoculated anammox biomass into the reactor to start up s2 sda the experimental results showed that sulfide based denitrification supplied nitrite for anammox and the anammox process accounted for 65 75 of nitrogen removal the s2 sda was the above mentioned studies have focused on implementing s2 sda for the simultaneous removal of nitrate ammonium and sulfide additionally sulfide based denitrification can be introduced into the anammox reactor to eliminate anammox produced nitrate under an influent nh4 no2 s2 mass ratio of 1 74 2 2 1 gn gn gs the nitrogen removal efficiency of the reactor was stable and bps0 was formed and retained in the uasb reactor guo et al 2016 the pna process under mainstream conditions was initially started up with an effluent nitrate concentration of 22 mgn l yuan et al 2020 after introducing sulfide based denitrification into this pna reactor with sulfide concentration below 40 0 mgs l the effluent nitrate concentration considerably decreased to 5 mgn l under mainstream conditions although anammox could be the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in s2 sda the coupled process has two different mechanisms it was reported that sulfur based denitrification in the s2 sda was a two step process under nitrate limiting conditions liu et al 2015 nitrate was firstly reduced to nitrite combined sulfide oxidation to bps0 then most of produced nitrite was utilized by anammox and a small portion of nitrite was slowly reduced to nitrogen gas combined bps0 oxidation to sulfate the nitrogen removal pathway of the s2 sda process under nitrate limiting conditions is shown in fig 3 a the authors suggested that excess sulfide was required to produce nitrite for feeding anammox in contrast the kinetics of the s2 sda process was investigated under sulfide limiting conditions and results showed that no nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction with sulfide as the electron donor deng et al 2021b nitrite accumulation occurred when the formed bps0 was used as the electron donor for nitrate reduction in this period the produced nitrite was available for anammox which became the dominant nitrogen removal pathway the nitrogen removal mechanism of the s2 sda process under sulfide limiting conditions is depicted in fig 3b 3 2 thiocyanate based denitrification and anammox process thiocyanate nc s is one of the major contaminants in industrial wastewater for coal gasification and it is widely used in insecticide and herbicide manufacturing mining electroplating and chemical synthesis the conventional activated sludge process is usually used for thiocyanate removal thiocyanate is a relatively chemically stable compound and its degradation requires enzymatic catalysis by a limited number of sob e g thiobacillus denitrificans thiobacillus thioparus and thialkalivibrio thiocyanodenitrificans kelly and wood 2000 sorokin et al 2004 thiocyanate can also be used as a nitrogen source by some heterotrophic bacteria bezsudnova et al 2007 thiocyanate is degraded via the carbonyl sulfide cos or cyanate cno pathway bezsudnova et al 2007 ebbs 2004 h2s is formed as an intermediate

denitrification in a sequencing batch reactor sbr could stably produce ammonium 200 mgn l and nitrite 110 mgn l pan et al 2018 the influent no3 n scn n ratio considerably influenced the nitrite accumulation ratio in the reactor with an increase in the no3 n scn n ratio from 1 0 to 3 0 gn gn the nitrite accumulation ratio increased from 44 6 to 86 1 furthermore at an influent no3 n scn n ratio of 1 5 gn gn the ratio of produced nitrite to ammonium was 1 1 which is close to that of the substrate of the anammox process to the best of our knowledge there is no report on anammox using nitrite from thiocyanate based denitrification however the thiocyanate based denitrification and anammox scn sda process was established in a batch test pan et al 2019 in which autotrophic denitrifying biomass 38 of the thiobacillus was mixed with anammox biomass 14 4 ca kuenenia in this combined process the reactor was provided with sufficient nitrite a part of nitrite reacted with scn to produce nh4 by sob and then the residual nitrite and produced nh4 were converted into nitrogen gas by anammox bacteria the coupled system achieved a tn removal efficiency of 98 with the nitrite to thiocyanate ratio of 3 g no2 n g scn n the overall reaction is described in eq 11 and the proposed mechanism is illustrated in fig 4 a a kinetic model to describe the removal of thiocyanate and nitrite in the scn sda process pan et al 2019 the model contained three processes 1 thiocyanate reacts with nitrite to produce nitrogen gas ammonium and sulfate 2 thiocyanate reacts with nitrate to generate nitrogen gas ammonium and sulfate 3 nitrite reacts with ammonium to produce nitrogen gas and nitrate after model calibration the effects of the nh4 scn ratio and the biomass concentration of anammox bacteria and sob on nitrogen removal efficiency were estimated this developed model was further improved to describe sulfur transformations chen et al 2019b such that thiocyanate oxidation to sulfate involved two steps with elemental sulfur as an intermediate fig 4b however the developed model did not consider the potential inhibitory effect of thiocyanate on anammox 11 3 s c n 11 n o 2 8 h 3 s o 4 2 3 c o 2 7 n 2 4 h 2 o 3 3 elemental sulfur based denitrification and anammox process elemental sulfur is nontoxic poorly soluble in water relatively stable and readily available as a mined mineral or an industrial byproduct e g petroleum industries syed et al 2006 tang et al 2009 as an effective and economical electron donor for denitrification elemental sulfur is widely used for treating nitrate contaminated water including drinking water secondary wastewater effluent and industrial wastewater zhu and getting 2012 elemental sulfur based denitrification is a two step process with nitrite as an intermediate as shown in eqs 3 and 4 with the overloading of nitrogen nitrite reduction became the rate limiting step that resulted in nitrite accumulation sahinkaya et al 2011 vidal et al 2002 the nitrite formed in elemental sulfur based denitrification inhibits denitrification owing to the toxicity of free nitrous acid cui et al 2019b sun and nemati 2012 the ph condition is another factor that influences nitrite accumulation during elemental sulfur based denitrification the optimum ph for nitrite and nitrate reduction was 7 0 and 8 5 respectively and that sulfur based denitrification under controlled ph resulted in the accumulation of over 95 of nitrite chen et al 2019a the elemental sulfur based denitrification and anammox s0 sda was applied to treat nitrate and ammonium containing wastewaters and achieved a tn removal efficiency of 98 li et al 2019 the experimental results revealed that the tn removal rate reached 4 1 kgn m3 d of which anammox and sulfur based denitrification accounted for 3 1 and 1 0 kgn m3 d respectively moreover elemental sulfur based denitrification can remove nitrate and nitrite from anammox process to enhance nitrogen removal efficiency a separated elemental sulfur packed bed reactor was used to polish the effluent from a pna reactor dasgupta et al 2017 in the integrated system 99 of the nitrate was removed through elemental sulfur based denitrification and an overall tn removal efficiency of 97 was achieved with a nitrogen removal rate of 0 6 kgn m3 d similarly wang et al 2019 used a separated elemental sulfur granule supported reactor for polishing the effluent from an anammox reactor and achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 99 the elemental sulfur based denitrification was also applied to remove nox i e 45 mg no2 n l and 145 no3 n l produced from pna treating mature landfill leachate and achieved a nox removal efficiency of 96 6 in the denitrification reactor zeng et al 2021 the polishing anammox effluent by elemental sulfur based denitrification can be conducted in anammox reactor the autotrophic denitrification biomass was inoculated into an anammox reactor and elemental sulfur was supplied as the electron donor to remove anammox produced nitrate chen et al 2019a the tn removal efficiency was stabilised at over 95 with an effluent nitrate concentration below 10 mgn l as elemental sulfur preferentially reacts with nitrate the combined process can mitigate the competition between denitrification and anammox for nitrite in the combined system sob was mainly responsible for reducing nitrate to nitrite the result slightly differed from those of separate polishing reactors in which anammox produced nitrate was completely reduced to nitrogen gas in the separated reactor dasgupta et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 the elemental sulfur based denitrification was introduced into a pna reactor and achieved a tn removal efficiency of 98 with an influent ammonium concentration of 600 mgn l zhang et al 2020a the nitrite uptake rate of anammox was 34 5 times higher than that in elemental sulfur based denitrification indicating that sob only reduced nitrate to nitrite in the s0 sda process this novel process not only simplifies the coupled system but also saves 60 of elemental sulfur compared with systems with a separate polishing process 3 4 thiosulfate based denitrification and anammox process thiosulfate is generally discharged from several industries including the petrochemical pharmaceutical and mining industries owing to its nontoxicity and ready bioavailability thiosulfate is also used as an external electron donor for denitrification cui et al 2019a di capua et al 2019 thiosulfate based denitrification is a two step process with nitrite as an intermediate mora et al 2014 as shown in eqs 12 and 13 12 s 2 o 3 2 4 n o 3 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 4 n o 2 2 h 13 s 2 o 3 2 1 6 n o 2 0 2 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 0 8 n 2 0 4 h thiosulfate based denitrification is an efficient and stable biological nitrogen removal process however nitrite accumulation has been observed under unfavourable conditions the nitrite was formed in a thiosulfate based denitrification system with ph below 7 4 because nitrite reduction was severely inhibited at low ph conditions while nitrate reduction was less impacted furumai et al 1996 it was reported that a lower nitrite reduction rate than nitrate reduction rate caused nitrite accumulation in thiosulfate based denitrification and the formed nitrite was retained in the reactor with insufficient thiosulfate campos et al 2008 nitrite accumulation in the thiosulfate based denitrification system is influenced by the initial nitrate concentration and the denitrifying bacterial population mora et al 2014 deng et al 2019 started up a thiosulfate based denitrification and anammox s2o3 2 sda process in a uasb reactor the tn removal efficiency and removal rate reached 82 5 and 0 33 kg n m³ d respectively and anammox accounted for 90 of nitrogen removal then a kinetic model was developed to evaluate the s2o3 2 sda system deng et al 2021a and the nitrogen removal pathway is shown in fig 5 the modelling results and metagenomic analysis demonstrated that bps0 is an important intermediate in thiosulfate oxidation this finding differs from those of previous experimental studies in which thiosulfate was found to be directly oxidised to sulfate mora et al 2014 yang et al 2020 also implemented the s2o3 2 sda process in a single system achieving a maximum tn removal efficiency of 99 4 moreover the authors found that the bps0 produced from thiosulfate oxidation could be an efficient electron buffer for denitrification in addition the authors proposed that in the s2o3 2 sda system sob provided anammox bacteria with not only nitrite but also nitric oxide however this proposition should be experimentally verified through nitric oxide dynamics analysis the s2o3 2 sda process was used to remove high strength nitrogen from wastewater lin et al 2022 a considerable amount of bps0 was formed in the reactor and bps0 on the granular surface could protect the anammox in the core from the inhibitory effects of free ammonia free nitrous acid and dissolved oxygen furthermore introducing thiosulfate based denitrification into an anammox system can eliminate nitrate and nitrite the s2o3 2 sda system was established in a uasb reactor fed with nitrite ammonium and thiosulfate qian et al 2018 the s2o3 2 sda process was implemented to treat the effluent containing nitrate nitrite and ammonium from a partial nitrification process and achieved a tn removal efficiency of 98 1 sun et al 2018 4 application and stoichiometry of the sda process the sda process has two potential applications for nitrogen removal from wastewater in nitrate and ammonium containing wastewater treatment the nitrate is first reduced to nitrite through sulfur based denitrification and then the produced nitrite is utilised by anammox to oxidise ammonium in the treatment of high strength ammonium wastewater sda can enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency of anammox and the anammox produced nitrate is eliminated through sulfur based denitrification 4 1 treatment of nitrate and ammonium containing wastewater industrial wastewaters containing nitrate and ammonium are produced in the mining milling fertiliser and semiconductor industries deng et al 2019 li et al 2022 the two stage nitrification denitrification process is generally applied to treat such wastewaters which requires external organics hirata et al 2001 shivaraman et al 2001 zaitsev et al 2008 sda is a more efficient and economical approach for treating nitrate and ammonium containing wastewaters the operational cost of the sda process is remarkably lower than that of nitrification denitrification because of the following 1 reduced sulfur compounds e g s2 s0 and s2o3 2 are much cheaper than organic matter e g ch3oh 2 oxygen is not required in sda 3 nitrate and ammonium can be removed using a single reactor 4 the low biomass yields and growth rates of sob and anammox bacteria considerably reduce sludge production sda also has potential application in nitrogen removal from sewage anammox implementation in mainstream sewage treatment allows for the decoupling of carbon and nitrogen removal resulting in energy neutral or positive wwtps jetten et al 1997 siegrist et al 2008 nonetheless sewage is characterised by low temperature and low nitrogen concentration and the lack of a stable nitrite source from pn is the bottleneck limiting the mainstream application of anammox cao et al 2017 partial denitrification could stably supply anammox with nitrite under low temperature and nitrogen concentration conditions du et al 2017a the sda system can be operated in a one stage reactor as shown in fig 6 a to evaluate the interactions between denitrification and anammox and their effects on nitrogen removal pathways and electron donor consumption the stoichiometry of the coupled process was further analysed in this study based on the stoichiometries of anammox and denitrification lotti et al 2014 rittmann and mccarty 2001 nitrogen gas production via denitrification and anammox are described in eqs 14 and 15 respectively the electrons e in the equation are assumed to originate from the reduced sulfur compounds γ ranging from 0 to 1 denotes the proportion of nitrite from nitrate reduction used by anammox 1 γ equals the proportion of nitrite reduced to nitrogen gas used by sob γ indicates the cooperation between sob and anammox bacteria where a high value indicates effective cooperation this parameter is vital in the stoichiometry of the sda process 14 1 γ no 3 1 γ 5 e 6 1 γ h 0 5 1 γ n 2 3 1 γ h 2 o 15 0 873 γ nh 4 0 860 γ no 3 0 062 γ hco 3 2 05 γ h 2 γ e 0 86 γ n 2 0 0062 γ c h 1 74 o 0 31 n 0 20 2 747 γ h 2 o in the absence of anammox in the reactor γ 0 nitrite produced from nitrate reduction is entirely reduced to nitrogen gas through denitrification fig 6b and the removal of 1 mol of tn requires 5 mol of electrons fig 6c in this case nitrogen removal is entirely due to denitrification and ammonium is not consumed consequently the ratio of consumed ammonium to nitrate is 0 with increasing γ the contribution of anammox to tn removal increases whereas that of denitrification to tn removal decreases with increasing γ the electron consumption per mol of removed nitrogen diminishes while the ratio of removed ammonium to nitrate increases when the nitrite from nitrate reduction is fully utilised by anammox γ 1 only anammox contributes to nitrogen removal and the ratio of removed ammonium to nitrate increases to 1 0 in addition the electron consumption associated with the removal of 1 mol of tn remarkably decreases by 77 1 16 mol e removed tn in previous studies the γ value for the combined system generally varied from 0 65 to 0 9 deng et al 2019 li et al 2019 russ et al 2014 therefore the sda process can simultaneously remove nitrate and ammonium nh4 no3 1 0 from wastewater and save electron donors compared with complete denitrification 4 2 treatment of high strength ammonium wastewater in practical applications the maximum nitrogen removal efficiency of the anammox system is normally less than 89 owing to nitrite nitrate accumulation vlaeminck et al 2012 for industrial wastewater treatment the anammox reactor effluent is transferred to wwtps or polished by additional units such as nitrification denitrification desloover et al 2011 tokutomi et al 2011 integrating sulfur based denitrification into the anammox system can improve the nitrogen removal efficiency by eliminating the nitrate intrinsically produced by anammox in the coupled process the pn effluent is supplied to the sda reactor fig 7 a moreover pn and sda can be performed in a single reactor yuan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a nitrogen removal pathways via denitrification and anammox in the combined system are described in eqs 16 and 17 where γ denotes the percentage of nitrite from nitrate reduction utilised by anammox and 1 γ denotes the percentage of nitrite reduced to nitrogen gas during denitrification 16 0 161 1 γ no 3 0 805 1 γ e 0 966 γ h 0 0805 1 γ n 2 0 483 1 γ h 2 o 17 nh 4 1 146 0 161 γ no 2 0 071 hco 3 0 057 0 322 γ h 0 322 γ e 0 986 n 2

removed tn is 0 38 mol e mol tn the contributions of anammox and denitrification to tn removal are 92 5 and 7 5 respectively and the ratio of consumed ammonium to nitrite is 0 87 such denitrification anammox interaction occurs in separate polishing systems dasgupta et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 with increasing γ anammox contribution to tn removal slightly increases but the contribution of denitrification decreases moreover electron consumption per mol of removed nitrogen declines while the ratio of removed ammonium to removed nitrite slightly increases when the produced nitrate by anammox is only reduced to nitrite γ 1 by denitrification the ratio of electron consumption to nitrate consumption decreases by 58 0 16 mol e mol n thus only anammox contributes to nitrogen removal and the ratio of consumed ammonium to nitrite increases to 1 0 5 microorganisms and metabolic interactions in the sda process anammox bacteria have different niches owing to the physiological properties of individual species or groups of species zhang and okabe 2020 anammox bacteria populations have been observed to vary with environmental conditions e g temperature salinity and substrate concentration three anammox genera have generally been identified in the sda system namely ca brocadia ca kuenenia and ca jettenia and the relative abundance of anammox bacteria varies considerably among reactors table 2 the maximum growth rate and half saturation constants are two important kinetic parameters for anammox bacteria growth oshiki et al 2016 which can be used in the monod model to assess the bacteria growth behaviour and microbial dynamics ca kuenenia exhibited a higher nitrite affinity 3 μm than ca brocadia 34 μm and ca jettenia 35 6 μm in contrast ca brocadia exhibited a higher maximum growth rate 0 34 d than ca kuenenia 0 23 d and ca jettenia 0 18 d oshiki et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 therefore ca brocadia and ca kuenenia are considered r and k strategists respectively the impact of ammonium limitation on anammox bacteria growth in the sda system is not considered here owing to the presence of abundant ammonium however nitrite availability is a more important factor that impacts the abundance and biodiversity of anammox bacteria in the combined system in the treatment of nitrate and ammonium containing wastewaters via sda anammox bacteria rely on sob for nitrite thus the sda system is operated under nitrite limiting conditions studies have found that the dominant anammox bacteria in the combined system was ca kuenenia deng et al 2021b lin et al 2022 qin et al 2019 russ et al 2014 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 these findings are consistent with the physiological characteristics of ca kuenenia which has a high affinity for nitrite in applying sda for treating high strength ammonium wastewater the reactor is fed with nitrite and ammonium in studies in which the reactor was operated in a nitrite rich environment the dominant genus of anammox was ca brocadia chen et al 2019a guo et al 2016 sun et al 2018 yan et al 2020 this indicates that ca brocadia is more likely to outcompete other anammox bacteria genera in the sda process owing to its higher growth rate in the nitrite rich reactor nitrite availability is a possible primary factor in determining the genera of anammox bacteria in the sda system currently enriched anammox culture is commonly used as an inoculum for establishing the sda process therefore selecting the appropriate seeding sludge could be beneficial for the fast start up of the sda process the genus thiobacillus has been identified as the dominant sob in most sda systems table 2 thiobacillus bacteria can grow under various environmental stress conditions such as oxygen deficiency and acidic conditions the genus thiobacillus comprises thiobacillus aquaesulis thiobacillus denitrificans and thiobacillus thioparus which belongs to a subclass of β proteobacteria kelly and wood 2000 both thiobacillus aquaesulis and thiobacillus denitrificans are facultative anaerobes that can use nitrate nitrite and oxygen as electron acceptors with thiosulfate tetrathionate thiocyanate sulfide and elemental sulfur as electron donors kelly and wood 2000 thiobacillus thioparus can reduce nitrate only to nitrite kelly et al 2006 the physiology of thiobacillus denitrificans the representative of thiobacillus sp is shown in table 3 the optimal conditions for thiobacillus are neutrophilic and mesophilic environments consistent with the sda system sulfurimonas is the second most abundant sob in the sda system the majority of sulfurimonas can oxidise sulfide elemental sulfur thiosulfate and sulfite all of the sulfurimonas species can use nitrate as the electron acceptor however only sulfurimonas denitrificans and sulfurimonas gotlandica can use nitrite as electron acceptors han and perner 2015 the optimal temperature and ph of sulfurimonas are slightly lower than that of thiobacillus denitrificans table 3 the proposed metabolic interactions between sob and anammox bacteria in the sda system are shown in fig 8 the sob produced nitrite is an essential substrate for anammox bacteria and anammox bacteria produced nitrate is an efficient electron acceptor for sob both thiobacillus and sulfurimonas can perform complete denitrification sulfurimonas has complete sox related enzymes and it can oxidise sulfide or thiosulfate without elemental sulfur accumulation however thiobacillus is deficient in soxcd which could be the reason for elemental sulfur accumulation in the sda system deng et al 2019 lin et al 2022 the relative abundances of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas in the sda process considerably influence sulfur metabolism nitrogen removal performance and the process dynamics therefore the effects of environmental factors on the abundance of thiobacillus and sulfurimonas in the sda system need to be further explored sob and anammox bacteria can grow chemolithotrophically on reduced sulfur and nitrogen compounds respectively and they use carbon dioxide as the carbon source moreover sob and anammox bacteria use different metabolic pathways for co2 fixation i e calvin cycle reverse tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and the wood ljungdahl pathway hernandez et al 1996 sievert et al 2008 strous et al 2006 6 advantages of the sda process the application of sda for nitrogen removal from wastewater has several advantages first the combined system can alleviate the inhibitory effects of reduced sulfur compounds i e s2 and scn on anammox sulfide is a well known inhibitor of various microorganisms including anammox bacteria dapena mora et al 2007 studies have reported a half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 of total dissolved sulfide for anammox was 5 0 9 6 mgs l dapena mora et al 2007 wu et al 2016 russ et al 2014 found that sulfide could inhibit anammox biomass over a long period by inducing cell lysis and the ic50 was as low as 0 32 mgs l however the mechanism of sulfide toxicity to anammox biomass remains unclear the authors attributed the high sensitivity of anammox to sulfide to the inhibitory effect of sulfide on heme containing proteins such as nitrite reductase and hydrazine dehydrogenase these heme proteins are crucial in the biochemical reactions of anammox metabolism kartal and keltjens 2016 h2s can ligate to ferric heme in globins eq 18 and even reduce the iron centre producing ferrous heme and hydrogen persulfide as shown in eq 19 kabil and banerjee 2010 18 heme fe iii h 2 s heme fe iii h 2 s 19 fe iii h 2 s h 2 s heme fe ii hs sh 2 h e sulfide has strong inhibitory effects on anammox activity nonetheless anammox bacteria have been found to survive in reactors with a continuous influx of sulfide and they even dominated the nitrogen removal pathway in the sda system deng et al 2021b kalyuzhnyi et al 2006 liu et al 2015 qin et al 2019 russ et al 2014 these results indicate that sulfide toxicity to anammox bacteria can be mitigated in the s2 sda process sulfide can be detoxified by sob russ et al 2014 which creates a suitable environment for anammox bacteria deng et al 2021b further investigated the reaction kinetics of the s2 sda system in a fed batch test and observed that the sulfide level in the s2 sda reactor was below the detection limit moreover anammox accounted for 87 2 of nitrogen removal and nitrate reduction to nitrite was the rate limiting step in nitrogen removal the mechanism of thiocyanate toxicity to anammox is not fully clear but it was probably related to the inhibition of adenosine triphosphatase mg2 atpases in anammox bacteria it was reported that the thiocyanate has inhibitory effects on mg2 atpases thus inhibiting the metabolic processes in cells douglas gould et al 2012 katz and epstein 1971 chen et al 2017 determined the ic50 of thiocyanate for anammox as 127 mgn l in a batch test the inhibitory effects of thiocyanate on anammox were enhanced in the continuous reactor where the anammox activity decreased by 43 at a thiocyanate concentration of 26 8 mgn l however pan et al 2019 implemented the scn sda process using an initial thiocyanate concentration of 57 mgs l and the tn removal efficiency reached 98 indicating that thiocyanate inhibition of anammox can be mitigated in the scn sda process second the sda process enables the elimination of toxic sulfur compounds i e s2 and scn from wastewater and simplifies wastewater treatment although sulfide could cause problems in wastewater treatment owing to its toxicity malodour and corrosive effect s2 sda could convert sulfide into nontoxic substances i e bps0 and sulfate sulfide is present in the industrial wastewater from petrochemical plants tanneries and coal gasification plants lens et al 1998 the s2 sda process can be applied for nitrogen removal from industrial wastewater without an external sulfur source in addition the sewer and effluent of anaerobic sewage treatment contain sulfide delgado vela et al 2015 wang et al 2009 zan et al 2021 which allows for the application of s2 sda for mainstream nitrogen removal furthermore bps0 is an intermediate of sulfide oxidation liu et al 2015 russ et al 2014 which is nontoxic noncorrosive and contains a high sulfur concentration could be recovered as a mineral source in s2 sda the recovered bps can be used as industrial raw material and it is an efficient donor for denitrification di capua et al 2016 bps can also be used to produce sulfide for heavy metal removal wang et al 2022 bps0 accumulation has been observed in s2 sda guo et al 2016 qin et al 2019 and liu et al 2015 found that over 99 of sulfide was converted into bps0 and retained in the reactor the general reaction for treating thiocyanate containing wastewater is described in eq 20 hung and pavlostathis 1997 the nitrogen in thiocyanate is converted into ammonium which cannot be removed during thiocyanate degradation the scn sda process can degrade thiocyanate and the produced ammonium can further be oxidised by anammox representing an economical and efficient treatment process 20 s c n 2 o 2 3 h 2 o h c o 3 s o 4 2 n h 4 h third the sda system is robust and the process control is simple the nitrite in the sulfur based denitrification stably accumulates under sulfur limiting conditions sulfur based denitrification preferentially uses nitrate instead of nitrite as the electron acceptor moreover anammox outcompetes sulfur based denitrification in nitrite consumption for example studies have found that with elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as the electron donor the nitrite uptake rates of anammox were 1 8 34 5 times that of sulfur based denitrification deng et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a thus anammox can cooperate with sulfur based denitrification for effective nitrogen removal in an sda system the growth rate and biomass yield of sob are comparable to those of anammox bacteria and the overgrowth risk of sob in the sda system can be considerably reduced in addition both anammox and sulfur based denitrification occur under anoxic conditions and the process control of sda is more efficient in contrast pna should be conducted under limited oxygen conditions to maintain a delicate balance between ammonium oxidising bacteria and anammox bacteria moreover anammox could partially compensate for alkalinity consumption for elemental sulfur based denitrification insufficient alkalinity deteriorates the performance of elemental sulfur based denitrification and the nitrogen removal performance is severely inhibited under ph conditions lower than 5 5 liu and koenig 2002 to control ph in the sulfur based denitrification reactor limestone was added or heterotrophic denitrification was introduced into the reactor liu et al 2009 the anammox reaction consumes 0 057 mol of protons per mol of ammonium removed lotti et al 2014 which could increase the buffering capacity of the sda system sda is an economical and energy efficient biological process in sda nitrate is reduced to nitrite and electron donor consumption is 60 less than that of denitrification the sda process can be applied for treating wastewater containing ammonium and sulfide thiocyanate for wastewater containing a limited amount of reduced sulfur compounds external reduced sulfur compounds i e thiosulfate and elemental sulfur can be introduced into the sda process thiosulfate is nontoxic and readily bioavailable for sob and it is an efficient external sulfur source in autotrophic denitrification cardoso et al 2006 found that the denitrification rate in the presence of thiosulfate was 4 6 and 9 5 times higher than those in the presence of sulfide and elemental sulfur respectively furthermore thiosulfate 1 4 1 7 usd kg no3 n is less costly than organics i e methanol 1 8 2 3 usd kg no3 n di capua et al 2019 elemental sulfur is widely used in nitrate nitrite removal from wastewater guo et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the cost of elemental sulfur is only 0 26 usd kg no3 n which accounts for only 15 19 of the cost of thiosulfate di capua et al 2019 besides the sda process has advantages in terms of co2 emission in wastewater treatment conventional nitrification and denitrification process has a large amount of carbon emission liu et al 2021 which is the primary driver of global climate change in contrast sda biotechnology considerably decreases carbon emissions because organics are not required in this autotrophic nitrogen removal system 7 challenges associated with the sda process despite the development of the sda process several challenges still limit its further implementation one major challenge is the fluctuation in substrate concentration which may cause sulfide or thiocyanate accumulation in the reactor thereby inhibiting anammox activity anammox bacteria are chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms with a low growth rate and biomass yield oshiki et al 2016 anammox bacteria inhibition in the combined system results in prolonged reactor recovery the sulfide loading rate of the reactor plays the most significant role in preventing anammox bacteria from the inhibitory effects of sulfide to prevent such effects the sda process should be conducted under sulfide limiting conditions deng et al 2021b russ et al 2014 other toxic compounds in industrial wastewater may also inhibit anammox which can cause a synergistic inhibition on anammox bacteria jin et al 2012 oshiki et al 2018 found that phenol and thiocyanate had a synergistic inhibitory effect on anammox and the specific anammox activity decreased by 90 under thiocyanate and phenol concentrations of 55 mgs l and 100 mg l respectively bps0 accumulation is another challenge associated with the sda process bps0 is an intermediate of sulfide thiocyanate and thiosulfate oxidation and a high concentration of bps0 accumulation in the reactor can influence the sda performance kleerebezem and mendez 2002 suggested that elemental sulfur accumulation may reduce biomass retention efficiency and the sulfide removal rate accumulated bps can also cause pipe blockage and secondary pollution chen et al 2016 moreover accumulated bps0 in sda reactors can hamper the mass transfer of substrates thereby limiting the denitrification and anammox activities in biological sulfide oxidation the produced bps0 exists as globules deposited inside or outside bacteria cells janssen et al 1996 and originates from different sulfide oxidation pathways in sob visser et al 1997 when s2 sda is operated under a high s n ratio complete elimination of sulfur pollution from wastewater can be achieved thus sulfide oxidation to bps0 is preferred in this case accumulated bps0 needs to be separated from the wastewater the bps0 is generally colloidal and hydrophilic which limits bps0 recovery sedimentation centrifugation membrane separation extraction and coagulation are effective techniques for bps0 recovery but they may increase the process complexity and operational cost cai et al 2017 the high sulfate production in the sda process is undesirable sulfate is generally considered nontoxic but discharged sulfate into freshwater is likely biologically reduced to toxic sulfide which could harm the ecosystem if the sulfate containing effluent does not elevate the background concentration such as in a marine environment the effects of the discharged sulfate can be ignored however when the effluent of the sda process is discharged into freshwater the sulfate concentration should be controlled and the sulfate discharge limits in industrial wastewater treatment typically vary from 250 to 1000 mg l runtti et al 2018 for treating high strength nitrogen wastewater by sda process incomplete sulfide oxidation is preferable thus bps0 can be recovered and sulfate is removed from wastewater besides elemental sulfur is more favourable than thiosulfate as the external sulfur source for sda process since sulfate production from elemental sulfur is 33 less than that from thiosulfate additionally the low solubility of elemental sulfur limits the application of the sda process elemental sulfur is particularly hydrophobic with a solubility as low as 5 ug l at 20 c and the dissolution rate of solid sulfur is the limiting step in sulfur based autotrophic denitrification koenig and liu 2001 however li et al 2019 reported that the nitrogen removal rate in the s0 sda reactor reached 4 1 kgn m3 d further research is needed to explore the relationship between the low solubility of elemental sulfur and the efficient nitrogen removal in s0 sda moreover elemental sulfur disproportionation may occur in the s0 sda system owing to the low solubility of elemental sulfur the reactor is normally packed with excessive elemental sulfur biological disproportionation is a chemolithotrophic process in which elemental sulfur is converted into sulfate and sulfide with a ratio of 1 3 as shown in eq 21 finster et al 1998 the disproportionation is conducted by sulfate reducing bacteria such as desulfovibrio sulfodismutans desulfocapsa thiozymogenes and desulfocapsa sulfoexigens finster 2008 disproportionation in s0 sda results in the consumption of more elemental sulfur in the reactor and the produced sulfide may inhibit anammox bacteria the produced sulfide may be present in the reactor effluent and cause environmental pollution 21 4 s 0 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 3 h s 5 h 8 future perspectives the sda process is an efficient and economical technique for nitrogen removal the feasibility and stability of the process have been investigated at a laboratory scale for the future development of this process kinetic investigation microbial analysis model evaluation and larger scale study are required investigating the diffusional limitation substrate distribution in aggregates and reaction kinetics will further elucidate the complicated bioreactions and underlying principles of the sda process which is essential for effective sda reactor design and optimisation although the functional bacteria in the sda process have been identified the metabolic properties interactions and spatial distribution of sob and anammox bacteria remain poorly understood further genomic and molecular studies such as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics can provide useful information about the microbial community genetics physiology and biochemistry these studies will also link environmental factors with the microbial community structure functional gene abundance and the nitrogen and sulfur metabolic pathways of the sda process the sda process is a complex system involving various substrates and bacterial populations developing mathematical models for the process is vital to further clarify the process dynamics design and operating conditions the metabolic pathways and molecular mechanisms of anammox have been well established kartal et al 2012 and mathematical models of the anammox process have been developed and widely applied to evaluate the process baeten et al 2019 however sulfur based denitrification modelling is yet to be fully achieved some sulfur oxidation metabolisms are still unclear and the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters of sulfur based denitrification are unavailable to develop a comprehensive spda model more efforts should be devoted to determining the metabolic pathways kinetic parameters and stoichiometric coefficients of sulfur based denitrification and the interactions between sob and anammox bacteria previous studies on the sda process have been performed at a laboratory scale with different reactor configurations and synthetic wastewater the performance of the sda process for larger scale practical wastewater treatment needs to be evaluated to verify its applicability careful control of the reactor to retain anammox bacteria and maintain a high anammox activity is crucial for the successful operation of the sda process biofilm or granular reactors have the advantage of enriching microorganisms owing to their high biomass concentrations efficient biomass retention resilience to toxicity and fluctuating loads and high nitrogen removal rate therefore such reactors are preferable for engineering application of spda process furthermore anammox bacteria are sensitive to various inhibitory substances in practical wastewater especially industrial wastewater the impacts of these toxic substances on sda should be explored 9 conclusions sda is an effective biological nitrogen removal process and it has the potential to extend the application of anammox based biotechnology in sewage and industrial wastewater treatment the sda system is robust because sob and anammox bacteria have a comparable growth rate and biomass yield and both bioprocesses occur in anoxic conditions the sda process successfully mitigates the toxicity of reduced sulfur compounds e g s2 and scn to anammox the sda process is an economical and sustainable approach for nitrogen removal because it can considerably save electron donor consumption reduce carbon emission simplify the treatment process and control system and recover mineral sources from wastewater despite these advantages the sda process also has some limitations in engineering application i the operational strategies should be optimized to reduce the effects of fluctuating influent and accumulated intermediates on reactor performance ii the elevated sulfate concentration in sda effluent is undesirable when it is discharged into freshwater more studies on the related kinetics genetics modelling and process scaling of the sda are required to better understand process dynamics and optimize the operating conditions in the future full scale implementation of the sda process will lead to significant savings in energy and better management of nutrient removal from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15494,nitrite can be transformed to nitrophenolic byproducts in sulfate radical oxidation processes sr aops these nitrophenols are highly mobile in subsurface and can potentially contaminate drinking water sources however their fate in a drinking water treatment remains ambiguous herein the removal and transformation of four nitrophenolic byproducts formed during a heat activated peroxydisulfate oxidation process i e 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid in a simulated drinking water treatment train were comprehensively examined the removal of these nitrophenolic compounds in coagulation by either aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride ranged from 3 8 to 13 4 in the chlorination process 4 nitrophenol was removed only by 45 4 in 24 h at a chlorine dose of 5 0 mg l the removal of the other three nitrophenolic byproducts were less than 20 reaction between nitrophenolic byproducts and chlorine via electrophilic substitution gave rise to their chlorinated derivatives chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts were more recalcitrant and toxic than their parent compounds but still a tiny fraction of them could undergo further oxidation to form trichloronitromethane this work implied that once nitrophenolic byproducts enter water source they can penetrate the drinking water treatment train and react with the residual chlorine in distribution pipelines to form more hazardous byproducts the findings raised additional concerns to the potential risk of the nitrophenolic byproducts formed in sr aops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrophenolic byproducts sulfate radical oxidation drinking water treatment coagulation chlorination disinfection byproducts 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are considered as promising technologies for water treatment and soil groundwater remediation zhou et al 2018 giannakis et al 2021 ganiyu et al 2022 so4 generated by the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds has a relatively high redox potential e0 2 5 3 1 vnhe that can degrade a wide spectrum of organic pollutants zhou et al 2018 however the formation of toxic byproducts in sr aops has raised growing concerns several studies demonstrated the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts when nitrite no2 was present in the reaction systems ji et al 2017 2018 2019 yang et al 2019 chen et al 2020 2021b yang et al 2022 more recently ammonium nh4 and amino acids were also found to be transformed to nitrophenolic byproducts in sr aops yang et al 2021a dong et al 2022 this is attributed to nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 generated from the oxidation of the inorganic nitrogen species by so4 for example no2 reacts with so4 to form no2 at a second order rate constant of 8 8 108 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 no2 can react with phenolic compounds or the phenolic moieties in natural organic matter nom macromolecules to form nitrophenolic byproducts yang et al 2019 due to the omnipresence of no2 and nom in the subsurface environment formation of nitrophenolic byproducts seems inevitable when sr aops are applied to remediate contaminated sites yang et al 2021b found that nitrophenolic compounds formed during sr aops were mostly distributed in soil waters which means that these byproducts are relatively soluble and mobile once formed they are readily transported long distance with runoffs therefore contaminate surface waters and groundwaters when the impacted waters are used as drinking water sources nitrophenolic byproducts would be potentially exposed to human beings to date however little is known concerning the fate of nitrophenolic byproducts in a drinking water treatment train conventional drinking water treatment usually consists of coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection processes to decrease turbidity remove color and odors and eliminate pathogens westerhoff et al 2005 na et al 2021 jin et al 2022 coagulation involves the addition of coagulants to alter the physical state of colloidal particles and facilitate their removal in sedimentation vik and eikebrokk 1988 aluminum and ferric salts are widely adopted as coagulants davis and edwards 2017 sillanpaa et al 2018 the coagulation process comprises two distinct stages sillanpää and matilainen 2015 first coagulant is rapidly dispersed into water via violent agitation then small particles condense into well defined aggregates via gentile agitation the aggregation mechanisms contain a combination of charge neutralization entrapment adsorption and complexation with coagulant ions the aggregates are allowed to settle under gravity and separated by filtration while the supernatant is transferred into the subsequent disinfection process in general coagulation is readily to remove higher molecular weight and hydrophobic organics while achieving less effective removal of lower molecular weight or more polar compounds vilgé ritter et al 1999 ji et al 2008 skaf et al 2020 huang et al 2021b liu et al 2022 unfortunately many emerging microcontaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals fall into this category thus poorly removed by coagulation westerhoff et al 2005 golbaz et al 2014 wang et al 2018 huang et al 2021a disinfection is applied in drinking water treatment before finished water is delivered to consumers through distribution systems cai et al 2020 chlorine chloramine chloride dioxide and ozone are the chemicals that can be used for disinfection but utilization of chlorine is most common out of these lu et al 2004 postigo and richardson 2014 yang et al 2018 chlorine can react with biomolecules in the cell membrane resulting in the loss of structural integrity and inducing the interruption of cellular processes huang et al 2011 usually the finished water should be disinfected at a free chlorine concentration range of 0 5 5 mg l for 30 min to ensure pathogen inactivation yang and cheng 2007 liu et al 2020 furthermore it is necessary to retain a certain amount of chlorine in pipe network in order to prevent the regrowth of microorganisms li et al 2019 based on chinese national standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2006 2006 the residual chlorine content at the beginning and end of the pipe network must be no less than 0 3 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively meanwhile organic contaminants that are not removed by coagulation sedimentation filtration can also react with chlorine during disinfection and in the distribution system rebenne et al 1996 deborde and von gunten 2008 qin et al 2021 sheng et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the reaction between chlorine with phenol occurs through an electrophilic attack at a second rate constant of 2 19 104 m 1s 1 gallard and gunten 2002 lau et al 2016 the main initial products are 2 and 4 chlorophenol because oh group directs electrophilic substitution at the ortho and para positions prasse et al 2020 subsequent reactions with chlorine yield di and tri chlorinated phenols these chlorinated phenols can further undergo ring cleavage decarboxylation and hydrolysis to form disinfection byproducts including chloroform and chloroacetic acids werschkun et al 2012 zhai et al 2022 electron withdrawing substituents lead to the decreasing reactivity of the substituted phenolic rings gallard and gunten 2002 for instance 4 bromo and 4 iodo phenol show lower chlorination reactivity with second rate constants of 2 6 103 m 1s 1 and 2 01 103 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 wang et al 2021b respectively due to deactivation by bromide or iodide atom as a typical electron withdrawing group nitro group would probably make nitrophenolic byproducts resistant to chlorine attack however detailed reaction kinetics and pathways are still ambiguous in this study formation of nitrophenolic byproducts in a heat activated pds heat pds oxidation process and their transformation and fate in a simulated drinking water treatment train that followed were comprehensively examined the water treatment train consists of coagulation sedimentation and chlorination processes the results indicate that conventional water treatment processes are largely ineffective to these nitrophenolic products in addition they are to be transformed to chlorinated derivatives of increased toxicity in water distribution system with residual chlorine available thus the nitrophenolic byproducts formed in sr aops could pose a potential threat to public health 2 materials and

the supporting information si after 12 h incubation the remaining sample solution was chilled in the ice bath for the following coagulation experiment after the heat pds treatment appropriate amounts of fecl3 or al2 so4 3 were added in the sample solution immediately and rapidly mixed using a dragonlab os40 s stirrer dragonlab china at 300 rpm for 1 min followed by the slow mixing at 50 rpm for 15

na2so3 was added to stop the reaction controls without either heat pds treatment or coagulation were prepared concurrently for further investigation chlorination of sole nitrophenolic byproduct and their chlorinated derivative was also conducted as described in text s2 2 4 analytical methods nitrophenolic byproducts and their chlorinated derivatives in nom samples were analyzed by an agilent

performed using gaussian 16 quantum chemistry computation package the optimization of the molecular geometries of the nitrophenolic compounds and their chlorinated byproducts were performed at the b3lyp 6 31 g d p level of theory all the computed frequencies were positive for the optimized structures indicating the energy stability of the optimized structures the nucleophilicity index n can be simply calculated as follows domingo and perez 2013 zhong et al 2022 1 n e h o m o n u e h o m o t c e where e h o m o n u is homo energy of nucleophilic compounds e h o m o t c e is homo energy of tetracyanoethylene tce tce has been taken as a reference because it has the lowest homo energy in a series of molecules giving a positive nucleophilicity value for various nucleophilic compounds 2 6 toxicity assay the acute toxicity of transformation products of nitrophenolic compounds after coagulation and chlorination was assessed by the luminescent bacteria test according to the standard method published by the ministry of ecology and environment of china gb t 15441 1995 1995 the preparation of the sample solution was described in text s5 a lyophilization agent of p phosphoreum t3 spp obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china was used as the source of luminescence the bacteria were activated in 1 ml of 2 nacl solution for 2 min then diluted with appropriate amounts of 3 nacl solution subsequently 180 μl of the sample solution was mixed with 20 μl bacteria solution in 96 well cell culture plates for 15 min then the luminescence intensity of the mixture was analyzed by ensight multimode microplate reader coupled with kaleido workflow software perkinelmer ma usa control groups with 3 nacl were measured concurrently the toxicity test for each sample was carried out with eight replicates the toxicity data were recorded as the luminescence inhibition versus the blank huang et al 2017 bodini et al 2018 he et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of nitrophenols during heat pds oxidation in accordance with prior studies yang et al 2019 2022 four main nitrophenolic products i e 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were identified during the heat pds oxidation of nom in presence of 0 1 mm no2 fig s1 as illustrated in fig 1 a concentrations of the nitrophenols increased monotonically in the solution the formation of 4 nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid reached 0 227 and 0 349 μm respectively in 12 h di nitrophenols were formed later and the yields of 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid reached 0 322 and 0 161 μm in 12 h respectively 3 2 removal of nitrophenols by coagulation after the heat pds treatment the water samples were coagulated using fecl3 or al2 so4 3 as the coagulants results showed that the nitrated byproducts were only marginally removed in this process at the fecl3 dose of 5 mg l as fe the concentrations of 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid were only reduced by 12 4 7 2 and 10 7 respectively fig 1a no attenuation of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid was found at all this is probably related to the hydrophilicity of these compounds in general coagulation is ineffective for the removal of hydrophilic organic molecules golbaz et al 2014 the pka of 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were 7 15 4 09 3 44 and 1 57 respectively aptula et al 2002 liptak et al 2002 chandrasekaram et al 2021 wu et al 2022 at ph 7 0 approximately 41 of 4 nitrophenol is presented as a deprotonated phenolate anion the other three are almost completely deprotonated this might explain their poor removal during coagulation previous work found that high coagulant dose facilitated the removal of phenolic compounds because of the sweep flocculation effect golbaz et al 2014 fig 2 depicts the removal of nitrophenols at varying coagulant doses when fecl3 dose increased from 5 to 20 mg l as fe the removal of 4 nitrophenol increased from 12 4 to 49 3 still not satisfying the removal of the other three nitrated byproducts was even worse fig 2a alum coagulation at equivalent dose achieved similar removals fig 2b in brief these nitrated aromatic compounds appeared to be unlikely effectively removed by coagulation 3 3 transformation of nitrophenols by chlorination the residual concentrations of 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid in the sample after coagulation sedimentation were 0 215 0 312 0 328 and 0 161 μm respectively the samples were further treated with 5 0 mg l free chlorine it was found that the mono nitrated byproducts were slowly removed the concentration of 4 nitrophenol decreased from 0 215 to 0 121 μm in 24 h fig 1a corresponding to a removal of 45 4 the removal of the other nitrated byproducts by chlorination was conspicuously less only 16 3 and 17 2 of the 2 4 dinitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid were gone in 24 h respectively no appreciated removal of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid was observed overall 4 nitrophenol was more readily removed by chlorination followed by 2 4 dinitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid was least reactive toward chlorine considering the disinfection process usually takes only a few minutes to less than 1 h during drinking water treatment these nitrated byproducts will be barely removed in this process and will enter the distribution system along with the removal of the nitrophenols their chlorinated derivatives were generated a total of 2 chlorinated products i e 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol were found for 4 nitrophenol fig s1 their concentrations reached 0 071 and 0 019 μm respectively in 24 h fig 1b it can be seen that chlorination occurred on the para and or ortho positions of the hydroxyl group on the molecule which is in accordance with the well recognized electrophilic substitution mechanism only one chlorinated derivative i e 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol was found for 2 4 dinitrophenol its concentration was under the detection limit in the first 6 h and increased slowly to 0 033 μm after 24 h chlorination fig 1b the chlorinated products of 5 nitrosalicylic acid were analyzed by ms fig s1 based on the isotopic signatures of cl 35cl 37cl 3 1 and the molecular weight the peak of m z 216 is attributed to its mono chlorinated derivative with the chlorine substituted on the ortho site of the hydroxyl group this compound is accompanied by an m 2 isotope m z 218 of 1 3 in intensity because of the lack of authentic standards its formation cannot be quantified however according to the abundance of the ms peak the formation of chlorinated 5 nitrosalicylic acid increased with the reaction time fig s2 chlorinated derivatives of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were not detected thus the nitrophenolic byproducts escaped from coagulation sedimentation will be slowly transformed to their chlorinated derivatives in the water distribution pipelines with residual chlorine to better understand the transformation of the nitrophenolic byproducts in the water distribution pipelines with chlorine residue each of the nitrophenolic byproducts 10 μm and their chlorinated derivatives were treated with free chlorine and their reaction rates were determined fig s3 and fig s4 in general the reaction was first order with respect to the concentrations of both free chlorine and nitrophenol fig s3 the second order rate constants between free chlorine and nitrophenols khocl np are listed in table 1 accordingly the respective half life times in the presence of 0 3 mg l chlorine residue are calculated and also included in the table it should be noted that except 4 nitrophenol none of the nitrophenolic byproducts would be transformed significantly in drinking water distribution systems 4 nitrophenol is more reactive than the others toward free chlorine with a second order rate constant of 2 43 102 m 1s 1 corresponding to a half life time of 0 47 d the khocl np values of 2 4 dinitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid are 1 17 m 1s 1 and 0 09 m 1s 1 respectively the half life times are a few months thus essentially no loss would occur in the water distribution system no degradation of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid was found in the chlorination reaction fig s5 which was consistent with the observation in the nom sample overall the nitrophenols are significantly less reactive than phenol 2 19 104 m 1s 1 toward free chlorine this is because the nitro group is highly electron withdrawing it passivates the phenolic ring and makes it less prone to chlorine attack the global nucleophilicity index n was used to quantify the tendency of a molecule toward electrophilic attack domingo and perez 2013 fig 3 shows that a good positive relationship between the nucleophilicity index of a nitrophenol and the second order rate constant of its chlorination reaction the most reactive one 4 nitrophenol has the highest n value 8 06 ev 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 2 4 dinitrophenol with close n values of 6 99 and 7 04 ev respectively also have similar chlorination rate constants fig 3 it should be noted that except 4 nitrophenol the nitrophenolic byproducts would be barely transformed in drinking water distribution systems with typical residual chlorine concentration in accordance with the observation in the nom sample 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol were formed sequentially during the chlorination of 4 nitrophenol at the free chlorine dose of 100 μm the yield of 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol increased to a temporal maximum 6 71 μm in 15 min then gradually decreased 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol was formed relatively slowly and increased continuously to 9 60 μm in 9 h fig 4 a a higher chlorine dose accelerated the formation and transformation of the 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol fig s6 however it did not promote the further transformation of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol it should be noticed that the sum of 4 nitrophenol 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol was balanced at approximately 10 μm during the investigated time span thus it means that chlorine substitution is probably the only transformation pathway of 4 nitrophenol during chlorination and 4 nitrophenol will be almost quantitatively transformed to 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol in water distribution systems the second order rate constant of the chlorination of 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol was determined to be 21 00 m 1s 1 table 1 in general the relationship between the chlorination rate constant and the global nucleophilicity index determined for nitrophenols also applies to their chlorinated derivatives fig 3 the n index of 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol was calculated to be 7 68 ev fig 3 lower than that of the parent compound 4 nitrophenol 8 06 ev the n value of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol is even lower only 7 34 ev fig 3 it means that the substitution of chlorine atoms on the phenolic ring further decreased its electron density using the second order rate constants of the chlorination of 4 nitrophenol and 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol in table 1 and assuming free chlorine concentration remained constant during the reaction the concentrations of its chlorinated products can be calculated using the following equations based on pseudo first order kinetic model eq 2 and 3 1r n p k 1 c l n p k 2 c l 2 n p 2 c c l n p t k 1 c n p 0 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t 3 c c l 2 n p t c n p 0 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 e k 1 t k 1 1 e k 2 t in the equations k1 and k2 represent the pseudo first order rate constants of the reactions they can be obtained by multiplying the second order rate constants with the free chlorine concentration as shown in fig 4a and fig s6 the results of the model prediction fit the experimental data precisely 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol was the only product found during the chlorination of 2 4 dinitrophenol the yield of 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol increased slowly to 1 58 μm in 9 h in presence of 100 μm free chlorine fig 4b and increasing the chlorine dose accelerated the reaction fig s7 besides its formation is also well predicted by the first order reaction model fig 4b and fig s7 indicating chlorine electrophilic substitution was the only reaction pathway the n value of 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol 6 74 ev is lower than that of the parent compound fig 3 2 4 dinitrophenol 7 04 ev and its further transformation can be neglected 3 4 formation of tcnm during chlorination n dbps formation was also monitored during the chlorination of the water samples after heat pds and coagulation treatments in this study only trace level tcnm was detected the yield was 3 12 nm at 24 h fig 5 for comparison tcnm yield from the same sample without heat pds pre oxidation only after coagulation sedimentation was only 1 66 nm we hypothesized the increased formation of tcnm was related to the nitrophenolic byproducts especially 4 nitrophenol formed during the heat pds treatment although the chlorinated nitrophenols are significantly less reactive than the parent compound they can still slowly undergo chlorination hydrolysis ring cleavage and decarboxylation to form tcnm in the presence of free chlorine fig s8 previous research has demonstrated that nitrophenolic compounds can serve as the precursors of tcnm in chlorination wang et al 2021a to test this hypothesis the formation of tcnm during the chlorination of each nitrophenolic byproduct 10 μm was measured tcnm yields of 3 41 and 0 908 nm were found from 4 nitrophenol and 2 4 dinitrophenol respectively at a chlorine dose of 100 μm the values increased to 9 52 and 1 59 nm at the free chlorine dose of 200 μm fig s9 thus it can be inferred that nitrophenolic byproducts formed in heat pds treatment might be an important precursor of tcnm generated during chlorination it should be noted that tcnm features cytotoxicity and genotoxicity which may cause adverse health effects via inhalation and dermal contact therefore the potential formation of tcnm in chlorination should be fully assessed when nitrophenolic byproducts are present in the raw water 3 5 toxicity assessment the toxicity of the water solution after the multi step treatments including heat pds oxidation coagulation and chlorination was assessed by the luminescent bacteria test comparing with the 3 nacl control the luminescence intensity was almost not inhibited in the nom sample without any treatment fig 6 after 12 h heat pds treatment the inhibition ratio increased to 9 2 which might arise from the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts coagulation did not change the toxicity because nitrophenolic byproducts were almost not removed in this process along with chlorination the concentration of nitrophenols slowly decreased but the toxicity dramatically increased the inhibition was 48 3 in 6 h and the value increased to 63 4 in 24 h it should be noted that the increasing toxicity showed a positive relationship with the formation of chlorinated nitrophenolic compounds fig 6 these results indicated that the chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts are more toxic than their parent compounds luminescent bacteria test of each individual nitrophenolic compound verified this hypothesis fig s10 one can see that the toxicity follows the order of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol 2 4 nitrophenol 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid 5 nitrosalicylic acid 4 nitrophenol overall the toxicity could generally increase with the increasing number of chlorine or nitro groups thus the formation of chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts may cause potential risk to human health 4 conclusions four nitrophenolic byproducts i e 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were formed during the heat pds oxidation their removal and transformation in a simulated drinking water treatment train was systematically investigated during coagulation by al2 so4 3 or fecl3 the nitrophenolic byproducts were only marginally removed in the chlorination process nitrophenolic byproducts were slowly transformed to their chlorinated derivatives of which a tiny fraction underwent further oxidation to form tcnm these chlorination reactions are expected to mainly occur in water distribution systems due to the electron withdrawing nature chlorine atoms can deactivate the phenolic ring thus chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts are more resistant to the reaction with free chlorine than their parent compounds once formed they tend to accumulate in water and can be exposed to customers toxicity test by p phosphoreum t3 spp revealed that formation of chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts may increase the acute toxicity of the water in summary this work indicates that nitrophenolic byproducts can probably penerate drinking water treatment train and react with the residual chlorine to form more toxic chlorinated nitrophenols in distribution pipelines thus particular attention should be paid to the formation of nitrophenolic

these nitrophenolic compounds in coagulation by either aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride ranged from 3 8 to 13 4 in the chlorination process 4 nitrophenol was removed only by 45 4 in 24 h at a chlorine dose of 5 0 mg l the removal of the other three nitrophenolic byproducts were less than 20 reaction between nitrophenolic byproducts and chlorine via electrophilic substitution gave rise to their chlorinated derivatives chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts were more recalcitrant and toxic than their parent compounds but still a tiny fraction of them could undergo further oxidation to form trichloronitromethane this work implied that once nitrophenolic byproducts enter water source they can penetrate the drinking water treatment train and react with the residual chlorine in distribution pipelines to form more hazardous byproducts the findings raised additional concerns to the potential risk of the nitrophenolic byproducts formed in sr aops graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrophenolic byproducts sulfate radical oxidation drinking water treatment coagulation chlorination disinfection byproducts 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes sr aops are considered as promising technologies for water treatment and soil groundwater remediation zhou et al 2018 giannakis et al 2021 ganiyu et al 2022 so4 generated by the activation of peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds has a relatively high redox potential e0 2 5 3 1 vnhe that can degrade a wide spectrum of organic pollutants zhou et al 2018 however the formation of toxic byproducts in sr aops has raised growing concerns several studies demonstrated the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts when nitrite no2 was present in the reaction systems ji et al 2017 2018 2019 yang et al 2019 chen et al 2020 2021b yang et al 2022 more recently ammonium nh4 and amino acids were also found to be transformed to nitrophenolic byproducts in sr aops yang et al 2021a dong et al 2022 this is attributed to nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 generated from the oxidation of the inorganic nitrogen species by so4 for example no2 reacts with so4 to form no2 at a second order rate constant of 8 8 108 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 no2 can react with phenolic compounds or the phenolic moieties in natural organic matter nom macromolecules to form nitrophenolic byproducts yang et al 2019 due to the omnipresence of no2 and nom in the subsurface environment formation of nitrophenolic byproducts seems inevitable when sr aops are applied to remediate contaminated sites yang et al 2021b found that nitrophenolic compounds formed during sr aops were mostly distributed in soil waters which means that these byproducts are relatively soluble and mobile once formed they are readily transported long distance with runoffs therefore contaminate surface waters and groundwaters when the impacted waters are used as drinking water sources nitrophenolic byproducts would be potentially exposed to human beings to date however little is known concerning the fate of nitrophenolic byproducts in a drinking water treatment train conventional drinking water treatment usually consists of coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection processes to decrease turbidity remove color and odors and eliminate pathogens westerhoff et al 2005 na et al 2021 jin et al 2022 coagulation involves the addition of coagulants to alter the physical state of colloidal particles and facilitate their removal in sedimentation vik and eikebrokk 1988 aluminum and ferric salts are widely adopted as coagulants davis and edwards 2017 sillanpaa et al 2018 the coagulation process comprises two distinct stages sillanpää and matilainen 2015 first coagulant is rapidly dispersed into water via violent agitation then small particles condense into well defined aggregates via gentile agitation the aggregation mechanisms contain a combination of charge neutralization entrapment adsorption and complexation with coagulant ions the aggregates are allowed to settle under gravity and separated by filtration while the supernatant is transferred into the subsequent disinfection process in general coagulation is readily to remove higher molecular weight and hydrophobic organics while achieving less effective removal of lower molecular weight or more polar compounds vilgé ritter et al 1999 ji et al 2008 skaf et al 2020 huang et al 2021b liu et al 2022 unfortunately many emerging microcontaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals and pharmaceuticals fall into this category thus poorly removed by coagulation westerhoff et al 2005 golbaz et al 2014 wang et al 2018 huang et al 2021a disinfection is applied in drinking water treatment before finished water is delivered to consumers through distribution systems cai et al 2020 chlorine chloramine chloride dioxide and ozone are the chemicals that can be used for disinfection but utilization of chlorine is most common out of these lu et al 2004 postigo and richardson 2014 yang et al 2018 chlorine can react with biomolecules in the cell membrane resulting in the loss of structural integrity and inducing the interruption of cellular processes huang et al 2011 usually the finished water should be disinfected at a free chlorine concentration range of 0 5 5 mg l for 30 min to ensure pathogen inactivation yang and cheng 2007 liu et al 2020 furthermore it is necessary to retain a certain amount of chlorine in pipe network in order to prevent the regrowth of microorganisms li et al 2019 based on chinese national standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2006 2006 the residual chlorine content at the beginning and end of the pipe network must be no less than 0 3 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively meanwhile organic contaminants that are not removed by coagulation sedimentation filtration can also react with chlorine during disinfection and in the distribution system rebenne et al 1996 deborde and von gunten 2008 qin et al 2021 sheng et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 the reaction between chlorine with phenol occurs through an electrophilic attack at a second rate constant of 2 19 104 m 1s 1 gallard and gunten 2002 lau et al 2016 the main initial products are 2 and 4 chlorophenol because oh group directs electrophilic substitution at the ortho and para positions prasse et al 2020 subsequent reactions with chlorine yield di and tri chlorinated phenols these chlorinated phenols can further undergo ring cleavage decarboxylation and hydrolysis to form disinfection byproducts including chloroform and chloroacetic acids werschkun et al 2012 zhai et al 2022 electron withdrawing substituents lead to the decreasing reactivity of the substituted phenolic rings gallard and gunten 2002 for instance 4 bromo and 4 iodo phenol show lower chlorination reactivity with second rate constants of 2 6 103 m 1s 1 and 2 01 103 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 wang et al 2021b respectively due to deactivation by bromide or iodide atom as a typical electron withdrawing group nitro group would probably make nitrophenolic byproducts resistant to chlorine attack however detailed reaction kinetics and pathways are still ambiguous in this study formation of nitrophenolic byproducts in a heat activated pds heat pds oxidation process and their transformation and fate in a simulated drinking water treatment train that followed were comprehensively examined the water treatment train consists of coagulation sedimentation and chlorination processes the results indicate that conventional water treatment processes are largely ineffective to these nitrophenolic products in addition they are to be transformed to chlorinated derivatives of increased toxicity in water distribution system with residual chlorine available thus the nitrophenolic byproducts formed in sr aops could pose a potential threat to public health 2 materials and

na2so3 was added to stop the reaction controls without either heat pds treatment or coagulation were prepared concurrently for further investigation chlorination of sole nitrophenolic byproduct and their chlorinated derivative was also conducted as described in text s2 2 4 analytical methods nitrophenolic byproducts and their chlorinated derivatives in nom samples were analyzed by an agilent

performed using gaussian 16 quantum chemistry computation package the optimization of the molecular geometries of the nitrophenolic compounds and their chlorinated byproducts were performed at the b3lyp 6 31 g d p level of theory all the computed frequencies were positive for the optimized structures indicating the energy stability of the optimized structures the nucleophilicity index n can be simply calculated as follows domingo and perez 2013 zhong et al 2022 1 n e h o m o n u e h o m o t c e where e h o m o n u is homo energy of nucleophilic compounds e h o m o t c e is homo energy of tetracyanoethylene tce tce has been taken as a reference because it has the lowest homo energy in a series of molecules giving a positive nucleophilicity value for various nucleophilic compounds 2 6 toxicity assay the acute toxicity of transformation products of nitrophenolic compounds after coagulation and chlorination was assessed by the luminescent bacteria test according to the standard method published by the ministry of ecology and environment of china gb t 15441 1995 1995 the preparation of the sample solution was described in text s5 a lyophilization agent of p phosphoreum t3 spp obtained from the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china was used as the source of luminescence the bacteria were activated in 1 ml of 2 nacl solution for 2 min then diluted with appropriate amounts of 3 nacl solution subsequently 180 μl of the sample solution was mixed with 20 μl bacteria solution in 96 well cell culture plates for 15 min then the luminescence intensity of the mixture was analyzed by ensight multimode microplate reader coupled with kaleido workflow software perkinelmer ma usa control groups with 3 nacl were measured concurrently the toxicity test for each sample was carried out with eight replicates the toxicity data were recorded as the luminescence inhibition versus the blank huang et al 2017 bodini et al 2018 he et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of nitrophenols during heat pds oxidation in accordance with prior studies yang et al 2019 2022 four main nitrophenolic products i e 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were identified during the heat pds oxidation of nom in presence of 0 1 mm no2 fig s1 as illustrated in fig 1 a concentrations of the nitrophenols increased monotonically in the solution the formation of 4 nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid reached 0 227 and 0 349 μm respectively in 12 h di nitrophenols were formed later and the yields of 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid reached 0 322 and 0 161 μm in 12 h respectively 3 2 removal of nitrophenols by coagulation after the heat pds treatment the water samples were coagulated using fecl3 or al2 so4 3 as the coagulants results showed that the nitrated byproducts were only marginally removed in this process at the fecl3 dose of 5 mg l as fe the concentrations of 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid were only reduced by 12 4 7 2 and 10 7 respectively fig 1a no attenuation of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid was found at all this is probably related to the hydrophilicity of these compounds in general coagulation is ineffective for the removal of hydrophilic organic molecules golbaz et al 2014 the pka of 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were 7 15 4 09 3 44 and 1 57 respectively aptula et al 2002 liptak et al 2002 chandrasekaram et al 2021 wu et al 2022 at ph 7 0 approximately 41 of 4 nitrophenol is presented as a deprotonated phenolate anion the other three are almost completely deprotonated this might explain their poor removal during coagulation previous work found that high coagulant dose facilitated the removal of phenolic compounds because of the sweep flocculation effect golbaz et al 2014 fig 2 depicts the removal of nitrophenols at varying coagulant doses when fecl3 dose increased from 5 to 20 mg l as fe the removal of 4 nitrophenol increased from 12 4 to 49 3 still not satisfying the removal of the other three nitrated byproducts was even worse fig 2a alum coagulation at equivalent dose achieved similar removals fig 2b in brief these nitrated aromatic compounds appeared to be unlikely effectively removed by coagulation 3 3 transformation of nitrophenols by chlorination the residual concentrations of 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid in the sample after coagulation sedimentation were 0 215 0 312 0 328 and 0 161 μm respectively the samples were further treated with 5 0 mg l free chlorine it was found that the mono nitrated byproducts were slowly removed the concentration of 4 nitrophenol decreased from 0 215 to 0 121 μm in 24 h fig 1a corresponding to a removal of 45 4 the removal of the other nitrated byproducts by chlorination was conspicuously less only 16 3 and 17 2 of the 2 4 dinitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid were gone in 24 h respectively no appreciated removal of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid was observed overall 4 nitrophenol was more readily removed by chlorination followed by 2 4 dinitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid was least reactive toward chlorine considering the disinfection process usually takes only a few minutes to less than 1 h during drinking water treatment these nitrated byproducts will be barely removed in this process and will enter the distribution system along with the removal of the nitrophenols their chlorinated derivatives were generated a total of 2 chlorinated products i e 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol were found for 4 nitrophenol fig s1 their concentrations reached 0 071 and 0 019 μm respectively in 24 h fig 1b it can be seen that chlorination occurred on the para and or ortho positions of the hydroxyl group on the molecule which is in accordance with the well recognized electrophilic substitution mechanism only one chlorinated derivative i e 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol was found for 2 4 dinitrophenol its concentration was under the detection limit in the first 6 h and increased slowly to 0 033 μm after 24 h chlorination fig 1b the chlorinated products of 5 nitrosalicylic acid were analyzed by ms fig s1 based on the isotopic signatures of cl 35cl 37cl 3 1 and the molecular weight the peak of m z 216 is attributed to its mono chlorinated derivative with the chlorine substituted on the ortho site of the hydroxyl group this compound is accompanied by an m 2 isotope m z 218 of 1 3 in intensity because of the lack of authentic standards its formation cannot be quantified however according to the abundance of the ms peak the formation of chlorinated 5 nitrosalicylic acid increased with the reaction time fig s2 chlorinated derivatives of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were not detected thus the nitrophenolic byproducts escaped from coagulation sedimentation will be slowly transformed to their chlorinated derivatives in the water distribution pipelines with residual chlorine to better understand the transformation of the nitrophenolic byproducts in the water distribution pipelines with chlorine residue each of the nitrophenolic byproducts 10 μm and their chlorinated derivatives were treated with free chlorine and their reaction rates were determined fig s3 and fig s4 in general the reaction was first order with respect to the concentrations of both free chlorine and nitrophenol fig s3 the second order rate constants between free chlorine and nitrophenols khocl np are listed in table 1 accordingly the respective half life times in the presence of 0 3 mg l chlorine residue are calculated and also included in the table it should be noted that except 4 nitrophenol none of the nitrophenolic byproducts would be transformed significantly in drinking water distribution systems 4 nitrophenol is more reactive than the others toward free chlorine with a second order rate constant of 2 43 102 m 1s 1 corresponding to a half life time of 0 47 d the khocl np values of 2 4 dinitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid are 1 17 m 1s 1 and 0 09 m 1s 1 respectively the half life times are a few months thus essentially no loss would occur in the water distribution system no degradation of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid was found in the chlorination reaction fig s5 which was consistent with the observation in the nom sample overall the nitrophenols are significantly less reactive than phenol 2 19 104 m 1s 1 toward free chlorine this is because the nitro group is highly electron withdrawing it passivates the phenolic ring and makes it less prone to chlorine attack the global nucleophilicity index n was used to quantify the tendency of a molecule toward electrophilic attack domingo and perez 2013 fig 3 shows that a good positive relationship between the nucleophilicity index of a nitrophenol and the second order rate constant of its chlorination reaction the most reactive one 4 nitrophenol has the highest n value 8 06 ev 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 2 4 dinitrophenol with close n values of 6 99 and 7 04 ev respectively also have similar chlorination rate constants fig 3 it should be noted that except 4 nitrophenol the nitrophenolic byproducts would be barely transformed in drinking water distribution systems with typical residual chlorine concentration in accordance with the observation in the nom sample 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol were formed sequentially during the chlorination of 4 nitrophenol at the free chlorine dose of 100 μm the yield of 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol increased to a temporal maximum 6 71 μm in 15 min then gradually decreased 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol was formed relatively slowly and increased continuously to 9 60 μm in 9 h fig 4 a a higher chlorine dose accelerated the formation and transformation of the 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol fig s6 however it did not promote the further transformation of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol it should be noticed that the sum of 4 nitrophenol 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol and 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol was balanced at approximately 10 μm during the investigated time span thus it means that chlorine substitution is probably the only transformation pathway of 4 nitrophenol during chlorination and 4 nitrophenol will be almost quantitatively transformed to 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol in water distribution systems the second order rate constant of the chlorination of 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol was determined to be 21 00 m 1s 1 table 1 in general the relationship between the chlorination rate constant and the global nucleophilicity index determined for nitrophenols also applies to their chlorinated derivatives fig 3 the n index of 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol was calculated to be 7 68 ev fig 3 lower than that of the parent compound 4 nitrophenol 8 06 ev the n value of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol is even lower only 7 34 ev fig 3 it means that the substitution of chlorine atoms on the phenolic ring further decreased its electron density using the second order rate constants of the chlorination of 4 nitrophenol and 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol in table 1 and assuming free chlorine concentration remained constant during the reaction the concentrations of its chlorinated products can be calculated using the following equations based on pseudo first order kinetic model eq 2 and 3 1r n p k 1 c l n p k 2 c l 2 n p 2 c c l n p t k 1 c n p 0 k 2 k 1 e k 1 t e k 2 t 3 c c l 2 n p t c n p 0 k 2 k 1 k 2 1 e k 1 t k 1 1 e k 2 t in the equations k1 and k2 represent the pseudo first order rate constants of the reactions they can be obtained by multiplying the second order rate constants with the free chlorine concentration as shown in fig 4a and fig s6 the results of the model prediction fit the experimental data precisely 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol was the only product found during the chlorination of 2 4 dinitrophenol the yield of 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol increased slowly to 1 58 μm in 9 h in presence of 100 μm free chlorine fig 4b and increasing the chlorine dose accelerated the reaction fig s7 besides its formation is also well predicted by the first order reaction model fig 4b and fig s7 indicating chlorine electrophilic substitution was the only reaction pathway the n value of 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol 6 74 ev is lower than that of the parent compound fig 3 2 4 dinitrophenol 7 04 ev and its further transformation can be neglected 3 4 formation of tcnm during chlorination n dbps formation was also monitored during the chlorination of the water samples after heat pds and coagulation treatments in this study only trace level tcnm was detected the yield was 3 12 nm at 24 h fig 5 for comparison tcnm yield from the same sample without heat pds pre oxidation only after coagulation sedimentation was only 1 66 nm we hypothesized the increased formation of tcnm was related to the nitrophenolic byproducts especially 4 nitrophenol formed during the heat pds treatment although the chlorinated nitrophenols are significantly less reactive than the parent compound they can still slowly undergo chlorination hydrolysis ring cleavage and decarboxylation to form tcnm in the presence of free chlorine fig s8 previous research has demonstrated that nitrophenolic compounds can serve as the precursors of tcnm in chlorination wang et al 2021a to test this hypothesis the formation of tcnm during the chlorination of each nitrophenolic byproduct 10 μm was measured tcnm yields of 3 41 and 0 908 nm were found from 4 nitrophenol and 2 4 dinitrophenol respectively at a chlorine dose of 100 μm the values increased to 9 52 and 1 59 nm at the free chlorine dose of 200 μm fig s9 thus it can be inferred that nitrophenolic byproducts formed in heat pds treatment might be an important precursor of tcnm generated during chlorination it should be noted that tcnm features cytotoxicity and genotoxicity which may cause adverse health effects via inhalation and dermal contact therefore the potential formation of tcnm in chlorination should be fully assessed when nitrophenolic byproducts are present in the raw water 3 5 toxicity assessment the toxicity of the water solution after the multi step treatments including heat pds oxidation coagulation and chlorination was assessed by the luminescent bacteria test comparing with the 3 nacl control the luminescence intensity was almost not inhibited in the nom sample without any treatment fig 6 after 12 h heat pds treatment the inhibition ratio increased to 9 2 which might arise from the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts coagulation did not change the toxicity because nitrophenolic byproducts were almost not removed in this process along with chlorination the concentration of nitrophenols slowly decreased but the toxicity dramatically increased the inhibition was 48 3 in 6 h and the value increased to 63 4 in 24 h it should be noted that the increasing toxicity showed a positive relationship with the formation of chlorinated nitrophenolic compounds fig 6 these results indicated that the chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts are more toxic than their parent compounds luminescent bacteria test of each individual nitrophenolic compound verified this hypothesis fig s10 one can see that the toxicity follows the order of 2 6 dichloro 4 nitrophenol 2 chloro 4 6 dinitrophenol 2 chloro 4 nitrophenol 2 4 nitrophenol 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid 5 nitrosalicylic acid 4 nitrophenol overall the toxicity could generally increase with the increasing number of chlorine or nitro groups thus the formation of chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts may cause potential risk to human health 4 conclusions four nitrophenolic byproducts i e 4 nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were formed during the heat pds oxidation their removal and transformation in a simulated drinking water treatment train was systematically investigated during coagulation by al2 so4 3 or fecl3 the nitrophenolic byproducts were only marginally removed in the chlorination process nitrophenolic byproducts were slowly transformed to their chlorinated derivatives of which a tiny fraction underwent further oxidation to form tcnm these chlorination reactions are expected to mainly occur in water distribution systems due to the electron withdrawing nature chlorine atoms can deactivate the phenolic ring thus chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts are more resistant to the reaction with free chlorine than their parent compounds once formed they tend to accumulate in water and can be exposed to customers toxicity test by p phosphoreum t3 spp revealed that formation of chlorinated nitrophenolic byproducts may increase the acute toxicity of the water in summary this work indicates that nitrophenolic byproducts can probably penerate drinking water treatment train and react with the residual chlorine to form more toxic chlorinated nitrophenols in distribution pipelines thus particular attention should be paid to the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts when sr aops are applied to remediate contaminated subsurface declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
