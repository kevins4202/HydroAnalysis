5645,water flow velocity is of great importance in quantifying overland water flow hydrodynamics related to rainfall infiltration runoff energy and soil erosion mixing the straw into the cultivated soil can change its physical properties and in turn affect the velocity of water flow laboratory investigations were made to measure the velocities of rainfall runoff water flow under four incorporation rates 0 2 4 and 8 ton ha three rainfall intensities 80 120 and 160 mm h and three slope gradients 10 15 and 20 on straw incorporation soil slopes at slope distances of 5 6 and 7 m from the top end of the slope using an electrolyte tracing system the results show that the flow velocity decreased exponentially with straw incorporation rate the mean flow velocity ranged from 0 17 to 0 23 m s over the bare soil slope while the mean flow velocity ranged from 0 10 to 0 17 m s 0 09 to 0 13 m s and 0 06 to 0 11 m s over the soil slopes with straw incorporation rates of 2 4 8 t ha respectively the 2 4 and 8 t ha straw incorporation rates reduced flow velocities by 28 44 44 09 and 55 56 respectively higher rainfall intensity and slope gradient caused increase in flow velocity there was no significant difference between the two adjacent rainfall intensities and slope gradients a nonlinear multiple regression model was used to fit the measured velocities which predicts well the effect of straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient increase in straw application rate had a good effect on reducing the flow velocity which may influence soil erosion and sediment delivery velocity over soil slope with straw incorporation can help interpret soil erosion and sediment transportation keywords overland water flow straw incorporation incorporation rate slope rainfall intensity 1 introduction water flow velocity is of great importance in quantifying overland water flow hydrodynamics related to rainfall infiltration runoff energy and soil erosion gao et al 2019 govers 1990 morgan et al 1998 tatard et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 flow velocity is an essential parameter for evaluating the dynamic mechanism of slope soil erosion it is also the basis for determining many hydrodynamics parameters of the runoff water flow rainfall intensity and slope gradients are important factors to influence flow velocity though soil texture underlying surface conditions and slope length also have their impacts on hydrodynamics characteristics of hillslope water flow nearing et al 2017b nearing et al 2005a zhang et al 2003 zhuang et al 2018 worldwide crop harvest produces enormous straw materials their improper utilization direct burning causes serious air pollution arunrat et al 2018 li et al 2018 removal of crop residues off farmland does not only cost a lot of manpower and waste of raw material resources which can otherwise have a positive impact on the physical chemical and biological properties of the farmland soils blanco canqui and lal 2009 therefore returning crop straws to the field has become an effective way for resource utilization of crop straws crop residues are rich in organic carbon with high benefit impacts on the soil such as to improve soil fertility increase crop yield and improve quality revise farmland degradation wakindiki and danga 2011 yin et al 2018 returning straws into farmland soil can also improve the activity of microorganisms in the soil mandal et al 2004 in addition to improvement of the fertility straw returning cultivated fields also beneficially affects the hydrological and soil erosion of sloped farmland liu et al 2019 mcgregor et al 1990 mcgregor et al 1988 rahma et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2015 shen et al 2012 mandal et al 2004 found that crop residues returning to field can improve soil moisture temperature and aggregate formation based on the simulated experiments mousavi et al 2012 investigated the effects of straw incorporation on soil moisture content and found that 2 7 of straw rate by weight can increase soil moisture content and delay the formation of soil cracks both rahma et al 2013 and omidvar et al 2019 indicated that straw mulching significantly reduced runoff flow velocity compared with straw mulching straw incorporation into soil does not only reduce rainfall and runoff erosivity but also improve anti erodibility of soil the effect of straw mixing into soil on water flow velocity needs further detailed study many studies on flow velocity were carried out under the conditions of high soil bulk density and high water content giménez and govers 2008 omidvar et al 2019 rahma et al 2013 zhuang et al 2018 soil infiltration and soil erosion can be neglected under the above experimental conditions but it always exists under natural conditions nearing et al 2017a 2005b found that in the steep rock slope the physical and hydraulic roughness is affected by the dynamic development of flow rate erosion and slope morphology in this case the slope evolves to a state of slope velocity equilibrium where the velocity depends on the flow rate and independent of slope gradient similar results were also obtained by giménez and govers 2008 on the straw incorporated slopes giménez and govers 2008 measured the flow velocity in rills under four straw residue rates 0 0 86 2 58 and 4 31 t ha three discharge rates 0 000278 0 000611 and 0 001 m3 s and four slope gradients 3 5 8 and 12 in laboratory the dye tracing method was used to measure the flow velocity with a correction factor of 0 94 they found that the average flow velocity decreased significantly as the mixing rate increased under concentrated flow when the discharge rate was 0 000278 m3 s the straw incorporation rate of 4 3 t ha reduced the flow velocity by 50 rainfall was an important factor affecting the hydrodynamics of hillslope water flow nouhou bako et al 2016 however the existing research has paid little attention to the influences of straw incorporation on the flow velocity under rainfall conditions the lack of work about flow velocity measurement on straw incorporation slope under rainfall condition is partly due to the difficult to conveniently and accurately measure the flow velocity although there are various methods for measuring slope flow velocity such as the dye tracing method abrahams et al 1986 electrolyte tracer method planchon et al 2005 lei et al 2005 radioactive material tracing method abril and abdel aal 2000 thermal tracer method abrantes et al 2019 abrantes et al 2018 hot film anemometer robinson and cook 1998 and acoustic doppler velocimetry method giménez et al 2004 each with its applicability and limitations it is still difficult to accurately measure the flow velocity of complex underlying surfaces dye tracing method is a commonly and widely used method to measure the flow velocity the straw incorporation into the soil makes it difficult to observe the tracer transport process thereby reducing the measured accuracy of dye tracing methods in addition the selection of the correction coefficient has an important impact on the measurement accuracy of the dye tracer method the selection of the same correction coefficient under different hydraulic conditions produced systematic errors chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 it is also difficult to accurately measure the flow velocity due to the complex hydraulic conditions of sediment laden water flow and the dynamic change of underlying surface natures based on the theory of solute transport the method of measuring the sheet flow velocity has been successfully applied to the flow velocity measurement of complex experimental conditions such as gravel mulch lei et al 2013 ban et al 2017 straw mulch rahma et al 2013 and extreme rainfall intensities zhuang et al 2018 to verify the hypothesis that the straw incorporation into the soil can affect the water flow velocity the electrolyte tracer method of lei et al 2005 was used to 1 measure flow velocity on straw incorporated slopes under rainfall conditions 2 compute the flow velocities under different hydraulic conditions and straw incorporation rates and 3 analyze the influences of rainfall intensity slope gradient and straw incorporation rate on water flow velocity 2 measurement principle the velocity of the slope flow was measured by the electrolyte tracer method the electrolyte tracer method has been widely used to measure the velocity and hydrodynamics dispersion coefficient of overland water flow lei et al 2013 rahma et al 2013 zhuang et al 2018 in this method the flow velocity is estimated as a parameter of the one dimensional 1d convective dispersion equation to fit the measured data the basic assumptions of the method were that the flow is a steady and the time of injecting electrolyte solution into the water flow is very short to be regarded as a pulse input the partial differential equation is given as 1 c t u c x x d h c x where c is the electrolyte concentration kg m 3 t is the time s x is the distance between a sensor and the salt injection location m u is the water flow velocity m s 1 dh is the hydrodynamics dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 the boundary and initial conditions for solving eq 1 are given as 2 c x t f t x 0 3 c x t 0 x 4 c x t 0 t 0 equation 1 produces the following analytical solution lei et al 2005 5 c x t c 0 x 2 τ π d h t exp x u t 2 4 d h t the solute transport processes were measured with a computerized system before they were fitted by eq 5 to determine the water flow velocity using the least square method the system for water flow velocity measurement consists of an electrolyte injection device sensors for electrical conductivity ec measurement a data logger as an interface to translate the signals measured by the sensors to computer and a special monitoring and control software system as shown in fig 1 the software controlled the measurement process and the measurement started to work when the electrolyte solute was injected into the water flow the data logger collected the measured signals from the sensors and recorded them through the software 3 experimental materials and methods 3 1 experimental equipment simulated rainfall experiments were conducted with a rainfall simulator the experimental flume was constructed to 8 m long 1 2 m wide and 0 3 m deep on a platform the flume was divided into 12 rills of 0 1 m wide using steel plates the bottom of the flume was filled with 5 cm thick clay soil materials to a bulk density of higher than 1 5 g cm 3 to imitate plow layer and to seal the gaps between the steel plate and the platform a gauze sheet was used on top of the clay soil layer to separate the plow layer and the experimental soil weighed soil materials were added with straw materials at the mass level determined by the designed incorporation rate before mixing them thoroughly by a shovel a specially manufactured funnel was used to fill the soil materials with straw incorporation into the rill strips to a thickness of 20 cm without compaction to simulate the tilled top soil layer in the farm field the filled soil layer roughly reached a bulk density of about 1 2 g cm3 after being filled into the flume the soil materials were covered with a plastic film on the surface for 12 h before the platform was adjusted to a designed slope gradient to conduct the simulated rainfall experiments rainfall intensity was calibrated before each experiment 3 2 experimental materials the experimental soil was a silt loam 23 80 sand 64 57 silt and 11 63 clay particles before the experiment the soil was passed through a 10 mm sieve and air dried to reach a water content of below 3 g g this had two purposes as to keep uniform initial water content and to benefit the operation of incorporating straws into soil and filling the soil straw mixture into the flume wheat straw 5 15 cm long was collected from a field after combine harvester the straw was manually incorporation into the soil to designed incorporation rates 3 3 experimental design the experiments involved a combination of four straw incorporation rates 0 2 4 and 8 t ha three rainfall intensities 80 120 and 160 mm h three slope gradients 10 15 and 20 and three flow velocity measurement distances from the top of the slope 5 6 and 7 m making a total of 108 experimental data points with three replicates the rainfall intensities were designed according to soil infiltration and the rainfall intensities during natural rainfalls under extreme conditions rainfall intensity in wheat production zone in northern china may get to 150 180 mm h the editorial committee of flood and drought disasters in yellow river basin and the northwest part of china 1996 and the typical loess soils when incorporated with straw produce steady infiltration around 50 mm h a rainfall intensity needs at least 30 mm h net rainfall to produce a runoff to measure flow velocity therefore we chose rainfall intensities between 80 and 160 mm h every interval of 40 mm h seems reasonable to distinguish runoff flow velocities between the rainfall levels under extreme conditions in order to ensure sufficient runoff area for reasonably good measurement accuracy of the electrolyte tracer model method the three measurement sensors were placed 5 6 and 7 m from the top end of the flume at a distance of 2 m after the electrolyte injection under different rainfall intensities the runoff initiation time was different only when infiltration becomes stable the water flow becomes steady therefore the measurement was conducted when the accumulative rainfall reached to 100 mm in this circumstance the measurement time under rainfall intensities of 80 120 and 160 mm h was about 75 50 and 37 5 min respectively 3 4 data analysis differences in the flow velocity between each treatment were determined using univariate anova analysis and the least significant difference lsd test at the significant level of p 0 05 the following eq 6 was used to calculate the increase percentages of the flow velocity under different conditions 6 p v 0 v i v i 100 where p is the increase percentage of flow velocity v0 is the flow velocity under 0 t ha 1 incorporation rate and vi is the flow velocity under incorporation rate of i i 2 4 and 8 t ha 1 the measured velocities are functionally related with straw incorporation rate with the power function wang et al 2019 the calculated model as follows 7 u a e bm where u is the average velocity m s 1 m is the straw incorporation rate t ha 1 b is the influence coefficient of incorporation rate on velocity ha t 1 and a is the flow velocity when m 0 m s 1 in order to quantify the influence of straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient on the water flow velocity the following nonlinear function was used to fit the flow velocity with regression analysis method 8 u a 0 a 1 i a 2 s a 3 m a 4 i s a 5 i m a 6 s m a 7 i 2 a 8 s 2 a 9 m 2 where u is the water flow velocity m s 1 m is the straw incorporation rate t ha 1 i is the rainfall intensity mm min 1 and s is the slope gradient in sine value of slope a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 and a9 are the regression coefficients the stepwise regression method was used to fit the flow velocity data with eq 8 using pasw statistics software 4 results and discussion figure 2 presents the typical but selected measured electrolyte transport curves after normalization with their fitting curves under combined conditions of rainfall intensity slope gradient and straw incorporation rate of 80 mm h 1 10 and 2 t ha 1 120 mm h 1 10 and 0 t ha 1 120 mm h 1 20 and 4 t ha 1 and 160 mm h 1 15 and 8 t ha 1 respectively the curves s1 s2 and s3 in each figure were the measured and fitted solute transport curves by the first second and third sensors which were located at 5 6 and 7 m from the top end of the flume 4 1 flow velocity over straw incorporation slope univariate analysis of variance was performed on the average flow velocity data of different treatments and the results are shown in table 1 the straw incorporation rate slope gradient and rainfall intensity have significant effects on flow velocity the interactions between straw rate and slope gradient rainfall intensity and slope gradient and straw rate rainfall intensity slope gradient also had significant impacts on flow velocity while the interactions straw rate and rainfall intensity had no significant effect on flow velocity the flow velocities under different rainfall intensities slope gradients and straw incorporation rates were listed in table 2 the standard deviations of velocity at distance 5 6 and 7 m from the slope top listed in table 2 indicate that the flow velocities varied very little this indicates that the flow velocity is stable which agrees with the conclusions by zhuang et al 2018 therefore the average velocity at the three distance positions were listed as the results as show in table 2 the mean flow velocities ranged from 0 06 to 0 17 m s over the soil slope with straw incorporation which were lower than those of giménez and govers s 2008 results in giménez and govers s 2008 experiments concentrated flow was used which produced high velocity both rainfall intensity and slope gradient affected the flow velocity on straw incorporation slopes in general average flow velocity over straw incorporation slope increased with slope gradient and rainfall intensity the trend agreed well with the results of rahma et al 2013 under straw mulch condition the computed increase percentages in flow velocities under increasing rainfall intensities and slope gradients are listed in tables 3 table 3a shows that the increase in the flow velocity when rainfall intensity increased from 80 mm h to 120 mm h from 120 mm h to 160 mm h and from 80 mm h to 160 mm h respectively when the slope was 20 the change in rainfall intensity had the least effect on the flow velocity ranging from 5 31 to 13 61 when the rainfall intensity increased from 80 mm h to 120 mm h the flow velocity increased most significantly at 15 with a percentage increase from 3 62 to 26 57 when the rainfall intensity increased from 120 mm h to 160 mm h the flow velocity increased most significantly at 10 ranging from 9 81 to 19 14 the increments in flow velocity from 10 to 15 from 15 to 20 and from 10 to 20 are shown in table 3b at the rainfall intensity of 160 mm h the slope gradient had the least effect on the increase in flow velocity ranging from 0 83 to 27 67 the rainfall intensity of 80 mm h responded most significantly to the increase in flow velocity with the percentage increases in flow velocity from 10 to 15 15 to 20 and 10 to 20 ranging from 8 20 to 43 52 6 54 to 33 21 and 22 28 to 68 86 respectively as shown in table 2 in most cases under the same rainfall intensity and straw incorporation rate the increase of slope gradient from 10 to 15 and 15 to 20 has no significant effect on flow velocity zhuang et al 2018 reported that the average flow velocity has no distinct difference between 10 and 20 under bare soil this is consistent with the slope velocity equilibrium theory proposed by nearing et al 2017a 2005b on the stone slopes although the flow velocity increased with the increase of slope gradient over straw incorporated slopes there was no significant difference in statistics according to zhuang et al 2018 steep slopes caused more headcuts thus increased slope roughness to balance the gravity impact due to increased slope for the slopes incorporated with plant litter and stone fragment the incorporation reduces the erosion but the increase of slope will cause more litters or stones to be exposed so as to increase the slope roughness nearing et al 2017a nearing et al 2005b rieke zapp et al 2007 wang et al 2019 4 2 effects of straw incorporation rate on reducing water flow velocity straw incorporation dramatically reduced water flow velocity the mean flow velocity table 2 ranged from 0 17 to 0 23 m s 0 10 to 0 17 m s 0 09 to 0 13 m s and 0 06 to 0 11 m s over the soil slope with straw incorporation rate s of 0 2 4 and 8 t ha respectively as presented in fig 3 the mean flow velocity decreased exponentially with the straw incorporation rate under different experiment conditions the fitting parameters of eq 7 to velocity data are shown in table 4 all the coefficients of determination are greater than 0 94 indicating that there is a good exponential relationship between the flow velocity and the straw incorporation rate the computed reduction percentages in flow velocities over straw incorporation slopes are listed in table 5 the average reduction rates in flow velocity was 28 44 44 09 and 55 56 for the straw incorporation rate of 2 4 8 t ha the reduction rates ranged from 12 74 to 65 18 26 86 to 57 98 and 25 25 to 58 07 under 80 120 and 160 mm h rainfall intensity respectively compared with the flow velocity under straw mulching the reduction efficiency of flow velocity under straw incorporation is similar to those by omidvar et al 2019 and foster et al 1982 but greater than the results under concentrated flow measured by rahma et al 2013 surface cover increases the roughness and reduces the generation of soil crust lentz and bjorneberg 2003 prosdocimi et al 2017 rahma et al 2017 researches also indicate that straw plant litter or stone fragments incorporation into soil decreased the flow velocity giménez and govers 2008 rieke zapp et al 2007 wang et al 2019 the decrease of velocity is attributed to the increase of slope surface roughness the slope roughness increases with the mixture emerges on the slope higher incorporation rate caused more roughness elements exposed wang et al 2019 thus effectively reduce raindrop impact nouhou bako et al 2016 rahma et al 2017 with the increase in the straw incorporation rate the decrease in flow velocity was intensified wang et al 2019 noted that the exposure amount of litters at the soil surface is the main factor to affect the flow velocity in this experiment the increase of exposures is not the only factor for the decrease of velocity straw incorporation produces new pores garnier et al 2004 kasteel et al 2007 which increases the infiltration rate and water holding capacity of the soil blanco canqui and lal 2007 mandal et al 2004 wu et al 2016 the rainfall runoff and water depth decreased with increasing straw incorporation rate mcgregor et al 1988 which reduced the flow kinetic energy and in turn reduces the flow velocity in the case of different rainfall intensities and slope gradients the incorporation rate of 8 t ha had the best effect in reducing the flow velocity by more than half under all experimental conditions giménez and govers 2008 found that the straw incorporation rate of 4 3 t ha reduced the flow velocity of concentrated water flow by 50 under the discharge rate of 0 000278 m3 s in their experiment straws were incorporated into 7 8 cm soil layer but in this experiment straw was mixed in 20 cm soil layer similarly wang et al 2019 mixed plant litters into 5 cm deep topsoil layer and the deeper the soil layer was the less the incorporation rate was under the same rain intensity and slope gradient conditions the results in this research are similar to those of wang et al 2019 which shows that the effect of straw incorporation on soil porosity cannot be neglected 4 3 flow velocity prediction model for straw incorporation slope the water flow velocity on the straw incorporation slopes was affected by the straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient the resulted fitting model is given as follows 9 u 0 333 0 173 m 0 065 i 1 043 s 0 013 m 2 the correlation coefficient of the fitting equation was 0 92 the results show that the flow velocity can be well predicted by straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient equation 9 shows that the flow velocity is positively proportional to i s and m 2 and negatively proportional to m slope gradient plays a dominant role in increasing the velocity also straw incorporation reduces flow velocity the comparison between the measured velocity and the model predicted velocity data using eq 9 is shown in fig 4 they have good consistency the determination coefficient is 0 91 and the proportional coefficient is 0 98 this shows that eq 9 can be used to predict the effect of straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient on flow velocity many studies suggest that the rainfall intensity is key factor in water flow velocity shen et al 2016 zhuang et al 2018 the diameter and density of raindrops increase with increase in rainfall intensity which leads to the intensified impacts of rainfall splash an et al 2012 it is worthwhile noting that in this experiment although the rainfall intensity significantly affected the flow velocity table 1 it was not dominant when compared with the influence of straw incorporation rate eq 9 in most cases there is no significant difference between 80 and 120 mm h and between 120 and 160 mm h rainfall intensities for the same slope gradient and straw incorporation rate table 2 which agrees with the results by zhuang et al 2018 the flow velocity is significantly smaller than the value observed by zhuang et al 2018 under the same rainfall intensity slope gradient this may be due to the significant differences in hydrodynamics conditions of runoff between this study and those by zhuang et al 2018 the rainfall infiltration runoff sediment transport is influenced by the different bulk density and antecedent soil moisture which may have a great effect on the flow velocity hieke and schmidt 2013 ziadat and taimeh 2013 in the study of zhuang et al 2018 the high bulk density 1 5 kg cm3 and initial water content 20 v v produced very low infiltration and soil erosion all the precipitations generate runoff and increase the flow kinetic energy which makes the flow velocity increase significantly sediment entrainment and deposition leads to increase in sediment viscosity coefficient zhang et al 2010 and reshape microtopography produce a rougher surface nearing et al 1997 and slows down the velocity huang et al 2018 figure 5 a is a slope surface state picture at 6 m location under the experimental condition of 120 mm h and 20 figure 5a sees soil erosion with the flow carrying a large amount of sediments in addition the development of headcuts is an important factor to reduce the flow velocity rieke zapp et al 2007 zhuang et al 2018 giménez and govers s 2008 research indicated that straw incorporation increased soil surface roughness under impact of water flow erosion resulting in less soil erosion on slopes in contrast to their results mcgregor et al 1990 and 1988 found that due to the sealing effect of surface crust the reduction effect of straw incorporation on runoff and soil erosion is not obvious under the rainfall intensity of 64 mm h and slope gradient of 2 5 figure 5b is the picture of slope morphology at 7 m from the top of the flume under a straw incorporation rate of 8 t ha and 120 mm h incorporation rate and 20 slope gradient compared with the slope surface state at the same rainfall intensity as shown in fig 5a the rill erosion on the slopes with straw incorporation was significantly slowed down and the flow velocity decreased by 56 80 further research is required to determine the effect of straw incorporation on runoff and erosion under rainfall conditions 5 conclusion a series of laboratory experiments were made under different rainfall intensities slope gradients to measure flow velocity on straw incorporated slopes the mean flow velocities ranged from 0 17 to 0 23 m s 0 10 to 0 17 m s 0 09 to 0 13 m s and 0 06 to 0 11 m s over the soil slope with straw incorporation rates of 0 2 4 8 t ha respectively the mean flow velocity decreased exponentially with the straw incorporation rate under different experiment conditions and the straw incorporation rate of 8 t ha can reduce the flow velocity by more than half the increments of flow velocity decreased with the increase in rainfall intensity and straw incorporation rate the higher rainfall intensity produced higher flow velocity the increments of flow velocity decreased with increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient straw incorporated into the soil is a feasible straw resource utilization method and it is an effective soil and water conservation

the top end of the slope using an electrolyte tracing system the results show that the flow velocity decreased exponentially with straw incorporation rate the mean flow velocity ranged from 0 17 to 0

respectively the 2 4 and 8 t ha straw incorporation rates reduced flow velocities by 28 44 44 09 and 55 56 respectively higher rainfall intensity and slope gradient caused increase in flow velocity

soil moisture temperature and aggregate formation based on the simulated experiments mousavi et al 2012 investigated the effects of straw incorporation on soil moisture content and found that 2 7 of straw rate by weight can increase soil moisture content and delay the formation of soil cracks both rahma et al 2013 and omidvar et al 2019 indicated that straw mulching significantly reduced runoff flow velocity compared with straw mulching straw incorporation into soil does not only reduce rainfall and runoff erosivity but also improve anti erodibility of soil the effect of straw mixing into soil on water flow velocity needs further detailed study many studies on flow velocity were carried out under the conditions of high soil bulk density and high water content giménez and govers 2008

et al 2017a 2005b found that in the steep rock slope the physical and hydraulic roughness is affected by the dynamic development of flow rate erosion and slope morphology in this case the slope evolves to a state of slope velocity equilibrium where the velocity depends on the flow rate and independent of slope gradient similar results were also obtained by giménez and govers 2008 on the straw incorporated slopes giménez and govers 2008 measured the flow velocity in rills under four straw residue rates 0 0 86 2 58 and 4 31 t ha three discharge rates 0 000278 0 000611 and 0 001 m3 s

significantly as the mixing rate increased under concentrated flow when the discharge rate was 0 000278 m3 s the straw incorporation rate of 4 3 t ha reduced the flow velocity by 50 rainfall was an important factor affecting the hydrodynamics of hillslope water flow nouhou bako et al 2016 however the existing research has paid little attention to the influences of straw incorporation on the flow velocity under rainfall conditions the lack of work about flow velocity measurement on straw incorporation slope under rainfall condition is partly due to the difficult to conveniently and accurately measure the flow velocity although there are various methods for measuring slope flow velocity such as the dye tracing method abrahams et al 1986 electrolyte tracer method planchon et al 2005 lei et al 2005 radioactive material tracing method abril and abdel aal 2000 thermal tracer method abrantes et al 2019 abrantes et al 2018 hot film anemometer robinson and cook 1998 and acoustic doppler velocimetry method giménez et al 2004 each with its applicability and limitations it is still difficult to accurately measure the flow velocity of complex underlying surfaces dye tracing method is a commonly and widely used method to measure the flow velocity the straw incorporation into the soil makes it difficult to observe the tracer transport process thereby reducing the measured accuracy of dye tracing methods in addition the selection of the correction coefficient has an important impact on the measurement accuracy of the dye tracer method the selection of the same correction coefficient under different hydraulic conditions produced systematic errors chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2010 it is also difficult to accurately measure the flow velocity due to the complex hydraulic conditions of sediment laden water flow and the dynamic change of underlying surface natures based on the theory of solute transport the method of measuring the sheet flow velocity has been successfully applied to the flow velocity measurement of complex experimental conditions such as gravel mulch lei et al 2013 ban et al 2017 straw mulch rahma et al 2013 and extreme rainfall intensities zhuang et al 2018 to verify the hypothesis that the straw incorporation into the soil can affect the water flow velocity the electrolyte tracer method of lei et al 2005 was used to 1 measure flow velocity on straw incorporated slopes under rainfall conditions 2 compute the flow velocities under different hydraulic conditions and straw incorporation rates and 3 analyze the influences of rainfall intensity slope gradient and straw incorporation rate on water flow velocity 2 measurement principle the velocity of the slope flow was measured by the electrolyte tracer method the electrolyte tracer method has been widely used to measure the velocity and hydrodynamics dispersion coefficient of overland water flow lei et al 2013 rahma et al 2013 zhuang et al 2018 in this method the flow velocity is estimated as a parameter of the one dimensional 1d convective dispersion equation to fit the measured data the basic assumptions of the method were that the flow is a steady and the time of injecting electrolyte solution into the water flow is very short to be regarded as a pulse input the partial differential equation is given as 1 c t u c x x d h c x where c is the electrolyte concentration kg m 3 t is the time s x is the distance between a sensor and the salt injection location m u is the water flow velocity m s 1 dh is the hydrodynamics dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 the boundary and initial conditions for solving eq 1 are given as 2 c x t f t x 0 3 c x t 0 x 4 c x t 0 t 0 equation 1 produces the following analytical solution lei et al 2005 5 c x t c 0 x 2 τ π d h t exp x u t 2 4 d h t the solute transport processes were measured with a computerized system before they were fitted by eq 5 to determine the water flow velocity using the least square method the system for water flow velocity measurement consists of an electrolyte injection device sensors for electrical conductivity ec measurement a data logger as an interface to translate the signals measured by the sensors to computer and a special monitoring and control software system as shown in fig 1 the software controlled the measurement process and the measurement started to work when the electrolyte solute was injected into the water flow the data logger collected the measured signals from the sensors and recorded them through the software 3 experimental materials and methods 3 1 experimental equipment simulated rainfall experiments were conducted with a rainfall simulator the experimental flume was constructed to 8 m long 1 2 m wide and 0 3 m deep on a platform the flume was divided into 12 rills of 0 1 m wide using steel plates the bottom of the flume was filled with 5 cm thick clay soil materials to a bulk density of higher than 1 5 g cm 3 to imitate plow layer and to seal the gaps between the steel plate and the platform a gauze sheet was used on top of the clay soil layer to separate the plow layer and the experimental soil weighed soil materials were added with straw materials at the mass level determined by the designed incorporation rate before mixing them thoroughly by a shovel a specially manufactured funnel was used to fill the soil materials with straw incorporation into the rill strips to a thickness of 20 cm without compaction to simulate the tilled top soil layer in the farm field the filled soil layer roughly reached a bulk density of about 1 2 g cm3 after being filled into the flume the soil materials were covered with a plastic film on the surface for 12 h before the platform was adjusted to a designed slope gradient to conduct the simulated rainfall experiments rainfall intensity was calibrated before each experiment 3 2 experimental materials the experimental soil was a silt loam 23 80 sand 64 57 silt and 11 63 clay particles before the experiment the soil was passed through a 10 mm sieve and air dried to reach a water content of below 3 g g this had two purposes as to keep uniform initial water content and to benefit the operation of incorporating straws into soil and filling the soil straw mixture into the flume wheat straw 5 15 cm long was collected from a field after combine harvester the straw was manually incorporation into the soil to designed incorporation rates 3 3 experimental design the experiments involved a combination of four straw incorporation rates 0 2 4 and 8 t ha three rainfall intensities 80 120 and 160 mm h three slope gradients 10 15 and 20 and three flow velocity measurement distances from the top of the slope 5 6 and 7 m making a total of 108 experimental data points with three replicates the rainfall intensities were designed according to soil infiltration and the rainfall intensities during natural rainfalls under extreme conditions rainfall intensity in wheat production zone in northern china may get to 150 180 mm h the editorial committee of flood and drought disasters in yellow river basin and the northwest part of china 1996 and the typical loess soils when incorporated with straw produce steady infiltration around 50 mm h a rainfall intensity needs at least 30 mm h net rainfall to produce a runoff to measure flow velocity therefore we chose rainfall intensities between 80 and 160 mm h every interval of 40 mm h seems reasonable to distinguish runoff flow velocities between the rainfall levels under extreme conditions in order to ensure sufficient runoff area for reasonably good measurement accuracy of the electrolyte tracer model method the three measurement sensors were placed 5 6 and 7 m from the top end of the flume at a distance of 2 m after the electrolyte injection under different rainfall intensities the runoff initiation time was different only when infiltration becomes stable the water flow becomes steady therefore the measurement was conducted when the accumulative rainfall reached to 100 mm in this circumstance the measurement time under rainfall intensities of 80 120 and 160 mm h was about 75 50 and 37 5 min respectively 3 4 data analysis differences in the flow velocity between each treatment were determined using univariate anova analysis and the least significant difference lsd test at the significant level of p 0 05 the following eq 6 was used to calculate the increase percentages of the flow velocity under different conditions 6 p v 0 v i v i 100 where p is the increase percentage of flow velocity v0 is the flow velocity under 0 t ha 1 incorporation rate and vi is the flow velocity under incorporation rate of i i 2 4 and 8 t ha 1 the measured velocities are functionally related with straw incorporation rate with the power function wang et al 2019 the calculated model as follows 7 u a e bm where u is the average velocity m s 1 m is the straw incorporation rate t ha 1 b is the influence coefficient of incorporation rate on velocity ha t 1 and a is the flow velocity when m 0 m s 1 in order to quantify the influence of straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient on the water flow velocity the following nonlinear function was used to fit the flow velocity with regression analysis method 8 u a 0 a 1 i a 2 s a 3 m a 4 i s a 5 i m a 6 s m a 7 i 2 a 8 s 2 a 9 m 2 where u is the water flow velocity m s 1 m is the straw incorporation rate t ha 1 i is the rainfall intensity mm min 1 and s is the slope gradient in sine value of slope a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 and a9 are the regression coefficients the stepwise regression method was used to fit the flow velocity data with eq 8 using pasw statistics software 4 results and discussion figure 2 presents the typical but selected measured electrolyte transport curves after normalization with their fitting curves under combined conditions of rainfall intensity slope gradient and straw incorporation rate of 80 mm h 1 10 and 2 t ha 1 120 mm h 1 10 and 0 t ha 1 120 mm h 1 20 and 4 t ha 1 and 160 mm h 1 15 and 8 t ha 1 respectively the curves s1 s2 and s3 in each figure were the measured and fitted solute transport curves by the first second and third sensors which were located at 5 6 and 7 m from the top end of the flume 4 1 flow velocity over straw incorporation slope univariate analysis of variance was performed on the average flow velocity data of different treatments and the results are shown in table 1 the straw incorporation rate slope gradient and rainfall intensity have significant effects on flow velocity the interactions between straw rate and slope gradient rainfall intensity and slope gradient and straw rate rainfall intensity slope gradient also had significant impacts on flow velocity while the interactions straw rate and rainfall intensity had no significant effect on flow velocity the flow velocities under different rainfall intensities slope gradients and straw incorporation rates were listed in table 2 the standard deviations of velocity at distance 5 6 and 7 m from the slope top listed in table 2 indicate that the flow velocities varied very little this indicates that the flow velocity is stable which agrees with the conclusions by zhuang et al 2018 therefore the average velocity at the three distance positions were listed as the results as show in table 2 the mean flow velocities ranged from 0 06 to 0 17 m s over the soil slope with straw incorporation which were lower than those of giménez and govers s 2008 results in giménez and govers s 2008 experiments concentrated flow was used which produced high velocity both rainfall intensity and slope gradient affected the flow velocity on straw incorporation slopes in general average flow velocity over straw incorporation slope increased with slope gradient and rainfall intensity the trend agreed well with the results of rahma et al 2013 under straw mulch condition the computed increase percentages in flow velocities under increasing rainfall intensities and slope gradients are listed in tables 3 table 3a shows that the increase in the flow velocity when rainfall intensity increased from 80 mm h to 120 mm h from 120 mm h to 160 mm h and from 80 mm h to 160 mm h respectively when the slope was 20 the change in rainfall intensity had the least effect on the flow velocity ranging from 5 31 to 13 61 when the rainfall intensity increased from 80 mm h to 120 mm h the flow velocity increased most significantly at 15 with a percentage increase from 3 62 to 26 57 when the rainfall intensity increased from 120 mm h to 160 mm h the flow velocity increased most significantly at 10 ranging from 9 81 to 19 14 the increments in flow velocity from 10 to 15 from 15 to 20 and from 10 to 20 are shown in table 3b at the rainfall intensity of 160 mm h the slope gradient had the least effect on the increase in flow velocity ranging from 0 83 to 27 67 the rainfall intensity of 80 mm h responded most significantly to the increase in flow velocity with the percentage increases in flow velocity from 10 to 15 15 to 20 and 10 to 20 ranging from 8 20 to 43 52 6 54 to 33 21 and 22 28 to 68 86 respectively as shown in table 2 in most cases under the same rainfall intensity and straw incorporation rate the increase of slope gradient from 10 to 15 and 15 to 20 has no significant effect on flow velocity zhuang et al 2018 reported that the average flow velocity has no distinct difference between 10 and 20 under bare soil this is consistent with the slope velocity equilibrium theory proposed by nearing et al 2017a 2005b on the stone slopes although the flow velocity increased with the increase of slope gradient over straw incorporated slopes there was no significant difference in statistics according to zhuang et al 2018 steep slopes caused more headcuts thus increased slope roughness to balance the gravity impact due to increased slope for the slopes incorporated with plant litter and stone fragment the incorporation reduces the erosion but the increase of slope will cause more litters or stones to be exposed so as to increase the slope roughness nearing et al 2017a nearing et al 2005b rieke zapp et al 2007 wang et al 2019 4 2 effects of straw incorporation rate on reducing water flow velocity straw incorporation dramatically reduced water flow velocity the mean flow velocity table 2 ranged from 0 17 to 0 23 m s 0 10 to 0 17 m s 0 09 to 0 13 m s and 0 06 to 0 11 m s over the soil slope with straw incorporation rate s of 0 2 4 and 8 t ha respectively as presented in fig 3 the mean flow velocity decreased exponentially with the straw incorporation rate under different experiment conditions the fitting parameters of eq 7 to velocity data are shown in table 4 all the coefficients of determination are greater than 0 94 indicating that there is a good exponential relationship between the flow velocity and the straw incorporation rate the computed reduction percentages in flow velocities over straw incorporation slopes are listed in table 5 the average reduction rates in flow velocity was 28 44 44 09 and 55 56 for the straw incorporation rate of 2 4 8 t ha the reduction rates ranged from 12 74 to 65 18 26 86 to 57 98 and 25 25 to 58 07 under 80 120 and 160 mm h rainfall intensity respectively compared with the flow velocity under straw mulching the reduction efficiency of flow velocity under straw incorporation is similar to those by omidvar et al 2019 and foster et al 1982 but greater than the results under concentrated flow measured by rahma et al 2013 surface cover increases the roughness and reduces the generation of soil crust lentz and bjorneberg 2003 prosdocimi et al 2017 rahma et al 2017 researches also indicate that straw plant litter or stone fragments incorporation into soil decreased the flow velocity giménez and govers 2008 rieke zapp et al 2007 wang et al 2019 the decrease of velocity is attributed to the increase of slope surface roughness the slope roughness increases with the mixture emerges on the slope higher incorporation rate caused more roughness elements exposed wang et al 2019 thus effectively reduce raindrop impact nouhou bako et al 2016 rahma et al 2017 with the increase in the straw incorporation rate the decrease in flow velocity was intensified wang et al 2019 noted that the exposure amount of litters at the soil surface is the main factor to affect the flow velocity in this experiment the increase of exposures is not the only factor for the decrease of velocity straw incorporation produces new pores garnier et al 2004 kasteel et al 2007 which increases the infiltration rate and water holding capacity of the soil blanco canqui and lal 2007 mandal et al 2004 wu et al 2016 the rainfall runoff and water depth decreased with increasing straw incorporation rate mcgregor et al 1988 which reduced the flow kinetic energy and in turn reduces the flow velocity in the case of different rainfall intensities and slope gradients the incorporation rate of 8 t ha had the best effect in reducing the flow velocity by more than half under all experimental conditions giménez and govers 2008 found that the straw incorporation rate of 4 3 t ha reduced the flow velocity of concentrated water flow by 50 under the discharge rate of 0 000278 m3 s in their experiment straws were incorporated into 7 8 cm soil layer but in this experiment straw was mixed in 20 cm soil layer similarly wang et al 2019 mixed plant litters into 5 cm deep topsoil layer and the deeper the soil layer was the less the incorporation rate was under the same rain intensity and slope gradient conditions the results in this research are similar to those of wang et al 2019 which shows that the effect of straw incorporation on soil porosity cannot be neglected 4 3 flow velocity prediction model for straw incorporation slope the water flow velocity on the straw incorporation slopes was affected by the straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient the resulted fitting model is given as follows 9 u 0 333 0 173 m 0 065 i 1 043 s 0 013 m 2 the correlation coefficient of the fitting equation was 0 92 the results show that the flow velocity can be well predicted by straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient equation 9 shows that the flow velocity is positively proportional to i s and m 2 and negatively proportional to m slope gradient plays a dominant role in increasing the velocity also straw incorporation reduces flow velocity the comparison between the measured velocity and the model predicted velocity data using eq 9 is shown in fig 4 they have good consistency the determination coefficient is 0 91 and the proportional coefficient is 0 98 this shows that eq 9 can be used to predict the effect of straw incorporation rate rainfall intensity and slope gradient on flow velocity many studies suggest that the rainfall intensity is key factor in water flow velocity shen et al 2016 zhuang et al 2018 the diameter and density of raindrops increase with increase in rainfall intensity which leads to the intensified impacts of rainfall splash an et al 2012 it is worthwhile noting that in this experiment although the rainfall intensity significantly affected the flow velocity table 1 it was not dominant when compared with the influence of straw incorporation rate eq 9 in most cases there is no significant difference between 80 and 120 mm h and between 120 and 160 mm h rainfall intensities for the same slope gradient and straw incorporation rate table 2 which agrees with the results by zhuang et al 2018 the flow velocity is significantly smaller than the value observed by zhuang et al 2018 under the same rainfall intensity slope gradient this may be due to the significant differences in hydrodynamics conditions of runoff between this study and those by zhuang et al 2018 the rainfall infiltration runoff sediment transport is influenced by the different bulk density and antecedent soil moisture which may have a great effect on the flow velocity hieke and schmidt 2013 ziadat and taimeh 2013 in the study of zhuang et al 2018 the high bulk density 1 5 kg cm3 and initial water content 20 v v produced very low infiltration and soil erosion all the precipitations generate runoff and increase the flow kinetic energy which makes the flow velocity increase significantly sediment entrainment and deposition leads to increase in sediment viscosity coefficient zhang et al 2010 and reshape microtopography produce a rougher surface nearing et al 1997 and slows down the velocity huang et al 2018 figure 5 a is a slope surface state picture at 6 m location under the experimental condition of 120 mm h and 20 figure 5a sees soil erosion with the flow carrying a large amount of sediments in addition the development of headcuts is an important factor to reduce the flow velocity rieke zapp et al 2007 zhuang et al 2018 giménez and govers s 2008 research indicated that straw incorporation increased soil surface roughness under impact of water flow erosion resulting in less soil erosion on slopes in contrast to their results mcgregor et al 1990 and 1988 found that due to the sealing effect of surface crust the reduction effect of straw incorporation on runoff and soil erosion is not obvious under the rainfall intensity of 64 mm h and slope gradient of 2 5 figure 5b is the picture of slope morphology at 7 m from the top of the flume under a straw incorporation rate of 8 t ha and 120 mm h incorporation rate and 20 slope gradient compared with the slope surface state at the same rainfall intensity as shown in fig 5a the rill erosion on the slopes with straw incorporation was significantly slowed down and the flow velocity decreased by 56 80 further research is required to determine the effect of straw incorporation on runoff and erosion under rainfall conditions 5 conclusion a series of laboratory experiments were made under different rainfall intensities slope gradients to measure flow velocity on straw incorporated slopes the mean flow velocities ranged from 0 17 to 0 23 m s 0 10 to 0 17 m s 0 09 to 0 13 m s and 0 06 to 0 11 m s over the soil slope with straw incorporation rates of 0 2 4 8 t ha respectively the mean flow velocity decreased exponentially with the straw incorporation rate under different experiment conditions and the straw incorporation rate of 8 t ha can reduce the flow velocity by more than half the increments of flow velocity decreased with the increase in rainfall intensity and straw incorporation rate the higher rainfall intensity produced higher flow velocity the increments of flow velocity decreased with increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient straw incorporated into the soil is a feasible straw resource utilization method and it is an effective soil and water conservation measure the study is important in understanding the hydrodynamics of soil erosion and sediment transport of straw incorporated slopes credit authorship contribution statement h q liu conceptualization

5646,longitudinal dispersion coefficient ldc is a crucial component in the modeling of pollutants and sediment transport in rivers several researches carried out to find an equation for ldc based on geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters also different approaches including analytical empirical and soft computing were utilized for this purpose while several researches were carried out in this field the implementation of the estimated ldc is restricted due to the accuracy of estimation and the small number of datasets in this research to overcome these problems a novel approach based on copula functions is considered to propose a range of ldc instead of a single value for this purpose an extended dataset including 164 worldwide of geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters was utilized these data were classified into six dimensionless classes also tri variate copula functions were used to the calculate conditional probability of ldc results indicated that frank copula is the best fit in bi variate and tri variate modeling based on frank copula the conditional probability of different classes was calculated among all classes the lowest conditional probability assigned to the k x hu 5000 and in the next rank to k x hu 30 60 70 of conditional probability was calculated for 120 k x hu 1400 physical interpretation of the dispersion process justifies the results which strengthen the methodology so the results have the capability to use worldwide in pollutant and sediment transport modeling keywords longitudinal dispersion coefficient copula function conditional probability hydrodynamic velocity gradient 1 introduction modeling of the pollutant transport in river flow is important from several aspects such as water quality management operation and control of the chemical and biological processes ecological evaluation and environmental management perucca et al 2009 huai et al 2018 although the river flow is three dimensional in the micro scale in applied aspects of river engineering the dominant process is one dimensional alizadeh et al 2017 in one dimensional open channel flow the longitudinal dispersion of pollutants plays an essential role determination of ldc is crucial for modeling the amount of chemical contaminants nutrients sediments and wood debris and to model the dynamic of water quality shen et al 2010 perucca et al 2009 wang and huai 2016 wang and chen 2017 the theory of taylor dispersion has been widely used for modeling pollutant transport in open channel flow taylor dispersion is the process that contaminant spreads longitudinally with the simultaneous action of transverse velocity gradients and pollutant diffusion taylor 1954 huai et al 2018 the general and the most well known method for modeling the one dimensional pollutant transport in river engineering works is based on the classical one dimensional advection dispersion equation ade fischer et al 1979 wang et al 2012 samani et al 2018 1 c t u c x k x 2 c x 2 where c is the average of concentration in the section u is the average of velocity in the longitudinal direction t is time x is the longitudinal direction in flow stream and k x is ldc so the pollutant transport in rivers is highly dependent to the k x value fischer et al 1979 developed the following triple integral term for estimation of k x riahi madvar et al 2009 2 k x 1 a 0 b hu 0 y 1 t h 0 y hu dydydy where k x is ldc a is cross section area of flow b is top width of water surface h is local depth of flow in any transverse point u is deviation of depth average flow velocity from cross sectional average velocity y is transverse location from left bank and t is transverse mixing coefficient in this equation the unknown term of t is described by several researchers as a transverse turbulent coefficient it is difficult to use eq 2 in real and applied cases because the geometry of cross section h y and transverse velocity profile u y aren t available and can t be determined simply despite that this equation is based on strong theoretical velocity gradients but in applied models of pollutant dispersion this integral method has a complicated format and its applicability is not easily accessible given their somewhat turbulence and concentration based nature the status of longitudinal dispersion is often predicted by various models that are derived from hydraulic variables or by black box models the dispersion process is several times larger than the molecular diffusivity wang and chen 2017 and numerous studies have carried out on the prediction of ldc in open channel flow the well known methods for prediction of k x in previous studies are experimental determination of k x gaganis et al 2005 perucca et al 2009 wang and huai 2016 theoretical calculation of k x by integration of velocity profile and concentration gradients bogle 1997 seo and baek 2004 lightbody and nepf 2006 wang and chen 2017 wikle 2003 bayesian network wikle 2003 wikle 2003 balf et al 2018 artificial neural network riahi madvar et al 2009 regression based approach balf et al 2018 gene expression programming sattar and gharabaghi 2015 riahi madvar et al 2019 and adaptive neuro fuzzy system najafzadeh and sattar 2015 najafzadeh and tafarojnoruz 2016 however understanding and considering the complex interactions between streamflow sediment dynamics and pollutant dispersion have always been a challenge because of heterogeneity of river flow pollutant and sediment transport and nature of turbulent flow shojaeezadeh et al 2018 generally there are two kinds of models including deterministic and stochastic or probabilistic models both of them have their advantages and shortcomings in a deterministic model the output of the model is a single determined value comes from a formula it means that starting from a pre defined condition will always get the same result so there is no space for random variation the advantage of deterministic models is that they can be used in mathematical analysis smelser and baltes 2001 in contrast a probabilistic model incorporates the randomness and probability distributions to produce an outcome which is based on the probability distributions rather than unique values as inferences from data are intrinsically uncertain the probabilistic models consider the uncertainty instead of ignoring it the main advantage of a probabilistic model is that it can provide additional information on the risk of choosing a certain value however if the available data is not adequate or the sample comes from certain parts of a population the results could not be reliable the present compromise among different studies in the field of k x is that there is no unique approach for characterizing longitudinal dispersion in open channel flows the pollutant dispersion status that is predicted by deterministic techniques often does not match well with the results predicted by other methods because of the complicated physical connections between river hydraulic flow shear forces in the flow field turbulence effects and concentration variation with roughness and cross section geometry of the reach to successfully evaluate the longitudinal dispersion information from various sources such as hydraulic flow pollutant transport and turbulence need to be examined simultaneously in regard to the specification of the longitudinal dispersion and its status in different flow regimes a rigorous analysis has not been feasible in the physical and probabilistic characterization of the k x and there is no defensible scientific analysis of pollutants dispersion it has great importance to explore the joint probabilities of the combination of river flow conditions channel geometry and shear force with pollutant dispersion coefficient however the existing methods provided for prediction and modeling of k x present some drawbacks and none is wholly acceptable because of their restriction assigning an appropriate distribution with an optimal set of parameters to each of the effective parameter in the estimation of k x the predictive models that are extensively implemented for estimation of the k x are classically deterministic and model estimations are used by the operators as deterministic values liu et al 2018a the theorem of rational decision making under uncertainty specifies that using a wrong deterministic prediction leads to the consequences possibly worse than a condition that there is no estimation gilboa 2009 there is a need to develop objective techniques for analyzing longitudinal pollutant dispersion coefficient based on multiple variables that affect the k x values this will be accomplished by the creation of a joint study that is based on information from multiple sources of hydraulic geometry shear force and provides a better prediction of the k x based on inherent patterns this study is carried out to consider the complex dependent interactions between various dispersion related parameters to achieve this goal copula functions are used in this study to infer the derivation and magnifying of the dependence structure of k x and to extend our knowledge into the dominant statistical and probabilistic status of the k x and our ability to illustrate them the applicability of copula families for considering the joint distributions in the water and hydrology researches is evident from previous studies including droughts analysis kao and govindaraju 2010 chen et al 2012b mirabbasi et al 2013 huang et al 2014 xu et al 2015 vaziri et al 2018 she and xia 2018 balf et al 2018 chen and guo 2019 dehghani et al 2019 sediment transport modeling tene et al 2018 shojaeezadeh et al 2018 uncertainty analysis in hydrology and water resources liu et al 2018a he et al 2018 chen and guo 2019a river flow analysis tosunoglu and singh 2018 wang et al 2018 tosunoglu and singh 2018 ma and wang 2018 liu and menzel 2018 and water quality indicators liu et al 2018b ma and wang 2018 it is well established that copula functions have vital competence to model joint distributions and provide flexibility in the selection of an indiscriminate marginal distribution and considering nonlinear and heteroscedastic dependence structure zhang et al 2011 these new studies over copula modeling in hydrology and water resources indicate that the application of copulas in hydrology is still in its promising phases chen and guo 2019 and the full potential of copula in analyzing pollutants dispersion problems is however to be understood as mentioned previously accurate calculation and prediction of ldc provide valuable information for pollutant transport modeling and water quality management of rivers because of the complex interaction between the different physical factors affecting the pollutant dispersion phenomenon chung and wen 1968 it is difficult to provide a precise estimation of the k x as a unique value which could be feasible and reliable in all conditions and this necessitates the usefulness of probabilistic methods in estimation of the dispersion coefficient so valuable features of copula functions interested the authors to develop a novel approach to estimate the ldc based on copula functions the main objective of this study is to develop a copula based conditional probability matrix of ldc in this study the authors developed a new methodological framework for longitudinal pollutant dispersion coefficient modeling using copulas that empowers us to compute a probability based k x from several dominant quantities the rest of the study is arranged as follows an explanation of the collected data provided at first after that an overview of the copulas and some properties that are dominant in modeling in conjunction with marginal dependence configuration and copula based joint k x modeling is presented in brief the modeling framework also included and finally the results discussion and conclusions of the study are provided 2 methodology 2 1 longitudinal dispersion data several geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters can affect the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in rivers many parameters including flow depth h bed shear velocity u flow velocity u and channel width w have the most effect in prediction of the ldc noori et al 2016 in this study a comprehensive field dataset including 164 samples was collected from the different literature etemad shahidi and taghipour 2012 disley et al 2015 for different river flow and pollutant conditions the kx values are calculated based on the concentration profiles of tracers riahi madvar et al 2019 statistical characteristics of the total data are given in table 1 according to this table this dataset covers a wide range of rivers in the world the width and depth of rivers in this dataset are in the range of 1 4 to 253 6 m and 0 14 to 8 2 m respectively the dimensionless variables can reduce the programmed workload so by taking into account the buckingham pi theorem of dimensional analysis in this study non dimensional parameters of w h u u and k x hu are used to estimate the ldc due to their accessibility for natural rivers these non dimension parameters were widely used in previous studies seo and cheong 1998 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 alizadeh et al 2017 wang et al 2017 riahi madvar et al 2019 based on the statistical characteristics of k x hu the standard deviation of this dimensionless parameter is high and the difference between maximum and minimum values reaches more than 37000 so the reliability of the results based on this data distribution may be a question to reduce the variance of this parameter h was replaced with the w in the denominator of this parameter and k x wu was calculated as it is presented in table 1 the maximum mean median and standard deviation of k x wu reduced to about one fortieth the minimum about one tenth and the skewness has no change compared to the k x hu then the results obtained by the combination of w h and u u with k x wu and k x hu compared in the results section the histograms for dimension and dimensionless variables w h u u k x w h u u k x wu and k x hu are presented in fig 1 it shows that the distributions of u and u u are relatively uniform somewhat but in the other dimension or non dimension parameters the data is highly skewed as this study focused on the probabilistic estimation of ldc it is necessary to classify the dataset it is obvious from fig 1 that the dataset is asymmetric to reproduce a more symmetric dataset it is common to use the transformation the most commonly used transformation in water resources is the logarithm helsel and hirsch 2002 so the logarithm of the dataset was calculated and after the classification it transformed into the original data using anti logarithm also it is not possible to use classic measures such as mean and standard deviation for the classification of the data due to the asymmetry instead resistant measures such as median and median absolute deviation mad are appropriate for this purpose mad is defined as helsel and hirsch 2002 3 mad x median d where d i x i median x where x is the vector of the dataset in this regard the median and mad of w h u u k x wu and k x hu datasets were calculated one and two mad were added and subtracted from the median for data classification and as a result the datasets were classified into six classes 2 2 copula functions a d dimensional copula is a function c u 1 u 2 u d from 0 1 d 0 1 which satisfies the two following properties 1 for

distribution function with marginal distributions f 1 f d based on the sklar s theorem there is a d dimensional copula c such that for every x 1 x d 7 h x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f d x d if f 1 f 2 f d are all continuous then c is unique from eq 7 the copula c is given by 8 c u 1 u d h f 1 1 u 1 f d 1 u d archimedean copulas get popular in the environmental modeling recently to consider the dependence structure between variables maity et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 dehghani et al 2019 an archimedean copula is defined as follows 9 c u 1 u d ϕ 1 ϕ u 1 ϕ u 2 ϕ u d 10 ϕ 1 0 1 i d i dx i ϕ 1 x 0 for i 1 d in this research four archimedean copulas including clayton frank joe and gumbel huggard were utilized as presented in table 2 to select the best copula function that fits the data a goodness of fit gof test is needed to examine whether the unique underlying copula c belongs to the parameter class c ϕ of archimedean copulas genest et al 2006 the null hypothesis is expressed by h 0 c c ϕ among all gof tests the one proposed by genest et al 2006 was utilized the procedure is as follows 1 suppose c be a copula function and let t c f 1 x 1 f d x d define k t as 11 k t p t t 0 t 1 from barbe et al 1996 for archimedean copula the function k t is given by 12 k t t i 1 d 1 1 i i ϕ t i f i t where 13 f i t d i dx i ϕ 1 x x ϕ t provided that ϕ t i f i t 0 as t 0 for all i 1 d 1 note in passing that 14 f i 1 t f 1 t t f i t i 1 d 1 k n t is the empirical representation of k t and calculated as follows 15 k n t 1 n j 1 n i v jn t 0 t 1 where the pseudo observations v jn could be defined as 16 v jn 1 n k 1 n i x 1 k x 1 j x dk x dj 2 according to barbe et al 1996 and jouini and clemen 1996 the multivariate extension of kendall s tau defined by 17 τ 2 d 1 2 d 1 1 2 d 2 d 1 1 0 1 k t dt the parameter τ for an archimedean copula is given by 18 τ 1 2 d 2 d 1 1 i 1 d 1 1 i i 0 1 ϕ t i f i θ t dt the empirical representation of τ is defined as τ n which calculated as follows 19 τ n 2 d 1 2 d 1 1 2 d 2 d 1 1 0 1 k n t dt 3 genest et al 2006 suggested two test statistics for testing the gof 20 s n n 3 n j 1 n 1 k n 2 j n k j 1 n k j n n j 1 n 1 k n j n k 2 j 1 n k 2 j n and 21 t n n max i 0 1 0 j n 1 k n j n k j i n the null hypothesis may be rejected or accepted based on the critical value and p value for these test statistics using the parametric bootstrap method as follows since τ depends on the θ τ g θ using τ n the copula parameter θ is estimated by θ g 1 τ n generate n random samples of size n from copula c and calculate the s n and t n values for all samples in the next step arrange the s n and t n values in the previous step as s 1 n s 2 n s n n the critical values based on s n and t n at level α are s 1 α n n and t 1 α n n where a denotes the integer part of a also the p values estimated as 1 n i 1 n i s i s n 0 and 1 n i 1 n i t i t n 0 where s n 0 and t n 0 are the observed values of s n and t n respectively dehghani et al 2019 2 3 conditional probability suppose that k x hu or k x wu w h and u u denoted by x y and z respectively then the conditional probability of k x hu or k x wu given w h and u u my be determined as follows 22 p a x b c y d e z f p a x b c y d e z f p c y d e z f where p a x b c y d e z f e f c d a b h x y z dxdydz e f c d a b 3 h x y z x y z dxdydz e f c d a b 3 c f x x f y y f z z x y z dxdydz e f c d a b 3 c f x x f y y f z z

same procedure we can calculate the denominator of eq 22 as p c y d e z f f y c f y d f x a f x b 2 c u v u v dudv with mathematical simplification eq 22 could be rewritten as follows 23 p a x b c y d

appropriate univariate marginal to the w h u u k x wu and k x hu in this study nine probability distribution functions were utilized for this purpose as presented in table 3 maximum likelihood estimation mle was conducted to estimate the parameters of marginal distributions while the goodness of fit test based on the kolmogrov smirnov and anderson darling test statistics were utilized to evaluate the suitability of fit akaike information criterion aic log likelihood ll and p value were calculated to choose the best fitted marginal distribution 3 results 3 1 data classification as previously mentioned it is needed to classify the datasets for conditional probability calculation for this purpose as the data are asymmetric the logarithm transformation was utilized to make the data more symmetric then the median and mad of datasets were calculated for w h u u k x wu and k x hu which are 1 58 0 73 and 2 61 0 31 and 0 97 0 37 and 0 28 0 54 respectively then based on the median and mad all the datasets were classified into six classes table 4 finally the values in each dataset transformed into the original value using anti logarithm 3 2 selection of the best copula and marginals to calculate the conditional probability of k x hu and k x wu in this study tri variate and bivariate archimedean copulas were utilized for this purpose the dependence parameter θ between w h u u and k x hu or k x wu was estimated for each copula presented in table 2 by inversion of kendall s τ θ g 1 τ n in the next step 3000 samples of size n were generated using parametric bootstrap finally the best copula was selected based on the p value and critical value results presented in tables 5 and 6 according to the results of table 5 it is obvious that all tri variate copulas accepted for modeling based on the p values in the significance level 0 05 while frank copula rejected based on the p value of s n in table 6 it shows that the class of archimedean copula is appropriate for this purpose among all frank and clayton copulas were selected as the best fitted tri variate copula for w h u u k x hu and w h u u k x wu respectively based on the p value although the p value of s n for joe copula is higher than that for the frank in table 5 however the difference is negligible instead the p value of t n for frank copula is higher than that for joe copula considerably so the copula based dependence structure of w h u u k x hu and w h u u k x wu presented in eqs 24 and 25 respectively 24 c f u v w 0 43 l n 1 1 22 e 2 348 u 1 e 2 348 v 1 e 2 348 w 1 25 c f u v w max u 0 244 v 0 244 w 0 244 2 0 4 1 according to eq 22 for conditional probability calculation it is required to find the dependence structure of the w h and u u in fact it is needed to find a bivariate copula that fit these two variables appropriately so all the copula presented in table 2 were fitted to the joint of these two variables the same as the procedure conducted for tri variate copulas results are presented in table 7 based on this table all bivariate archimedean copulas were fitted to the joint of the w h and u u satisfactorily which again verifies the capability of archimedean copulas in this field frank and clayton copulas were selected for modeling which presented as follows 26 c f u v 1 46 ln 1 2 02 e 0 684 u 1 e 0 684 v 1 27 c f u v max u 0 164 v 0 164 1 0 6 1 in eq 22 it is needed to assign a univariate marginal to each of variables w h u u k x wu and k x hu for this purpose nine univariate marginal distributions were used as presented in table 3 the mle method was used to estimate the parameters of marginal distributions the best univariate marginal distribution was selected based on the aic ll and p value results are presented in table 8 burr 3p pearson type 6 and log logistic distributions were chosen as the best fit for variables w h and k x hu u u and k x hu respectively 28 f x x 1 1 x 42 28 2 23 1 29 x 0 29 f y x 592 62 0 x x 19 35 t 1 99

22 could be utilized for this purpose all combinations of w h and u u classes were considered for estimation of conditional probability of the k x hu and k x wu the conditional probability matrices were presented in table 9 and 10 according to table 9 the lowest conditional probability assigned to the k x hu 5000 and in the next rank to k x hu 30 all conditional probabilities are less than 10 in these two classes except for one scenario k x hu 5000 it means that for each w h and u u combinations the conditional probability of k x hu 30 or k x hu 5000 is less than 10 also it is worthy to note that the summation of conditional probability for k x hu 30 and k x hu 5000 for each w h and u u combinations is less than 10 except for u u 19 5 and w h 160 so it can be concluded that the conditional probability of k x hu 30 and k x hu 5000 is negligible for all w h and u u combinations and a value out of these ranges should be assigned to this parameter in most cases however for 30 k x hu 120 the conditional probability for different w h and u u combinations reaches to about three times of the k x hu 30 or k x hu 5000 or even the summation of conditional probability for k x hu 30 and k x hu 5000 this pattern is enhanced and weakened for 120 k x hu 400 and 400 k x hu 1400 respectively for better judgment one can fix one of the w h or u u and assess the non dimensional longitudinal dispersion coefficient for this purpose the authors fixed the u u in each category and evaluated the k x hu for each w h for w h 9 and all u u combinations the summation of the conditional probability of 30 k x hu 120 and 120 k x hu 400 reaches to about 70 for u u 1 5 the maximum conditional probability achieved for 120 k x hu 400 and in the next rank for 30 k x hu 120 this pattern is evident for 1 5 u u 2 8 more than 60 of conditional probability is assigned to these two classes for 2 8 u u 5 3 and w h 19 the same pattern is visible however the conditional probability of 400 k x hu 1400 for 2 8 u u 5 3 and w h 19 combination is greater than the probability of 120 k x hu 400 and more than 60 of conditional probability is assigned to 120 k x hu 400 and 400 k x hu 1400 classes this pattern is predominant for all combinations except for u u 10 2 and w h 38 for u u 10 2 and w h 38 the conditional probability of 1400 k x hu 5000 reaches a considerable value and about 70 of the conditional probability assigned to 400 k x hu 1400 and 1400 k x hu 5000 for these combinations based on table 10 it is evident that the pattern of conditional probabilities in different classes is the same as table 9 again the first and the last classes including k x wu 1 7 and k x wu 50 however it does not mean that the probabilities are the same in all combinations the value of probabilities for k x wu 1 7 and k x wu 50 are somehow more than k x hu 30 and k x hu 5000 but the pattern is almost the same also the most probabilities about 70 assigned to the 1 7 k x hu 22 the other characteristics of this table is similar to the table 9 so the rest of the research was carried out based on the combinations of w h u u k x hu 3 4 interpretation of the results in the next step it is necessary to discuss and interpret the results table 9 indicates that the lowest probability of k x hu in any values of w h and u u is for k x hu 5000 in this case the greatest value of the probability of k x hu 5000 corresponds to w h 160 and u u 19 5 which occurs in very wide channels having low flow depth with high velocity values that rarely occurs in rivers the greatest probability of k x hu corresponds to 120 k x hu 1400 with cumulative probability value equals to 60 70 and in the estimation of k x hu or mathematical modeling of pollutant dispersion the significant effort should be over this ranges in an overview one can find two different patterns in the conditional probabilities based on the w h and u u combinations in the first three classes of k x hu a conditional probability reduction pattern is visible along the original diameter while in the rest three classes an increasing pattern is apparent lower values of k x hu 120 corresponds to uniform and fully developed flows that in this case the velocity gradients are very smooth in this condition the pollutant dispersion in large w h and u u values because of small velocity deviations and fully developed flows have lower probabilities than small values of w h and u u in other words coinciding with the physical meaning of pollutant dispersion in river flows for fully developed flows the boundary effects geometry irregularities roughness and wall shear effects are more dominant than the flow properties such as depth and velocity this has resulted in larger values of k x hu probabilities for small values of w h and u u and emphasis on the importance of boundary roughness effects for k x hu 120 fully developed flow occurs when the viscous effects due to the shear stress between the fluid particles and river banks generate a fully developed velocity profile so the velocity of the fluid for a fully developed flow will be at its fastest at the center line of the river section and the velocity of the fluid at the walls of the river section will be zero theoretically these variations from zero at banks to the maximum velocity at the centerline of the river section increase the velocity gradients so for large values of the w h and u u the effects of the boundary layer and surface roughness on velocity profiles are less than the flows with small values of the w h and u u in small values of the w h and u u the surface roughness effects on momentum transport in the boundary layer is a significant feature of turbulent boundary layers that causes interactions in flow field tachie et al 2000 lin et al 1997 and produces more velocity gradients that led to increase in longitudinal dispersion which the results of conditional probabilities of k x hu in table 9 indicate that increasing the w h causes decreasing the secondary flow role at a given velocity these results satisfy that one would expect the decreasing in the effects of the banks when the channel widens by increasing the w h the velocity profile across the cross section will be more uniform resulted in a smaller dispersion coefficient song 2017 as well predicted by the copula function in the table 9 furthermore a significant feature of three dimensional turbulence in river flows is that the largest eddies are generally restricted by the smallest spatial dimension of the cross section so the turbulence is supposed to be produced in regions of high shear which in a river cross section would be at the bed of channel and near the banks especially in narrow channels with small values of w h and this is captured by the shear velocity u for k x hu 400 the dispersion process corresponds to flows having large transverse velocity gradients and strong shear gradients across the section in this case the larger w h and u u creates more turbulence and larger velocity gradients that produce more dispersions and increase the k x hu probabilities with increasing jointed parameters as stated by marion and zaramella 2006 in natural river sections the large cross sectional variability of the longitudinal velocity component causes the tendency to larger longitudinal dispersions by generating a more difference from neighboring fast and slow velocity fields on the other hand increasing the secondary flows smooth the velocity gradients by providing transverse mixing and this causes lower probability values of k x hu by decreasing w h and u u bogle 1997 and seo and baek 2004 used measured velocity profiles to quantify the positive effects of velocity profile shape and velocity gradients and deviations on the k x values as stated in eq 2 there is a straight relation between k x and the deviation of the depth averaged velocity from the cross sectional average velocity u the hypothesis made in deriving eq 2 is that in the river flows with w h 10 the transverse shear is much more critical in determining the ldc than the vertical shear in the flat transverse velocity profiles the velocity deviation and transverse shear are smaller than the uneven non flat velocity profiles with advective velocities bogle 1997 also it should be mentioned that the dispersion is a combined and simultaneous process of longitudinal advection and lateral diffusion of concentration and effects of dead zones river meanders secondary currents and other irregular geometry features strengthen the dispersion in rivers deng et al 2001 wall roughness also results in higher turbulence in the outer zone of the boundary layer the effect of river surface roughness on the outer zone and the influence of river flow turbulence on the main flow show a strong interaction that will cause more dispersion tachie et al 2000 flow analysis indicates that an abrupt growth of surface roughness increases the strength and the distribution density of ejections and vortical structures in the main flow field lin et al 1997 the developments of some of the ejections and vortical structures cause the growth of the boundary layer and indicate that the drag coefficient or the ratio of surface friction velocity u to free stream velocity u is related to the scale and strength of coherent flux and vortical structures of flows all of these contributions show that the change of shear velocities velocity gradients and surface roughness in shear driven boundary layer flows appear to have the same effect as the change of free stream velocity in smooth wall flows that generates the dispersion these interactions between flow mechanisms and channel properties provide a possible clarification for the existence of large strong horseshoe vortical structures in shear driven fully rough flows in rivers that mainly cause the dispersion of pollutants lin et al 1997 furthermore to quantify the shear dispersion due to velocity deviations four velocity profiles in which the k x values as observed values were available are investigated here in fig 2 various types of the measured velocity profile i e parabolic flattened sharply peaked and skewed distributions are presented godfrey and frederick 1970 seo and baek 2004 also in table 11 the hydraulic and shear dispersion due to velocity variation in regard to the observed k x values of these profiles are presented the uniformity of the velocity profile mainly affects the k x values if the velocity profile across the river section is more uniform the deviation of local velocity from cross sectional average will become less and the dispersion coefficient will be less as well and vice versa bogle 1997 seo and baek 2004 as shown in the fig 2 by considering these deviations of local velocity from cross sectional average velocity it is apparent that there is large shear dispersion due to velocity deviation and causes the dominant longitudinal dispersions as the copula model predicted based on conditional probabilities in table 9 as this figure shows in real streams the lateral shear in the y direction plays a more critical role in the dispersion process the average velocity assumed to be constant over the depth and local velocities are variable over the depth such that they produce longitudinal dispersion of pollutants the velocity gradients in the transverse and vertical directions may tend to produce large dispersion coefficients godfrey and frederick 1970 the analysis of velocity profiles has shown that in the prismatic channel the shear dispersion is only about 1 3 of the rectangular channel values and reveals the contribution effects generated by the edges of the velocity distribution near the banks of cross section where the velocity deviates furthermost from the average cross sectional velocity value bogle 1997 as stated by bogle 1997 in the case of the prismatic section where the depth near the banks is comparatively and considerably decreased the effects of the contribution of these edge near the bank velocities into the longitudinal dispersion are decreased proportionately also changes in the concentration profiles that are produced by the shear flows cause tilting and stretching of the averaged concentration and the variations are destroyed by transverse molecular diffusion wang and jones 1991 the conditional probability ranges predicted by copula for the k x in table 11 two last columns considerably envelopes the observed values and shows the reliability of developed copula based estimation in different velocity profiles with various velocity gradient and flow conditions 3 5 application of probabilistic k x estimation in the practical application range based calibration of a one dimensional numerical model presented in eq 1 is used to verify and show the validity and the applicability of developed copula based range predictions of k x in a precise calibration the range based calibration process is as follows first according to the flow characteristics and the geometrical parameters of the river sections the dimensionless parameters u u and w h are calculated then based on the copula conditional probability results presented in tables 9 and 10 the highest probability for k x hu or k x wu is achieved that gives a range with the highest probability for k x hu or k x wu it is in fact the most probable range for k x hu or k x wu based on the flow characteristics and the geometrical parameters in the next step for one dimensional numerical model calibration the k x value will vary step by step from the lowest to the highest value in the range and the best value for the k x is determined by comparing the reproduced contamination concentration profile with the measured values the k x value which leads the least difference between the simulated concentration and the observed concentration profiles is the optimal k x value two different modes of application of the copula functions can be recommended the first one is determining the appropriate range for the k x with the highest probability and the second one is selecting the best k x value in this paper eight different cases of contamination dispersion in river sections and flume have been used to evaluate the results of the copula application four modes were considered for estimating the highest probability range and four modes for selecting the best dispersion coefficient value the results of the first four cases prediction of the ranges with the highest probability are presented in fig 2 and table 11 in these four cases the aim is to compare the observed dispersion coefficient with the predicted class of k x using copula function based on fig 2 and table 11 the copula is capable of predicting the range of k x with the highest conditional probability appropriately and well fit the dispersion coefficient to the probability range detailed description of fig 2 and table 11 was presented in the previous section the profile of contaminant dispersion and the results of modeling the second four cases choosing the best value of the dispersion coefficient are presented in fig 3 and table 12 for this purpose the experimental data reported by chatila 1998 which are measured in a flume for pollutant transport was used more information about the case study presented by chatila 1998 and seifi and riahi madvar 2018 the objective is to compare the results of contamination concentration modeling based on the copula range based calibrated value of the k x with the measured concentration profile for the range based calibration process first w h and u u were calculated based on the flow characteristics and the geometrical parameters of the cross section then based on the results of the copula conditional probability in table 9 the best range for the dispersion coefficient with the highest probability is selected and presented as the appropriate range for the dispersion coefficient value to the one dimensional numerical model column 9 table 12 in the next step in the one dimensional numerical model the k x in eq 1 was changed in the range from the lower to the upper value and the best value for the k x was achieved based on the least difference between the simulated and measured concentration profiles the final dispersion coefficient is presented in the last column of table 12 as the ultimate value in each modeling mode in fig 3 the concentration profile of the calibrated numerical model with the copula function anfis and anfis ga seifi and riahi madvar 2018 was drawn versus the measured concentration profile it can be seen that there is a general agreement between the measured and simulated concentration profiles also the concentration profiles produced by fischer 1975 and kashefipour and falconer 2002 equations were drawn in this figure the fischer 1975 and kashefipour and falconer 2002 equations eqs 32 and 33 are as follows 32 k x hu 0 011 u u 2 w h 2 33 k x hu 7 428 1 775 w h 0 62 u u 0 572 u u 2 for w h 50 10 612 u u 2 for w h 50 it is worthy to note that as fischer 1975 results were not accurate the correction factor was used to in the calibration process to improve the results of fischer 1975 equation and then the results were compared with the results of the copula function in seifi and riahi madvar 2018 model the dispersion coefficient is determined based on a two step anfis optimization and genetic algorithm training process that is time consuming with the high computational burden and it is a black box model however based on the proposed range of dispersion coefficient using copula calibration of the model is done in a shorter and faster time interval which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach in numerical model calibration in real conditions also the concentration profile produced by range based calibration has relatively desirable and acceptable accuracy which shows a novel application of copula in numerical model calibration 4 conclusion a single value for k x cannot satisfactorily represent the whole river so in the present study the author s used copula functions to provide a range of the ldc based on hydraulic parameters w h u u instead of a single value the accurate estimation of the k x value is crucial in one dimensional pollutant transport model calibrations based on the authors knowledge this is the first research that carried out the probabilistic prediction of the k x by providing reliable ranges of the k x for numerical model calibrations the proposed ranges of the k x reduce time and required efforts to calibrate the pollutant transport model to alleviate the non identifiability issues of the k x calibration previous studies focused on applying empirical equations to calibrate the k x this approach is typically not a feasible solution because it is time consuming in finding the appropriate range for kx in the case and one rarely has such accurate and informative prior knowledge besides in the present study authors innovatively provided conditional based calibration results table 8 for the k x based on predefined values of dimensionless w h and u u parameters another substantial improvement of probabilistic model calibration is that it can provide further evidence on the risk of selecting a certain value of the k x this copula based conditional probability between w h u u and k x not only shows the appropriate range of the k x but also provides a reliable probability distribution of the k x with various flow conditions this probabilistic estimation is based on a comprehensive analysis of available data and it can be used for future formulation of the k x for robust estimations it must be noted that this research was carried out based on an extended dataset of 164 field samples so the best copula and marginal distributions frank burr pearson type 6 and log logistic distributions may not be the best fit if the samples change however if the distribution of high low values in the samples does not change considerably they still are the best fits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5646,longitudinal dispersion coefficient ldc is a crucial component in the modeling of pollutants and sediment transport in rivers several researches carried out to find an equation for ldc based on geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters also different approaches including analytical empirical and soft computing were utilized for this purpose while several researches were carried out in this field the implementation of the estimated ldc is restricted due to the accuracy of estimation and the small number of datasets in this research to overcome these problems a novel approach based on copula functions is considered to propose a range of ldc instead of a single value for this purpose an extended dataset including 164 worldwide of geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters was utilized these data were classified into six dimensionless classes also tri variate copula functions were used to the calculate conditional probability of ldc results indicated that frank copula is the best fit in bi variate and tri variate modeling based on frank copula the conditional probability of different classes was calculated among all classes the lowest conditional probability assigned to the k x hu 5000 and in the next rank to k x hu 30 60 70 of conditional probability was calculated for 120 k x hu 1400 physical interpretation of the dispersion process justifies the results which strengthen the methodology so the results have the capability to use worldwide in pollutant and sediment transport modeling keywords longitudinal dispersion coefficient copula function conditional probability hydrodynamic velocity gradient 1 introduction modeling of the pollutant transport in river flow is important from several aspects such as water quality management operation and control of the chemical and biological processes ecological evaluation and environmental management perucca et al 2009 huai et al 2018 although the river flow is three dimensional in the micro scale in applied aspects of river engineering the dominant process is one dimensional alizadeh et al 2017 in one dimensional open channel flow the longitudinal dispersion of pollutants plays an essential role determination of ldc is crucial for modeling the amount of chemical contaminants nutrients sediments and wood debris and to model the dynamic of water quality shen et al 2010 perucca et al 2009 wang and huai 2016 wang and chen 2017 the theory of taylor dispersion has been widely used for modeling pollutant transport in open channel flow taylor dispersion is the process that contaminant spreads longitudinally with the simultaneous action of transverse velocity gradients and pollutant diffusion taylor 1954 huai et al 2018 the general and the most well known method for modeling the one dimensional pollutant transport in river engineering works is based on the classical one dimensional advection dispersion equation ade fischer et al 1979 wang et al 2012 samani et al 2018 1 c t u c x k x 2 c x 2 where c is the average of concentration in the section u is the average of velocity in the longitudinal direction t is time x is the longitudinal direction in flow stream and k x is ldc so the pollutant transport in rivers is highly dependent to the k x value fischer et al 1979 developed the following triple integral term for estimation of k x riahi madvar et al 2009 2 k x 1 a 0 b hu 0 y 1 t h 0 y hu dydydy where k x is ldc a is cross section area of flow b is top width of water surface h is local depth of flow in any transverse point u is deviation of depth average flow velocity from cross sectional average velocity y is transverse location from left bank and t is transverse mixing coefficient in this equation the unknown term of t is described by several researchers as a transverse turbulent coefficient it is difficult to use eq 2 in real and applied cases because the geometry of cross section h y and transverse velocity profile u y aren t available and can t be determined simply despite that this equation is based on strong theoretical velocity gradients but in applied models of pollutant dispersion this integral method has a complicated format and its applicability is not easily accessible given their somewhat turbulence and concentration based nature the status of longitudinal dispersion is often predicted by various models that are derived from hydraulic variables or by black box models the dispersion process is several times larger than the molecular diffusivity wang and chen 2017 and numerous studies have carried out on the prediction of ldc in open channel flow the well known methods for prediction of k x in previous studies are experimental determination of k x gaganis et al 2005 perucca et al 2009 wang and huai 2016 theoretical calculation of k x by integration of velocity profile and concentration gradients bogle 1997 seo and baek 2004 lightbody and nepf 2006 wang and chen 2017 wikle 2003 bayesian network wikle 2003 wikle 2003 balf et al 2018 artificial neural network riahi madvar et al 2009 regression based approach balf et al 2018 gene expression programming sattar and gharabaghi 2015 riahi madvar et al 2019 and adaptive neuro fuzzy system najafzadeh and sattar 2015 najafzadeh and tafarojnoruz 2016 however understanding and considering the complex interactions between streamflow sediment dynamics and pollutant dispersion have always been a challenge because of heterogeneity of river flow pollutant and sediment transport and nature of turbulent flow shojaeezadeh et al 2018 generally there are two kinds of models including deterministic and stochastic or probabilistic models both of them have their advantages and shortcomings in a deterministic model the output of the model is a single determined value comes from a formula it means that starting from a pre defined condition will always get the same result so there is no space for random variation the advantage of deterministic models is that they can be used in mathematical analysis smelser and baltes 2001 in contrast a probabilistic model incorporates the randomness and probability distributions to produce an outcome which is based on the probability distributions rather than unique values as inferences from data are intrinsically uncertain the probabilistic models consider the uncertainty instead of ignoring it the main advantage of a probabilistic model is that it can provide additional information on the risk of choosing a certain value however if the available data is not adequate or the sample comes from certain parts of a population the results could not be reliable the present compromise among different studies in the field of k x is that there is no unique approach for characterizing longitudinal dispersion in open channel flows the pollutant dispersion status that is predicted by deterministic techniques often does not match well with the results predicted by other methods because of the complicated physical connections between river hydraulic flow shear forces in the flow field turbulence effects and concentration variation with roughness and cross section geometry of the reach to successfully evaluate the longitudinal dispersion information from various sources such as hydraulic flow pollutant transport and turbulence need to be examined simultaneously in regard to the specification of the longitudinal dispersion and its status in different flow regimes a rigorous analysis has not been feasible in the physical and probabilistic characterization of the k x and there is no defensible scientific analysis of pollutants dispersion it has great importance to explore the joint probabilities of the combination of river flow conditions channel geometry and shear force with pollutant dispersion coefficient however the existing methods provided for prediction and modeling of k x present some drawbacks and none is wholly acceptable because of their restriction assigning an appropriate distribution with an optimal set of parameters to each of the effective parameter in the estimation of k x the predictive models that are extensively implemented for estimation of the k x are classically deterministic and model estimations are used by the operators as deterministic values liu et al 2018a the theorem of rational decision making under uncertainty specifies that using a wrong deterministic prediction leads to the consequences possibly worse than a condition that there is no estimation gilboa 2009 there is a need to develop objective techniques for analyzing longitudinal pollutant dispersion coefficient based on multiple variables that affect the k x values this will be accomplished by the creation of a joint study that is based on information from multiple sources of hydraulic geometry shear force and provides a better prediction of the k x based on inherent patterns this study is carried out to consider the complex dependent interactions between various dispersion related parameters to achieve this goal copula functions are used in this study to infer the derivation and magnifying of the dependence structure of k x and to extend our knowledge into the dominant statistical and probabilistic status of the k x and our ability to illustrate them the applicability of copula families for considering the joint distributions in the water and hydrology researches is evident from previous studies including droughts analysis kao and govindaraju 2010 chen et al 2012b mirabbasi et al 2013 huang et al 2014 xu et al 2015 vaziri et al 2018 she and xia 2018 balf et al 2018 chen and guo 2019 dehghani et al 2019 sediment transport modeling tene et al 2018 shojaeezadeh et al 2018 uncertainty analysis in hydrology and water resources liu et al 2018a he et al 2018 chen and guo 2019a river flow analysis tosunoglu and singh 2018 wang et al 2018 tosunoglu and singh 2018 ma and wang 2018 liu and menzel 2018 and water quality indicators liu et al 2018b ma and wang 2018 it is well established that copula functions have vital competence to model joint distributions and provide flexibility in the selection of an indiscriminate marginal distribution and considering nonlinear and heteroscedastic dependence structure zhang et al 2011 these new studies over copula modeling in hydrology and water resources indicate that the application of copulas in hydrology is still in its promising phases chen and guo 2019 and the full potential of copula in analyzing pollutants dispersion problems is however to be understood as mentioned previously accurate calculation and prediction of ldc provide valuable information for pollutant transport modeling and water quality management of rivers because of the complex interaction between the different physical factors affecting the pollutant dispersion phenomenon chung and wen 1968 it is difficult to provide a precise estimation of the k x as a unique value which could be feasible and reliable in all conditions and this necessitates the usefulness of probabilistic methods in estimation of the dispersion coefficient so valuable features of copula functions interested the authors to develop a novel approach to estimate the ldc based on copula functions the main objective of this study is to develop a copula based conditional probability matrix of ldc in this study the authors developed a new methodological framework for longitudinal pollutant dispersion coefficient modeling using copulas that empowers us to compute a probability based k x from several dominant quantities the rest of the study is arranged as follows an explanation of the collected data provided at first after that an overview of the copulas and some properties that are dominant in modeling in conjunction with marginal dependence configuration and copula based joint k x modeling is presented in brief the modeling framework also included and finally the results discussion and conclusions of the study are provided 2 methodology 2 1 longitudinal dispersion data several geometrical and hydrodynamic parameters can affect the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in rivers many parameters including flow depth h bed shear velocity u flow velocity u and channel width w have the most effect in prediction of the ldc noori et al 2016 in this study a comprehensive field dataset including 164 samples was collected from the different literature etemad shahidi and taghipour 2012 disley et al 2015 for different river flow and pollutant conditions the kx values are calculated based on the concentration profiles of tracers riahi madvar et al 2019 statistical characteristics of the total data are given in table 1 according to this table this dataset covers a wide range of rivers in the world the width and depth of rivers in this dataset are in the range of 1 4 to 253 6 m and 0 14 to 8 2 m respectively the dimensionless variables can reduce the programmed workload so by taking into account the buckingham pi theorem of dimensional analysis in this study non dimensional parameters of w h u u and k x hu are used to estimate the ldc due to their accessibility for natural rivers these non dimension parameters were widely used in previous studies seo and cheong 1998 sattar and gharabaghi 2015 alizadeh et al 2017 wang et al 2017 riahi madvar et al 2019 based on the statistical characteristics of k x hu the standard deviation of this dimensionless parameter is high and the difference between maximum and minimum values reaches more than 37000 so the reliability of the results based on this data distribution may be a question to reduce the variance of this parameter h was replaced with the w in the denominator of this parameter and k x wu was calculated as it is presented in table 1 the maximum mean median and standard deviation of k x wu reduced to about one fortieth the minimum about one tenth and the skewness has no change compared to the k x hu then the results obtained by the combination of w h and u u with k x wu and k x hu compared in the results section the histograms for dimension and dimensionless variables w h u u k x w h u u k x wu and k x hu are presented in fig 1 it shows that the distributions of u and u u are relatively uniform somewhat but in the other dimension or non dimension parameters the data is highly skewed as this study focused on the probabilistic estimation of ldc it is necessary to classify the dataset it is obvious from fig 1 that the dataset is asymmetric to reproduce a more symmetric dataset it is common to use the transformation the most commonly used transformation in water resources is the logarithm helsel and hirsch 2002 so the logarithm of the dataset was calculated and after the classification it transformed into the original data using anti logarithm also it is not possible to use classic measures such as mean and standard deviation for the classification of the data due to the asymmetry instead resistant measures such as median and median absolute deviation mad are appropriate for this purpose mad is defined as helsel and hirsch 2002 3 mad x median d where d i x i median x where x is the vector of the dataset in this regard the median and mad of w h u u k x wu and k x hu datasets were calculated one and two mad were added and subtracted from the median for data classification and as a result the datasets were classified into six classes 2 2 copula functions a d dimensional copula is a function c u 1 u 2 u d from 0 1 d 0 1 which satisfies the two following properties 1 for every j 1 2 d and u i 0 1 4 c u 1 u 2 u j 1 0 u j 1 u d 0 5 c 1 1 u j 1 1 u j 2 for every 0 u i 1 u i 2 1 and i 1 d 6 v c i 1 1 2 i d 1 2 1 i 1 i d c u 1 i 1 u di d 0 let h be a d dimensional distribution function with marginal distributions f 1 f d based on the sklar s theorem there is a d dimensional copula c such that for every x 1 x d 7 h x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f d x d if f 1 f 2 f d are all continuous then c is unique from eq 7 the copula c is given by 8 c u 1 u d h f 1 1 u 1 f d 1 u d archimedean copulas get popular in the environmental modeling recently to consider the dependence structure between variables maity et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 dehghani et al 2019 an archimedean copula is defined as follows 9 c u 1 u d ϕ 1 ϕ u 1 ϕ u 2 ϕ u d 10 ϕ 1 0 1 i d i dx i ϕ 1 x 0 for i 1 d in this research four archimedean copulas including clayton frank joe and gumbel huggard were utilized as presented in table 2 to select the best copula function that fits the data a goodness of fit gof test is needed to examine whether the unique underlying copula c belongs to the parameter class c ϕ of archimedean copulas genest et al 2006 the null hypothesis is expressed by h 0 c c ϕ among all gof tests the one proposed by genest et al 2006 was utilized the procedure is as follows 1 suppose c be a copula function and let t c f 1 x 1 f d x d define k t as 11 k t p t t 0 t 1 from barbe et al 1996 for archimedean copula the function k t is given by 12 k t t i 1 d 1 1 i i ϕ t i f i t where 13 f i t d i dx i ϕ 1 x x ϕ t provided that ϕ t i f i t 0 as t 0 for all i 1 d 1 note in passing that 14 f i 1 t f 1 t t f i t i 1 d 1 k n t is the empirical representation of k t and calculated as follows 15 k n t 1 n j 1 n i v jn t 0 t 1 where the pseudo observations v jn could be defined as 16 v jn 1 n k 1 n i x 1 k x 1 j x dk x dj 2 according to barbe et al 1996 and jouini and clemen 1996 the multivariate extension of kendall s tau defined by 17 τ 2 d 1 2 d 1 1 2 d 2 d 1 1 0 1 k t dt the parameter τ for an archimedean copula is given by 18 τ 1 2 d 2 d 1 1 i 1 d 1 1 i i 0 1 ϕ t i f i θ t dt the empirical representation of τ is defined as τ n which calculated as follows 19 τ n 2 d 1 2 d 1 1 2 d 2 d 1 1 0 1 k n t dt 3 genest et al 2006 suggested two test statistics for testing the gof 20 s n n 3 n j 1 n 1 k n 2 j n k j 1 n k j n n j 1 n 1 k n j n k 2 j 1 n k 2 j n and 21 t n n max i 0 1 0 j n 1 k n j n k j i n the null hypothesis may be rejected or accepted based on the critical value and p value for these test statistics using the parametric bootstrap method as follows since τ depends on the θ τ g θ using τ n the copula parameter θ is estimated by θ g 1 τ n generate n random samples of size n from copula c and calculate the s n and t n values for all samples in the next step arrange the s n and t n values in the previous step as s 1 n s 2 n s n n the critical values based on s n and t n at level α are s 1 α n n and t 1 α n n where a denotes the integer part of a also the p values estimated as 1 n i 1 n i s i s n 0 and 1 n i 1 n i t i t n 0 where s n 0 and t n 0 are the observed values of s n and t n respectively dehghani et al 2019 2 3 conditional probability suppose that k x hu or k x wu w h and u u denoted by x y and z respectively then the conditional probability of k x hu or k x wu given w h and u u my be determined as follows 22 p a x b c y d e z f p a x b c y d e z f p c y d e z f where p a x b c y d e z f e f c d a b h x y z dxdydz e f c d a b 3 h x y z x y z dxdydz e f c d a b 3 c f x x f y y f z z x y z dxdydz e f c d a b 3 c f x x f y y f z z

same procedure we can calculate the denominator of eq 22 as p c y d e z f f y c f y d f x a f x b 2 c u v u v dudv with mathematical simplification eq 22 could be rewritten as follows 23 p a x b c y d e z f p a x b c y d e z f p c y d e z f c f x b f y d f z f c f x b f y c f z e c f x a f y d f z e c f x a f y c f z f c f x b f y d c f x b f y c c f x a f y d c f x a f y c c f x b f y d f z e c f x b f y c f z f c f x a f y d f z f c f x a f y c f z e c f x b f y d c f x b f y c c f x a f y d c f x a f y c based on the above equations for conditional probability calculation one needs to assign appropriate univariate marginal to the w h u u k x wu and k x hu in this study nine probability distribution functions were utilized for this purpose as presented in table 3 maximum likelihood estimation mle was conducted to estimate the parameters of marginal distributions while the goodness of fit test based on the kolmogrov smirnov and anderson darling test statistics were utilized to evaluate the suitability of fit akaike information criterion aic log likelihood ll and p value were calculated to choose the best fitted marginal distribution 3 results 3 1 data classification as previously mentioned it is needed to classify the datasets for conditional probability calculation for this purpose as the data are asymmetric the logarithm transformation was utilized to make the data more symmetric then the median and mad of datasets were calculated for w h u u k x wu and k x hu which are 1 58 0 73 and 2 61 0 31 and 0 97 0 37 and 0 28 0 54 respectively then based on the median and mad all the datasets were classified into six classes table 4 finally the values in each dataset transformed into the original value using anti logarithm 3 2 selection of the best copula and marginals to calculate the conditional probability of k x hu and k x wu in this study tri variate and bivariate archimedean copulas were utilized for this purpose the dependence parameter θ between w h u u and k x hu or k x wu was estimated for each copula presented in table 2 by inversion of kendall s τ θ g 1 τ n in the next step 3000 samples of size n were generated using parametric bootstrap finally the best copula was selected based on the p value and critical value results presented in tables 5 and 6 according to the results of table 5 it is obvious that all tri variate copulas accepted for modeling based on the p values in the significance level 0 05 while frank copula rejected based on the p value of s n in table 6 it shows that the class of archimedean copula is appropriate for this purpose among all frank and clayton copulas were selected as the best fitted tri variate copula for w h u u k x hu and w h u u k x wu respectively based on the p value although the p value of s n for joe copula is higher than that for the frank in table 5 however the difference is negligible instead the p value of t n for frank copula is higher than that for joe copula considerably so the copula based dependence structure of w h u u k x hu and w h u u k x wu presented in eqs 24 and 25 respectively 24 c f u v w 0 43 l n 1 1 22 e 2 348 u 1 e 2 348 v 1 e 2 348 w 1 25 c f u v w max u 0 244 v 0 244 w 0 244 2 0 4 1 according to eq 22 for conditional probability calculation it is required to find the dependence structure of the w h and u u in fact it is needed to find a bivariate copula that fit these two variables appropriately so all the copula presented in table 2 were fitted to the joint of these two variables the same as the procedure conducted for tri variate copulas results are presented in table 7 based on this table all bivariate archimedean copulas were fitted to the joint of the w h and u u satisfactorily which again verifies the capability of archimedean copulas in this field frank and clayton copulas were selected for modeling which presented as follows 26 c f u v 1 46 ln 1 2 02 e 0 684 u 1 e 0 684 v 1 27 c f u v max u 0 164 v 0 164 1 0 6 1 in eq 22 it is needed to assign a univariate marginal to each of variables w h u u k x wu and k x hu for this purpose nine univariate marginal distributions were used as presented in table 3 the mle method was used to estimate the parameters of marginal distributions the best univariate marginal distribution was selected based on the aic ll and p value results are presented in table 8 burr 3p pearson type 6 and log logistic distributions were chosen as the best fit for variables w h and k x hu u u and k x hu respectively 28 f x x 1 1 x 42 28 2 23 1 29 x 0 29 f y x 592 62 0 x x 19 35 t 1 99

22 could be utilized for this purpose all combinations of w h and u u classes were considered for estimation of conditional probability of the k x hu and k x wu the conditional probability matrices were presented in table 9 and 10 according to table 9 the lowest conditional probability assigned to the k x hu 5000 and in the next rank to k x hu 30 all conditional probabilities are less than 10 in these two classes except for one scenario k x hu 5000 it means that for each w h and u u combinations the conditional probability of k x hu 30 or k x hu 5000 is less than 10 also it is worthy to note that the summation of conditional probability for k x hu 30 and k x hu 5000 for each w h and u u combinations is less than 10 except for u u 19 5 and w h 160 so it can be concluded that the conditional probability of k x hu 30 and k x hu 5000 is negligible for all w h and u u combinations and a value out of these ranges should be assigned to this parameter in most cases however for 30 k x hu 120 the conditional probability for different w h and u u combinations reaches to about three times of the k x hu 30 or k x hu 5000 or even the summation of conditional probability for k x hu 30 and k x hu 5000 this pattern is enhanced and weakened for 120 k x hu 400 and 400 k x hu 1400 respectively for better judgment one can fix one of the w h or u u and assess the non dimensional longitudinal dispersion coefficient for this purpose the authors fixed the u u in each category and evaluated the k x hu for each w h for w h 9 and all u u combinations the summation of the conditional probability of 30 k x hu 120 and 120 k x hu 400 reaches to about 70 for u u 1 5 the maximum conditional probability achieved for 120 k x hu 400 and in the next rank for 30 k x hu 120 this pattern is evident for 1 5 u u 2 8 more than 60 of conditional probability is assigned to these two classes for 2 8 u u 5 3 and w h 19 the same pattern is visible however the conditional probability of 400 k x hu 1400 for 2 8 u u 5 3 and w h 19 combination is greater than the probability of 120 k x hu 400 and more than 60 of conditional probability is assigned to 120 k x hu 400 and 400 k x hu 1400 classes this pattern is predominant for all combinations except for u u 10 2 and w h 38 for u u 10 2 and w h 38 the conditional probability of 1400 k x hu 5000 reaches a considerable value and about 70 of the conditional probability assigned to 400 k x hu 1400 and 1400 k x hu 5000 for these combinations based on table 10 it is evident that the pattern of conditional probabilities in different classes is the same as table 9 again the first and the last classes including k x wu 1 7 and k x wu 50 however it does not mean that the probabilities are the same in all combinations the value of probabilities for k x wu 1 7 and k x wu 50 are somehow more than k x hu 30 and k x hu 5000 but the pattern is almost the same also the most probabilities about 70 assigned to the 1 7 k x hu 22 the other characteristics of this table is similar to the table 9 so the rest of the research was carried out based on the combinations of w h u u k x hu 3 4 interpretation of the results in the next step it is necessary to discuss and interpret the results table 9 indicates that the lowest probability of k x hu in any values of w h and u u is for k x hu 5000 in this case the greatest value of the probability of k x hu 5000 corresponds to w h 160 and u u 19 5 which occurs in very wide channels having low flow depth with high velocity values that rarely occurs in rivers the greatest probability of k x hu corresponds to 120 k x hu 1400 with cumulative probability value equals to 60 70 and in the estimation of k x hu or mathematical modeling of pollutant dispersion the significant effort should be over this ranges in an overview one can find two different patterns in the conditional probabilities based on the w h and u u combinations in the first three classes of k x hu a conditional probability reduction pattern is visible along the original diameter while in the rest three classes an increasing pattern is apparent lower values of k x hu 120 corresponds to uniform and fully developed flows that in this case the velocity gradients are very smooth in this condition the pollutant dispersion in large w h and u u values because of small velocity deviations and fully developed flows have lower probabilities than small values of w h and u u in other words coinciding with the physical meaning of pollutant dispersion in river flows for fully developed flows the boundary effects geometry irregularities roughness and wall shear effects are more dominant than the flow properties such as depth and velocity this has resulted in larger values of k x hu probabilities for small values of w h and u u and emphasis on the importance of boundary roughness effects for k x hu 120 fully developed flow occurs when the viscous effects due to the shear stress between the fluid particles and river banks generate a fully developed velocity profile so the velocity of the fluid for a fully developed flow will be at its fastest at the center line of the river section and the velocity of the fluid at the walls of the river section will be zero theoretically these variations from zero at banks to the maximum velocity at the centerline of the river section increase the velocity gradients so for large values of the w h and u u the effects of the boundary layer and surface roughness on velocity profiles are less than the flows with small values of the w h and u u in small values of the w h and u u the surface roughness effects on momentum transport in the boundary layer is a significant feature of turbulent boundary layers that causes interactions in flow field tachie et al 2000 lin et al 1997 and produces more velocity gradients that led to increase in longitudinal dispersion which the results of conditional probabilities of k x hu in table 9 indicate that increasing the w h causes decreasing the secondary flow role at a given velocity these results satisfy that one would expect the decreasing in the effects of the banks when the channel widens by increasing the w h the velocity profile across the cross section will be more uniform resulted in a smaller dispersion coefficient song 2017 as well predicted by the copula function in the table 9 furthermore a significant feature of three dimensional turbulence in river flows is that the largest eddies are generally restricted by the smallest spatial dimension of the cross section so the turbulence is supposed to be produced in regions of high shear which in a river cross section would be at the bed of channel and near the banks especially in narrow channels with small values of w h and this is captured by the shear velocity u for k x hu 400 the dispersion process corresponds to flows having large transverse velocity gradients and strong shear gradients across the section in this case the larger w h and u u creates more turbulence and larger velocity gradients that produce more dispersions and increase the k x hu probabilities with increasing jointed parameters as stated by marion and zaramella 2006 in natural river sections the large cross sectional variability of the longitudinal velocity component causes the tendency to larger longitudinal dispersions by generating a more difference from neighboring fast and slow velocity fields on the other hand increasing the secondary flows smooth the velocity gradients by providing transverse mixing and this causes lower probability values of k x hu by decreasing w h and u u bogle 1997 and seo and baek 2004 used measured velocity profiles to quantify the positive effects of velocity profile shape and velocity gradients and deviations on the k x values as stated in eq 2 there is a straight relation between k x and the deviation of the depth averaged velocity from the cross sectional average velocity u the hypothesis made in deriving eq 2 is that in the river flows with w h 10 the transverse shear is much more critical in determining the ldc than the vertical shear in the flat transverse velocity profiles the velocity deviation and transverse shear are smaller than the uneven non flat velocity profiles with advective velocities bogle 1997 also it should be mentioned that the dispersion is a combined and simultaneous process of longitudinal advection and lateral diffusion of concentration and effects of dead zones river meanders secondary currents and other irregular geometry features strengthen the dispersion in rivers deng et al 2001 wall roughness also results in higher turbulence in the outer zone of the boundary layer the effect of river surface roughness on the outer zone and the influence of river flow turbulence on the main flow show a strong interaction that will cause more dispersion tachie et al 2000 flow analysis indicates that an abrupt growth of surface roughness increases the strength and the distribution density of ejections and vortical structures in the main flow field lin et al 1997 the developments of some of the ejections and vortical structures cause the growth of the boundary layer and indicate that the drag coefficient or the ratio of surface friction velocity u to free stream velocity u is related to the scale and strength of coherent flux and vortical structures of flows all of these contributions show that the change of shear velocities velocity gradients and surface roughness in shear driven boundary layer flows appear to have the same effect as the change of free stream velocity in smooth wall flows that generates the dispersion these interactions between flow mechanisms and channel properties provide a possible clarification for the existence of large strong horseshoe vortical structures in shear driven fully rough flows in rivers that mainly cause the dispersion of pollutants lin et al 1997 furthermore to quantify the shear dispersion due to velocity deviations four velocity profiles in which the k x values as observed values were available are investigated here in fig 2 various types of the measured velocity profile i e parabolic flattened sharply peaked and skewed distributions are presented godfrey and frederick 1970 seo and baek 2004 also in table 11 the hydraulic and shear dispersion due to velocity variation in regard to the observed k x values of these profiles are presented the uniformity of the velocity profile mainly affects the k x values if the velocity profile across the river section is more uniform the deviation of local velocity from cross sectional average will become less and the dispersion coefficient will be less as well and vice versa bogle 1997 seo and baek 2004 as shown in the fig 2 by considering these deviations of local velocity from cross sectional average velocity it is apparent that there is large shear dispersion due to velocity deviation and causes the dominant longitudinal dispersions as the copula model predicted based on conditional probabilities in table 9 as this figure shows in real streams the lateral shear in the y direction plays a more critical role in the dispersion process the average velocity assumed to be constant over the depth and local velocities are variable over the depth such that they produce longitudinal dispersion of pollutants the velocity gradients in the transverse and vertical directions may tend to produce large dispersion coefficients godfrey and frederick 1970 the analysis of velocity profiles has shown that in the prismatic channel the shear dispersion is only about 1 3 of the rectangular channel values and reveals the contribution effects generated by the edges of the velocity distribution near the banks of cross section where the velocity deviates furthermost from the average cross sectional velocity value bogle 1997 as stated by bogle 1997 in the case of the prismatic section where the depth near the banks is comparatively and considerably decreased the effects of the contribution of these edge near the bank velocities into the longitudinal dispersion are decreased proportionately also changes in the concentration profiles that are produced by the shear flows cause tilting and stretching of the averaged concentration and the variations are destroyed by transverse molecular diffusion wang and jones 1991 the conditional probability ranges predicted by copula for the k x in table 11 two last columns considerably envelopes the observed values and shows the reliability of developed copula based estimation in different velocity profiles with various velocity gradient and flow conditions 3 5 application of probabilistic k x estimation in the practical application range based calibration of a one dimensional numerical model presented in eq 1 is used to verify and show the validity and the applicability of developed copula based range predictions of k x in a precise calibration the range based calibration process is as follows first according to the flow characteristics and the geometrical parameters of the river sections the dimensionless parameters u u and w h are calculated then based on the copula conditional probability results presented in tables 9 and 10 the highest probability for k x hu or k x wu is achieved that gives a range with the highest probability for k x hu or k x wu it is in fact the most probable range for k x hu or k x wu based on the flow characteristics and the geometrical parameters in the next step for one dimensional numerical model calibration the k x value will vary step by step from the lowest to the highest value in the range and the best value for the k x is determined by comparing the reproduced contamination concentration profile with the measured values the k x value which leads the least difference between the simulated concentration and the observed concentration profiles is the optimal k x value two different modes of application of the copula functions can be recommended the first one is determining the appropriate range for the k x with the highest probability and the second one is selecting the best k x value in this paper eight different cases of contamination dispersion in river sections and flume have been used to evaluate the results of the copula application four modes were considered for estimating the highest probability range and four modes for selecting the best dispersion coefficient value the results of the first four cases prediction of the ranges with the highest probability are presented in fig 2 and table 11 in these four cases the aim is to compare the observed dispersion coefficient with the predicted class of k x using copula function based on fig 2 and table 11 the copula is capable of predicting the range of k x with the highest conditional probability appropriately and well fit the dispersion coefficient to the probability range detailed description of fig 2 and table 11 was presented in the previous section the profile of contaminant dispersion and the results of modeling the second four cases choosing the best value of the dispersion coefficient are presented in fig 3 and table 12 for this purpose the experimental data reported by chatila 1998 which are measured in a flume for pollutant transport was used more information about the case study presented by chatila 1998 and seifi and riahi madvar 2018 the objective is to compare the results of contamination concentration modeling based on the copula range based calibrated value of the k x with the measured concentration profile for the range based calibration process first w h and u u were calculated based on the flow characteristics and the geometrical parameters of the cross section then based on the results of the copula conditional probability in table 9 the best range for the dispersion coefficient with the highest probability is selected and presented as the appropriate range for the dispersion coefficient value to the one dimensional numerical model column 9 table 12 in the next step in the one dimensional numerical model the k x in eq 1 was changed in the range from the lower to the upper value and the best value for the k x was achieved based on the least difference between the simulated and measured concentration profiles the final dispersion coefficient is presented in the last column of table 12 as the ultimate value in each modeling mode in fig 3 the concentration profile of the calibrated numerical model with the copula function anfis and anfis ga seifi and riahi madvar 2018 was drawn versus the measured concentration profile it can be seen that there is a general agreement between the measured and simulated concentration profiles also the concentration profiles produced by fischer 1975 and kashefipour and falconer 2002 equations were drawn in this figure the fischer 1975 and kashefipour and falconer 2002 equations eqs 32 and 33 are as follows 32 k x hu 0 011 u u 2 w h 2 33 k x hu 7 428 1 775 w h 0 62 u u 0 572 u u 2 for w h 50 10 612 u u 2 for w h 50 it is worthy to note that as fischer 1975 results were not accurate the correction factor was used to in the calibration process to improve the results of fischer 1975 equation and then the results were compared with the results of the copula function in seifi and riahi madvar 2018 model the dispersion coefficient is determined based on a two step anfis optimization and genetic algorithm training process that is time consuming with the high computational burden and it is a black box model however based on the proposed range of dispersion coefficient using copula calibration of the model is done in a shorter and faster time interval which demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach in numerical model calibration in real conditions also the concentration profile produced by range based calibration has relatively desirable and acceptable accuracy which shows a novel application of copula in numerical model calibration 4 conclusion a single value for k x cannot satisfactorily represent the whole river so in the present study the author s used copula functions to provide a range of the ldc based on hydraulic parameters w h u u instead of a single value the accurate estimation of the k x value is crucial in one dimensional pollutant transport model calibrations based on the authors knowledge this is the first research that carried out the probabilistic prediction of the k x by providing reliable ranges of the k x for numerical model calibrations the proposed ranges of the k x reduce time and required efforts to calibrate the pollutant transport model to alleviate the non identifiability issues of the k x calibration previous studies focused on applying empirical equations to calibrate the k x this approach is typically not a feasible solution because it is time consuming in finding the appropriate range for kx in the case and one rarely has such accurate and informative prior knowledge besides in the present study authors innovatively provided conditional based calibration results table 8 for the k x based on predefined values of dimensionless w h and u u parameters another substantial improvement of probabilistic model calibration is that it can provide further evidence on the risk of selecting a certain value of the k x this copula based conditional probability between w h u u and k x not only shows the appropriate range of the k x but also provides a reliable probability distribution of the k x with various flow conditions this probabilistic estimation is based on a comprehensive analysis of available data and it can be used for future formulation of the k x for robust estimations it must be noted that this research was carried out based on an extended dataset of 164 field samples so the best copula and marginal distributions frank burr pearson type 6 and log logistic distributions may not be the best fit if the samples change however if the distribution of high low values in the samples does not change considerably they still are the best fits declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5647,the dynamic capillary effect in capillary pressure plays a significant role during the non equilibrium flow in porous media for various chemical environmental and petroleum processes a unified model is developed in this work to estimate the dynamic capillary effect in matrix during the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media multiple influential parameters especially fluid viscosity surfactant and fracture with inconsistent effects and the interplays between them are comprehensively considered firstly a databank of the relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the main controlling parameters is established through non equilibrium flow experiments on the fractured and intact tight core samples secondly the previously unclear correlations between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the influential parameters are determined individually which are then incorporated into an overall model based on the buckingham s π theorem the proposed model is further validated and simplified showing accurate matches with the r2 0 95 at last the sensitivity analysis of five different non equilibrium flow conditions is conducted through which effects of the influential parameters on the dynamic capillary effect are investigated the proposed model can reasonably explain the porous media properties the easiness and uniformity of the fluid flow and the

equilibrium flow in porous media is commonly encountered in petroleum chemical and environmental engineering zhang et al 2019 a typical example is the petroleum contamination in the subsurface during which petroleum is produced from the reservoir and spreads to near subsurface aquifers dejam et al 2018a b other examples include co2 sequestration agricultural applications paper production and so on cai et al 2014 wang and sheng 2018 during such non equilibrium flow the relationship between the capillary pressure and wetting phase saturation is vital for describing and simulating the hydrodynamics of multiphase fluid flow civan 2015 traditionally the capillary pressure is measured under the equilibrium process and it is assumed to depend only on the relative saturation of the wetting phase bear and verruijt 1987 however the measurement of this equilibrium capillary pressure is highly time consuming and the flow appears non equilibrium in tight porous media where the saturation changes tremendously o carroll et al 2005 tian et al 2012 diamantopoulos et al 2015 the capillary pressure is governed by the change rate of wetting phase saturation during the non equilibrium flow which is regarded as the dynamic capillary effect and the corresponding capillary pressure is dynamic hassanizadeh celia and dahle 2002 a widely used model to describe the relationship between the dynamic capillary pressure and the equilibrium capillary pressure has been proposed by hassanizadeh and gray 1990 as 1 p c d p nw p w p c s τ s w t where p c d is the dynamic capillary pressure ml 1t 2 p c s is the equilibrium capillary pressure ml 1t 2 s w is the water saturation dimensionless s w t is the time derivative of water saturation t 1 τ is the dynamic capillary coefficient ml 1t 1 which is a direct measurement of the dynamic capillary effect a large τ describes a strong dynamic capillary effect if the τ is nearly 0 the difference between the dynamic capillary pressure and the equilibrium capillary pressure can be neglected the dynamic capillary effect is obvious during the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media li et al 2018 tian et al 2019 because the dynamic capillary effect is stronger in a lower permeability all the permeability is intrinsic in this paper and more heterogeneous porous media hou et al 2012 das and mirzaei 2013 the dynamic capillary effect is significantly affected by multiple parameters such as the fluid properties porous media properties contact angle and fluid saturation joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 in particular the fractures in porous media have important influences on the dynamic capillary effect indicating that the dynamic capillary effect in a fractured tight porous media is considerable and complex which will influence the capillary pressure and thus the non equilibrium flow salimi and bruining 2012 tang et al 2018 dejam 2019 some of the conclusions from the previous studies regarding the effects of the influential parameters are not consistent among which some typical examples are listed as follows 1 fluid viscosity dahle et al 2005 and joekar niasar et al 2010 found that the dynamic capillary coefficient increases with the increase of the viscosity ratio the ratio of non wetting fluid viscosity to wetting fluid viscosity through their pore net work modeling which is verified by the primary drainage experiments conducted by goel and o carroll 2011 das et al 2010 reported the opposite trend by examining the variation of the dynamic capillary coefficient in a series of numerical drainage experiments at the core scale joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 revealed that the dynamic capillary coefficient increases with the increase of the effective viscosity where the effective viscosity weights the wetting phase and non wetting phase viscosities linearly by saturation however such relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and effective viscosity is only applicable for a stable invading front where a piston like movement dominates abbasi et al 2018 found that the dynamic capillary effect is weaker with higher oil viscosities in their ongoing simulation methods 2 fracture fractures change the heterogeneity and domain scale previous studies manthey et al 2005 hou et al 2012 das et al 2015 on the role of heterogeneity have agreed with each other that the dynamic capillary coefficient increases with the increase in heterogeneity as for domain scale dahle et al 2005 concluded that the dynamic capillary coefficient is proportional to l 2 where l is the length of capillary tube this result was also reported by manthey et al 2005 based on the simulation study at continuum scale mirzaei and das 2007 demonstrated that the dynamic capillary coefficient depends on aspect ratio or sample volume bottero et al 2011 investigated the dynamic capillary coefficient experimentally and observed that the order of magnitude increases in the dynamic capillary coefficient as the observation scale increases also abidoye and das 2014 reported an order increase in the magnitude of the dynamic capillary coefficient as the domain increases however camps roach et al 2010 suggested that the magnitude of the dynamic capillary coefficient does not increase when the average volume decreases 3 surfactant surfactant can change the contact angle wettability and interfacial tension thus impacting the dynamic capillary coefficient which has been concluded by li et al 2016 mumford and o carroll 2011 explored effects of the contact angle on the dynamic capillary coefficient using bundle of tubes simulations and pointed that the dynamic capillary coefficient would change non monotonically with an increasing equilibrium contact angle a maximum value of the dynamic capillary coefficient would occur at 60 while the lower value would be reached at near 90 and the lowest value would be achieved at near 0 li et al 2016 found that the dynamic capillary coefficient is smaller with a contact angle closer to 90 on the contrary hassanizadeh et al 2002 and wildenschild et al 2001 suggested that dynamic contact angles may be important for larger equilibrium contact angles the conclusions listed above regarding the effect of fluid viscosity fracture and surfactant have not reached agreement also limited efforts have been made in the literatures to model the dynamic capillary coefficient by a functional form for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media which causes the difficulty to predict the dynamic capillary coefficient and quantify the interplay among the influential parameters moreover the existing models of dynamic capillary coefficient have shown a wide range of variability because the physics accounted by one model is overlooked by other models entov 1980 das et al 2010 abidoye and das 2014 civan 2015 for example the coefficients in the model of das et al 2010 must be obtained for individual scenario separately in the model of abidoye and das 2014 the influence of domain scales is elucidated and the effects of viscosity ratio are emphasized civan 2012 2015 presented a formula for the correlation of the dynamic capillary coefficient with the scaled temperature immobile saturation of the wetting phase and fluid viscosity et al the value of the dynamic capillary coefficient not only helps to quantify the capillary pressure accurately but also is beneficial to understand the dynamics of the non equilibrium flow in porous media civan 2011 our work aims to propose a unified dynamic capillary coefficient model which can be applied for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media our model in this work is established through the incorporation of different influential parameters such as fracture surfactant and viscosity first the relationships between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the main controlling parameters especially fluid viscosity surfactant and fracture with inconsistent effects were examined through the displacement experiments on the fractured and intact tight core samples with different porous media properties different fluid properties and different injection pressures thus establishing a comprehensive databank for the model second previously unclear correlations between the dynamic capillary coefficient and its corresponding influential parameters were determined and the overall model was built by employing the buckingham s π theorem further the proposed model was validated and simplified with the experimental databank and the ranges of coefficients values in this model were recommended at last the sensitivity analysis was performed on the proposed model to demonstrate the effects of the influential parameters on the dynamic capillary effect 2 methods 2 1 establishment of the experimental databank in our previous work the dynamic capillary effect was measured through specially designed apparatus which explores the effects of chemical additives li et al 2016 capillary number li et al 2018 fracture li et al 2019a and fluid viscosity li et al 2020b on the dynamic capillary effect in low permeability and tight porous media the effects of permeability on the dynamic capillary effect were also examined li et al 2017b in this work further experiments were conducted to obtain a comprehensive databank to explore the relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and its controlling factors especially fracture surfactant and viscosity of which the roles on the dynamic capillary coefficient remained unclear during the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media although the effects of permeability and pressure difference have been clearly illustrated by the previous studies we also tested the reaction of the dynamic capillary coefficient with these parameters thus expanding the databank and preparing for the simplification and validation of the unified model the core samples were collected from a tight sandstone oil formation the depth of the reservoir is 1700 1800 m and the overburden pressure is calculated as 40 mpa the average pressure and temperature of the reservoir are 14 5 mpa and 60 c respectively the length of the core samples is approximately 40 mm and the diameter is around 38 mm the formation brine shows a total salinity of 41 04 g l a density of 1 017 g cm3 an electrical resistivity of 0 102 ω m and a viscosity of 0 488 mpa s at the reservoir temperature two kinds of formulated oil were used in the experiments and the viscosities of these two kinds of formulated oil are 1 14 mpa s basic oil and 2 97 mpa s viscous oil respectively methanol and toluene were used to clean the core samples then the core samples were dried in an oven for 72 h the in situ effective stress in the formation was adopted to measure the intrinsic permeability and porosity of the core samples through the scms b2 core measurement system made by the state key laboratory of oil and gas reservoir geology and exploitation southwest petroleum university the average contact angle between water and the rock surface the other phase is air was measured to be 39 which shows that these core samples are water wet hydrophilic the fractured core samples were made in the way that the intact cores were fractured by the laboratory vise with steel wires on the two sides of the cores which has been illustrated fully in our previous published paper li et al 2019b to establish the original water and oil saturation specially for the tight core samples a permeable porous sheet saturated with brine was used the core samples were rolled on the porous sheet thus enabling brine to be imbibed into the core samples until the original water saturation was established then the core samples were vacuumed for 4 h to enable the imbibed brine evenly distributed finally the formulated oil was pressured into the core samples for 24 h under the average reservoir pressure of 14 5 mpa fig 1 shows the experimental schematic li et al 2020a the experimental procedures are the same as our previous work li et al 2018 li et al 2020a these experimental procedures include preparing the semi permeable plates establishing the in situ condition and executing dynamic and steady displacement tests separately the relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the water saturation can be obtained from the dynamic capillary pressure saturation relationship the steady capillary pressure saturation relationship and the time derivative of saturation measured by the experiment as shown in table 1 experiments were conducted with different variables permeability case 1 pressure difference case 2 fracture case 3 surfactant case 4 and fluid viscosity case 5 permeabilities intrinsic of the core samples vary from 0 192 to 0 724 md pressure differences were set to be 2 5 mpa and 4 mpa surfactant added is a kind of gemini surfactant of 0 03 wt which can drive the contact angle to be more close to 90 and reduce the interfacial tension with a negligible change of the brine viscosity changes of fluid viscosity were made by using the two kinds of formulated oil 2 2 development of the correlations between influential parameters and the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix from our previous experiments and simulations li et al 2016 li et al 2017b li et al 2018 li et al 2019a li et al 2020a li et al 2020b and the literatures reviewing in the introduction section the dynamic capillary coefficient is associated with multiple parameters such as the fluid viscosity interfacial tension and contact angle the relationships between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the fracture fluid viscosity and surfactant for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media were previously unclear in this work firstly the quantitative relationships between the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix and the controlling parameters for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media were determined individually then a unified model of the dynamic capillary coefficient is proposed to incorporate all the influential parameters as shown in fig 2 the unified model was further regressed simplified and validated with the experimental databank of this work 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental databank as mentioned in the introduction inconsistency exists in the previous studies regarding the effects of the influential parameters on the dynamic capillary effect this inconsistency can be resulted from the varied tested systems in the previous studies so most of the previous studies choose one typical system to explore the characteristics of the dynamic capillary effect thus this work establishes the dynamic capillary coefficient model specially for tight porous media the experimental data used for the development simplification and verification of the dynamic capillary effect model of matrix are plotted in figs 3 7 the fractured samples were characterized by the permeability before their fracturing treatment the results of this work on the role of permeability and pressure difference are consistent with those of the previous studies joekar niasar et al 2010 tian et al 2012 in fig 3 the lower the permeability the higher the dynamic capillary coefficient fig 4 compares the dynamic capillary coefficients of matrix under different injection pressures which shows that the dynamic capillary coefficient is higher under the higher injection pressure in both the intact and fractured core samples the results of this work on the role of fracture surfactant and viscosity are specially for the tight porous media as illustrated in fig 5 fractures decrease the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix and the more the fractures the larger the decrease in the dynamic capillary coefficient fig 6 illustrates that the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix is decreased by the surfactant added which reduces the interfacial tension and changes the contact angle in fig 7 the higher oil viscosity could result in the higher dynamic capillary coefficient 3 2 model establishment 3 2 1 correlation between fracture and the dynamic capillary coefficient in this study the dynamic capillary effect in the matrix as well as the influence of fracture on the dynamic capillary effect in the matrix are considered the dynamic capillary effect in the fractures is neglected one reason is that the matrix system has a much stronger dynamic capillary effect and a much higher dynamic capillary pressure than those in the fracture systems and the dynamic capillary effect in a fracture is very weak and impacts very slightly on the fluid flow in the porous media the other reason is that the forced capillary imbibition mainly occurs in the matrix system instead of in the fractures due to the high capillary pressure only in the matrix the matrix of a fractured porous medium faces higher invading pressure than that faced by the matrix of an intact porous medium i e fractures shorten the transmission distance of the injection pressure for the matrix an effective pressure imposing length l c is introduced to quantify this mechanism in our previous work li et al 2020a as 2 l c v a c where a c is the pressure imposing area l2 v is the pressure imposing volume l3 3 2 2 correlation between the viscosity and the dynamic capillary coefficient after analyzing the experimental data using the method of goel and o carroll 2011 with the typical result shown in fig 8 we find that the dynamic capillary coefficient in tight porous media of this study can be proportional to the parameter μ ew 3 μ ew μ o s o μ w s w μ w where μ ew is defined as the effective relative viscosity in this work dimensionless μ w and μ o are the viscosity of water and oil respectively ml 1t 1 s w and s o are the water and oil phase saturation respectively dimensionless as plotted in fig 8 the dynamic capillary coefficient is normalized by the effective relative viscosity to better demonstrate the relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the fluid viscosity 3 2 3 correlation between the surfactant and the dynamic capillary coefficient the more water wet the rock is or the lower the interfacial tension is between oil and water the lower the work of adhesion is between oil and rock surface and the lower energy is required to displace oil tadmor et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and liu et al 2007 defined the reduction factor of adhesion work e to quantitatively explore the effect of surfactant on the fluid imbibition which is shown as follows 4 e w 2 w 1 σ ow2 1 cos θ 2 σ ow1 1 cos θ 1 where w 2 and w 1 are the adhesion work between oil and porous media surface to displace oil after and before the surfactant are added respectively mt 2 θ 2 and θ 1 are the contact angles between water and porous media surface after and before the surfactant is added respectively σ ow2 and σ ow1 are the interfacial tensions between oil and brine with and without the surfactant added respectively mt 2 the smaller the adhesion work is the stronger effect of the surfactant is and the oil could be moved more easily in the pores during the displacement process accordingly we applied a similar correlation between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the surfactant as follows 5 τ σ 2 cos θ 2 σ 1 cos θ 1 f 3 2 4 the unified model of the dynamic capillary coefficient apart from the influential parameters fluid viscosity fracture and surfactant specially affecting on tight porous media explored by the experiments of this work there are many parameters affecting the dynamic capillary coefficient during multiphase flow in porous media these parameters including the porous media entry pressure porosity fluid density and so on based on the experimental study and the literatures the general relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and all the influential parameters can be combined as 6 τ f s w σ 1 cos θ 1 σ 2 cos θ 2 l c 2

pressure ml 1t 2 ϕ is the porosity of the material dimensionless λ is a dimensionless parameter from brooks corey constitutive model which mainly depends on the pore and particle size distribution of the materials brooks and corey 1964 g is the gravity constant lt 2 based on the correlations between the influential parameters and the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix concluded from the experiments and the literatures reviewing the integrated model for the dynamic capillary coefficient of the matrix can be deduced using the buckingham s π theorem civan 2011 as 7 τ w s w b ϕ λ l c 2 k

cos θ 1 f represents the effect of the surfactant injected into the porous media ρ w ρ o e demonstrates the effect of density and a higher e shows a stronger effect of density on the dynamic capillary effect μ ew c shows the effect of viscosity or viscous forces and a higher c means a stronger effect of the viscous forces ϕ λ l c 2 k d shows the properties of the porous media and a smaller d means generally the higher permeability and porosity of the porous media 3 3 model simplification and validation the unified model was regressed with the experimental databank of this work illustrated in section 3 1 the results show that e 0 indicating that the density has a negligible influence on the dynamic capillary effect moreover d 0 5 f s w s w i 4 and h 1 so the model can be simplified as follows 8 τ a s w b μ ew c σ 2 cos θ 2 σ 1 cos θ 1 s w s wi 4 9 a ω ϕ l c λ k δ p p d p d σ cos θ g where a b c are the coefficients determined by experiments for individual rock type they represent different properties of the porous media a represents the permeability porosity of the porous media and the easiness of the fluid flow a smaller a indicates a more permeable and more porous rock b indicates the uniformity of the fluid flow in the porous media and the flow is less uniform if the b is closer to 1 c shows the effect of viscosity or viscous forces and a higher c shows a stronger effect of the viscous forces σ 2 cos θ 2 σ 1 cos θ 1 s w s wi 4 indicates that the influence of surfactant is related to the injected proportion of the surfactant the accuracy of this model is well validated by the experimental data as shown in fig 9 with the r2 around 0 95 the recommended ranges of values for the coefficients a b and c are determined by fitting this model with the experimental databank as follows 1 a 1010 to 1011 2 b 1 4 to 1 8 for water flooding 0 4 0 8 for surfactant added flooding 3 c 1 01 to 1 2 it should be noted that these ranges of values are specifically for tight porous media the coefficients a b and c should be evaluated for every rock type and the applicability of this model with other types of porous media needs further examinations 3 4 effects of the influential parameters the sensitivity analysis was performed on the proposed model to examine the effect of the influential parameters permeability fluid viscosity surfactant pressure difference and fracture on the dynamic capillary effect in the matrix during the non equilibrium flow in fractured tight porous media 3 4 1 the effect of permeability the coefficients a b and c were determined from case 1 and the results were illustrated in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix increases with the decrease of permeability which is consistent with the previous researches manthey et al 2005 li et al 2017b the lower permeability corresponds to the higher dynamic capillary effect since a porous media with a lower permeability indicates generally the smaller pores and the more heterogeneous structure meanwhile the coefficients show different trends as the permeability increases the decrease of a shows that the porous media is more permeable and more porous the increased gap between 1 and b represents the more uniform fluid flow c decreases slightly around 1 demonstrating the marginally weaker effect of the viscous force 3 4 2 the effect of fluid viscosity the values of the coefficients a b and c are determined from case 5 as shown in table 2 with the higher oil viscosity the value of a grows for both fractured and intact tight core samples which implies a smaller flow ability in the rock with the smaller permeability and porosity this is because that the higher oil viscosity allows more oil to absorb on the pore walls which increases the thickness of the boundary layer and constricts the fluid flow area diwu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the value of b is closer to 1 with the higher oil viscosity for all the tight core samples indicating a more irregular displacement front such as a stronger fingering flow which is consistent with the previous study that a higher dynamic capillary coefficient corresponds to a more unstable and steeper front das et al 2010 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 the increased c with the higher oil viscosity represents a stronger effect of the viscous force on the dynamic fluid flow 3 4 3 the effect of surfactant table 3 displays the coefficients a b and c with and without surfactant from case 4 a significant decrement of a can be found after the surfactant was added which is caused by the reduced interfacial tension and thus the reduced adhesion energy with the addition of surfactant b decreases from larger than 1 to be lower than 1 the reason is that before the addition of the surfactant the injected brine mainly enters into the large pores with the addition of the surfactant the injected fluid enters into large and small pores at the same time it is shown that c declines noticeably and the more fractures correspond to the larger decline of c this is because that fractures enable more matrix to contact with the surfactant thus reducing the interfacial tension more significantly the reduction factor of adhesion work e is 0 02 in our experiments for the effect of surfactant which shows the considerable reduction in the dynamic capillary effect and the much enhanced oil recovery efficiency in addition the widely used low salinity waterflooding also changes the interfacial tension and wettability ai saedi and flori 2018 bikash et al 2018 which leads to the value of e lower than 1 thus the dynamic capillary effect is weakened for the low salinity waterflooding and the capillary resistant is reduced 3 4 4 the effect of pressure difference table 4 shows the coefficients a b and c with different pressure difference from case 2 it is indicated that a increases significantly with the higher pressure difference demonstrating a more difficult condition for fluid flow the decreased b shows a less uniform front during the displacement with the higher injection pressure the higher c shows a thicker boundary layer and a larger viscous force the changes of dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix in this work show a significant dependence on the pressure difference however previous experimental studies sakaki et al 2010 abidoye and das 2014 concluded that the dynamic capillary coefficient is not related to the injection pressure one reason should be the difference in porous media type the previous studies generally used high or medium permeability porous media but this work aims at tight porous media another reason should be that the injection pressures of this work are much higher than those in the previous literatures therefore our conclusions show the specific characteristics of the dynamic capillary coefficient in tight porous media li et al 2017a found that the higher the injection rate is the more likely the displacement would be piston like and they recommended a large injection rate to get a good sweep efficiency however in this work the higher injection pressure causes the stronger dynamic capillary effect which is unfavorable to reach a good sweep efficiency this is because the injection rate 0 001 cm3 s adopted in the crossflow model of li et al 2017a is much slower compared with that in our experiments also the smallest pore radius in their model is 9 um which is obviously larger than the pore sizes of tight porous media weitz et al 1987 found that when the capillary number grows from lower than 10 4 to higher than 10 4 the capillary pressure changes from driving force to resistance this is consistent with our results which indicates that a high injection pressure may be unfavorable to piston like displacement li et al 2018 during the displacement process in fractured tight porous media the capillary pressure is the driving force of the imbibition recovery when the injection pressure is low and turns to be a resistance force when the injection pressure is high surfactant reduces the adhesion energy and the capillary pressure which improves the sweep efficiency but reduces the recovery rate from imbibition thus low injection pressures are recommended to allow fully imbibition in small pores at the early stage of the displacement process of tight porous media surfactant can be added at the later stage with a higher injection pressure thus reducing the capillary resistance and displacing more oil out of both small and large pores 3 4 5 the effect of fracture as described in table 5 the coefficients a b and c were obtained by fitting the model with the experimental data considering the effects of fractures from case 3 it is shown that the value of a for the fractured porous media is smaller than that for the intact porous media the more fractures of a porous medium shows the smaller the value of a is the value of b is increasingly larger than 1 and the more fractures corresponds to the larger value of b this indicates that fractures lead to a more uniform and regular displacement front in the matrix the value of c rises more significantly for the multi fractures condition than that for the single fracture condition this is because the fractures increase the flow velocity in the matrix and the higher flow velocity in the matrix triggers the stronger viscous force on the one hand the more fractures correspond to the more heterogeneous porous media the geometry heterogeneities may cause lateral spreading of oil and entrapment of fluid in the small pores which results in a larger dynamic capillary coefficient fractures generate the lower anisotropic ration of matrix permeability to fracture permeability which also leads to higher dynamic capillary coefficients according to the conclusion of mirzaei and das 2007 on the other hand fractures change the boundary condition of the matrix which has been demonstrated to influence the dynamic capillary effect of capillary pressure sakaki et al 2010 the fractures are much more permeable than the matrix which could be another source of injection pressure i e the effective pressure imposing length on the matrix l c is shortened by fractures and the pressure gradient is enlarged by the fractures 4 summary and conclusions in this paper a comprehensive model is proposed to quantitatively describe the dynamic capillary effect in matrix during the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media the model is further validated and simplified by fitting with the experimental databank of core flooding on the target tight porous media and ranges of values for the model coefficients are recommended for tight porous media sensitivity analysis has been conducted on this model to examine the effect of its influential parameters permeability fluid viscosity surfactant pressure difference and fracture on the dynamic capillary effect several conclusions could be drawn as follows 1 the proposed model can specifically and reasonably explain the porous media properties the easiness and uniformity of the fluid flow and the influence of viscous forces for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media through the interpretation of its coefficients 2 the model demonstrates that before the addition of the surfactant the injected brine mainly enters into the large pores after the addition of the surfactant the injected brine enters into the large and small pores at the same time 3 low injection pressure is recommended to allow the full imbibition in small pores at the early stage of the displacement process in fractured tight porous media and surfactant is recommended to be added at the later stage with a higher injection pressure thus reducing the capillary resistance and displacing more oil out of both large and small pores 4 fractures can change the heterogeneity and the boundary condition which is responsible for the complex influence of fractures on the dynamic capillary effect in matrix it should be noted that permeabilities of the examined porous media in this work have not included the lowest values of the tight porous media and we did not consider this extreme case we will investigate this extreme case in our future work to extend the application scope of our research credit authorship contribution statement ying li

equilibrium flow in porous media is commonly encountered in petroleum chemical and environmental engineering zhang et al 2019 a typical example is the petroleum contamination in the subsurface during which petroleum is produced from the reservoir and spreads to near subsurface aquifers dejam et al 2018a b other examples include co2 sequestration agricultural applications paper production and so on cai et al 2014 wang and sheng 2018 during such non equilibrium flow the relationship between the capillary pressure and wetting phase saturation is vital for describing and simulating the hydrodynamics of multiphase fluid flow civan 2015 traditionally the capillary pressure is measured under the equilibrium process and it is assumed to depend only on the relative saturation of the wetting phase bear and verruijt 1987 however the measurement of this equilibrium capillary pressure is highly time consuming and the flow appears non equilibrium in tight porous media where the saturation changes tremendously o carroll et al 2005 tian et al 2012 diamantopoulos et al 2015 the capillary pressure is governed by the change rate of wetting phase saturation during the non equilibrium flow which is regarded as the dynamic capillary effect and the corresponding capillary pressure is dynamic hassanizadeh celia and dahle 2002 a widely used model to describe the relationship between the dynamic capillary pressure and the equilibrium capillary pressure has been proposed by hassanizadeh and gray 1990 as 1 p c d p nw p w p c s τ s w t where p c d is the dynamic capillary pressure ml 1t 2 p c s is the equilibrium capillary pressure ml 1t 2 s w is the water saturation dimensionless s w t is the time derivative of water saturation t 1 τ is the dynamic capillary coefficient ml 1t 1 which is a direct measurement of the dynamic capillary effect a large τ describes a strong dynamic capillary effect if the τ is nearly 0 the difference between the dynamic capillary pressure and the equilibrium capillary pressure can be neglected the dynamic capillary effect is obvious during the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media li et al 2018 tian et al 2019 because the dynamic capillary effect is stronger in a lower permeability all the permeability is intrinsic in this paper and more heterogeneous porous media hou et al 2012 das and mirzaei 2013 the dynamic capillary effect is significantly affected by multiple parameters such as the fluid properties porous media properties contact angle and fluid saturation joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 in particular the fractures in porous media have important influences on the dynamic capillary effect indicating that the dynamic capillary effect in a fractured tight porous media is considerable and complex which will influence the capillary pressure and thus the non equilibrium flow salimi and bruining 2012 tang et al 2018 dejam 2019 some of the conclusions from the previous studies regarding the effects of the influential parameters are not consistent among which some typical examples are listed as follows 1 fluid viscosity dahle et al 2005 and joekar niasar et al 2010 found that the dynamic capillary coefficient increases with the increase of the viscosity ratio the ratio of non wetting fluid viscosity to wetting fluid viscosity through their pore net work modeling which is verified by the primary drainage experiments conducted by goel and o carroll 2011 das et al 2010 reported the opposite trend by examining the variation of the dynamic capillary coefficient in a series of numerical drainage experiments at the core scale joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 revealed that the dynamic capillary coefficient increases with the increase of the effective viscosity where the effective viscosity weights the wetting phase and non wetting phase viscosities linearly by saturation however such relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and effective viscosity is only applicable for a stable invading front where a piston like movement dominates abbasi et al 2018 found that the dynamic capillary effect is weaker with higher oil viscosities in their ongoing simulation methods 2 fracture fractures change the heterogeneity and domain scale previous studies manthey et al 2005 hou et al 2012 das et al 2015 on the role of heterogeneity have agreed with each other that the dynamic capillary coefficient increases with the increase in heterogeneity as for domain scale dahle et al 2005 concluded that the dynamic capillary coefficient is proportional to l 2 where l is the length of capillary tube this result was also reported by manthey et al 2005 based on the simulation study at continuum scale mirzaei and das 2007 demonstrated that the dynamic capillary coefficient depends on aspect ratio or sample volume bottero et al 2011 investigated the dynamic capillary coefficient experimentally and observed that the order of magnitude increases in the dynamic capillary coefficient as the observation scale increases also abidoye and das 2014 reported an order increase in the magnitude of the dynamic capillary coefficient as the domain increases however camps roach et al 2010 suggested that the magnitude of the dynamic capillary coefficient does not increase when the average volume decreases 3 surfactant surfactant can change the contact angle wettability and interfacial tension thus impacting the dynamic capillary coefficient which has been concluded by li et al 2016 mumford and o carroll 2011 explored effects of the contact angle on the dynamic capillary coefficient using bundle of tubes simulations and pointed that the dynamic capillary coefficient would change non monotonically with an increasing equilibrium contact angle a maximum value of the dynamic capillary coefficient would occur at 60 while the lower value would be reached at near 90 and the lowest value would be achieved at near 0 li et al 2016 found that the dynamic capillary coefficient is smaller with a contact angle closer to 90 on the contrary hassanizadeh et al 2002 and wildenschild et al 2001 suggested that dynamic contact angles may be important for larger equilibrium contact angles the conclusions listed above regarding the effect of fluid viscosity fracture and surfactant have not reached agreement also limited efforts have been made in the literatures to model the dynamic capillary coefficient by a functional form for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media which causes the difficulty to predict the dynamic capillary coefficient and quantify the interplay among the influential parameters moreover the existing models of dynamic capillary coefficient have shown a wide range of variability because the physics accounted by one model is overlooked by other models entov 1980 das et al 2010 abidoye and das 2014 civan 2015 for example the coefficients in the model of das et al 2010 must be obtained for individual scenario separately in the model of abidoye and das 2014 the influence of domain scales is elucidated and the effects of viscosity ratio are emphasized civan 2012 2015 presented a formula for the correlation of the dynamic capillary coefficient with the scaled temperature immobile saturation of the wetting phase and fluid viscosity et al the value of the dynamic capillary coefficient not only helps to quantify the capillary pressure accurately but also is beneficial to understand the dynamics of the non equilibrium flow in porous media civan 2011 our work aims to propose a unified dynamic capillary coefficient model which can be applied for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media our model in this work is established through the incorporation of different influential parameters such as fracture surfactant and viscosity first the relationships between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the main controlling parameters especially fluid viscosity surfactant and fracture with inconsistent effects were examined through the displacement experiments on the fractured and intact tight core samples with different porous media properties different fluid properties and different injection pressures thus establishing a comprehensive databank for the model second previously unclear correlations between the dynamic capillary coefficient and its corresponding influential parameters were determined and the overall model was built by employing the buckingham s π theorem further the proposed model was validated and simplified with the experimental databank and the ranges of coefficients values in this model were recommended at last the sensitivity analysis was performed on the proposed model to demonstrate the effects of the influential parameters on the dynamic capillary effect 2 methods 2 1 establishment of the experimental databank in our previous work the dynamic capillary effect was measured through specially designed apparatus which explores the effects of chemical additives li et al 2016 capillary number li et al 2018 fracture li et al 2019a and fluid viscosity li et al 2020b on the dynamic capillary effect in low permeability and tight porous media the effects of permeability on the dynamic capillary effect were also examined li et al 2017b in this work further experiments were conducted to obtain a comprehensive databank to explore the relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and its controlling factors especially fracture surfactant and viscosity of which the roles on the dynamic capillary coefficient remained unclear during the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media although the effects of permeability and pressure difference have been clearly illustrated by the previous studies we also tested the reaction of the dynamic capillary coefficient with these parameters thus expanding the databank and preparing for the simplification and validation of the unified model the core samples were collected from a tight sandstone oil formation the depth of the reservoir is 1700 1800 m and the overburden pressure is calculated as 40 mpa the average pressure and temperature of the reservoir are 14 5 mpa and 60 c respectively the length of the core samples is approximately 40 mm and the diameter is around 38 mm the formation brine shows a total salinity of 41 04 g l a density of 1 017 g cm3 an electrical resistivity of 0 102 ω m and a viscosity of 0 488 mpa s at the reservoir temperature two kinds of formulated oil were used in the experiments and the viscosities of these two kinds of formulated oil are 1 14 mpa s basic oil and 2 97 mpa s viscous oil respectively methanol and toluene were used to clean the core samples then the core samples were dried in an oven for 72 h the in situ effective stress in the formation was adopted to measure the intrinsic permeability and porosity of the core samples through the scms b2 core measurement system made by the state key laboratory of oil and gas reservoir geology and exploitation southwest petroleum university the average contact angle between water and the rock surface the other phase is air was measured to be 39 which shows that these core samples are water wet hydrophilic the fractured core samples were made in the way that the intact cores were fractured by the laboratory vise with steel wires on the two sides of the cores which has been illustrated fully in our previous published paper li et al 2019b to establish the original water and oil saturation specially for the tight core samples a permeable porous sheet saturated with brine was used the core samples were rolled on the porous sheet thus enabling brine to be imbibed into the core samples until the original water saturation was established then the core samples were vacuumed for 4 h to enable the imbibed brine evenly distributed finally the formulated oil was pressured into the core samples for 24 h under the average reservoir pressure of 14 5 mpa fig 1 shows the experimental schematic li et al 2020a the experimental procedures are the same as our previous work li et al 2018 li et al 2020a these experimental procedures include preparing the semi permeable plates establishing the in situ condition and executing dynamic and steady displacement tests separately the relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the water saturation can be obtained from the dynamic capillary pressure saturation relationship the steady capillary pressure saturation relationship and the time derivative of saturation measured by the experiment as shown in table 1 experiments were conducted with different variables permeability case 1 pressure difference case 2 fracture case 3 surfactant case 4 and fluid viscosity case 5 permeabilities intrinsic of the core samples vary from 0 192 to 0 724 md pressure differences were set to be 2 5 mpa and 4 mpa surfactant added is a kind of gemini surfactant of 0 03 wt which can drive the contact angle to be more close to 90 and reduce the interfacial tension with a negligible change of the brine viscosity changes of fluid viscosity were made by using the two kinds of formulated oil 2 2 development of the correlations between influential parameters and the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix from our previous experiments and simulations li et al 2016 li et al 2017b li et al 2018 li et al 2019a li et al 2020a li et al 2020b and the literatures reviewing in the introduction section the dynamic capillary coefficient is associated with multiple parameters such as the fluid viscosity interfacial tension and contact angle the relationships between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the fracture fluid viscosity and surfactant for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media were previously unclear in this work firstly the quantitative relationships between the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix and the controlling parameters for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media were determined individually then a unified model of the dynamic capillary coefficient is proposed to incorporate all the influential parameters as shown in fig 2 the unified model was further regressed simplified and validated with the experimental databank of this work 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental databank as mentioned in the introduction inconsistency exists in the previous studies regarding the effects of the influential parameters on the dynamic capillary effect this inconsistency can be resulted from the varied tested systems in the previous studies so most of the previous studies choose one typical system to explore the characteristics of the dynamic capillary effect thus this work establishes the dynamic capillary coefficient model specially for tight porous media the experimental data used for the development simplification and verification of the dynamic capillary effect model of matrix are plotted in figs 3 7 the fractured samples were characterized by the permeability before their fracturing treatment the results of this work on the role of permeability and pressure difference are consistent with those of the previous studies joekar niasar et al 2010 tian et al 2012 in fig 3 the lower the permeability the higher the dynamic capillary coefficient fig 4 compares the dynamic capillary coefficients of matrix under different injection pressures which shows that the dynamic capillary coefficient is higher under the higher injection pressure in both the intact and fractured core samples the results of this work on the role of fracture surfactant and viscosity are specially for the tight porous media as illustrated in fig 5 fractures decrease the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix and the more the fractures the larger the decrease in the dynamic capillary coefficient fig 6 illustrates that the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix is decreased by the surfactant added which reduces the interfacial tension and changes the contact angle in fig 7 the higher oil viscosity could result in the higher dynamic capillary coefficient 3 2 model establishment 3 2 1 correlation between fracture and the dynamic capillary coefficient in this study the dynamic capillary effect in the matrix as well as the influence of fracture on the dynamic capillary effect in the matrix are considered the dynamic capillary effect in the fractures is neglected one reason is that the matrix system has a much stronger dynamic capillary effect and a much higher dynamic capillary pressure than those in the fracture systems and the dynamic capillary effect in a fracture is very weak and impacts very slightly on the fluid flow in the porous media the other reason is that the forced capillary imbibition mainly occurs in the matrix system instead of in the fractures due to the high capillary pressure only in the matrix the matrix of a fractured porous medium faces higher invading pressure than that faced by the matrix of an intact porous medium i e fractures shorten the transmission distance of the injection pressure for the matrix an effective pressure imposing length l c is introduced to quantify this mechanism in our previous work li et al 2020a as 2 l c v a c where a c is the pressure imposing area l2 v is the pressure imposing volume l3 3 2 2 correlation between the viscosity and the dynamic capillary coefficient after analyzing the experimental data using the method of goel and o carroll 2011 with the typical result shown in fig 8 we find that the dynamic capillary coefficient in tight porous media of this study can be proportional to the parameter μ ew 3 μ ew μ o s o μ w s w μ w where μ ew is defined as the effective relative viscosity in this work dimensionless μ w and μ o are the viscosity of water and oil respectively ml 1t 1 s w and s o are the water and oil phase saturation respectively dimensionless as plotted in fig 8 the dynamic capillary coefficient is normalized by the effective relative viscosity to better demonstrate the relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the fluid viscosity 3 2 3 correlation between the surfactant and the dynamic capillary coefficient the more water wet the rock is or the lower the interfacial tension is between oil and water the lower the work of adhesion is between oil and rock surface and the lower energy is required to displace oil tadmor et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and liu et al 2007 defined the reduction factor of adhesion work e to quantitatively explore the effect of surfactant on the fluid imbibition which is shown as follows 4 e w 2 w 1 σ ow2 1 cos θ 2 σ ow1 1 cos θ 1 where w 2 and w 1 are the adhesion work between oil and porous media surface to displace oil after and before the surfactant are added respectively mt 2 θ 2 and θ 1 are the contact angles between water and porous media surface after and before the surfactant is added respectively σ ow2 and σ ow1 are the interfacial tensions between oil and brine with and without the surfactant added respectively mt 2 the smaller the adhesion work is the stronger effect of the surfactant is and the oil could be moved more easily in the pores during the displacement process accordingly we applied a similar correlation between the dynamic capillary coefficient and the surfactant as follows 5 τ σ 2 cos θ 2 σ 1 cos θ 1 f 3 2 4 the unified model of the dynamic capillary coefficient apart from the influential parameters fluid viscosity fracture and surfactant specially affecting on tight porous media explored by the experiments of this work there are many parameters affecting the dynamic capillary coefficient during multiphase flow in porous media these parameters including the porous media entry pressure porosity fluid density and so on based on the experimental study and the literatures the general relationship between the dynamic capillary coefficient and all the influential parameters can be combined as 6 τ f s w σ 1 cos θ 1 σ 2 cos θ 2 l c 2

the materials brooks and corey 1964 g is the gravity constant lt 2 based on the correlations between the influential parameters and the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix concluded from the experiments and the literatures reviewing the integrated model for the dynamic capillary coefficient of the matrix can be deduced using the buckingham s π theorem civan 2011 as 7 τ w s w b ϕ λ l c 2 k

cos θ 1 f represents the effect of the surfactant injected into the porous media ρ w ρ o e demonstrates the effect of density and a higher e shows a stronger effect of density on the dynamic capillary effect μ ew c shows the effect of viscosity or viscous forces and a higher c means a stronger effect of the viscous forces ϕ λ l c 2 k d shows the properties of the porous media and a smaller d means generally the higher permeability and porosity of the porous media 3 3 model simplification and validation the unified model was regressed with the experimental databank of this work illustrated in section 3 1 the results show that e 0 indicating that the density has a negligible influence on the dynamic capillary effect moreover d 0 5 f s w s w i 4 and h 1 so the model can be simplified as follows 8 τ a s w b μ ew c σ 2 cos θ 2 σ 1 cos θ 1 s w s wi 4 9 a ω ϕ l c λ k δ p p d p d σ cos θ g where a b c are the coefficients determined by experiments for individual rock type they represent different properties of the porous media a represents the permeability porosity of the porous media and the easiness of the fluid flow a smaller a indicates a more permeable and more porous rock b

effect of the viscous forces σ 2 cos θ 2 σ 1 cos θ 1 s w s wi 4 indicates that the influence of surfactant is related to the injected proportion of the surfactant the accuracy of this model is well validated by the experimental data as shown in fig 9 with the r2 around 0 95 the recommended ranges of values for the coefficients a b and c are determined by fitting this model with the experimental databank as follows 1 a 1010 to 1011 2 b 1 4 to 1 8 for water flooding 0 4 0 8 for surfactant added flooding 3 c 1 01 to 1 2 it should be noted that these ranges of values are specifically for tight porous media the coefficients a b and c should be evaluated for every rock type and the applicability of this model with other types of porous media needs further examinations 3 4 effects of the influential parameters the sensitivity analysis was performed on the proposed model to examine the effect of the influential parameters permeability fluid viscosity surfactant pressure difference and fracture on the dynamic capillary effect in the matrix during the non equilibrium flow in fractured tight porous media 3 4 1 the effect of permeability the coefficients a b and c were determined from case 1 and the results were illustrated in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix increases with the decrease of permeability which is consistent with the previous researches manthey et al 2005 li et al 2017b the lower permeability corresponds to the higher dynamic capillary effect since a porous media with a lower permeability indicates generally the smaller pores and the more heterogeneous structure meanwhile the coefficients show different trends as the permeability increases the decrease of a shows that the porous media is more permeable and more porous the increased gap between 1 and b represents the more uniform fluid flow c decreases slightly around 1 demonstrating the marginally weaker effect of the viscous force 3 4 2 the effect of fluid viscosity the values of the coefficients a b and c are determined from case 5 as shown in table 2 with the higher oil viscosity the value of a grows for both fractured and intact tight core samples which implies a smaller flow ability in the rock with the smaller permeability and porosity this is because that the higher oil viscosity allows more oil to absorb on the pore walls which increases the thickness of the boundary layer and constricts the fluid flow area diwu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the value of b is closer to 1 with the higher oil viscosity for all the tight core samples indicating a more irregular displacement front such as a stronger fingering flow which is consistent with the previous study that a higher dynamic capillary coefficient corresponds to a more unstable and steeper front das et al 2010 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 the increased c with the higher oil viscosity represents a stronger effect of the viscous force on the dynamic fluid flow 3 4 3 the effect of surfactant table 3 displays the coefficients a b and c with and without surfactant from case 4 a significant decrement of a can be found after the surfactant was added which is caused by the reduced interfacial tension and thus the reduced adhesion energy with the addition of surfactant b decreases from larger than 1 to be lower than 1 the reason is that before the addition of the surfactant the injected brine mainly enters into the large pores with the addition of the surfactant the injected fluid enters into large and small pores at the same time it is shown that c declines noticeably and the more fractures correspond to the larger decline of c this is because that fractures enable more matrix to contact with the surfactant thus reducing the interfacial tension more significantly the reduction factor of adhesion work e is 0 02 in our experiments for the effect of surfactant which shows the considerable reduction in the dynamic capillary effect and the much enhanced oil recovery efficiency in addition the widely used low salinity waterflooding also changes the interfacial tension and wettability ai saedi and flori 2018 bikash et al 2018 which leads to the value of e lower than 1 thus the dynamic capillary effect is weakened for the low salinity waterflooding and the capillary resistant is reduced 3 4 4 the effect of pressure difference table 4 shows the coefficients a b and c with different pressure difference from case 2 it is indicated that a increases significantly with the higher pressure difference demonstrating a more difficult condition for fluid flow the decreased b shows a less uniform front during the displacement with the higher injection pressure the higher c shows a thicker boundary layer and a larger viscous force the changes of dynamic capillary coefficient of matrix in this work show a significant dependence on the pressure difference however previous experimental studies sakaki et al 2010 abidoye and das 2014 concluded that the dynamic capillary coefficient is not related to the injection pressure one reason should be the difference in porous media type the previous studies generally used high or medium permeability porous media but this work aims at tight porous media another reason should be that the injection pressures of this work are much higher than those in the previous literatures therefore our conclusions show the specific characteristics of the dynamic capillary coefficient in tight porous media li et al 2017a found that the higher the injection rate is the more likely the displacement would be piston like and they recommended a large injection rate to get a good sweep efficiency however in this work the higher injection pressure causes the stronger dynamic capillary effect which is unfavorable to reach a good sweep efficiency this is because the injection rate 0 001 cm3 s adopted in the crossflow model of li et al 2017a is much slower compared with that in our experiments also the smallest pore radius in their model is 9 um which is obviously larger than the pore sizes of tight porous media weitz et al 1987 found that when the capillary number grows from lower than 10 4 to higher than 10 4 the capillary pressure changes from driving force to resistance this is consistent with our results which indicates that a high injection pressure may be unfavorable to piston like displacement li et al 2018 during the displacement process in fractured tight porous media the capillary pressure is the driving force of the imbibition recovery when the injection pressure is low and turns to be a resistance force when the injection pressure is high surfactant reduces the adhesion energy and the capillary pressure which improves the sweep efficiency but reduces the recovery rate from imbibition thus low injection pressures are recommended to allow fully imbibition in small pores at the early stage of the displacement process of tight porous media surfactant can be added at the later stage with a higher injection pressure thus reducing the capillary resistance and displacing more oil out of both small and large pores 3 4 5 the effect of fracture as described in table 5 the coefficients a b and c were obtained by fitting the model with the experimental data considering the effects of fractures from case 3 it is shown that the value of a for the fractured porous media is smaller than that for the intact porous media the more fractures of a porous medium shows the smaller the value of a is the value of b is increasingly larger than 1 and the more fractures corresponds to the larger value of b this indicates that fractures lead to a more uniform and regular displacement front in the matrix the value of c rises more significantly for the multi fractures condition than that for the single fracture condition this is because the fractures increase the flow velocity in the matrix and the higher flow velocity in the matrix triggers the stronger viscous force on the one hand the more fractures correspond to the more heterogeneous porous media the geometry heterogeneities may cause lateral spreading of oil and entrapment of fluid in the small pores which results in a larger dynamic capillary coefficient fractures generate the lower anisotropic ration of matrix permeability to fracture permeability which also leads to higher dynamic capillary coefficients according to the conclusion of mirzaei and das 2007 on the other hand fractures change the boundary condition of the matrix which has been demonstrated to influence the dynamic capillary effect of capillary pressure sakaki et al 2010 the fractures are much more permeable than the matrix which could be another source of injection pressure i e the effective pressure imposing length on the matrix l c is shortened by fractures and the pressure gradient is enlarged by the fractures 4 summary and conclusions in this paper a comprehensive model is proposed to quantitatively describe the dynamic capillary effect in matrix during the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media the model is further validated and simplified by fitting with the experimental databank of core flooding on the target tight porous media and ranges of values for the model coefficients are recommended for tight porous media sensitivity analysis has been conducted on this model to examine the effect of its influential parameters permeability fluid viscosity surfactant pressure difference and fracture on the dynamic capillary effect several conclusions could be drawn as follows 1 the proposed model can specifically and reasonably explain the porous media properties the easiness and uniformity of the fluid flow and the influence of viscous forces for the non equilibrium flow in tight porous media through the interpretation of its coefficients 2 the model demonstrates that before the addition of the surfactant the injected brine mainly enters into the large pores after the addition of the surfactant the injected brine enters into the large and small pores at the same time 3 low injection pressure is recommended to allow the full imbibition in small pores at the early stage of the displacement process in fractured tight porous media and surfactant is recommended to be added at the later stage with a higher injection pressure thus reducing the capillary resistance and displacing more oil out of both large and small pores 4 fractures can change the heterogeneity and the boundary condition which is responsible for the complex influence of fractures on the dynamic capillary effect in matrix it should be noted that permeabilities of the examined porous media in this work have not included the lowest values of the tight porous media and we did not consider this extreme case we will investigate this extreme case in our future work to extend the application scope of our research credit authorship contribution statement ying li

5648,accuracy assessment of precipitation retrievals is a pre requisite for many hydrological studies as it helps to understand the source and the magnitude of the uncertainty in hydrological response variables particularly over regions with complex topography this study evaluates gpm imergv05 tmpa 3b42v7 era interim and era5 precipitation products using 256 ground based gauge stations between 2014 and 2018 over turkey known to have complex topography and varying climate error statistics categorical performance indices and intensity frequency distribution of the precipitation products are investigated over varying wetness and terrain slope classes results show that while the monthly correlation coefficient averaged over all the products is 0 79 for regions having slopes between 5 and 10 this value drops to 0 74 when the slope is above 15 imerg tmpa and era interim products underestimate the observed precipitation over relatively wetter regions while they overestimate over relatively drier regions and relatively higher slopes era5 consistently overestimates the observed precipitation over all the wetness and slope classes overall tmpa shows the smallest wet bias 0 1 mm day while era5 has the largest wet bias 0 5 mm day imerg has the highest monthly correlation i e 0 82 when averaged for all 256 stations and era interim has the lowest correlation 0 77 against the ground based observations the successors imerg and era5 show smaller errsd and higher cc compared to their predecessors tmpa and era interim at both daily and monthly time scales the results also show that the studied satellite based products perform better in matching the frequency of daily precipitation intensities whereas the studied model based products perform better in terms of categorical performance indices for lighter precipitation events keywords complex topography precipitation data evaluation satellite based precipitation products model re analysis global precipitation mission 1 introduction the accurate estimation of precipitation arguably the most significant element in the water and energy cycles kucera et al 2013 is critical in many hydrologic studies however the spatio temporal heterogeneity of precipitation makes its accurate estimation difficult herold et al 2016 hence quantification of the uncertainty of different precipitation products is essential before their use in various hydrologic and hydro climatic settings because of their spatially and temporally continuous coverage remote sensing and model based precipitation data retrieval methods are widely used as alternative sources to cope with the sparsity of ground based observations for example distributed hydrological model simulations using remote sensing and or model based precipitation estimations are particularly beneficial for many studies related to climate impact assessment hydrology and water resources over data sparse regions meng et al 2014 xue et al 2013 with the ever increasing demand for precipitation estimates several quasi global satellite based precipitation products as well as numerical model forecast and reanalysis based products have emerged recently with a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions examples of remote sensing based products include the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 and imerg the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm huffman et al 2015 while examples of the multi year global reanalysis datasets include the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim dee et al 2011 and era5 herbach and dee 2016 among others both satellite and model based precipitation products are being continuously improved over time through taking advantage of the new algorithms and or new satellite based sensors and ground based observations for example gpm encompasses the sensor package a dual frequency precipitation radar pr and a conical scanning multi channel gpm microwave imager compared with trmm instruments a single frequency pr and a multichannel trmm microwave imager thus improving its precipitation detection capability and data error statistics e g hou et al 2014 prakash et al 2016 tan and duan 2017 wang et al 2017 similarly compared with era interim era5 has a higher potential to be used in many hydrological applications owing to its higher spatial resolution 0 25 than its predecessor 0 75 and other improvements related with model physics and assimilation of observations herbach and dee 2016 studies focusing on the inter comparison of these predecessor and successor products are particularly needed to better understand the added utility if any of the successor products to date however only a limited number of studies focused on the inter comparison of era interim and era5 e g beck et al 2019 hénin et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 hence more studies are needed that focus on inter comparison of both satellite based products imerg and tmpa and model based products era5 and era interim over a variety of topographical and climate conditions to better highlight the added utility of these products overall different factors may drive the accuracy of remote sensing and model based precipitation products over regions with complex topography local and regional topographical complexity has the potential to exert a profound impact on atmospheric lapse rate and mesoscale circulations moreover in regions having complex topography extreme events show significant temporal and spatial variations and generate extensive amounts of precipitation in short durations consequently disasters occur in a much quicker fashion over complex topography than over flat regions highlighting the significance of accurate estimation of precipitation over regions with complex topography on the other hand precipitation variability over complex topography poses additional challenges in its estimation via satellite and model based methodologies e g the view angle of the satellite changes abruptly and the orography significantly affects the performance of models hence dedicated studies investigating the relative performances of precipitation products over complex topography are imperative to provide feedback for the continuous improvement of these products as well as for hydrological studies focusing on extreme events and water management at the watershed scale several studies assessed the performance of satellite and model based products by considering either complex topography only e g derin et al 2016 derin and yilmaz 2014 gampe and ludwig 2017 hobouchian et al 2017 mei et al 2014 xu et al 2017 or both the complex and non complex i e relatively flatter topography simultaneously e g beck et al 2019 el kenawy et al 2015 mayor et al 2017 sharifi et al 2016 however most of these studies e g derin and yilmaz 2014 mei et al 2014 were completed before some of the promising precipitation datasets era5 and or imerg were released similarly many of these studies e g derin et al 2016 el kenawy et al 2015 gampe and ludwig 2017 hobouchian et al 2017 mayor et al 2017 mei et al 2014 sharifi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 selected study periods that did not include aforomentioned successor products hence the performance comparisons between tmpa vs imerg and era interim vs era5 were not implemented over complex topography additionally some of these studies e g hobouchian et al 2017 mayor et al 2017 mei et al 2014 sharifi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 evaluated precipitation products for a short limited duration and their estimated errors may not reflect long term error statistics among these studies only beck et al 2019 evaluated recently released precipitation products including imerg and era5 however error statistics over complex topography are not explicitly given as the study focused on the entire conus i e complex and non complex regions together hence studies focusing on comprehensive investigation of satellite and model based precipitation estimates in terms of predecessor successor relationship over complex topography are needed to better understand the degree of performance improvement if any of these products through time geography of turkey is characterized by complex topography and varying climate regimes owing to the high mountains stretching in its east west direction close to both the northern and the southern shores with a relatively flat high plateau in the central parts of the peninsula there exist a number of studies performed to characterize the accuracy of precipitation products over turkey e g bıyık et al 2009 demir et al 2018 derin and yilmaz 2014 toros et al 2018 yucel 2015 yucel et al 2011 yucel and onen 2014 however these studies remain limited and narrow focused i e they either used a low number of stations in validation efforts implemented the analyses over limited regions focused only on short precipitation events occurring within 1 2 days or used only one or two precipitation products hence more comprehensive studies are still needed using more datasets acquired over more stations and representing longer periods to characterize better the uncertainty of widely used recent precipitation products over this region which is known for its varying climatic and topographical conditions the objective of this study is to investigate and simultaneously inter compare the accuracy of some of the most frequently used remote sensing based tmpa and imerg and model based era5 and era interim precipitation products by focusing only on the wide spread complex topography regions of turkey with these investigations the study also adds to the efforts to better characterize the added utility of imerg and era5 products against their predecessors tmpa and era interim products over complex topography with varying climate the article is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data section 3 describes the methodology adopted for the study section 4 presents the results and discussion while the summary and conclusion are covered in section 5 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the study area is turkey which has a total of 783 500 km2 the country is situated in the mediterranean region with temperate climatic conditions but in general the diverse nature of its landscape and the presence of mountains contribute to a significant difference in the climatic conditions of its regions the coastal areas enjoy milder climates while the inland anatolian plateau experiences extremes of hot summers and cold winters with limited precipitation sensoy 2004 depending on the location the annual precipitation in aegean and mediterranean coasts ranges between 580 mm and 1300 mm the eastern coast of the black sea region receives 2200 mm annual precipitation and is the only region of the study area that receives precipitation throughout the year the amount of total precipitation on the coastal and inland stations differs significantly because of mountain blockage for example antalya station which is located at the mediterranean coast in the windward side of the taurus mountain receives three times a higher amount of annual precipitation than karaman and burdur stations which are situated in the leeward side a similar mountain blockage makes the precipitation highly variable along the northern black sea region derin and yilmaz 2014 sensoy 2004 where a coastal hopa station windward receives 2182 mm annual rainfall while an inland bayburt station leeward receives only 420 mm overall the entire country consists of undulating regions while most of the high mountainous ranges are situated in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country please refer to fig 1 a that shows the digital elevation map dem of the study area prepared from 1 km mean dem data that was obtained from https www earthenv org topography amatulli et al 2018 very long coast lines draw its borders with black sea in the north mediterranean sea in the south and aegean sea in the west most of the relatively flat and low land areas are situated in the western regions while most of the high land areas and high mountainous areas are situated in eastern regions the black sea region northeast of turkey and parts of the southeastern region have steeper slopes high percent slopes indicating mountainous areas fig 1b the term complex topography has been widely used in the literature to refer to regions with high elevation e g dinku et al 2002 hirpa et al 2010 milewski et al 2015 or standard deviation of elevation e g chiaravalloti et al 2018 among these studies no clear consensus exists over the definition of the term complex association of this term with only high elevations might be problematic as some flat topography regions may exist at very high altitudes while the precipitation characteristics may not differ considerably from other flat regions at lower elevations hence the term complex may better be associated with the terrain slope that depicts the change in elevation within a unit distance with this one can make a clear perception that the regions with very high slopes are so called mountainous regions even when they are situated at lower elevations in this study we define the term complex regions as those regions having slope values greater than 5 hence all the evaluation analyses are conducted only over regions corresponding to this definition 2 2 datasets the performance of satellite based precipitation products imerg and tmpa and model based precipitation products era interim and era5 is primarily investigated using ground based gauge station data as a reference 2 2 1 ground based gauge precipitation data ground based observation data used in this study were obtained from the general directorate of meteorology gdm of turkey the precipitation datasets obtained over the stations whose data have been shared with world meteorological organization wmo by gdm were excluded to ensure the independence of the reference dataset from the satellite and model based datasets information about these stations were obtained from gdm once this exclusion was done daily precipitation data obtained over 256 gauge stations all of them were situated in complex topography regions having 5 slope between april 2014 and march 2018 was used a reference data for further analyses 2 2 2 satellite based precipitation data gpm imerg algorithm provides three levels of products including the near real time early and late run products and the post real time final run product this study focuses on the final run product which is intended to inter calibrate merge and interpolate all the microwave estimates of the gpm constellation infrared estimates global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly gauge observations and data from other sensors e g geosynchronous infrared imagers and ir passive microwave sounders at 0 1 0 1 huffman et al 2018 please refer to huffman et al 2018 for detailed information on the imerg algorithm the product used in this study is 3imergdfv05 version 5 of the final run product with the 1 daily temporal resolution having a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and a latency of approximately three months the tmpa 3b42 retrievals consist of two products near real time 3b42rt spatial coverage 60 n 60 s and research grade 3b42 spatial coverage 50 n 50 s the former is less accurate e g 3b42rtv7 was found to have lower nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient lower correlation coefficient and higher normalized rmse than 3b42v7 by milewski et al 2015 but provides estimates suitable for near real time monitoring and modeling activities wu et al 2012 the latter available approximately two months after the observation time is released after calibration with trmm combined instrument tci estimate and the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly rain gauge analysis developed by the global precipitation climatological center gpcc a detailed description of the tmpa algorithm and its contributing sensors can be found in huffman and bolvin 2018 nevertheless the resulting research grade product is more accurate and suitable for research huffman et al 2007 huffman and bolvin 2018 it showed higher hydrological efficiency tong et al 2014 and higher statistical accuracy milewski et al 2015 than its real time product this study uses daily precipitation data from version 7 of research grade daily product tmpa 3b42v7 that has 0 25o spatial resolution for brevity shorter names imerg and tmpa are used from here on instead of complete names of satellite based products gpm 3imergdfv05 and tmpa 3b42v7 respectively 2 2 3 model based reanalysis precipitation data the ecmwf era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 is produced with a sequential data assimilation scheme advancing in time using a 12 hourly analysis cycles in each cycle available observations are combined with prior information from a forecast model to estimate the evolving state of the global atmosphere and its underlying surface the analyses are then used to initialize a short range model forecast which provides the prior state estimates needed for the next analysis cycle the spatial resolution of era interim data is 79 km t255 spectral truncation dee et al 2011 the ecmwf web applications server http apps ecmwf int offers a default spatial resolution grid of 0 75 and also offers other spatial resolution grids ranging from 0 125 to 3 based on a bilinear interpolation technique for continuous parameters in this study 0 75 spatial resolution for the era interim product is used in 2017 the ecmwf released a new reanalysis data era5 herbach and dee 2016 with major improvements over era interim for example era5 provides datasets starting from 1950 era interim from 1979 to present has 0 25 spatial resolution era interim has 0 75 and hourly analysis fields era interim has 6 hourly improved variational bias scheme in addition to satellite radiances now ozone aircraft and surface pressure data are also used includes more information on variation in quality over space and time an improved representation of troposphere better global balance of precipitation and evaporation and more consistent sea surface temperature and sea ice coverage herbach and dee 2016 this study uses era5 daily accumulated reanalysis data at native spatial resolution of 0 25 3 methods 3 1 pre processing of the datasets the spatial representativeness of gauge based observations i e point and satellite and model based datasets i e grids is different in general two different methodologies are commonly used to reconcile the spatial scale differences between the products in the studies performing comparisons of such datasets either the grids of satellite and the model data that are closest to the stations are extracted point to grid methodology following el kenawy et al 2015 heidinger et al 2012 islam et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 or the station based observations within the grids of satellite model datasets are averaged so that a compatible estimate can be obtained over many locations of the world only a minority of the grids of precipitation products with 0 10 to 0 25 spatial resolution contain more than a single station hence the second methodology works similar to the first methodology for most locations for such low station density locations the average number of stations falling under each grid only increases i e this makes a considerable difference between the two methodologies when the spatial resolution of precipitation products is reduced via spatial averaging but then the fine spatial resolution information that many hydrological applications use is being lost with coarse resolution products here in this study the first methodology was adopted for all analyses i e satellite and model grids closest to the stations are extracted while additional analyses were also performed comparing both methodologies to investigate the impact of the second methodology on the results in this study the stations are grouped into four classes based on wetness dry moderately dry moderately wet and wet and percent slope 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 to evaluate the performance of products over varying wetness and complexity of topography table 1 and fig 1 here 1 km mean percent slope data source nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm obtained from https www earthenv org topography amatulli et al 2018 was extracted over point locations of individual stations and the stations were then grouped into four classes based on slope monthly precipitation values for all the stations within each class were averaged for each month separately thus forming a monthly complete time series later this complete time series was decomposed into climatology and anomaly components following below equations 1 p p m seasonality y 1 y n p p y m 2 p p y m anomaly p p y m p p m seasonality where p p y m is the precipitation estimate in mm mon for each product p year y and month m p p m seasonality is the seasonality component mean of each product for a specific month of all the years and p p y m anomaly is the remaining anomaly component here the climatology of a specific month of the year is calculated by taking the average of precipitation for that month during all the study years 4 years in our case 3 2 categorical indices for daily time scale three categorical performance indices cpi were investigated for different daily precipitation intensity thresholds the precipitation thresholds were selected based on the study of yucel et al 2011 that presented a detailed analysis on event based precipitation patterns over a mountainous region namely probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi here pod and far measure the fraction of data points which are correctly and incorrectly respectively estimated to be above a threshold value table 2 while csi is also related with the depiction of the fraction of data points correctly estimated as having values above the threshold yucel et al 2011 a perfect detection should have csi and pod values equal to 1 and a far value of 0 these categorical performance indices are calculated as 3 pod h h m 4 far f h f 5 csi h h m f where h indicates a hit i e a satellite model estimate that correctly identifies an observed precipitation above a threshold m is a miss i e satellite model shows precipitation less than a threshold while ground based observations show higher precipitation rates than that threshold and f is a false alarm i e satellite model shows precipitation greater than a threshold while ground based observations show lower precipitation rates than that threshold following yucel et al 2011 the statistics pod far and csi were computed using six thresholds 1 10 20 30 40 and 50 mm day with the only exception being the 1 mm day instead of 0 mm day to detect no precipitation zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 frequency distributions of daily precipitation intensity for wetness and slope classifications were analyzed for five different daily precipitation intensity intervals table 3 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 3 3 evaluation statistics four precipitation datasets imerg tmpa era interim and era5 were validated by selecting the station based dataset as the truth initially the daily datasets were accumulated to monthly datasets where the accuracy assessments were done using monthly datasets while frequency and categorical performance based assessments were done using daily datasets the monthly evaluation statistics included mean standard deviation sd bias error standard deviation errsd and correlation coefficient cc and calculated as below 6 cc i 1 n p p i p p p o i p o i 1 n p p i p p 2 i 1 n p o i p o 2 7 bias 1 n i 1 n p p i 1 n i 1 n p o i 8 sd 1 n i 1 n p i p 9 errsd s d i 1 n p p i p o i where n is the number of stations the subscripts o and p denote observed data and products p p i is the product precipitation estimates mm mon p o i is the observed precipitation mm mon p p is the product mean precipitation mm mon p o is the mean observed precipitation mm mon additionally monthly evaluation analyses included the analysis of how the errors and correlations vary with the station wetness and slope 3 4 additional scenario of different spatial resolutions to assess the impact of changing spatial resolution over the uncertainty of the products the original gridded products were resized to coarser resolutions up to 1 5 by using bilinear interpolation where the interpolated pixel value is computed by bilinear interpolation of the four neighboring pixels for this interpolation the resize function provided in the ebimage package of data analysis software r was used this function converts the dimension of matrices by preserving the mean during the linear transformation the resampled or resized datasets were extracted over point locations of gauge stations and were evaluated against observed data on a monthly time scale another additional analysis was performed to assess the impact on statistics if we evaluate the gridded data of the products by using the average not the individual precipitation of gauge stations contained by those specific grids 4 results and discussion 4 1 daily evaluation statistics considering the entire study area the products show an overall wet bias table 4 where tmpa and era5 have the smallest 0 1 mm day and the largest 0 5 mm day daily wet bias values respectively compared with the successor products i e imerg and era5 both the predecessor products i e tmpa and era interim show smaller overall bias on daily scale however the order of bias is reversed in case of daily errsd over the entire study area as the successors show smaller errsd compared with their predecessors table 5 among the satellite based products an improvement of 1 1 mm day in daily errsd of imerg compared with that of tmpa indicates its higher statistical accuracy and probably better suitability in hydrological applications era5 also shows a smaller daily errsd 4 0 mm day compared with that 4 2 mm day of era interim over the entire region tmpa has the largest errsd 5 9 mm day among all four products table 5 observed precipitation data shows the highest average monthly precipitation amounts to be received by the regions with slopes 15 20 while all four products show them occurring at regions with the slopes 20 table 4 this implies that the products have tendency to overestimate the observed data at the highest slopes in the region imerg tmpa and era interim have a common tendency to show wet bias over dry to moderately dry regions table 4 the wet bias over dry regions is consistent with the results of chiaravalloti et al 2018 and el kenawy et al 2015 however the sign of the bias changes i e becomes dry bias over wet regions for imerg tmpa and era interim products which is consistent with the results of de leeuw et al 2015 yang et al 2017 and yuan et al 2017 on the other hand era5 consistently overestimates the observed precipitation regardless of the wetness of the stations table 4 the absolute magnitude of the combined average bias of all four products is higher over dry and wet classes 3 mm day and 2 6 mm day respectively than over moderately dry and moderately wet classes 1 4 mm day and 0 8 mm day respectively which implies that the wetness has a considerable impact on the accuracy of the evaluated products thus highlighting the significance of implementing validation efforts over different wetness classes as a study considering only moderately dry or moderately wet stations could have yielded more optimistic conclusions magnitude of bias in era5 increases with the increasing terrain slope while the other three products show mixed results related to their bias variation w r t varying slopes table 4 although all four products show their largest wet bias values occurring over the regions with the steepest slopes i e slopes 20 the daily errsd of a given product increases with the increasing wetness table 5 while both the satellite based products show larger errsd than both the model based products which is true not only for the entire study area but also for all the four wetness classes all four products show the smallest values of their daily errsd table 6 occurring at the regions having the gentlest slopes i e slopes between 5 and 10 considering the average daily errsd for two sets of slope classes the average errsd values over the regions having slopes 15 are smaller 4 9 6 0 4 3 and 4 1 mm day for imerg tmpa era interim and era respectively than those 5 5 6 8 4 5 and 4 7 mm day for imerg tmpa era interim and era5 respectively over the regions having slopes 15 table 6 which depicts the effect of terrain slope over the accuracy of the individual products overestimation of precipitation over relatively more complex topography i e higher terrain slopes might have implications for studies using these precipitation products in flood forecasting overestimation of precipitation over complex topography may result in an increased number of false alarms for floods similarly the wet bias over dry regions may have implications in water resources management related studies particularly those related to dam operations that are located over complex topography overestimation of the precipitation might lead to more optimistic management decisions than the real observed precipitation rates particularly over drought periods under over estimation of precipitation is particularly critical for studies focusing on mass balance type retrieval of other parameters over remote locations where the ground observations are non existent e g runoff estimation over some parts of africa the presence of consistent bias in precipitation products especially in era5 might have implications for studies focusing on turbulent fluxes through land surface atmosphere interactions along with the largest errsd among all the products tmpa shows the lowest daily cc with the observed data not only over the entire study area but also over all the wetness table 7 and slope classes table 8 imerg on the other hand shows improved cc compared with tmpa over all the considered scenarios i e entire study area wetness classes and slope classes in fact the succesors imerg and era5 display higher cc values compared with their predecessors over all the scenarios both the model based products display higher daily cc compared with satellite based products over the entire study area as well as over all the wetness and slope classes both the satellite based products have their lowest daily cc values associated to the most wet regions table 7 because they show the largest daily errsd table 5 over those regions all four products associate their lowest cc values to the steepest regions table 8 the scatter plots between daily precipitation of the products and the observed daily precipitation over the entire study area i e 256 stations are stronger around the precipitation amounts of 1 3 mm day fig 2 imerg fig 2a era interim fig 2c and era5 fig 2d show moderate linear association daily cc values of 0 61 0 65 and 0 69 respectively with the observed daily data while tmpa fig 2b has weaker daily cc 0 45 association with the observed data despite having the highest daily cc with the observed data era5 shows frequent overestimation depicted by several outliers occurring at precipitation amounts around 1 3 mm day fig 2d which results in its largest wet bias 0 5 mm day among all 4 2 intensity frequency analysis over each of the wetness and slope classes both era5 and era interim model products show a smaller number of dry days i e no precipitation compared with observations figs 3 and 4 this result is consistent with the literature that era interim de leeuw et al 2015 gampe and ludwig 2017 and era5 hénin et al 2018 show too few dry days although both the model based products underestimate the frequency of observed days with extreme precipitation over almost all the wetness and slope classes figs 3 and 4 era5 shows some improvement over era interim in recording the frequency of these specific days the poor performance of era interim compared with era5 in estimating heavy precipitation events 40 mm day can be related to the coarser spatial resolution 0 75 at which cloud precipitation systems are weakly resolved and the lower number of observations assimilated into the model contrary to model based products imerg and tmpa perform relatively well in line with the observed data regarding the frequency of days with all the different precipitation intensities although there are some examples of over and under estimation while imerg slightly edges ahead in matching the frequency of observed days with most of the precipitation intensities which refers to its better capability of capturing the precipitation intensities 4 3 categorical performance indices because of the overestimation of frequency of light precipitation days mentioned earlier in this section both model based products showed higher pod and csi compared with the satellite based products for lighter precipitation intensities 0 10 mm day the same was true for all wetness and slope classes figs 5 and 6 imerg outperformed tmpa by showing better categorical performance indices cpi over all the wetness and slope classes as well as for all the precipitation intensity thresholds while era5 showed better cpi than era interim over most of the precipitation intensity thresholds figs 5 and 6 the level of categorical performance of the products over all the wetness and slope classes decreases with increasing daily precipitation intensities overall imerg and era5 performed better in cpi compared with tmpa and era interim 4 4 monthly precipitation time series variability at country scale monthly precipitation time series was investigated in more detail by plotting the climatology and anomaly components eqs 1 and 2 for individual wetness and slope classes figs 7 and 8 the time series plots for the climatology components and as a result the complete time series of imerg tmpa and era interim are higher showing wet bias than climatology components and the complete time series of the observed precipitation over dry to moderately dry classes fig 7a c whereas these three products underestimate the monthly observed precipitation over wet regions fig 7d era5 on the other hand consistently overestimates the observed precipitation regardless of the wetness of the stations and regardless of the season of a year over wet regions fig 7d where tmpa shows the largest differences from the observed climatology time series imerg better follows it thus depicting its better performance in the wet regions one of the reasons for large dry bias in era interim over wet regions fig 7d table 4 might be because of the coarse resolution 0 75 of the model that causes to diminish the resolving capacity of the cloud precipitation system the bias in era interim is also reported to be severe over africa because of the scarcity of observations to constrain the assimilation cycle and defect of the land surface parameterization scheme over the region agustí panareda et al 2010 the same might be true for our study area as the number of ground based stations sharing data with wmo is very low i e on average one station data for every 5400 km2 in fact when the number of observations assimilated into the models to update the model s initial condition is low then the accuracy of model generated estimates depends on model physics only and the accuracy of simulations might not be as accurate as the assimilation scenario era5 over compensates the dry bias shown by era interim over wet regions and appears to have a wet bias fig 7d overall the climatology of the products shows that july september are the driest months while january may are the wettest months figs 7 and 8 for all the products the differences from the observed data time series during the summers are less than those during winters perhaps because the lower average precipitation amounts tend to have lower errors the discrepancy between monthly observed time series and the products time series increases with the increasing complexity of terrain fig 8 while this can be more clearly observed in climatology time series plots for both the model based products fig 8a d the climatology time series of satellite based products closely follow the climatology of observed precipitation data during months june to august this is more obvious over dry to moderately wet regions fig 7a c and over slopes less than 20 fig 8a c however the differences between monthly climatology plots of the observed data and the products are higher during all the other seasons especially during winters similarly this discrepancy becomes more pronounced especially in the case of model based products when the terrain slope increases fig 8a d on the other hand the trends in the observed monthly anomaly time series are followed well by all the products figs 7 and 8 although discrepancies between the anomalies of the observed and product precipitation increase with increasing wetness and slope to summarize the variability of monthly and seasonal precipitation and in turn the accuracy of the products are highly affected by both wetness and slope factors 4 5 monthly evaluation statistics among all four products imerg shows the smallest errsd for the monthly complete time series and both of its components not only over the entire study area but also over all the wetness classes table 5 with an exception of the monthly climatology component where tmpa has slightly smaller errsd 13 6 mm month compared with that 13 8 mm month of imerg over dry regions for a given product the magnitude of monthly errsd increases with the increasing wetness over the entire study area and for the monthly complete and anomaly time series era5 shows slightly improved errsd values 28 8 and 23 mm month respectively compared with those 29 4 and 23 8 mm month respectively shown by its predecessor table 5 overall errsd in monthly anomaly components of the products contributes to the total errsd more than their climatology components which is valid for the entire regions as well as for the individual wetness classes compared with satellite based products there is a general trend of showing larger errsd in model based products table 5 for all four products the smallest monthly errsd values occur over the regions having terrain slopes between 5 and 10 table 6 the errsd values of the products increase with the increasing terrain slope till they reach their maxima which occur over regions having terrain slopes between 15 and 20 table 6 over the regions with slopes 20 the monthly complete time series of imerg has smaller errsd than that of tmpa while the converse is true for the regions having slopes steeper than 20 table 6 among the model based products era5 shows smaller errsd than era interim over the regions with 5 15 slopes while the converse is valid for the regions with slopes steeper than 15 considering the combined averages of monthly errsd values for the two pairs of satellite based and model based products the former products show smaller errsd than the latter products over all the slope classes table 6 imerg shows improved monthly correlations with the observed data compared with those of tmpa over the entire region 0 82 compared with 0 79 as well as over all the wetness classes table 7 the same is also true in the case of correlation between monthly anomaly time series keeping in mind that anomaly components are of great interest for many studies investigating extreme events like droughts floods model based products on the other hand show mixed results in case of correlation with observed data where era5 shows an overall higher monthly correlation 0 79 than era interim 0 77 although the converse is true over wet class table 7 considering monthly cc over the entire study area compared with model based products average cc 0 78 satellite based products average cc 0 8 show higher monthly correlation with the observed data this is especially true in the case of anomaly component table 7 similar to its performance over wetness classes imerg shows higher monthly correlations with complete time series of the observed data compared to tmpa over all the slope classes table 8 moreover the monthly anomaly time series of imerg show higher correlations with those of the observed data compared to tmpa over all the slope classes indicating the better capability of imerg for applications like drought management considering the monthly complete time series era5 shows an overall higher correlation 0 79 than era interim 0 77 over the entire study area however era interim shows a higher correlation 0 76 than era5 0 74 over slopes 15 table 8 imerg outperforms the other three products in monthly correlation with the observed data over the entire study area as well as over all the individual slope classes table 8 fig 9 shows the scattering patterns of monthly precipitation of the individual products against the observed monthly precipitation as well as a brief reflection of the statistics over monthly temporal scale the scatter plots for all four products have relatively more strength around the precipitation amounts of 25 90 mm month compared with the other three products imerg fig 9a has stronger linear association monthly cc of 0 82 with the observed data very few outliers in the scatter plot for tmpa fig 9b suggest it having small monthly bias compared with era interim fig 9c era5 fig 9d has stronger linear association with the observed data but at the same time it shows a larger wet bias than era interim which is depicted by a number of outliers occurring to the right of the 1 1 line 4 6 impact of grid spatial resolution selection precipitation products are compared with ground station based observations for their bias fig 10 and correlation coefficients fig 11 using two different methodologies 1 the values of the grids closest to the station locations are selected point to grid methodology fig 10a and 11a and 2 the station based observations falling under each grid are averaged grid to grid methodology fig 10b and 11b as we are using a rather sparse gauge network fig 1 the two methodologies using various spatial resolution scenarios between 0 1 and 1 5 have almost the same impact on the change in monthly bias fig 10a and 10b for imerg tmpa and era5 the change is mainly notable for era interim over its native resolution 0 75 as well as over its resampled resolutions 0 8 to 1 5 where averaging the observed precipitation inside the grid results in improved monthly bias fig 10b the impact of changing the grid scale resolution on the bias of the products was also investigated on a daily scale but it was proportionally similar to the monthly scale which is shown in fig 10 even though era interim showed different behaviors in monthly correlations with the observed data for point to grid methodology fig 11a and grid to grid methodology fig 11b imerg tmpa and era5 showed almost the same monthly correlations with the observed data on their native resolutions i e 0 1 0 25 and 0 25 respectively irrespective of the methodology adopted for evaluation these results show that in general the relative performance of products is not sensitive to point to grid or grid to grid methodology selection overall the use of native resolution products and point to grid methodology reflects the relative accuracy of products correctly here the sensitivity analyses related to the precipitation product and its spatial resolution show that the same product with higher spatial resolution yields higher accuracy when the point to grid comparison is made fig 11a here because a single station dataset is associated with the whole grid of the precipitation product resizing the products to the coarser grid increases the representation error of the station on the other hand fig 11b shows that the product accuracy remains mostly invariant to the change in spatial resolution when all the station datasets falling inside the product grid are averaged i e both the station and the products represent precipitation averaged over the larger smaller area hence their representation errors are not different this study originally applies the point to grid methodology of evaluation on the four products at their native resolutions i e imerg 0 1 tmpa 0 25 era interim 0 75 and era5 0 25 at the same time the authors do not recommend changing the spatial resolutions of the products from coarser to finer ones as downscaling the products to a finer spatial resolution may introduce additional uncertainty sourcing from the downscaling algorithm while the source of the total error acquired in the validation process may not be clear i e due to uncertainty of the native product or due to the downscaling algorithm however the spatial resolutions of the individual products have been converted from finer to coarser scales to investigate the impact of change in grid resolution on the accuracy of the products this is included here just to address the question of how much the accuracy of the individual products will change if the four products would have the same spatial resolution hence besides adopting the point to grid evaluation methodology on the products with their native resolutions this study also includes an accuracy assessment of the products at the same spatial resolutions 5 summary and conclusion this study evaluates satellite based gpm imerg and tmpa and model based ecmwf era interim and era5 precipitation products over a region with varying climate and complex topography using 256 ground based gauge station data for a period of four years april 2014 to march 2018 topographical complexity has been defined by percent terrain slope in this study and only the complex regions i e having slopes more than 5 are considered as the study area the evaluation is performed separately for different wetness using average monthly precipitation intervals of 0 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 mm mon and percent slope 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 classes to better characterize the sensitivity of the product uncertainties to the increasing wetness and topographical complexity i e increasing slope the temporal accuracy of imerg tmpa era interim and era5 precipitation products are measured using mean standard deviation bias error standard deviation and correlation coefficients separately for monthly complete climatology and anomaly time series evaluation of the products over a daily time scale includes intensity frequency analysis as well as the intensity cpi analysis the following conclusions are drawn on average all four products show wet bias over the entire study area imerg tmpa and era interim have dry bias over wet regions i e receiving precipitation 80 mm mon while era5 consistently overestimates the observed precipitation over all the wetness and slope classes compared with era interim era5 has a higher daily and monthly correlation with the observed data and smaller errsd however it has larger wet bias than era interim mainly because it tends to over compensate the dry bias shown by era interim over wet regions among all the products era5 shows the highest wet bias over both the daily and monthly temporal scales overall tmpa performs better than imerg in case of bias while imerg performs better than tmpa when daily and monthly errsd and correlation are considered considering deviations from the mean i e anomalies from local mean values which are important for many applications like drought management imerg shows an improvement compared with tmpa by showing lower errsd in anomalies for all four products the monthly combined average correlation is 0 79 for regions having slopes between 5 and 10 while it drops to 0 74 when the slope is above 15 these results stress that increasing topographical complexity causes reduced accuracy consistently for the products which implies that the retrieval algorithms of the products require a higher level of improvement over complex terrains than less complex terrains on a daily time scale the highest cc 0 69 with the observed data is displayed by era5 while imerg shows the highest monthly cc 0 82 among all four products compared with model based products taking an overall average satellite based products show lower bias and lower monthly error sd over all the four slope classes satellite based products consistently performed better than model based products in detecting estimating all the daily precipitation intensities especially the light precipitation while compared to era interim era5 showed the improved capability of estimating higher intensity precipitation events overall the evaluated products besides having uncertainties spread over the entire region and difficulties in performing as consistently over highly wet and complex topography regions show promising correlation and consistent trend in following the observed data over a complex topographic region based on the results obtained from this study the products have good utility and they have high potential to be considered as an alternative to gauge based precipitation observations particularly over complex topography where the installation and maintenance of gauges are more difficult compared with flat regions given the fact that satellite products reflect an overall better performance they can be merged re scaled to prepare satellite based precipitation reanalysis dataset as an alternative to model based reanalysis particularly for era interim the detailed evaluation of these precipitation products adds a valuable contribution to the existing literature not only in turkey but also in other regions of the world with varying climate and complex topography as the uncertainties from terrain induced precipitation together with convective weather systems intensify considering the variation of the accuracy statistics related to the climatology and anomaly components of these datasets further studies focusing on their bias adjustment over regions with complex topography are recommended moreover a detailed further performance evaluation that focuses on event based system signatures is suggested for ecmwf re analysis products declaration of competing

thank the general directorate of meteorology turkey for providing us the ground based observed precipitation data we also appreciate nasa and jaxa for giving open access to imerg and tmpa products and

5648,accuracy assessment of precipitation retrievals is a pre requisite for many hydrological studies as it helps to understand the source and the magnitude of the uncertainty in hydrological response variables particularly over regions with complex topography this study evaluates gpm imergv05 tmpa 3b42v7 era interim and era5 precipitation products using 256 ground based gauge stations between 2014 and 2018 over turkey known to have complex topography and varying climate error statistics categorical performance indices and intensity frequency distribution of the precipitation products are investigated over varying wetness and terrain slope classes results show that while the monthly correlation coefficient averaged over all the products is 0 79 for regions having slopes between 5 and 10 this value drops to 0 74 when the slope is above 15 imerg tmpa and era interim products underestimate the observed precipitation over relatively wetter regions while they overestimate over relatively drier regions and relatively higher slopes era5 consistently overestimates the observed precipitation over all the wetness and slope classes overall tmpa shows the smallest wet bias 0 1 mm day while era5 has the largest wet bias 0 5 mm day imerg has the highest monthly correlation i e 0 82 when averaged for all 256 stations and era interim has the lowest correlation 0 77 against the ground based observations the successors imerg and era5 show smaller errsd and higher cc compared to their predecessors tmpa and era interim at both daily and monthly time scales the results also show that the studied satellite based products perform better in matching the frequency of daily precipitation intensities whereas the studied model based products perform better in terms of categorical performance indices for lighter precipitation events keywords complex topography precipitation data evaluation satellite based precipitation products model re analysis global precipitation mission 1 introduction the accurate estimation of precipitation arguably the most significant element in the water and energy cycles kucera et al 2013 is critical in many hydrologic studies however the spatio temporal heterogeneity of precipitation makes its accurate estimation difficult herold et al 2016 hence quantification of the uncertainty of different precipitation products is essential before their use in various hydrologic and hydro climatic settings because of their spatially and temporally continuous coverage remote sensing and model based precipitation data retrieval methods are widely used as alternative sources to cope with the sparsity of ground based observations for example distributed hydrological model simulations using remote sensing and or model based precipitation estimations are particularly beneficial for many studies related to climate impact assessment hydrology and water resources over data sparse regions meng et al 2014 xue et al 2013 with the ever increasing demand for precipitation estimates several quasi global satellite based precipitation products as well as numerical model forecast and reanalysis based products have emerged recently with a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions examples of remote sensing based products include the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 and imerg the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm huffman et al 2015 while examples of the multi year global reanalysis datasets include the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim dee et al 2011 and era5 herbach and dee 2016 among others both satellite and model based precipitation products are being continuously improved over time through taking advantage of the new algorithms and or new satellite based sensors and ground based observations for example gpm encompasses the sensor package a dual frequency precipitation radar pr and a conical scanning multi channel gpm microwave imager compared with trmm instruments a single frequency pr and a multichannel trmm microwave imager thus improving its precipitation detection capability and data error statistics e g hou et al 2014 prakash et al 2016 tan and duan 2017 wang et al 2017 similarly compared with era interim era5 has a higher potential to be used in many hydrological applications owing to its higher spatial resolution 0 25 than its predecessor 0 75 and other improvements related with model physics and assimilation of observations herbach and dee 2016 studies focusing on the inter comparison of these predecessor and successor products are particularly needed to better understand the added utility if any of the successor products to date however only a limited number of studies focused on the inter comparison of era interim and era5 e g beck et al 2019 hénin et al 2018 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 hence more studies are needed that focus on inter comparison of both satellite based products imerg and tmpa and model based products era5 and era interim over a variety of topographical and climate conditions to better highlight the added utility of these products overall different factors may drive the accuracy of remote sensing and model based precipitation products over regions with complex topography local and regional topographical complexity has the potential to exert a profound impact on atmospheric lapse rate and mesoscale circulations moreover in regions having complex topography extreme events show significant temporal and spatial variations and generate extensive amounts of precipitation in short durations consequently disasters occur in a much quicker fashion over complex topography than over flat regions highlighting the significance of accurate estimation of precipitation over regions with complex topography on the other hand precipitation variability over complex topography poses additional challenges in its estimation via satellite and model based methodologies e g the view angle of the satellite changes abruptly and the orography significantly affects the performance of models hence dedicated studies investigating the relative performances of precipitation products over complex topography are imperative to provide feedback for the continuous improvement of these products as well as for hydrological studies focusing on extreme events and water management at the watershed scale several studies assessed the performance of satellite and model based products by considering either complex topography only e g derin et al 2016 derin and yilmaz 2014 gampe and ludwig 2017 hobouchian et al 2017 mei et al 2014 xu et al 2017 or both the complex and non complex i e relatively flatter topography simultaneously e g beck et al 2019 el kenawy et al 2015 mayor et al 2017 sharifi et al 2016 however most of these studies e g derin and yilmaz 2014 mei et al 2014 were completed before some of the promising precipitation datasets era5 and or imerg were released similarly many of these studies e g derin et al 2016 el kenawy et al 2015 gampe and ludwig 2017 hobouchian et al 2017 mayor et al 2017 mei et al 2014 sharifi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 selected study periods that did not include aforomentioned successor products hence the performance comparisons between tmpa vs imerg and era interim vs era5 were not implemented over complex topography additionally some of these studies e g hobouchian et al 2017 mayor et al 2017 mei et al 2014 sharifi et al 2016 xu et al 2017 evaluated precipitation products for a short limited duration and their estimated errors may not reflect long term error statistics among these studies only beck et al 2019 evaluated recently released precipitation products including imerg and era5 however error statistics over complex topography are not explicitly given as the study focused on the entire conus i e complex and non complex regions together hence studies focusing on comprehensive investigation of satellite and model based precipitation estimates in terms of predecessor successor relationship over complex topography are needed to better understand the degree of performance improvement if any of these products through time geography of turkey is characterized by complex topography and varying climate regimes owing to the high mountains stretching in its east west direction close to both the northern and the southern shores with a relatively flat high plateau in the central parts of the peninsula there exist a number of studies performed to characterize the accuracy of precipitation products over turkey e g bıyık et al 2009 demir et al 2018 derin and yilmaz 2014 toros et al 2018 yucel 2015 yucel et al 2011 yucel and onen 2014 however these studies remain limited and narrow focused i e they either used a low number of stations in validation efforts implemented the analyses over limited regions focused only on short precipitation events occurring within 1 2 days or used only one or two precipitation products hence more comprehensive studies are still needed using more datasets acquired over more stations and representing longer periods to characterize better the uncertainty of widely used recent precipitation products over this region which is known for its varying climatic and topographical conditions the objective of this study is to investigate and simultaneously inter compare the accuracy of some of the most frequently used remote sensing based tmpa and imerg and model based era5 and era interim precipitation products by focusing only on the wide spread complex topography regions of turkey with these investigations the study also adds to the efforts to better characterize the added utility of imerg and era5 products against their predecessors tmpa and era interim products over complex topography with varying climate the article is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data section 3 describes the methodology adopted for the study section 4 presents the results and discussion while the summary and conclusion are covered in section 5 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the study area is turkey which has a total of 783 500 km2 the country is situated in the mediterranean region with temperate climatic conditions but in general the diverse nature of its landscape and the presence of mountains contribute to a significant difference in the climatic conditions of its regions the coastal areas enjoy milder climates while the inland anatolian plateau experiences extremes of hot summers and cold winters with limited precipitation sensoy 2004 depending on the location the annual precipitation in aegean and mediterranean coasts ranges between 580 mm and 1300 mm the eastern coast of the black sea region receives 2200 mm annual precipitation and is the only region of the study area that receives precipitation throughout the year the amount of total precipitation on the coastal and inland stations differs significantly because of mountain blockage for example antalya station which is located at the mediterranean coast in the windward side of the taurus mountain receives three times a higher amount of annual precipitation than karaman and burdur stations which are situated in the leeward side a similar mountain blockage makes the precipitation highly variable along the northern black sea region derin and yilmaz 2014 sensoy 2004 where a coastal hopa station windward receives 2182 mm annual rainfall while an inland bayburt station leeward receives only 420 mm overall the entire country consists of undulating regions while most of the high mountainous ranges are situated in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country please refer to fig 1 a that shows the digital elevation map dem of the study area prepared from 1 km mean dem data that was obtained from https www earthenv org topography amatulli et al 2018 very long coast lines draw its borders with black sea in the north mediterranean sea in the south and aegean sea in the west most of the relatively flat and low land areas are situated in the western regions while most of the high land areas and high mountainous areas are situated in eastern regions the black sea region northeast of turkey and parts of the southeastern region have steeper slopes high percent slopes indicating mountainous areas fig 1b the term complex topography has been widely used in the literature to refer to regions with high elevation e g dinku et al 2002 hirpa et al 2010 milewski et al 2015 or standard deviation of elevation e g chiaravalloti et al 2018 among these studies no clear consensus exists over the definition of the term complex association of this term with only high elevations might be problematic as some flat topography regions may exist at very high altitudes while the precipitation characteristics may not differ considerably from other flat regions at lower elevations hence the term complex may better be associated with the terrain slope that depicts the change in elevation within a unit distance with this one can make a clear perception that the regions with very high slopes are so called mountainous regions even when they are situated at lower elevations in this study we define the term complex regions as those regions having slope values greater than 5 hence all the evaluation analyses are conducted only over regions corresponding to this definition 2 2 datasets the performance of satellite based precipitation products imerg and tmpa and model based precipitation products era interim and era5 is primarily investigated using ground based gauge station data as a reference 2 2 1 ground based gauge precipitation data ground based observation data used in this study were obtained from the general directorate of meteorology gdm of turkey the precipitation datasets obtained over the stations whose data have been shared with world meteorological organization wmo by gdm were excluded to ensure the independence of the reference dataset from the satellite and model based datasets information about these stations were obtained from gdm once this exclusion was done daily precipitation data obtained over 256 gauge stations all of them were situated in complex topography regions having 5 slope between april 2014 and march 2018 was used a reference data for further analyses 2 2 2 satellite based precipitation data gpm imerg algorithm provides three levels of products including the near real time early and late run products and the post real time final run product this study focuses on the final run product which is intended to inter calibrate merge and interpolate all the microwave estimates of the gpm constellation infrared estimates global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly gauge observations and data from other sensors e g geosynchronous infrared imagers and ir passive microwave sounders at 0 1 0 1 huffman et al 2018 please refer to huffman et al 2018 for detailed information on the imerg algorithm the product used in this study is 3imergdfv05 version 5 of the final run product with the 1 daily temporal resolution having a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 and a latency of approximately three months the tmpa 3b42 retrievals consist of two products near real time 3b42rt spatial coverage 60 n 60 s and research grade 3b42 spatial coverage 50 n 50 s the former is less accurate e g 3b42rtv7 was found to have lower nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient lower correlation coefficient and higher normalized rmse than 3b42v7 by milewski et al 2015 but provides estimates suitable for near real time monitoring and modeling activities wu et al 2012 the latter available approximately two months after the observation time is released after calibration with trmm combined instrument tci estimate and the global precipitation climatology project gpcp monthly rain gauge analysis developed by the global precipitation climatological center gpcc a detailed description of the tmpa algorithm and its contributing sensors can be found in huffman and bolvin 2018 nevertheless the resulting research grade product is more accurate and suitable for research huffman et al 2007 huffman and bolvin 2018 it showed higher hydrological efficiency tong et al 2014 and higher statistical accuracy milewski et al 2015 than its real time product this study uses daily precipitation data from version 7 of research grade daily product tmpa 3b42v7 that has 0 25o spatial resolution for brevity shorter names imerg and tmpa are used from here on instead of complete names of satellite based products gpm 3imergdfv05 and tmpa 3b42v7 respectively 2 2 3 model based reanalysis precipitation data the ecmwf era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 is produced with a sequential data assimilation scheme advancing in time using a 12 hourly analysis cycles in each cycle available observations are combined with prior information from a forecast model to estimate the evolving state of the global atmosphere and its underlying surface the analyses are then used to initialize a short range model forecast which provides the prior state estimates needed for the next analysis cycle the spatial resolution of era interim data is 79 km t255 spectral truncation dee et al 2011 the ecmwf web applications server http apps ecmwf int offers a default spatial resolution grid of 0 75 and also offers other spatial resolution grids ranging from 0 125 to 3 based on a bilinear interpolation technique for continuous parameters in this study 0 75 spatial resolution for the era interim product is used in 2017 the ecmwf released a new reanalysis data era5 herbach and dee 2016 with major improvements over era interim for example era5 provides datasets starting from 1950 era interim from 1979 to present has 0 25 spatial resolution era interim has 0 75 and hourly analysis fields era interim has 6 hourly improved variational bias scheme in addition to satellite radiances now ozone aircraft and surface pressure data are also used includes more information on variation in quality over space and time an improved representation of troposphere better global balance of precipitation and evaporation and more consistent sea surface temperature and sea ice coverage herbach and dee 2016 this study uses era5 daily accumulated reanalysis data at native spatial resolution of 0 25 3 methods 3 1 pre processing of the datasets the spatial representativeness of gauge based observations i e point and satellite and model based datasets i e grids is different in general two different methodologies are commonly used to reconcile the spatial scale differences between the products in the studies performing comparisons of such datasets either the grids of satellite and the model data that are closest to the stations are extracted point to grid methodology following el kenawy et al 2015 heidinger et al 2012 islam et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 or the station based observations within the grids of satellite model datasets are averaged so that a compatible estimate can be obtained over many locations of the world only a minority of the grids of precipitation products with 0 10 to 0 25 spatial resolution contain more than a single station hence the second methodology works similar to the first methodology for most locations for such low station density locations the average number of stations falling under each grid only increases i e this makes a considerable difference between the two methodologies when the spatial resolution of precipitation products is reduced via spatial averaging but then the fine spatial resolution information that many hydrological applications use is being lost with coarse resolution products here in this study the first methodology was adopted for all analyses i e satellite and model grids closest to the stations are extracted while additional analyses were also performed comparing both methodologies to investigate the impact of the second methodology on the results in this study the stations are grouped into four classes based on wetness dry moderately dry moderately wet and wet and percent slope 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 to evaluate the performance of products over varying wetness and complexity of topography table 1 and fig 1 here 1 km mean percent slope data source nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm obtained from https www earthenv org topography amatulli et al 2018 was extracted over point locations of individual stations and the stations were then grouped into four classes based on slope monthly precipitation values for all the stations within each class were averaged for each month separately thus forming a monthly complete time series later this complete time series was decomposed into climatology and anomaly components following below equations 1 p p m seasonality y 1 y n p p y m 2 p p y m anomaly p p y m p p m seasonality where p p y m is the precipitation estimate in mm mon for each product p year y and month m p p m seasonality is the seasonality component mean of each product for a specific month of all the years and p p y m anomaly is the remaining anomaly component here the climatology of a specific month of the year is calculated by taking the average of precipitation for that month during all the study years 4 years in our case 3 2 categorical indices for daily time scale three categorical performance indices cpi were investigated for different daily precipitation intensity thresholds the precipitation thresholds were selected based on the study of yucel et al 2011 that presented a detailed analysis on event based precipitation patterns over a mountainous region namely probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi here pod and far measure the fraction of data points which are correctly and incorrectly respectively estimated to be above a threshold value table 2 while csi is also related with the depiction of the fraction of data points correctly estimated as having values above the threshold yucel et al 2011 a perfect detection should have csi and pod values equal to 1 and a far value of 0 these categorical performance indices are calculated as 3 pod h h m 4 far f h f 5 csi h h m f where h indicates a hit i e a satellite model estimate that correctly identifies an observed precipitation above a threshold m is a miss i e satellite model shows precipitation less than a threshold while ground based observations show higher precipitation rates than that threshold and f is a false alarm i e satellite model shows precipitation greater than a threshold while ground based observations show lower precipitation rates than that threshold following yucel et al 2011 the statistics pod far and csi were computed using six thresholds 1 10 20 30 40 and 50 mm day with the only exception being the 1 mm day instead of 0 mm day to detect no precipitation zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 frequency distributions of daily precipitation intensity for wetness and slope classifications were analyzed for five different daily precipitation intensity intervals table 3 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 3 3 evaluation statistics four precipitation datasets imerg tmpa era interim and era5 were validated by selecting the station based dataset as the truth initially the daily datasets were accumulated to monthly datasets where the accuracy assessments were done using monthly datasets while frequency and categorical performance based assessments were done using daily datasets the monthly evaluation statistics included mean standard deviation sd bias error standard deviation errsd and correlation coefficient cc and calculated as below 6 cc i 1 n p p i p p p o i p o i 1 n p p i p p 2 i 1 n p o i p o 2 7 bias 1 n i 1 n p p i 1 n i 1 n p o i 8 sd 1 n i 1 n p i p 9 errsd s d i 1 n p p i p o i where n is the number of stations the subscripts o and p denote observed data and products p p i is the product precipitation estimates mm mon p o i is the observed precipitation mm mon p p is the product mean precipitation mm mon p o is the mean observed precipitation mm mon additionally monthly evaluation analyses included the analysis of how the errors and correlations vary with the station wetness and slope 3 4 additional scenario of different spatial resolutions to assess the impact of changing spatial resolution over the uncertainty of the products the original gridded products were resized to coarser resolutions up to 1 5 by using bilinear interpolation where the interpolated pixel value is computed by bilinear interpolation of the four neighboring pixels for this interpolation the resize function provided in the ebimage package of data analysis software r was used this function converts the dimension of matrices by preserving the mean during the linear transformation the resampled or resized datasets were extracted over point locations of gauge stations and were evaluated against observed data on a monthly time scale another additional analysis was performed to assess the impact on statistics if we evaluate the gridded data of the products by using the average not the individual precipitation of gauge stations contained by those specific grids 4 results and discussion 4 1 daily evaluation statistics considering the entire study area the products show an overall wet bias table 4 where tmpa and era5 have the smallest 0 1 mm day and the largest 0 5 mm day daily wet bias values respectively compared with the successor products i e imerg and era5 both the predecessor products i e tmpa and era interim show smaller overall bias on daily scale however the order of bias is reversed in case of daily errsd over the entire study area as the successors show smaller errsd compared with their predecessors table 5 among the satellite based products an improvement of 1 1 mm day in daily errsd of imerg compared with that of tmpa indicates its higher statistical accuracy and probably better suitability in hydrological applications era5 also shows a smaller daily errsd 4 0 mm day compared with that 4 2 mm day of era interim over the entire region tmpa has the largest errsd 5 9 mm day among all four products table 5 observed precipitation data shows the highest average monthly precipitation amounts to be received by the regions with slopes 15 20 while all four products show them occurring at regions with the slopes 20 table 4 this implies that the products have tendency to overestimate the observed data at the highest slopes in the region imerg tmpa and era interim have a common tendency to show wet bias over dry to moderately dry regions table 4 the wet bias over dry regions is consistent with the results of chiaravalloti et al 2018 and el kenawy et al 2015 however the sign of the bias changes i e becomes dry bias over wet regions for imerg tmpa and era interim products which is consistent with the results of de leeuw et al 2015 yang et al 2017 and yuan et al 2017 on the other hand era5 consistently overestimates the observed precipitation regardless of the wetness of the stations table 4 the absolute magnitude of the combined average bias of all four products is higher over dry and wet classes 3 mm day and 2 6 mm day respectively than over moderately dry and moderately wet classes 1 4 mm day and 0 8 mm day respectively which implies that the wetness has a considerable impact on the accuracy of the evaluated products thus highlighting the significance of implementing validation efforts over different wetness classes as a study considering only moderately dry or moderately wet stations could have yielded more optimistic conclusions magnitude of bias in era5 increases with the increasing terrain slope while the other three products show mixed results related to their bias variation w r t varying slopes table 4 although all four products show their largest wet bias values occurring over the regions with the steepest slopes i e slopes 20 the daily errsd of a given product increases with the increasing wetness table 5 while both the satellite based products show larger errsd than both the model based products which is true not only for the entire study area but also for all the four wetness classes all four products show the smallest values of their daily errsd table 6 occurring at the regions having the gentlest slopes i e slopes between 5 and 10 considering the average daily errsd for two sets of slope classes the average errsd values over the regions having slopes 15 are smaller 4 9 6 0 4 3 and 4 1 mm day for imerg tmpa era interim and era respectively than those 5 5 6 8 4 5 and 4 7 mm day for imerg tmpa era interim and era5 respectively over the regions having slopes 15 table 6 which depicts the effect of terrain slope over the accuracy of the individual products overestimation of precipitation over relatively more complex topography i e higher terrain slopes might have implications for studies using these precipitation products in flood forecasting overestimation of precipitation over complex topography may result in an increased number of false alarms for floods similarly the wet bias over dry regions may have implications in water resources management related studies particularly those related to dam operations that are located over complex topography overestimation of the precipitation might lead to more optimistic management decisions than the real observed precipitation rates particularly over drought periods under over estimation of precipitation is particularly critical for studies focusing on mass balance type retrieval of other parameters over remote locations where the ground observations are non existent e g runoff estimation over some parts of africa the presence of consistent bias in precipitation products especially in era5 might have implications for studies focusing on turbulent fluxes through land surface atmosphere interactions along with the largest errsd among all the products tmpa shows the lowest daily cc with the observed data not only over the entire study area but also over all the wetness table 7 and slope classes table 8 imerg on the other hand shows improved cc compared with tmpa over all the considered scenarios i e entire study area wetness classes and slope classes in fact the succesors imerg and era5 display higher cc values compared with their predecessors over all the scenarios both the model based products display higher daily cc compared with satellite based products over the entire study area as well as over all the wetness and slope classes both the satellite based products have their lowest daily cc values associated to the most wet regions table 7 because they show the largest daily errsd table 5 over those regions all four products associate their lowest cc values to the steepest regions table 8 the scatter plots between daily precipitation of the products and the observed daily precipitation over the entire study area i e 256 stations are stronger around the precipitation amounts of 1 3 mm day fig 2 imerg fig 2a era interim fig 2c and era5 fig 2d show moderate linear association daily cc values of 0 61 0 65 and 0 69 respectively with the observed daily data while tmpa fig 2b has weaker daily cc 0 45 association with the observed data despite having the highest daily cc with the observed data era5 shows frequent overestimation depicted by several outliers occurring at precipitation amounts around 1 3 mm day fig 2d which results in its largest wet bias 0 5 mm day among all 4 2 intensity frequency analysis over each of the wetness and slope classes both era5 and era interim model products show a smaller number of dry days i e no precipitation compared with observations figs 3 and 4 this result is consistent with the literature that era interim de leeuw et al 2015 gampe and ludwig 2017 and era5 hénin et al 2018 show too few dry days although both the model based products underestimate the frequency of observed days with extreme precipitation over almost all the wetness and slope classes figs 3 and 4 era5 shows some improvement over era interim in recording the frequency of these specific days the poor performance of era interim compared with era5 in estimating heavy precipitation events 40 mm day can be related to the coarser spatial resolution 0 75 at which cloud precipitation systems are weakly resolved and the lower number of observations assimilated into the model contrary to model based products imerg and tmpa perform relatively well in line with the observed data regarding the frequency of days with all the different precipitation intensities although there are some examples of over and under estimation while imerg slightly edges ahead in matching the frequency of observed days with most of the precipitation intensities which refers to its better capability of capturing the precipitation intensities 4 3 categorical performance indices because of the overestimation of frequency of light precipitation days mentioned earlier in this section both model based products showed higher pod and csi compared with the satellite based products for lighter precipitation intensities 0 10 mm day the same was true for all wetness and slope classes figs 5 and 6 imerg outperformed tmpa by showing better categorical performance indices cpi over all the wetness and slope classes as well as for all the precipitation intensity thresholds while era5 showed better cpi than era interim over most of the precipitation intensity thresholds figs 5 and 6 the level of categorical performance of the products over all the wetness and slope classes decreases with increasing daily precipitation intensities overall imerg and era5 performed better in cpi compared with tmpa and era interim 4 4 monthly precipitation time series variability at country scale monthly precipitation time series was investigated in more detail by plotting the climatology and anomaly components eqs 1 and 2 for individual wetness and slope classes figs 7 and 8 the time series plots for the climatology components and as a result the complete time series of imerg tmpa and era interim are higher showing wet bias than climatology components and the complete time series of the observed precipitation over dry to moderately dry classes fig 7a c whereas these three products underestimate the monthly observed precipitation over wet regions fig 7d era5 on the other hand consistently overestimates the observed precipitation regardless of the wetness of the stations and regardless of the season of a year over wet regions fig 7d where tmpa shows the largest differences from the observed climatology time series imerg better follows it thus depicting its better performance in the wet regions one of the reasons for large dry bias in era interim over wet regions fig 7d table 4 might be because of the coarse resolution 0 75 of the model that causes to diminish the resolving capacity of the cloud precipitation system the bias in era interim is also reported to be severe over africa because of the scarcity of observations to constrain the assimilation cycle and defect of the land surface parameterization scheme over the region agustí panareda et al 2010 the same might be true for our study area as the number of ground based stations sharing data with wmo is very low i e on average one station data for every 5400 km2 in fact when the number of observations assimilated into the models to update the model s initial condition is low then the accuracy of model generated estimates depends on model physics only and the accuracy of simulations might not be as accurate as the assimilation scenario era5 over compensates the dry bias shown by era interim over wet regions and appears to have a wet bias fig 7d overall the climatology of the products shows that july september are the driest months while january may are the wettest months figs 7 and 8 for all the products the differences from the observed data time series during the summers are less than those during winters perhaps because the lower average precipitation amounts tend to have lower errors the discrepancy between monthly observed time series and the products time series increases with the increasing complexity of terrain fig 8 while this can be more clearly observed in climatology time series plots for both the model based products fig 8a d the climatology time series of satellite based products closely follow the climatology of observed precipitation data during months june to august this is more obvious over dry to moderately wet regions fig 7a c and over slopes less than 20 fig 8a c however the differences between monthly climatology plots of the observed data and the products are higher during all the other seasons especially during winters similarly this discrepancy becomes more pronounced especially in the case of model based products when the terrain slope increases fig 8a d on the other hand the trends in the observed monthly anomaly time series are followed well by all the products figs 7 and 8 although discrepancies between the anomalies of the observed and product precipitation increase with increasing wetness and slope to summarize the variability of monthly and seasonal precipitation and in turn the accuracy of the products are highly affected by both wetness and slope factors 4 5 monthly evaluation statistics among all four products imerg shows the smallest errsd for the monthly complete time series and both of its components not only over the entire study area but also over all the wetness classes table 5 with an exception of the monthly climatology component where tmpa has slightly smaller errsd 13 6 mm month compared with that 13 8 mm month of imerg over dry regions for a given product the magnitude of monthly errsd increases with the increasing wetness over the entire study area and for the monthly complete and anomaly time series era5 shows slightly improved errsd values 28 8 and 23 mm month respectively compared with those 29 4 and 23 8 mm month respectively shown by its predecessor table 5 overall errsd in monthly anomaly components of the products contributes to the total errsd more than their climatology components which is valid for the entire regions as well as for the individual wetness classes compared with satellite based products there is a general trend of showing larger errsd in model based products table 5 for all four products the smallest monthly errsd values occur over the regions having terrain slopes between 5 and 10 table 6 the errsd values of the products increase with the increasing terrain slope till they reach their maxima which occur over regions having terrain slopes between 15 and 20 table 6 over the regions with slopes 20 the monthly complete time series of imerg has smaller errsd than that of tmpa while the converse is true for the regions having slopes steeper than 20 table 6 among the model based products era5 shows smaller errsd than era interim over the regions with 5 15 slopes while the converse is valid for the regions with slopes steeper than 15 considering the combined averages of monthly errsd values for the two pairs of satellite based and model based products the former products show smaller errsd than the latter products over all the slope classes table 6 imerg shows improved monthly correlations with the observed data compared with those of tmpa over the entire region 0 82 compared with 0 79 as well as over all the wetness classes table 7 the same is also true in the case of correlation between monthly anomaly time series keeping in mind that anomaly components are of great interest for many studies investigating extreme events like droughts floods model based products on the other hand show mixed results in case of correlation with observed data where era5 shows an overall higher monthly correlation 0 79 than era interim 0 77 although the converse is true over wet class table 7 considering monthly cc over the entire study area compared with model based products average cc 0 78 satellite based products average cc 0 8 show higher monthly correlation with the observed data this is especially true in the case of anomaly component table 7 similar to its performance over wetness classes imerg shows higher monthly correlations with complete time series of the observed data compared to tmpa over all the slope classes table 8 moreover the monthly anomaly time series of imerg show higher correlations with those of the observed data compared to tmpa over all the slope classes indicating the better capability of imerg for applications like drought management considering the monthly complete time series era5 shows an overall higher correlation 0 79 than era interim 0 77 over the entire study area however era interim shows a higher correlation 0 76 than era5 0 74 over slopes 15 table 8 imerg outperforms the other three products in monthly correlation with the observed data over the entire study area as well as over all the individual slope classes table 8 fig 9 shows the scattering patterns of monthly precipitation of the individual products against the observed monthly precipitation as well as a brief reflection of the statistics over monthly temporal scale the scatter plots for all four products have relatively more strength around the precipitation amounts of 25 90 mm month compared with the other three products imerg fig 9a has stronger linear association monthly cc of 0 82 with the observed data very few outliers in the scatter plot for tmpa fig 9b suggest it having small monthly bias compared with era interim fig 9c era5 fig 9d has stronger linear association with the observed data but at the same time it shows a larger wet bias than era interim which is depicted by a number of outliers occurring to the right of the 1 1 line 4 6 impact of grid spatial resolution selection precipitation products are compared with ground station based observations for their bias fig 10 and correlation coefficients fig 11 using two different methodologies 1 the values of the grids closest to the station locations are selected point to grid methodology fig 10a and 11a and 2 the station based observations falling under each grid are averaged grid to grid methodology fig 10b and 11b as we are using a rather sparse gauge network fig 1 the two methodologies using various spatial resolution scenarios between 0 1 and 1 5 have almost the same impact on the change in monthly bias fig 10a and 10b for imerg tmpa and era5 the change is mainly notable for era interim over its native resolution 0 75 as well as over its resampled resolutions 0 8 to 1 5 where averaging the observed precipitation inside the grid results in improved monthly bias fig 10b the impact of changing the grid scale resolution on the bias of the products was also investigated on a daily scale but it was proportionally similar to the monthly scale which is shown in fig 10 even though era interim showed different behaviors in monthly correlations with the observed data for point to grid methodology fig 11a and grid to grid methodology fig 11b imerg tmpa and era5 showed almost the same monthly correlations with the observed data on their native resolutions i e 0 1 0 25 and 0 25 respectively irrespective of the methodology adopted for evaluation these results show that in general the relative performance of products is not sensitive to point to grid or grid to grid methodology selection overall the use of native resolution products and point to grid methodology reflects the relative accuracy of products correctly here the sensitivity analyses related to the precipitation product and its spatial resolution show that the same product with higher spatial resolution yields higher accuracy when the point to grid comparison is made fig 11a here because a single station dataset is associated with the whole grid of the precipitation product resizing the products to the coarser grid increases the representation error of the station on the other hand fig 11b shows that the product accuracy remains mostly invariant to the change in spatial resolution when all the station datasets falling inside the product grid are averaged i e both the station and the products represent precipitation averaged over the larger smaller area hence their representation errors are not different this study originally applies the point to grid methodology of evaluation on the four products at their native resolutions i e imerg 0 1 tmpa 0 25 era interim 0 75 and era5 0 25 at the same time the authors do not recommend changing the spatial resolutions of the products from coarser to finer ones as downscaling the products to a finer spatial resolution may introduce additional uncertainty sourcing from the downscaling algorithm while the source of the total error acquired in the validation process may not be clear i e due to uncertainty of the native product or due to the downscaling algorithm however the spatial resolutions of the individual products have been converted from finer to coarser scales to investigate the impact of change in grid resolution on the accuracy of the products this is included here just to address the question of how much the accuracy of the individual products will change if the four products would have the same spatial resolution hence besides adopting the point to grid evaluation methodology on the products with their native resolutions this study also includes an accuracy assessment of the products at the same spatial resolutions 5 summary and conclusion this study evaluates satellite based gpm imerg and tmpa and model based ecmwf era interim and era5 precipitation products over a region with varying climate and complex topography using 256 ground based gauge station data for a period of four years april 2014 to march 2018 topographical complexity has been defined by percent terrain slope in this study and only the complex regions i e having slopes more than 5 are considered as the study area the evaluation is performed separately for different wetness using average monthly precipitation intervals of 0 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 mm mon and percent slope 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 classes to better characterize the sensitivity of the product uncertainties to the increasing wetness and topographical complexity i e increasing slope the temporal accuracy of imerg tmpa era interim and era5 precipitation products are measured using mean standard deviation bias error standard deviation and correlation coefficients separately for monthly complete climatology and anomaly time series evaluation of the products over a daily time scale includes intensity frequency analysis as well as the intensity cpi analysis the following conclusions are drawn on average all four products show wet bias over the entire study area imerg tmpa and era interim have dry bias over wet regions i e receiving precipitation 80 mm mon while era5 consistently overestimates the observed precipitation over all the wetness and slope classes compared with era interim era5 has a higher daily and monthly correlation with the observed data and smaller errsd however it has larger wet bias than era interim mainly because it tends to over compensate the dry bias shown by era interim over wet regions among all the products era5 shows the highest wet bias over both the daily and monthly temporal scales overall tmpa performs better than imerg in case of bias while imerg performs better than tmpa when daily and monthly errsd and correlation are considered considering deviations from the mean i e anomalies from local mean values which are important for many applications like drought management imerg shows an improvement compared with tmpa by showing lower errsd in anomalies for all four products the monthly combined average correlation is 0 79 for regions having slopes between 5 and 10 while it drops to 0 74 when the slope is above 15 these results stress that increasing topographical complexity causes reduced accuracy consistently for the products which implies that the retrieval algorithms of the products require a higher level of improvement over complex terrains than less complex terrains on a daily time scale the highest cc 0 69 with the observed data is displayed by era5 while imerg shows the highest monthly cc 0 82 among all four products compared with model based products taking an overall average satellite based products show lower bias and lower monthly error sd over all the four slope classes satellite based products consistently performed better than model based products in detecting estimating all the daily precipitation intensities especially the light precipitation while compared to era interim era5 showed the improved capability of estimating higher intensity precipitation events overall the evaluated products besides having uncertainties spread over the entire region and difficulties in performing as consistently over highly wet and complex topography regions show promising correlation and consistent trend in following the observed data over a complex topographic region based on the results obtained from this study the products have good utility and they have high potential to be considered as an alternative to gauge based precipitation observations particularly over complex topography where the installation and maintenance of gauges are more difficult compared with flat regions given the fact that satellite products reflect an overall better performance they can be merged re scaled to prepare satellite based precipitation reanalysis dataset as an alternative to model based reanalysis particularly for era interim the detailed evaluation of these precipitation products adds a valuable contribution to the existing literature not only in turkey but also in other regions of the world with varying climate and complex topography as the uncertainties from terrain induced precipitation together with convective weather systems intensify considering the variation of the accuracy statistics related to the climatology and anomaly components of these datasets further studies focusing on their bias adjustment over regions with complex topography are recommended moreover a detailed further performance evaluation that focuses on event based system signatures is suggested for ecmwf re analysis products declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we thank the general directorate of meteorology turkey for providing us the ground based observed precipitation data we also appreciate nasa and jaxa for giving open access to imerg and tmpa products and

5649,flood disasters are caused by two types of flooding pluvial and fluvial flooding the different hydrodynamic characteristics of these two types have been intensively discussed in a literature however their impact and the resulting damage have not yet been examined in a comprehensive manner due to the lack of extreme rainfall data and or computational costs of flood simulations recently an increasing number of ensemble climate simulation data has become available providing long term rainfall data based on numerical climate simulations this is a case study of a flooding in an urban area set in nagoya city japan we applied a large ensemble climate simulation database d4pdf to a pluvial and fluvial flood model and derived the flood risk curves for each type of flooding the results indicated that pluvial flooding presents comparable economic risk to fluvial flooding only 16 and 17 lesser damage at 50 and 100 year return periods respectively despite its significantly shallower flood depths area with flood depth over 45 cm was only 10 5 and 5 4 respectively the significant impact of pluvial flooding is attributable to its wider flood area despite shallower depths impacting major economic assets sprawled over the city including areas further away from the river furthermore fluvial flood risk was managed by settling the nagoya castle now the central economic district on higher altitudes the results suggest that pluvial flooding could have comparable economic risks to fluvial flooding in urban areas where major economic assets are not concentrated around streams as well as historical countermeasures are installed against fluvial flooding keywords fluvial flood pluvial flood flood risk assessment ensemble climate simulation 1 introduction flooding is one of the most hazardous natural disasters reported worldwide this is because many urban areas are situated in floodplains extreme rainfall is a major source of damage via flooding to humans and assets in two ways rainfall intensity exceeding infiltration capacity pluvial flooding and high water levels in river channels exceeding bank heights and or causing dyke breach fluvial flooding pluvial flooding is dominated by short term high rainfall intensity and drainage capacity of sewage systems as rainwater is a source of flood water flood water is generally shallow 1 0 m and may extend a fair distance away from river channels yin et al 2016 furthermore pluvial flooding generally occurs more frequently than fluvial flooding which might lead to comparative or higher economic risk moftakhari et al 2017 fluvial flooding tends to have a deeper flood depth and thus cause serious human and economic damage to date most studies on flood frequency analysis and or risk assessment target fluvial or coastal flooding falter et al 2015 guerreiro et al 2017 thieken et al 2015 ward et al 2013 and studies on pluvial flood risk assessment are scant in the literature olsen et al 2015 palla et al 2018 furthermore most studies discussed a single flood type and very few have analyzed the combined flood risk zhou et al 2012 apel et al 2016 in particular the drainage capacity during heavy rainfall should affect the extent of fluvial and combined floods which has not been taken into account in typical fluvial flood risk assessments accordingly research on the quantitative comparison of fluvial and pluvial flood risks in terms of their resultant economic damage is lacking the lack of research on the drainage system and or the analysis of combined floods in flood risk assessment is owing to a limited accessibility to sewage capacity drainage network data b the complexity involved in modeling high intensity local rainfall at a hourly scale in urban areas and c modeling daily scale accumulated rainfall over a catchment requiring long term rainfall data for model configuration rosenzweig et al 2018 to quantify flood risk caused by pluvial and fluvial flooding flood inundation models that can simulate both phenomena and a large number of distributed rainfall data are essential to generate high intensity rainfall events at different spatio temporal scales stochastic rainfall modeling of these phenomena requires long term observation apel et al 2016 breinl et al 2017 this is also the case for alternative rainfall databases such as re analysis and or global climate model gcm simulation data as their target period is generally as long as the observation on the other hand long term climate simulation data has recently become available for the whole globe to assess climate change impacts including changes in the frequencies of extreme events for instance the half a degree additional warming prognosis and projected impacts happi project has published large ensemble climate simulation data under 1 5 and 2 degree rise conditions mitchell et al 2017 the japan meteorological agency has produced a database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf which contains thousands of years of climate simulation data under the present 4 degree and 2 degree temperature rise conditions mizuta et al 2017 these datasets are now being applied to a wide range of climate change impact assessments doll et al 2018 faye et al 2018 lavender et al 2018 mori et al 2019 yang et al 2018 they are also useful for assessing the current risk of low frequency phenomena such as floods and droughts given the data is consistent with the observation data or its bias is properly corrected gcms have performed present climate simulation to show their validity however the simulation period was a similar length to the observation period which was usually a few decades large ensemble climate simulation datasets show promise as datasets for reliable flood risk assessment this study presents the demonstration of applying d4pdf under present climate scenario including 3000 year simulation data to pluvial and fluvial flood risk assessment for nagoya city japan flood risk curves for both types of flooding were derived by inputting 3000 annual max rainfall events into a 1 km distributed hydrological model 1 k dhm tanaka and tachikawa 2015 and the fluvial pluvial flood inundation models this output was input in a depth damage function our study quantifies the contribution of each flood type to risk in the study area we also discuss the different characteristics in pluvial and fluvial flooding by employing various rainfall scenarios in d4pdf datasets we expect that our findings may be generalized in terms of different magnitudes and characteristics of storm events 2 study area nagoya city is one of the largest mega cities in japan with a population of 2 3 million and gross domestic product gdp of 12 trillion japanese yen as of august 2016 population density and economic assets are highly concentrated nagoya station in particular see fig 1 inside the black circle the shonai river 1010 km2 flows through the center of the city a large fraction of the city is located under zero meter and prone to flood risk and the city experiences pluvial flooding every few years the most serious damage in this area occurred in 2000 caused by a high intensity autumnal rain front strengthened by typhoon no 14 which amounted to 850 billion japanese yen in damages including the inundation of over 60 000 houses 3 methods 3 1 simulation framework this study quantitatively compares fluvial and pluvial flood risks using a probability plot of annual flood damage derived from d4pdf rainfall data the d4pdf provides 50 ensembles of 60 year climate simulation data 3000 year data in total for the present climate at 20 km resolution across japan the annual flood damage is the damage caused by an annual maximum flood event defined as a 10 day rainfall event including the annual max 24 h basin averaged rainfall with the preceding 72 h and succeeding 144 h flood risk curves are then deroved by simply applying the weibull plotting position formula to all 3000 annual flood damage values the bias of annual maximum rainfall in d4pdf is first detected by comparison with observed rainfall and corrected radar amedas rainfall rar of the japan meteorological agency was used as the observed rainfall this is radar observed rainfall corrected with gauged rainfall data by the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas at 1 5 km spatial resolution spanning 29 years from 1988 to 2016 fluvial and pluvial floods are dominated by rainfall amounts averaged over the whole basin and target area respectively the dominant rainfall duration of fluvial flooding was designated as 24 h by the ministry of land infrastructure transportation and tourism mlit japan similarly the dominant rainfall duration of pluvial flooding was identified to be 3 h refer to appendix a to compare fluvial and pluvial flood damage characteristics two types of flooding were separated using a specific approach pluvial flood damage was simulated by switching off the 1 d river module of the model and eliminating overflow discharge in the continuity equation pluvial model pl model it was difficult to separate fluvial flooding from pluvial flooding because rainfall in the study area reduces drainage capacity and neglecting this effect implicitly assumes no rainfall in the study area downstream of the shonai river basin to address this depth damage attributable to a fluvial flood was calculated as the difference between the depth damage simulated with the flood inundation model fluvial and pluvial model flpl model and the pl model this was realized by inputting 3000 annual maximum rainfall events from d4pdf to pl and flpl models then calculating the damage from pluvial and fluvial flooding 3 2 rainfall runoff model

and should not be coarser than 100 m to ensure the reliability of the probabilistic flood maps to realize 3 000 flood simulations for all the annual maximum flood events over 3 000 years in d4pdf this study up scaled the dem to 3 s 90 m resolution the vertical resolution of the dem is 0 1 m the study area includes many small tributaries and channels not targeted in flood simulation as such their dyke height g spatial information center 2017 was embedded in the elevation data to consider the blocking of flooded water inside floodplains 4 results and discussions 4 1 bias identification and correction in d4pdf rainfall data probability plots of annual maximum 24 h basin averaged rainfall and 3 h study area averaged rainfall from d4pdf and rar are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the weibull formula was applied to each plot the d4pdf rainfall is consistent with rar for the former plot and largely underestimates rar for the latter this is attributed to insufficient representation of short term and local rainfall intensity rar of the tokai heavy rainfall the triangles in fig 2 is far from d4pdf but also from other years in rar thus 24 h rainfall of the tokai heavy rainfall appears to be an outlier this is not the case for the 3 h rainfall indicating that this event is characterized by strong rainfall intensities over long durations as the number of samples is largely different between d4pdf 3 000 years and rar 29 years the bias of larger return periods than 29 years cannot be calculated to give reasonable bias correction d4pdf was split into original 50 ensembles of 60 year data probability plots of each ensemble in d4pdf and rar using the weibull formula is shown in fig 3 a the ratio between rar and the ensemble median of d4pdf with the same quantile was multiplied to each member of d4pdf this process was repeated for each quantile the bias ratio of the top two quantiles among 60 year data in d4pdf with a return period 29 years was substituted by the one of the third quantiles the bias corrected 3 h study area averaged rainfall for each ensemble and all associated data is shown in fig 3 b and c respectively the rainfall intensities over the study area during the maximum 3 h rainfall were modified by multiplying the obtained bias ratio in each rainfall event of d4pdf 4 2 validation of the fluvial pluvial flood model the validation of the fluvial and pluvial flood models is described in this section since there was no large scale river overflow in the study area the 1 d river flow model component was validated against river water stage for the most severe fluvial flooding without overflow by typhoon no 15 in 2011 changing the manning s roughness coefficient among 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 m 1 3 s the simulated and observed water level at the biwajima station see fig 1 is shown in fig 4 river flow modeling in the flood model showed good agreement with the observed data when the manning s coefficient was between 0 04 m 1 3s to 0 05 m 1 3 s nse for the manning s coefficient of 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 m 1 3 s was 0 69 0 82 0 94 and 0 90 respectively this study applied 0 04 m 1 3 s for the 1 d river flow model resulting in the highest nse given the roughness in floodplains is larger than that of a river channel manning s roughness coefficient in floodplains was set to 0 05 m 1 3 s a pluvial component was validated using the inundation area and damage during the tokai heavy rainfall in 2000 caused by an autumn rain front with typhoon no 14 the rainfall data for validating past flood events refer to rar the simulated maximum flood depth and that reported by ministry of land 2000 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively although the evaluation index was not calculated because the digital data of reported flood area was unavailable the location of flooded regions the river mouth its eastern area and the north and south of the middle reach and their area are generally consistent between the report and simulation a quantitative comparison was made with a report by the ministry of construction 2000 for the affected number of houses office workers and the resultant flood damage the number of flooded houses and office workers was estimated by counting those located on flooded cells flood damage to building households and office assets were calculated by estimating the damage ratio and the total assets at an inundation simulation cell level 90 m a relationship between the maximum flood depth and damage ratio had been estimated for each property by ministry of land 2005 the total number of assets including buildings households and office stocks was estimated from the total floor area the number of households and workers with their unit appraised value respectively the reported and estimated flood damage were compared in table 1 simulated flood damage for buildings is larger than the reported value because the report includes only residential buildings whilst the simulated results also include commercial buildings overall the simulated flood damage had good consistency with the observed data 4 3 flood area prior to the assessment of flood risk curves flood extent at various return periods were examined to see different characteristics of inundation situations fig 6 shows flood area plots above as circles and below as triangles 45 cm 1st floor height for both types of flooding fluvial flooding fig 6 black coloring showed similar flood extent for both types of depths pluvial flooding resulted in shallow flood depth lower than the 1st floor over wider area with a small area flooded above the 1st floor figs 7 and 8 show maximum flood depth over the study area for fluvial and pluvial flooding at different return periods of flood area ranging from a 10 years b 50 years c 100 years and d 3000 years fluvial flooding occurs near the nagoya bay at the shortest return period where river dyke height is relatively lower followed by overflow at upstream river reaches the flood area is expansive and flood depth is deeper when the return period is greater than 100 years the shonai river has a long narrow basin in the north east direction and thus no large floodplain along the upper and middle streams as such this study did not consider any overflow in these sections leading to rapidly increasing flood area with return periods the study site located at the outlet of the shonai river basin is a low lying area thus the expanse of fluvial flooding is limited to the area around the shonai river channel conversely with pluvial flooding flood expanse is relatively uniform across the study area including the fluvial flood area as return periods become longer this is consistent with apel et al 2016 flood depths were much lower than fluvial flooding where the area with a flood depth over 45 cm was only 10 5 and 5 4 at 50 and 100 year return periods respectively although the equivalent infiltration capacity to actual drainage capacity differs in each district and defines the maximum infiltration capacity in eq 7 it did not contribute to the distribution of pluvial flood extent this is because the values do not contrast each other ranging within 18 to 30 mm hr in more than 90 of 2 d simulation cells as such areas with deeper over 1st floor pluvial flood depths were identified using elevation not spatial variation of drainage capacity 4 4 flood damage the simulated flood damage for fluvial and pluvial flooding was plotted with the weibull formula in fig 9 a flood damage was calculated from maximum flood depth through a depth damage function used in model configuration and validation most quantiles show higher damage by fluvial flooding than pluvial however the difference is marginal below 99 100 year return period for example flood damage from pluvial flooding corresponding to 50 and 100 year return periods are only 16 and 17 smaller respectively despite much smaller flood depths comparing the plots for damage above and below 45 cm see fig 9 b and c it is clear that damages above and below the 1st floor are dominated by fluvial and pluvial floods respectively fig 9 illustrates that this is because the flood area below the 1st floor caused by pluvial flooding is far larger than that of fluvial flooding negative damage values in fig 9 c for the flood area below 1st floor occurred because the fluvial flood damage was calculated as the difference between damage in the flpl and pl and a part of the flood area below the 1st floor in the pl model was flooded above the 1st floor in the flpl model in the study area economic assets are not based along river channels but spread around the central economic district see fig 1 therefore pluvial flooding causing shallow but wide flood extent resulted in a comparable flood risk to fluvial flooding with the exception of the 1st to 3rd most severe events corresponding to over 1 000 return periods the study area is a typical coastal city at the outlet of the shonai river and thus the elevation is low and flat exposing large parts of the city to both types of flooding as well as coastal flooding this is similar to many other deltas around the world wong et al 2014 while the central economic zone is characterized with higher elevation its impact on the total flood damage is marginal around 3 5 as shown in fig 10 as such although flood risk is also influenced by the flood control facilities installed this study has found that flood risk between pluvial and fluvial flooding is comparable this finding could be applied to other urban low lying areas with large human and economic resources located around a waterway previous studies have also found that pluvial flooding has a major impact on properties and or road networks douglas et al 2010 yin et al 2016 zhou et al 2012 the difference between the two types of floods has been also discussed with a focus on flood drivers in different places pluvial flooding is dominant in areas that are not on the river overflow path whereas areas on the overflow path at lower elevations are more strongly affected by fluvial flooding chen et al 2010 on the other hand there is little literature on the different flood characteristics relating to the resultant flood damage at various return periods the economic flood damage associated with each type of flooding has only recently been analyzed falter et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 this study provides a systematic investigation of the quantitative impact of pluvial flooding compared with fluvial flooding using a vast number of ensemble climate simulations that avoid uncertainty in extrapolating extreme rainfall frequencies with parametric probability distributions 4 5 analysis of historical and local flood damage these flood damage plots also provide insight as to the estimated return period of the tokai heavy rainfall using the resulting damage the simulated flood damage of the event was 1 166 billion japanese yen primarily from pluvial flooding this corresponds to a return period of 77 years in fig 9 a this is the same order in the bias corrected d4pdf as the return period of 29 years for 3 h rainfall possibly smaller as local fluvial flooding also occurred and much smaller than 574 years for 24 h rainfall this demonstrates that 3 h rainfall best represents pluvial flood damage see fig a1 a these analyses indicate that devastating damage in the tokai heavy rainfall in 2000 may potentially occurs once every 100 years on average figs 7 and 8 present the local characteristics in each type of flooding fluvial flood water expanded around river channels but did not propagate over small channel dykes besides the central economic district whilst pluvial flooding also caused shallow inundation in these areas the probability plots of damage to mesh with assets over 5 billion japanese yen is shown in fig 10 the damage from pluvial flooding is more severe than fluvial flooding fig 7 shows that the central economic district is blocked by dykes of local channels and is located on higher elevation typically historical areas are well protected against fluvial flooding this study s findings demonstrate that the central economic district in nagoya city although well protected against fluvial flooding is susceptible to pluvial flooding this local characteristic partly affected the comparability of flood risk between pluvial and fluvial flooding as shown in fig 9 however the overall impact on risks over the entire study area is limited as the economic assets in the central economic district the scale of fig 10 is very small compared with the total assets in the study area that of fig 9 5 conclusions pluvial and fluvial floods are different types of phenomena causing serious damage to urban areas in different ways few studies have quantified and compared these flood types due to the challenges of modeling short term and long term rainfall using stochastic models this study conducted pluvial and fluvial flood risk assessment using a large ensemble climate simulation dataset in nagoya city japan the key findings from this study were 1 pluvial and fluvial flood risks were successfully compared using large ensemble climate simulation data this study was able to explicitly consider different drainage capacities during fluvial floods with heavy rainfall by defining fluvial flood damage as different between combined flood damage and pluvial flood damage 2 as economic assets in the city were not only spread along river channels but also situated further away from the river in the study area pluvial flooding had a similar level of flood risk with fluvial flood as the flood extent was shallow but wide there was an exception for the three most severe events 1 000 year return periods 3 fluvial flood risk is largely influenced by historical dyke development while pluvial flood risk exists even in areas protected against fluvial flood risk in the nagoya city as such flood risk within the central economic district was much higher from pluvial flooding compared with fluvial flooding this study suggests that within the context of urban mega cities pluvial flooding should be assumed to have a comparable level of economic risk as fluvial flooding note that the outcomes such as the balance between fluvial and pluvial flood risk and the characteristics of flood risk in the central economic district are specific to the study area and might be the case in some other urban areas while the methodology implemented in this study can be applied to elsewhere this study also demonstrated the impact of pluvial flooding on property damage in compared with fluvial flooding however these findings are subject to uncertainties owing to the rainfall data of d4pdf and the flood inundation model used these uncertainties stem from spatial resolution blanc et al 2012 and assumptions in the drainage network the regional climate simulation in d4pdf was performed at 20 km resolution covering nagoya city with 4 grids the bias in area averaged 3 h rainfall was corrected with the observed radar based rainfall at 1 km resolution however coarse resolution in d4pdf might lead to smaller spatial variability in local rainfall intensity and contribute to relatively uniform pluvial flood depths the flood inundation model employed in this study has uncertainty in spatial resolution and model structure to complete 3000 pluvial and fluvial flood simulations elevation data was up scaled from 10 m to 90 m omitting local topographical variations horritt and bates 2001 in terms of the modeled drainage network rainwater in sewage pipes was assumed to go back to a river channel and thus overflow from manholes was not considered these issues will be addressed in future research d4pdf is capable of helping understand changes in the frequency of low return interval severe flood damage under 2 and 4 degree temperature rise scenarios by comparing probability plots with the present climate future research will demonstrate the application of this framework to different climate scenarios to inform the potential change signals of extreme floods based on the impact

flooding any governmental document or academic literature has not shown dominant rainfall duration against pluvial flooding in the nagoya city area this study identified it by simulating pluvial flood damage with the pluvial flood model pl model constructed in this study from d4pdf rainfall data without bias correction given rainfall data in d4pdf before bias correction is still applicable for testing the sensitivity of rainfall duration on pluvial flood damage thanks to a large number of ensembles flood damage calculation also follows the fragility functions provided by mlit 2005 the relationship between the simulated flood damage and 3 6 and 24 h study area averaged rainfall in 3 000 events with annual maximum 24 h basin averaged rainfall is plotted in fig a1 a b and c it is clear that rainfall over a shorter duration shows higher correlation with damage spearman s rank correlation coefficients for 3 6 and 24 h durations are 0 976 0 960 and 0 736 therefore the target duration for the bias correction of d4pdf rainfall data was set as 3 h in this study 
5649,flood disasters are caused by two types of flooding pluvial and fluvial flooding the different hydrodynamic characteristics of these two types have been intensively discussed in a literature however their impact and the resulting damage have not yet been examined in a comprehensive manner due to the lack of extreme rainfall data and or computational costs of flood simulations recently an increasing number of ensemble climate simulation data has become available providing long term rainfall data based on numerical climate simulations this is a case study of a flooding in an urban area set in nagoya city japan we applied a large ensemble climate simulation database d4pdf to a pluvial and fluvial flood model and derived the flood risk curves for each type of flooding the results indicated that pluvial flooding presents comparable economic risk to fluvial flooding only 16 and 17 lesser damage at 50 and 100 year return periods respectively despite its significantly shallower flood depths area with flood depth over 45 cm was only 10 5 and 5 4 respectively the significant impact of pluvial flooding is attributable to its wider flood area despite shallower depths impacting major economic assets sprawled over the city including areas further away from the river furthermore fluvial flood risk was managed by settling the nagoya castle now the central economic district on higher altitudes the results suggest that pluvial flooding could have comparable economic risks to fluvial flooding in urban areas where major economic assets are not concentrated around streams as well as historical countermeasures are installed against fluvial flooding keywords fluvial flood pluvial flood flood risk assessment ensemble climate simulation 1 introduction flooding is one of the most hazardous natural disasters reported worldwide this is because many urban areas are situated in floodplains extreme rainfall is a major source of damage via flooding to humans and assets in two ways rainfall intensity exceeding infiltration capacity pluvial flooding and high water levels in river channels exceeding bank heights and or causing dyke breach fluvial flooding pluvial flooding is dominated by short term high rainfall intensity and drainage capacity of sewage systems as rainwater is a source of flood water flood water is generally shallow 1 0 m and may extend a fair distance away from river channels yin et al 2016 furthermore pluvial flooding generally occurs more frequently than fluvial flooding which might lead to comparative or higher economic risk moftakhari et al 2017 fluvial flooding tends to have a deeper flood depth and thus cause serious human and economic damage to date most studies on flood frequency analysis and or risk assessment target fluvial or coastal flooding falter et al 2015 guerreiro et al 2017 thieken et al 2015 ward et al 2013 and studies on pluvial flood risk assessment are scant in the literature olsen et al 2015 palla et al 2018 furthermore most studies discussed a single flood type and very few have analyzed the combined flood risk zhou et al 2012 apel et al 2016 in particular the drainage capacity during heavy rainfall should affect the extent of fluvial and combined floods which has not been taken into account in typical fluvial flood risk assessments accordingly research on the quantitative comparison of fluvial and pluvial flood risks in terms of their resultant economic damage is lacking the lack of research on the drainage system and or the analysis of combined floods in flood risk assessment is owing to a limited accessibility to sewage capacity drainage network data b the complexity involved in modeling high intensity local rainfall at a hourly scale in urban areas and c modeling daily scale accumulated rainfall over a catchment requiring long term rainfall data for model configuration rosenzweig et al 2018 to quantify flood risk caused by pluvial and fluvial flooding flood inundation models that can simulate both phenomena and a large number of distributed rainfall data are essential to generate high intensity rainfall events at different spatio temporal scales stochastic rainfall modeling of these phenomena requires long term observation apel et al 2016 breinl et al 2017 this is also the case for alternative rainfall databases such as re analysis and or global climate model gcm simulation data as their target period is generally as long as the observation on the other hand long term climate simulation data has recently become available for the whole globe to assess climate change impacts including changes in the frequencies of extreme events for instance the half a degree additional warming prognosis and projected impacts happi project has published large ensemble climate simulation data under 1 5 and 2 degree rise conditions mitchell et al 2017 the japan meteorological agency has produced a database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf which contains thousands of years of climate simulation data under the present 4 degree and 2 degree temperature rise conditions mizuta et al 2017 these datasets are now being applied to a wide range of climate change impact assessments doll et al 2018 faye et al 2018 lavender et al 2018 mori et al 2019 yang et al 2018 they are also useful for assessing the current risk of low frequency phenomena such as floods and droughts given the data is consistent with the observation data or its bias is properly corrected gcms have performed present climate simulation to show their validity however the simulation period was a similar length to the observation period which was usually a few decades large ensemble climate simulation datasets show promise as datasets for reliable flood risk assessment this study presents the demonstration of applying d4pdf under present climate scenario including 3000 year simulation data to pluvial and fluvial flood risk assessment for nagoya city japan flood risk curves for both types of flooding were derived by inputting 3000 annual max rainfall events into a 1 km distributed hydrological model 1 k dhm tanaka and tachikawa 2015 and the fluvial pluvial flood inundation models this output was input in a depth damage function our study quantifies the contribution of each flood type to risk in the study area we also discuss the different characteristics in pluvial and fluvial flooding by employing various rainfall scenarios in d4pdf datasets we expect that our findings may be generalized in terms of different magnitudes and characteristics of storm events 2 study area nagoya city is one of the largest mega cities in japan with a population of 2 3 million and gross domestic product gdp of 12 trillion japanese yen as of august 2016 population density and economic assets are highly concentrated nagoya station in particular see fig 1 inside the black circle the shonai river 1010 km2 flows through the center of the city a large fraction of the city is located under zero meter and prone to flood risk and the city experiences pluvial flooding every few years the most serious damage in this area occurred in 2000 caused by a high intensity autumnal rain front strengthened by typhoon no 14 which amounted to 850 billion japanese yen in damages including the inundation of over 60 000 houses 3 methods 3 1 simulation framework this study quantitatively compares fluvial and pluvial flood risks using a probability plot of annual flood damage derived from d4pdf rainfall data the d4pdf provides 50 ensembles of 60 year climate simulation data 3000 year data in total for the present climate at 20 km resolution across japan the annual flood damage is the damage caused by an annual maximum flood event defined as a 10 day rainfall event including the annual max 24 h basin averaged rainfall with the preceding 72 h and succeeding 144 h flood risk curves are then deroved by simply applying the weibull plotting position formula to all 3000 annual flood damage values the bias of annual maximum rainfall in d4pdf is first detected by comparison with observed rainfall and corrected radar amedas rainfall rar of the japan meteorological agency was used as the observed rainfall this is radar observed rainfall corrected with gauged rainfall data by the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas at 1 5 km spatial resolution spanning 29 years from 1988 to 2016 fluvial and pluvial floods are dominated by rainfall amounts averaged over the whole basin and target area respectively the dominant rainfall duration of fluvial flooding was designated as 24 h by the ministry of land infrastructure transportation and tourism mlit japan similarly the dominant rainfall duration of pluvial flooding was identified to be 3 h refer to appendix a to compare fluvial and pluvial flood damage characteristics two types of flooding were separated using a specific approach pluvial flood damage was simulated by switching off the 1 d river module of the model and eliminating overflow discharge in the continuity equation pluvial model pl model it was difficult to separate fluvial flooding from pluvial flooding because rainfall in the study area reduces drainage capacity and neglecting this effect implicitly assumes no rainfall in the study area downstream of the shonai river basin to address this depth damage attributable to a fluvial flood was calculated as the difference between the depth damage simulated with the flood inundation model fluvial and pluvial model flpl model and the pl model this was realized by inputting 3000 annual maximum rainfall events from d4pdf to pl and flpl models then calculating the damage from pluvial and fluvial flooding 3 2 rainfall runoff model rainfall runoff characteristics in the study area are influenced by steep mountainous slopes with humid soil layers and well represented by a kinematic wave based rainfall runoff model tanaka and tachikawa 2015 this study applies a kinematic wave based distributed rainfall runoff model 1k dhm ver 2 tachikawa and tanaka 2013 each cell is composed of slope and river channel components slope runoff is modeled with a kinematic wave flow approximation that considers surface subsurface flow through surface soil layers tanaka and tachikawa 2015 the model consists of the following mass balance

river flow and 2 d overflow model i1 d river flow and 2 d overflow model inundation model coupled with rainfall runoff model imcr tanaka et al 2015 upstream river discharge and lateral inflow are provided from 1k dhm ver 2 through an automatic connection system refer to tanaka et al 2015 for details this limits the simulation domain to the floodplain areas the imcr consists of river and

infiltration intensity defined as drainage capacity per unit area water that had drained into sewage pipes was integrated over 30 s 1 km mesh to be the same resolution as 1 k dhm and routed with the 1 d kinematic wave equation along the flow direction of 1 k dhm until it arrived at a river cell the drainage capacity of each district was provided by the nagoya city waterworks and sewage bureau elevation data is provided at 10 m spatial resolution by the geospatial information authority of japan 2019 according to savage et al 2016 the performance deteriorates at resolutions coarser than 50 m and should not be coarser than 100 m to ensure the reliability of the probabilistic flood maps to realize 3 000 flood simulations for all the annual maximum flood events over 3 000 years in d4pdf this study up scaled the dem to 3 s 90 m resolution the vertical resolution of the dem is 0 1 m the study area includes many small tributaries and channels not targeted in flood simulation as such their dyke height g spatial information center 2017 was embedded in the elevation data to consider the blocking of flooded water inside floodplains 4 results and discussions 4 1 bias identification and correction in d4pdf rainfall data probability plots of annual maximum 24 h basin averaged rainfall and 3 h study area averaged rainfall from d4pdf and rar are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively the weibull formula was applied to each plot the d4pdf rainfall is consistent with rar for the former plot and largely underestimates rar for the latter this is attributed to insufficient representation of short term and local rainfall intensity rar of the tokai heavy rainfall the triangles in fig 2 is far from d4pdf but also from other years in rar thus 24 h rainfall of the tokai heavy rainfall appears to be an outlier this is not the case for the 3 h rainfall indicating that this event is characterized by strong rainfall intensities over long durations as the number of samples is largely different between d4pdf 3 000 years and rar 29 years the bias of larger return periods than 29 years cannot be calculated to give reasonable bias correction d4pdf was split into original 50 ensembles of 60 year data probability plots of each ensemble in d4pdf and rar using the weibull formula is shown in fig 3 a the ratio between rar and the ensemble median of d4pdf with the same quantile was multiplied to each member of d4pdf this process was repeated for each quantile the bias ratio of the top two quantiles among 60 year data in d4pdf with a return period 29 years was substituted by the one of the third quantiles the bias corrected 3 h study area averaged rainfall for each ensemble and all associated data is shown in fig 3 b and c respectively the rainfall intensities over the study area during the maximum 3 h rainfall were modified by multiplying the obtained bias ratio in each rainfall event of d4pdf 4 2 validation of the fluvial pluvial flood model the validation of the fluvial and pluvial flood models is described in this section since there was no large scale river overflow in the study area the 1 d river flow model component was validated against river water stage for the most severe fluvial flooding without overflow by typhoon no 15 in 2011 changing the manning s roughness coefficient among 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 m 1 3 s the simulated and observed water level at the biwajima station see fig 1 is shown in fig 4 river flow modeling in the flood model showed good agreement with the observed data when the manning s coefficient was between 0 04 m 1 3s to 0 05 m 1 3 s nse for the manning s coefficient of 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 m 1 3 s was 0 69 0 82 0 94 and 0 90 respectively this study applied 0 04 m 1 3 s for the 1 d river flow model resulting in the highest nse given the roughness in floodplains is larger than that of a river channel manning s roughness coefficient in floodplains was set to 0 05 m 1 3 s a pluvial component was validated using the inundation area and damage during the tokai heavy rainfall in 2000 caused by an autumn rain front with typhoon no 14 the rainfall data for validating past flood events refer to rar the simulated maximum flood depth and that reported by ministry of land 2000 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively although the evaluation index was not calculated because the digital data of reported flood area was unavailable the location of flooded regions the river mouth its eastern area and the north and south of the middle reach and their area are generally consistent between the report and simulation a quantitative comparison was made with a report by the ministry of construction 2000 for the affected number of houses office workers and the resultant flood damage the number of flooded houses and office workers was estimated by counting those located on flooded cells flood damage to building households and office assets were calculated by estimating the damage ratio and the total assets at an inundation simulation cell level 90 m a relationship between the maximum flood depth and damage ratio had been estimated for each property by ministry of land 2005 the total number of assets including buildings households and office stocks was estimated from the total floor area the number of households and workers with their unit appraised value respectively the reported and estimated flood damage were compared in table 1 simulated flood damage for buildings is larger than the reported value because the report includes only residential buildings whilst the simulated results also include commercial buildings overall the simulated flood damage had good consistency with the observed data 4 3 flood area prior to the assessment of flood risk curves flood extent at various return periods were examined to see different characteristics of inundation situations fig 6 shows flood area plots above as circles and below as triangles 45 cm 1st floor height for both types of flooding fluvial flooding fig 6 black coloring showed similar flood extent for both types of depths pluvial flooding resulted in shallow flood depth lower than the 1st floor over wider area with a small area flooded above the 1st floor figs 7 and 8 show maximum flood depth over the study area for fluvial and pluvial flooding at different return periods of flood area ranging from a 10 years b 50 years c 100 years and d 3000 years fluvial flooding occurs near the nagoya bay at the shortest return period where river dyke height is relatively lower followed by overflow at upstream river reaches the flood area is expansive and flood depth is deeper when the return period is greater than 100 years the shonai river has a long narrow basin in the north east direction and thus no large floodplain along the upper and middle streams as such this study did not consider any overflow in these sections leading to rapidly increasing flood area with return periods the study site located at the outlet of the shonai river basin is a low lying area thus the expanse of fluvial flooding is limited to the area around the shonai river channel conversely with pluvial flooding flood expanse is relatively uniform across the study area including the fluvial flood area as return periods become longer this is consistent with apel et al 2016 flood depths were much lower than fluvial flooding where the area with a flood depth over 45 cm was only 10 5 and 5 4 at 50 and 100 year return periods respectively although the equivalent infiltration capacity to actual drainage capacity differs in each district and defines the maximum infiltration capacity in eq 7 it did not contribute to the distribution of pluvial flood extent this is because the values do not contrast each other ranging within 18 to 30 mm hr in more than 90 of 2 d simulation cells as such areas with deeper over 1st floor pluvial flood depths were identified using elevation not spatial variation of drainage capacity 4 4 flood damage the simulated flood damage for fluvial and pluvial flooding was plotted with the weibull formula in fig 9 a flood damage was calculated from maximum flood depth through a depth damage function used in model configuration and validation most quantiles show higher damage by fluvial flooding than pluvial however the difference is marginal below 99 100 year return period for example flood damage from pluvial flooding corresponding to 50 and 100 year return periods are only 16 and 17 smaller respectively despite much smaller flood depths comparing the plots for damage above and below 45 cm see fig 9 b and c it is clear that damages above and below the 1st floor are dominated by fluvial and pluvial floods respectively fig 9 illustrates that this is because the flood area below the 1st floor caused by pluvial flooding is far larger than that of fluvial flooding negative damage values in fig 9 c for the flood area below 1st floor occurred because the fluvial flood damage was calculated as the difference between damage in the flpl and pl and a part of the flood area below the 1st floor in the pl model was flooded above the 1st floor in the flpl model in the study area economic assets are not based along river channels but spread around the central economic district see fig 1 therefore pluvial flooding causing shallow but wide flood extent resulted in a comparable flood risk to fluvial flooding with the exception of the 1st to 3rd most severe events corresponding to over 1 000 return periods the study area is a typical coastal city at the outlet of the shonai river and thus the elevation is low and flat exposing large parts of the city to both types of flooding as well as coastal flooding this is similar to many other deltas around the world wong et al 2014 while the central economic zone is characterized with higher elevation its impact on the total flood damage is marginal around 3 5 as shown in fig 10 as such although flood risk is also influenced by the flood control facilities installed this study has found that flood risk between pluvial and fluvial flooding is comparable this finding could be applied to other urban low lying areas with large human and economic resources located around a waterway previous studies have also found that pluvial flooding has a major impact on properties and or road networks douglas et al 2010 yin et al 2016 zhou et al 2012 the difference between the two types of floods has been also discussed with a focus on flood drivers in different places pluvial flooding is dominant in areas that are not on the river overflow path whereas areas on the overflow path at lower elevations are more strongly affected by fluvial flooding chen et al 2010 on the other hand there is little literature on the different flood characteristics relating to the resultant flood damage at various return periods the economic flood damage associated with each type of flooding has only recently been analyzed falter et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 this study provides a systematic investigation of the quantitative impact of pluvial flooding compared with fluvial flooding using a vast number of ensemble climate simulations that avoid uncertainty in extrapolating extreme rainfall frequencies with parametric probability distributions 4 5 analysis of historical and local flood damage these flood damage plots also provide insight as to the estimated return period of the tokai heavy rainfall using the resulting damage the simulated flood damage of the event was 1 166 billion japanese yen primarily from pluvial flooding this corresponds to a return period of 77 years in fig 9 a this is the same order in the bias corrected d4pdf as the return period of 29 years for 3 h rainfall possibly smaller as local fluvial flooding also occurred and much smaller than 574 years for 24 h rainfall this demonstrates that 3 h rainfall best represents pluvial flood damage see fig a1 a these analyses indicate that devastating damage in the tokai heavy rainfall in 2000 may potentially occurs once every 100 years on average figs 7 and 8 present the local characteristics in each type of flooding fluvial flood water expanded around river channels but did not propagate over small channel dykes besides the central economic district whilst pluvial flooding also caused shallow inundation in these areas the probability plots of damage to mesh with assets over 5 billion japanese yen is shown in fig 10 the damage from pluvial flooding is more severe than fluvial flooding fig 7 shows that the central economic district is blocked by dykes of local channels and is located on higher elevation typically historical areas are well protected against fluvial flooding this study s findings demonstrate that the central economic district in nagoya city although well protected against fluvial flooding is susceptible to pluvial flooding this local characteristic partly affected the comparability of flood risk between pluvial and fluvial flooding as shown in fig 9 however the overall impact on risks over the entire study area is limited as the economic assets in the central economic district the scale of fig 10 is very small compared with the total assets in the study area that of fig 9 5 conclusions pluvial and fluvial floods are different types of phenomena causing serious damage to urban areas in different ways few studies have quantified and compared these flood types due to the challenges of modeling short term and long term rainfall using stochastic models this study conducted pluvial and fluvial flood risk assessment using a large ensemble climate simulation dataset in nagoya city japan the key findings from this study were 1 pluvial and fluvial flood risks were successfully compared using large ensemble climate simulation data this study was able to explicitly consider different drainage capacities during fluvial floods with heavy rainfall by defining fluvial flood damage as different between combined flood damage and pluvial flood damage 2 as economic assets in the city were not only spread along river channels but also situated further away from the river in the study area pluvial flooding had a similar level of flood risk with fluvial flood as the flood extent was shallow but wide there was an exception for the three most severe events 1 000 year return periods 3 fluvial flood risk is largely influenced by historical dyke development while pluvial flood risk exists even in areas protected against fluvial flood risk in the nagoya city as such flood risk within the central economic district was much higher from pluvial flooding compared with fluvial flooding this study suggests that within the context of urban mega cities pluvial flooding should be assumed to have a comparable level of economic risk as fluvial flooding note that the outcomes such as the balance between fluvial and pluvial flood risk and the characteristics of flood risk in the central economic district are specific to the study area and might be the case in some other urban areas while the methodology implemented in this study can be applied to elsewhere this study also demonstrated the impact of pluvial flooding on property damage in compared with fluvial flooding however these findings are subject to uncertainties owing to the rainfall data of d4pdf and the flood inundation model used these uncertainties stem from spatial resolution blanc et al 2012 and assumptions in the drainage network the regional climate simulation in d4pdf was performed at 20 km resolution covering nagoya city with 4 grids the bias in area averaged 3 h rainfall was corrected with the observed radar based rainfall at 1 km resolution however coarse resolution in d4pdf might lead to smaller spatial variability in local rainfall intensity and contribute to relatively uniform pluvial flood depths the flood inundation model employed in this study has uncertainty in spatial resolution and model structure to complete 3000 pluvial and fluvial flood simulations elevation data was up scaled from 10 m to 90 m omitting local topographical variations horritt and bates 2001 in terms of the modeled drainage network rainwater in sewage pipes was assumed to go back to a river channel and thus overflow from manholes was not considered these issues will be addressed in future research d4pdf is capable of helping understand changes in the frequency of low return interval severe flood damage under 2 and 4 degree temperature rise scenarios by comparing probability plots with the present climate future research will demonstrate the application of this framework to different climate scenarios to inform the potential change signals of extreme floods based on the impact

flooding any governmental document or academic literature has not shown dominant rainfall duration against pluvial flooding in the nagoya city area this study identified it by simulating pluvial flood damage with the pluvial flood model pl model constructed in this study from d4pdf rainfall data without bias correction given rainfall data in d4pdf before bias correction is still applicable for testing the sensitivity of rainfall duration on pluvial flood damage thanks to a large number of ensembles flood damage calculation also follows the fragility functions provided by mlit 2005 the relationship between the simulated flood damage and 3 6 and 24 h study area averaged rainfall in 3 000 events with annual maximum 24 h basin averaged rainfall is plotted in fig a1 a b and c it is clear that rainfall over a shorter duration shows higher correlation with damage spearman s rank correlation coefficients for 3 6 and 24 h durations are 0 976 0 960 and 0 736 therefore the target duration for the bias correction of d4pdf rainfall data was set as 3 h in this study
