tradeoffs and co benefits between types and levels of agricultural products and other ecosystem services generated in a watershed pewi s niche as an ecological model is as a tool for engaging broad public audiences in understanding the science and management of landscapes and watersheds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agroecosystems ecosystem services landscape design science communication visualization n nitrogen pewi people in ecosystems watershed integration stp soil test phosphorus 1 introduction improving public understanding of ecosystem services is a critical strategy for achieving sustainable management of our crowded planet chaplin kramer et al 2019 costanza et al 2014 palmer et al 2004 as societies evaluate their present use of ecosystem services and the need to sustain them far into the future researchers including biggs et al 2010 have called for new ways of thinking that reframe the relationship between science and decision making p 267 models can provide broad public audiences with access to the science needed to address local and global ecosystem challenges that affect human wellbeing chaplin kramer et al 2019 a strength in using models is the ability to take complex or abstract knowledge for example land use tradeoffs and simplify it into useful relational concepts that apply outside the research or learning environment long et al 2014 such models emphasize simplification of inputs and modeling with a preservation of complex relationships kiili 2005 garcia barrios et al 2008 long et al 2014 to be effective in an educational context users require goals matched to their skill level and immediate and clear feedback kiili 2005 interactive visualizations and graphics can provide such feedback facilitating user understanding of complex subjects mcinerny et al 2014 incorporating these ideas together educational modeling with appealing intuitive and interactive visualizations enables experimentation and hands on exploration with a vast body of ecological knowledge otherwise too detailed or abstract for general audiences within the specific context of ecosystem service modeling a vast body of emerging models is greatly advancing society s capacity for informed environmental decision making bagstad et al 2013 rieb et al 2017 the audiences for these models are largely scientific and technical however and time and cost constraints data and expertise requirements and lack of intuitiveness impede their use for more general audiences environmental stakeholders in the broader public including private individuals and those that work for or engage with municipalities county governments or civil society organizations also have interest in tools that address the interplay between land use and ecosystem services for educational engagement and communication purposes f√ºrst et al 2010 gill et al 2014 goldstein et al 2012 hilde and paterson 2014 tayyebi et al 2016 here we present a simulation model that serves as an integrated platform for educational users to test and evaluate how changes in land cover use and management affect the production of multiple ecosystem services in an agricultural watershed this open source web application people in ecosystems watershed integration pewi http www nrem iastate edu pewi accomplishes educational objectives by making complex relationships between land use ecosystem function and ecosystem services more transparent while eliminating the need for extensive user supplied ecological knowledge and information common to advanced decision making tools pewi features an interactive platform which allows broad public audiences to easily explore visualize learn and discuss complex issues associated with ecosystem services to our knowledge pewi is unique among available tools in combining the simulation of multiple ecosystem service outcomes with game like qualities including a stand alone virtual environment communicative visual display and instantaneous user interactivity previous publications presenting pewi schulte et al 2010 chennault et al 2016 summarized the pewi v1 and v2 models respectively most recently chennault et al 2016 introduced the expanded categories of ecosystem services modeled in pewi v2 and demonstrated the usefulness of the lessons and exercises in the pewi library however these publications have yet to present the scientific rationale for the modeling of each service nor any quantification of the inputs and outputs in this manuscript and its accompanying supplementary materials appendix a we provide the full model formulation and equations within pewi v2 publishing the model equations fill an important knowledge gap in understanding the trade offs in multiple ecosystem service benefits in us corn belt agriculture settings the most recent release pewi v3 retained the v2 model but has significantly improved pewi s web application through testing and a more streamlined and modular code which we also address in this paper we believe that publishing the full model formulation testing details and structure of the underlying code can further our goal of making pewi a more widely collaborative model among the open source ecological modeling community we also present and analyze five basic land use scenarios to demonstrate the results of the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 data controls and outcomes the pewi model fig 1 is static in its predefined physiographic properties of the virtual watershed random in assignment of seven annual precipitation levels and dynamic in its incorporation of user created land use patterns users choose among 15 land cover use and management options hereafter land use to simplify to assign to grid cell locations comprising the watershed land use configurations physiographic properties soil class drainage class topography watershed boundaries etc and weather conditions serve as inputs for modeling ecosystem services outcomes reports provide users annual summaries of area in each land use type weather conditions number of strategic wetlands assigned and ecosystem services produced pewi s virtual watershed is informed by real world land use context and geographic assemblies but it is not a real world location users may evaluate environmental conditions us corn belt a highly productive agricultural region that supports myriad provisioning services at the expense of supporting regulating and cultural ecosystem services larsen et al 2019 specifically geographic data comprising the pewi watershed is derived from boone county and jasper county iowa which are associated with two landform regions the des moines lobe and the southern iowa drift plain respectively prior 1991 the des moines lobe region was created by geologically recent glacial activity which generated a relatively flat poorly drained landscape dotted with prairie potholes and other depressions to enhance productivity of annual row crops in the region s wetland areas extensive tile drainage networks were installed by contrast the older glacial activity in the southern iowa drift plain region enabled time for streams and rivers to form sloping hills and as a result the region historically has included more pasture grazing and tree cover than the des moines lobe region including multiple regions in pewi provides users with opportunities to consider distinct land use and management challenges that arise in different physical geographies while the data are derived from real locations the spatial configuration of the watershed s topography soil conditions and drainage within pewi is virtual and unique we made the decision to develop pewi as a virtual location for educational purposes environmental conditions and challenges associated with two different landforms can be simultaneously considered and more generalized learning can be facilitated a virtual location can also overcome personal psychological barriers about what is supposed to be where the pewi watershed is composed of 20 subwatersheds table s1 and 593 individual grid cells each grid cell represents up to approximately 4 ha which maps to a soil map series and its associated iowa soil properties and interpretations database ispaid data set miller et al 2010a we incorporated historical annual precipitation data from iowa to simulate weather variability across years in pewi idals et al 2017 based upon these data we randomly assigned predefined weather conditions for years 1 3 and an initialization year 0 from seven annual precipitation levels between 62 4 and 114 6 cm as model inputs table s2 the pewi web interface fig 2 contains a watershed map loaded with a predefined year 1 baseline land use configuration 100 conventional corn which remains the same until users choose among the 15 different land use types and apply them to the watershed table 1 years 2 and 3 pre load with the previous year s user configuration until users modify their land use patterns users may evaluate environmental conditions including annual precipitation levels and maps of watershed physiographic properties to inform their land use decisions fig 1 within the pewi web interface users can access maps of predefined physiographic property data with flood frequency drainage class and soil class data for each soil map series obtained from ispaid miller et al 2010a the other two available maps show users realistically delineated subwatershed boundaries and strategic wetland location data topographic relief data with slopes ranging 0 18 table s3 were also obtained from ispaid and may be visualized on the interactive watershed by toggling the t key on the keyboard and turned off by again toggling the t key the pewi model equations make use of additional physiographic characteristics from ispaid that are not presented to users corn suitability rating an index rating soil type suitability for row crop production yield rates for corn soybean and alfalfa brome slope range hydrologic group soil texture surface horizon subsoil group b horizon only permeability and an erodibility factor kw the supplementary materials appendix a provide full details on use of these factors in the model pewi presents outcomes to users in three forms 1 numeric output of nine crop and livestock production three water quality two soil quality and two habitat indicators presented in units appropriate to the factor of each ecosystem service indicator 2 indexed scores for the same 16 ecosystem service indicators on a scale of from 0 the lowest possible value for each indicator to 100 the highest fig 3 and 3 watershed maps for two measures of water quality and one measure of soil quality presenting outcome data as index scores facilitates user comparisons among diverse types of measurements making tradeoff assessment less abstract e g among results as different as corn yield and nitrate concentration by associating outcomes with a relative index rather than monetary values it also allows users to value ecosystem services on their own terms rather than imposing external socially constructed values to facilitate this process we converted all measured unit based outcome to unitless index scores on a straight line basis with scores ranging between 0 the lowest score attainable in pewi and 100 the highest score attainable in pewi a higher index score corresponds to enhanced functionality in the watershed thus serving as a relative way to compare and evaluate various user determined land use patterns pewi presents its scores in tabular form and in an interactive graphic plot that allows users to compare scores for all ecosystem service indicators across three years fig 3 the interactive watershed maps for ecosystem service indicators enable users to spatially target yield water and soil quality improvements pewi is an open source application accessible at https github com nrem pewi its web based interface is coded using a combination of javascript ecma international 2018 css mozilla and individual contributors 2019a php achour et al 2019 and html5 mozilla and individual contributors 2019b its front end framework is built on the javascript d3 library bostock 2019 and jquery the jquery foundation 2019 a comprehensive object oriented redesign of the code structure was conducted to ensure long term maintainability eliminate repetitive code and make the project more usable for the open source software community pewi includes a glossary that provides text and or video descriptions of all land uses and management practices the environmental context physical features and precipitation ecosystem service modules and user controls a 2 minute introductory video and other tutorials pewi 2017 and tutorials on pewi are available online 2 2 modules pewi computes and outputs 16 ecosystem service indicators in four categories habitat soil quality water quality and yield table 2 various land use configurations weather conditions and predefined physiographic properties jointly affect multiple ecosystem service outcomes which pewi tracks simultaneously we initially based model equations on literature review empirical data existing models and expert consultation and finalized equations using a combination of testing sensitivity analysis and expert review descriptions of ecosystem service indicators rationale for incorporating them within pewi and summaries of associated calculations are more fully documented below with additional supporting information in the supplementary material appendix a 2 2 1 habitat pewi reports two ecosystem service indicators within the habitat category biodiversity and game wildlife the biodiversity indicator in pewi presents a relative measure of how well a landscape pattern maintains habitat suitability at the watershed scale for native species fischer et al 2006 based upon landscape configuration and composition fahrig 2017 fahrig et al 2011 we consider biodiversity as a supporting service due to its linkages with other ecosystem services such as the regulating services of pollination and pest control which are not currently incorporated into pewi as well as a cultural service due to the intrinsic value some people place on native biota mace et al 2012 the game wildlife index is similar to the biodiversity index but represents a provisioning and cultural ecosystem service due to its association with hunting arnett and southwick 2015 it is adjusted to reflect less sensitivity to need for native habitats and greater need to reach a minimum threshold area for land use types that support each specific game species considered here including white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus mallard duck anas platyrhynchos wild turkey meleagris gallopavo ring neck pheasant phasianus colchicus bobwhite quail colinus virginianus and sport fish e g largemouth bass micropterus salmoides these are popular game species in the us corn belt region as with all modules in pewi the biodiversity and game wildlife indicator scores are relativized such that the lowest calculated value mapped to 0 and the highest calculated value mapped to 100 however unlike other modules which calculate absolute values e g nitrate n concentration biodiversity and game wildlife are modeled with a relative points system ranging from 0 to 10 thus the indicator score simply equals the point totals multiplied by 10 2 2 1 1 biodiversity the biodiversity model in pewi is a scoring system ranging 0 to 10 with 10 indicating a pewi landscape that best maintains habitat quality the additive score is distributed among five sub scores table 3 1 the combined percent area in the three most habitat conserving land uses conservation forest grassland wetland awarding up to 4 0 points 2 the combined percent area in the three most habitat conserving land uses conservation forest grassland wetland and three high diversity land uses conventional forest mixed fruit and vegetable rotational grazing awarding up to 1 5 points 3 the combined percent area in all non corn or soybean land uses awarding up to 1 5 points 4 a combination of percent area in wetland and strategic placement of wetlands awarding up to 1 5 points and 5 the percent of the stream length that is buffered awarding up to 1 5 points rationale supporting these calculations follows with additional information in the supplementary material appendix a table s4 the first three calculations form a hierarchical structure that awards points primarily for more habitat supporting vegetation types and secondarily for agricultural land use types that better support wildlife richness and abundance relative to a conventionally row cropped system as an agricultural matrix can provide beneficial ecosystem functions as long as it has a similar vegetation structure to patches of native vegetation fischer et al 2006 additionally perennial non native vegetation and land uses e g biomass production may provide habitat for different species as long as the production system maintains structural similarities to historically natural habitat areas in the same landscape fahrig et al 2011 wetlands provide invertebrate and amphibian habitat with prairie pothole wetlands being especially important for birds best et al 1995 hunter jr 2005 stream buffers protect sensitive aquatic ecosystems and can provide corridors that connect patches of native vegetation fischer et al 2006 streams and riparian areas provide habitat for diverse and abundant wildlife and land managers can use strips of vegetation in these zones to protect against agricultural runoff and conserve these sensitive ecosystems hunter jr 2005 2 2 1 2 game wildlife game wildlife also ranges from a score of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating a pewi landscape that best maintains game habitat quality based on six additive sub calculations table 4 1 the percent area in conservation forest awarding up to 1 0 point 2 the percent area in grassland awarding up to 1 0 point 3 the percent area in wetland awarding up to 1 0 point 4 the combined percent area in all three natural land uses conservation forest prairie wetland and three additional high diversity land uses conventional forest mixed fruit and vegetable rotational grazing awarding up to 4 0 points 5 the combined percent area in all non corn or soybean land uses awarding up to 1 5 points and 6 the percent of the stream length that is buffered awarding up to 1 5 points rationale supporting the game wildlife calculations includes the following with additional information available in the supplementary material appendix a table s5 incorporating at least some forest into an agricultural landscape is known to support game wildlife including northern bobwhite quail wild turkey and white tailed deer brennan 1999 mcroberts et al 2014 incorporating at least some grassland into an agricultural landscape supports game wildlife including northern bobwhite quail and ring necked pheasant brennan 1999 giudice and ratti 2001 prairie pothole wetlands are important for birds especially water nesting bird species best et al 1995 hunter jr 2005 incorporating at least some wetland into an agricultural landscape supports game wildlife such as mallards drilling et al 2002 and ring necked pheasants giudice and ratti 2001 pewi awards points for percent of stream buffered based on fischer et al 2006 principle that stream buffers protect sensitive aquatic ecosystems and the organisms that reside there including sport fish and that corridors connect patches of native vegetation together the game wildlife score calculations account for the effects of land use type land management and landscape pattern on native species habitat 2 2 2 soil quality pewi presents two indicators of soil quality carbon sequestration and erosion control carbon sequestration in an agricultural context serves as a strategy to improve the long term health and productivity of soil and helps offset atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions fissore et al 2010 lal 2011 agricultural lands have been shown to positively sequester carbon and increase overall carbon storage capacity in response to various types of field management e g use of cover crops and land use change post et al 2004 erosion in excess has documented negative impacts on soil health leading to diminished crop productivity and when deposited in surface waters impairs aquatic stream habitat bennett and wells 2019 idals et al 2017 li et al 2016 as measures of soil quality both carbon sequestration and erosion control are considered supporting services mea 2005 over longer time periods beyond the 3 years modeled in pewi carbon sequestration is also considered a regulating service due to its impact on climate erosion control is also linked with the regulating service of water purification as soil that moves with wind or water can become serious air and water pollutants blanco canqui and lal 2008 turner and rabalais 2003 2 2 2 1 carbon sequestration the carbon sequestration model in pewi presents a measure of potential sequestered carbon in the soil resulting from vegetation conversion of an annual conventional row crop land use to alternative land use or land management practices annual per hectare carbon sequestration rates in pewi range from 0 40 mg with conversion to conservation corn or conservation soybean land use types to 4 69 mg with conversion to the short rotation woody bioenergy land use type table s6 a meta analysis conducted by fissore et al 2010 summarized available empirical data on carbon sequestration rates associated with changes in land use land cover we assigned the summary rates which serve as the primary source for soil carbon sequestration calculations to 13 land use types in pewi for the two remaining pewi land use types alfalfa and switchgrass crops we based calculations on empirical data from iowa al kaisi et al 2005 due to the gap in published empirical data regarding carbon sequestration in mixed fruits and vegetable systems at the time of pewi s development we incorporated expert knowledge suggesting no appreciable increases in carbon sequestration cynthia cambardella usda agricultural research service personal communication 2 2 2 2 erosion control pewi quantifies gross erosion as the amount of soil loss per year in the watershed from rill erosion interrill erosion and ephemeral gully erosion table s7 high gross erosion translates to low erosion control and thus a low index score and vice versa pewi provides estimates for rill and interrill erosion based on the widely used revised universal soil loss equation rulse renard et al 1997 the rusle soil loss calculation takes the product of five factors rainfall erosivity factor r soil erodibility factor k slope length steepness factor ls cover management factor c and practice support factor p renard et al 1997 table s7 parameterization of these factors within pewi can be found in the supplementary material appendix a rusle was calculated on a grid cell basis and then summed to develop a watershed estimate ephemeral gully erosion is soil movement that forms small channels where water flow concentrates with runoff it is considered as an important factor in agricultural landscapes with highly erodible soil little crop residue or crop harvest soil disturbance usda nrcs 1997 because rusle does not consider ephemeral gully erosion we incorporated a calculation using the statewide annual estimates for iowa usda nrcs 1997 annual estimates of 6 7 mg ha 1 for iowa upward by 50 to 10 1 mg ha 1 for conventional annual row crop practices and downward by 50 to 3 4 mg ha 1 for conservation annual row crop practices thomas isenhart iowa state university personal communication because modeling the relationships between ephemeral gully erosion and row cropping practices is an active area of research where the relationships are not yet settled bennett and wells 2019 idals et al 2017 the 50 upward and downward adjustments reflect directionally accurate models based on the generalized effects of conservation practices on ephemeral gully erosion annual gross erosion rates in pewi range from 0 04 137 mg ha 1 2 2 3 water quality pewi provides three indicators of water quality nitrate pollution control phosphorus pollution control and sediment control all are considered regulating services mea 2005 we report all three because of their different impacts on human health and economy and on ecosystem function nitrate pollution is a well known public health problem that negatively affects human health when exceeding a contamination level of 10 mg l 1 in drinking water limits set forth in the national primary drinking water regulations 40 c f r 141 2010 excess nitrate further impairs aquatic ecosystems and disrupts human activity at various scales downstream e g from local fishing streams to large hypoxic zones in gulf regions turner and rabalais 2003 transport of phosphorus from agricultural fields into surface waters has negative consequences where aquatic eutrophication threatens aquatic species and human economy at scales ranging from the local to regional scales jacobson et al 2011 jones and schilling 2011 turner and rabalais 2003 phosphorus and sediment are tightly linked because some forms of phosphorus bind to and move with sediment 2 2 3 1 nitrate pollution control nitrate pollution control within pewi is the indexed inverse of the annual mean nitrate nitrogen n concentration levels in surface water from the outlet of the model watershed where low levels of concentration correspond to high levels of control and vice versa the calculation for watershed annual mean nitrate n concentration averages subwatershed nitrate n concentration weighted by subwatershed area proportional to watershed area the subwatershed nitrate n concentration incorporates information on precipitation the extent of conventional and conservation row crop land uses and the presence of wetland land cover in strategic locations table s8 the equations are based on the schilling and libra 2000 conclusion that watershed size impacts the relationship between the percent of the watershed in row crops and the expected nitrate n concentrations in surface water specific details on module formulation and parameterization can be found in the supplementary material appendix a mean annual nitrate n concentration in pewi ranges from 2 to 29 54 mg l 1 pewi also generates a map for users to evaluate the percent contribution of each subwatershed to the overall watershed nitrate n concentration pewi calculates the percent contribution of each subwatershed as the product of subwatershed nitrate n concentration and the ratio of subwatershed area to watershed area table s8 2 2 3 2 phosphorus pollution control phosphorus pollution control is reported as the indexed inverse of annual in stream phosphorus loading in pewi the calculation incorporates three phosphorus delivery pathways to surface waters phosphorus bound to sediment and moving with erosion dissolved phosphorus moving with surface water in runoff and dissolved phosphorus moving with subsurface water usda nrcs 2004 pollution control is calculated for each grid cell and values are summed to yield watershed annual in stream phosphorus delivery table s9 we used the iowa phosphorus index p index as the bases for our calculations and selected index parameter values based on iowa idals et al 2017 usda nrcs 2004 and expert consultation matthew helmers and thomas isenhart iowa state university personal communication specific information on module formulation and parameterization can be found in the supplementary material appendix a 2 2 3 3 sediment pollution control to calculate sediment pollution control we modified the phosphorus pollution control equation presented in the above section to report it as the indexed inverse of annual in stream sediment delivery specifically we removed two factors from the erosion calculation described above that convert sediment to phosphorus enrichment factor and soil test phosphorus stp erosion factor the enrichment factor adjusts the erosion component to account for soils with higher concentrations of phosphorus and the stp erosion factor converts sediment delivery to sediment bound phosphorus based on estimates of soil phosphorus concentration usda nrcs 2004 three remaining multiplicative factors buffer factor gross erosion and sediment delivery ratio provide the pewi estimate of the total amount of sediment delivery to a stream table s12 2 2 4 yield yield calculations in pewi provide estimates of marketable crop and livestock production for several land use types in the watershed table s13 in terms of ecosystem services crop and livestock production provides primarily food fuel and feed for consumers as well as a source of producer income that benefits individual and community livelihoods all are considered provisioning services mea 2005 the general formula for crop and livestock production is the sum total of production across the watershed for each yield type table s14 production for each grid cell equals the product of three factors grid cell area yield base rate per unit area which is a function of yield type and yield precipitation factor the yield precipitation factor reduces base yields in years of extreme climate conditions for selected yield types table s15 the remainder of this section presents models of yield base rate per unit area for each yield type tables s13 s16 s21 2 2 4 1 corn and soybean yields we derived corn yield estimates for conventional corn zea mays l and conservation corn and soybean yield estimates for conventional soybean and conservation soybean glycine max l merr from ispaid data that models corn yield for each soil mapping unit assuming high level management miller et al 2010a table s16 ispaid derives soybean yield for each soil mapping unit based on a percentage of corn yield equivalent to 29 for model simplification we assumed no yield difference between conventional and conservation row crops for multiple reasons first we assumed that crop yield differences are primarily driven by weather and soils as well as management factors not modeled in pewi i e crop genetics plant spacing fertilization these factors are likely to have a greater impact on yield than the implementation of practices we associated with conservation i e cover crops and no till relatedly the pewi model assumes that conservation practices necessitating the removal of crop production areas are strategically located in areas of the field that are low yielding in conventional crop systems basso et al 2019 brandes et al 2016 2 2 4 2 alfalfa hay and grass hay yields ispaid also provides estimates of alfalfa hay for stands of alfalfa medicago sativa l and grass hay yields for stands of either bromegrass bromus inermis leyss or orchard grass dactylis glomerata l we used these estimates for alfalfa and grass hay land use types table s17 setting minimum base yield rates of 8 07 mg ha 1 for alfalfa and grass hay emily heaton and matthew liebman iowa state university personal communication 2 2 4 3 permanent pasture and rotational grazing yields permanent pasture and rotational grazing land use types both have potential to support a wide range of ruminant livestock we used pewi alfalfa hay and grass hay yield potentials to estimate the number of cattle that each ispaid soil mapping unit supports however note that the pewi model does not allocate production from areas in alfalfa or grass hay land use types to support cattle only production from areas in permanent pasture and rotational grazing land use types yield base rate multiplies forage production alfalfa base rate by a utilization intake ratio percentage of seasonal utilization of forage production to total intake over the grazing season per animal usda nrcs 2008 table s18 instead of reporting animal unit months aum which may be unfamiliar to a broad public audience pewi calculates the number of grazing cattle supported per grazing season we also implicitly assumed that cattle outside of grazing season require additional inputs including feed water and shelter 2 2 4 4 mixed fruit and vegetable yield for mixed fruit and vegetable crops we selected grapes vitis spp green beans phaseolus vulgaris squash cucurbita pepo and strawberries fragaria ananassa as examples of crops that are increasingly popular among iowa fruit and vegetable producers and have high demand in local and regional metropolitan markets bregendahl and enderton 2013 swenson 2011 for green beans squash and strawberries we used yield values published by iowa state university extension with downward adjustments for unfavorable soil textures taber 2008 table s19 due to a lack of grape yield information from iowa we used regionally similar data from new york state that indicated elvira grape yields of 17 6 mg ha 1 delate and friedrich 2004 post and robinson 1995 and applied a soil texture multiplier adjustment we based the multiplier upon relationships between soil types and vegetable crop adaptation taber 2008 2 2 4 5 wood yield pewi estimates wood production for conventional forest and conservation forest land use types based on soil mapping unit yield ranging from the 2007 iowa woodland suitability composite idnr and usda nrcs 2007 table s20 base yield estimates assume selection of tree species suitable for a given location as recommended in the iowa woodland suitability composite to account for potential yield differences due to management practices in conservation forest land use types we applied a 30 reduction to wood production estimates from the iowa woodland suitability composite for conservation forest yield 2 2 4 6 switchgrass yield bioenergy crops are a potential market in the us corn belt heaton et al 2013 for pewi we selected herbaceous perennial crops and short rotation woody crops to represent the potential of the watershed to produce bioenergy for the land use category herbaceous perennial bioenergy switchgrass panicum virgatum l biomass yields range between 4 39 and 6 61 mg ha 1 which we scaled based on a modification to ispaid corn suitability ratings csr emily heaton iowa state university personal communication table s21 switchgrass is the pewi herbaceous perennial bioenergy crop since it is the most developed perennial dedicated energy crop in the region langholtz et al 2016 based on expert consultation for the level of yields in pewi we assumed no added inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization emily heaton iowa state university personal communication 2 2 4 7 short rotation woody biomass yield pewi provides biomass yield estimates for production of short rotation woody bioenergy crops based on 10 year aspen populus alba p grandidentata biomass of 224 mg ha 1 manatt et al 2013 for annual production figures we assumed temporally spaced plantings such that one tenth of an area in production becomes ready for harvest each year thus annual production of biomass equals 22 4 mg ha 1 2 3 feedbacks among modules some ecosystem service indicators within pewi draw upon the same computations e g erosion pollution control and phosphorus pollution control both use gross erosion calculations and thus outcomes are correlated outcomes are also correlated because changes in precipitation or land use actions can jointly affect multiple indicators simultaneously for example rainfall jointly affects crop yields and water quality measures hatfield et al 2009 miller et al 2010b the selection of a greater proportion of perennial versus annual land uses jointly improves habitat soil quality and water quality indicators as supported by the majority of scientific studies asbjornsen et al 2014 ecosystem service indicators are not otherwise interactive i e the output for one indicator is not used in calculating another indicator in the current version of pewi 2 4 model performance and sensitivity because the pewi watershed is a virtual location informed by real world geographic assemblies and is not an actual location we could not perform model calibration and validation using field collected data instead comprehensive testing was carried out to ensure all modules and subcalculations preformed exactly as described in the model each module was broken down into its respective subcalculations for analysis if a subcalculation includes additional formulas the process was repeated until only a single output variable remained all output variables were evaluated to determine the impact of different input variables inputs that tend to have a large impact on outputs include current and previous year precipitation rates and land use especially at strategic wetland locations or along the stream a total of 6131 individual test cases were run using this methodology all errors and inconsistencies found were methodically located and corrected in the pewi software code to represent model performance and sensitivity we created and ran six basic land use scenarios that illustrate the model s learning objectives the results of which we present in the following section the first five basic and contrasting land use scenarios with static and average precipitation conditions in pewi depict model performance these land use scenarios were produced by interactively changing the land use of the whole watershed to all 1 conventional corn 2 conservation corn 3 conservation forest 4 prairie and 5 rotational grazing and then recording ecosystem service outputs precipitation was held constant at the average precipitation of 81 7 cm yr 1 we also assumed average precipitation for the previous year we chose these land uses because of well known qualitative differences e g annual versus perennial vegetation type herbaceous versus woody vegetation type including versus excluding a livestock component that easily correspond to contrasting quantitative differences in pewi s outputs thus highlighting model performance for illustrative purposes we also created and ran a sixth basic land use scenario to depict the impact of varying precipitation conditions on ecosystem service outcomes the land use type for this scenario is conventional corn we converted all of the land use within the watershed to conventional corn and varied the precipitation to seven different precipitation levels coded within pewi 3 results in this section we present ecosystem service results of the model for six different scenarios although more complex scenarios are possible in pewi e g fig 2 in this section we describe results of five basic land use scenarios with average precipitation conditions and one basic land use scenario across varying precipitation conditions to illustrate the ecological lessons that pewi can support through comparisons across even the simplest of user generated scenarios the pewi model calculates annual results across three years producing absolute measurements and indexed scores for 16 ecosystem services as well as outcome maps for two water quality and one soil quality measure the results span between scores of 0 and 100 scaling from lowest to highest level of ecosystem service benefits no single land use receives scores of 100 across all ecosystem services hence users must consider tradeoffs among ecosystem service outputs in the pewi model in the first five scenarios we chose a single land use for each scenario and assumed average precipitation conditions of 81 7 cm in the current year as well as the preceding year the scenarios have the following land uses respectively conservation corn conservation forest conventional corn prairie and rotational grazing fig 4 of the five scenarios with average precipitation levels the scenario comprised of 100 conventional corn performs very well in terms of crop yield but poorest among all land use types in this example in terms of other ecosystem service outcomes conservation corn provides equally high crop yields but performs better on other ecosystem service outcomes than conventional corn by comparison perennial land uses each exhibit additional improvements on the other ecosystem service outcomes over conservation corn with tradeoffs exhibited in terms of preferences between annual commodity crops alternative crops and livestock and non production in the case of prairie the extent of improvement varies by land use as well as by ecosystem service to use biodiversity as an example conventional corn results in a score of zero as it provides the lowest level habitat support of pewi land uses conservation corn provides modest improvements upon biodiversity and rotational grazing produces an even higher biodiversity index score than either conventional corn or conservation corn finally conservation forest and prairie land use types score even higher than rotational grazing yet none of the five land uses scores the maximum of 100 because the model requires restoration of at least some strategically located wetlands to optimize support for habitat see 2 2 1 1 biodiversity in the sixth scenario fig 5 we chose a single land use conventional corn and recorded the current year results for varying levels of precipitation in the current year and preceding year only three ecosystem service outcomes nitrate control sediment control and yield respond to varying levels of precipitation nitrate n concentration not only varies by precipitation level in the current year but also depends on interannual precipitation patterns erosion and yield present no interannual precipitation effects fig 5 see supplementary material appendix a as expected for conventional corn increasing precipitation has negative effects on both erosion control and nitrate control while both extreme dry and wet conditions impact yield quantities these scenarios provide a few important examples of results from the pewi model model calculations constants estimated parameter values and minimum and maximum results and are presented in the supplementary material appendix a 4 discussion 4 1 learning objectives as societies evaluate their present use of ecosystem services and the need to sustain them far into the future educational modeling can provide broad public audiences access to the science needed to address local and global ecosystem challenges that affect human wellbeing costanza et al 2014 long et al 2014 we developed pewi as an educational watershed simulation model that serves as an integrated ecosystem service tradeoffs tool around which users may evaluate how changes to land use affect the types and levels of ecosystem services produced users interact with the environment land use ecosystem service outcomes and the relationships between them in a virtual watershed without other barriers posed by land use decision making in the real world such as time cost and ownership users construct preferences for ecosystem services through an iterative process of learning where evaluation of outcomes informs further modifications to land use configurations to meet user objectives anderson et al 2020 the six basic scenarios presented in the results section provide one possible starting point for that iterative learning process with subsequent modifications enabling users to explore nuanced tradeoffs and co benefits between types and levels of agricultural products and other ecosystem services generated in a watershed we designed pewi to meet multiple learning objectives including improved understanding of basic ecological functions e g levels of habitat provided by diverse perennial land use types versus annual row crops the interplay of ecological functions and conservation practices e g increases in erosion control with conservation corn and soybean versus conventional corn and conventional soybean spatial targeting for ecosystem service production e g multifunctional benefits of buffering streams and restoring strategically placed wetlands the impacts of interannual variability of rainfall on ecosystem services e g decreases in nitrate control in annual row crop systems and land use tradeoffs e g types and levels of agricultural products vary with the levels of ecosystem services anderson et al 2020 of these objectives the six simple scenarios we presented in the results section allow users to begin examining all but one spatial targeting adding increased complexity to these simple scenarios through spatial targeting users might next apply stream buffers or convert areas to wetlands based on pewi s pre supplied maps of strategic wetland locations through such exploration users can answer questions such as which scenario presents better nitrate control a landscape with conventional corn and strategic placement of wetlands or a landscape with 100 conservation corn and no strategic wetlands while designed to be relevant to public audiences in the us corn belt pewi s accessible conceptual framework and general relationships provide lessons that transfer to a variety contexts anderson et al 2020 for example agricultural land uses based on annual crops such as corn and soybeans pose tradeoffs world over between provisioning versus other types of ecosystem services power 2010 in the results section the two annual row crop scenarios conventional corn and conservation corn provide high levels of agricultural yields but with lower levels of other services even with modest improvements to non provisioning services the conservation corn land use still results in much lower levels of biodiversity and game wildlife compared to the prairie scenario fig 4 after evaluating these results pewi users might then experiment with perennial crop and livestock land use types such as hay alfalfa and rotational grazing which provide a more balanced array of ecosystem services but with concomitant declines in the provisioning of agricultural yields at least in the short term asbjornsen et al 2014 li et al 2016 robertson et al 2014 analyzing the results from the rotational grazing scenario for example users can learn how agricultural landscapes composed of land uses that incorporate native species and more structurally complex vegetation better support native biodiversity fahrig et al 2011 fischer et al 2006 hunter jr 2005 while such lessons might seem obvious to ecosystem service scientists they are not necessarily obvious to members of the broader public costanza et al 2014 thompson et al 2016 after exploring the tradeoffs among these and other basic scenarios we expect pewi users to creatively experiment on their own with increasingly complex land use designed with decisions informed by the base layer physical feature maps in pewi alternatively users can complete any of the designed lesson plan activities accessible through the pewi website 4 2 user activity and experience the current version of pewi v3 is a web based application of an original spreadsheet based pewi model schulte et al 2010 in comparison to v1 v2 3 are delivered in a user friendly web based format and offer an expanded watershed area added land use and management options a temporal component varied interannual weather conditions new physiographic maps an expanded set of ecosystem service indicators improved graphics and visualization and enhanced user interaction all ecosystem service indicator modules were also updated to reflect progress in ecosystem service research pewi v2 was initially launched in beta form in october 2014 and was fully released in july 2016 chennault et al 2016 pewi v3 was released in december 2017 web use statistics indicate in 2019 pewi was been used by 2509 unique visitors representing all continents with the greatest usage coming from the us canada china and the uk we have used pewi with a variety of age groups including middle school students high school students college undergraduates graduate students and adult learners and evaluated the learning opportunities it provides according to next generation science standards ngss lead states 2016 and agriculture food and natural resources standards ncae national council for agricultural education 2015 while formal evaluation data are not yet available our experience using pewi in formal classrooms is that the defined learning objectives can be met when use of the model is paired with structured learning materials as provided on pewi s supporting website www nrem iastate edu pewi group activities and discussion and or guidance from instructors in non formal adult learning contexts including workshops with farmers agricultural educators and other agricultural stakeholders we observed pewi users develop increasingly complex scenarios that triggered discussions on topics important to multifunctional landscapes management for example sustainable rates of soil erosion water quality impairments loss of agrotourism income and the potential markets based on perennial crops which otherwise are not readily discussed atwell et al 2009 larsen et al 2019 pewi may inhabit a unique niche in comparison to other ecosystem service models thus far the modeling community has placed the most effort on developing models that can predict the delivery of ecosystem services from spatially explicit land use arrangements in the real world historically most models have focused on just one to a few ecosystem services although more recently effort has been placed on developing modeling platforms such as those reviewed by bagstad et al 2013 that can simultaneously assess whole suites of ecosystem services running these models requires substantial expertise time and user supplied data essential ingredients for accurate prediction but barriers to use beyond scientific and technical communities bagstad et al 2013 developing simpler models to engage public audiences in ecosystem service concepts is a frontier costanza et al 2014 goldstein et al 2012 and existing tools tend to fall into two categories those that associate with real locations through google maps or a similar interface e g aries villa et al 2014 inforest virginia department of forestry 2014 itree hilde and paterson 2014 model my watershed gill et al 2014 smartscape tayyebi et al 2016 and those built for a virtual environment e g pewi chennault et al 2016 pimp your landscape f√ºrst et al 2010 rock your watershed isu 2012 while the simpler models in the real world category offer a higher level of credibility from a decision making standpoint the virtual landscape in pewi can bolster creative exploration of ecological relationships and watershed principles without tying users to personal psychological barriers or social norms about what land uses are supposed to be in particular real world locations pewi also enhances understanding of ecological decision making factors by incorporating a broader suite of ecosystem services and greater flexibility to spatially target changes to land use patterns and conservation practices than many of the simpler real world models other distinctive features of pewi include substantially shorter web based only training requirements bypassing any in person training sessions needed for still complex simpler modeling platforms models built for a virtual environment are better suited for education because they are quicker to learn and more game like in quality hagen 2016 among these pewi offers substantial scientific depth a pleasing display a high level of interactivity and spatially explicit decision making and the greatest number of land use options and ecosystem service indicators hagen 2016 we suggest that pewi s forte is in rapidly facilitating user understanding of general relationships between land use and ecosystem services and that it may provide a gateway to either using models that predict ecosystem service outcomes for real world locations or the outputs from such models in decision making 4 3 future model development we performed extensive literature review and repeatedly consulted subject experts in building pewi s modules yet we perceive substantial opportunity for module refinement moving forward for example parameterization of pewi s nitrogen pollution control module could be improved for the perennial land use types of alfalfa pasture and switchgrass the relationship between these land uses and the water quality impairment of nitrate n pollution is not well understood at a watershed scale or how variability in management including fertilization affects that relationship the schilling and libra 2000 estimate incorporated into pewi only evaluated crops corn and soybean as did the lawlor curve lawlor et al 2008 used in the iowa nutrient reduction strategy idals et al 2017 we used data from unmanaged grasslands to represent the performance of pasture land use types because we could not find more specific data there is also substantial uncertainty associated with pewi s carbon sequestration module because the existing literature is conflicting fissore et al 2010 meta analysis published on carbon sequestration potential in the midwest us found large standard deviations in published carbon sequestration data and subsequent literature review by cambardella et al 2012 pointed to a relatively poor understanding of the mechanisms that determine soc changes in response to land management practices p 52 lack of scientific understanding and uncertainty in model formulation and the selection of parameters presented a challenge in pewi s development and thus provides an opportunity for future refinement both in terms of updating the modules as further knowledge is developed as well as finding ways to represent scientific uncertainty where it exists without diminishing the value of the tool for its intended audience kiili 2005 5 conclusions pewi s niche is as an open source scientifically grounded ecological model for engaging a broad public audience in concepts of land use the environment ecosystem services and tradeoffs in an agricultural context pewi integrates general scientific principles with the best available local data through quantitative models embedded in an appealing interactive platform pewi allows users to evaluate how changes to agricultural land management affect the production of multiple ecosystem services and in time may facilitate the design of land use arrangements that satisfy both individual and societal needs as an open source tool we hope other scientists and programmers will contribute data and code to improve and expand pewi s capacity into the future credit author

critical strategy for achieving sustainable management of our crowded planet chaplin kramer et al 2019 costanza et al 2014 palmer et al 2004 as societies evaluate their present use of ecosystem services and the need to sustain them far into the future researchers including biggs et al 2010 have called for new ways of thinking that reframe the relationship between science and decision making p 267 models can provide broad public audiences with access to the science needed to address local and global ecosystem challenges that affect human wellbeing chaplin kramer et al 2019 a strength in using models is the ability to take complex or abstract knowledge for example land use tradeoffs and simplify it into useful relational concepts that apply outside the research or learning environment long et al 2014 such models emphasize simplification of inputs and modeling with a preservation of complex relationships kiili 2005 garcia barrios et al 2008 long et al 2014 to be effective in an educational context users require goals matched to their skill level and immediate and clear feedback kiili 2005 interactive visualizations and graphics can provide such feedback facilitating user understanding of complex subjects mcinerny et al 2014 incorporating these ideas together educational modeling with appealing intuitive and interactive visualizations enables experimentation and hands on exploration with a vast body of ecological knowledge otherwise too detailed or abstract for general audiences within the specific context of ecosystem service modeling a vast body of emerging models is greatly advancing society s capacity for informed environmental decision making bagstad et al 2013 rieb et al 2017 the audiences for these models are largely scientific and technical however and time and cost constraints data and expertise requirements and lack of intuitiveness impede their use for more general audiences environmental stakeholders in the broader public including private individuals and those that work for or engage with municipalities county governments or civil society organizations also have interest in tools that address the interplay between land use and ecosystem services for educational engagement and communication purposes f√ºrst et al 2010 gill et al 2014 goldstein et al 2012 hilde and paterson 2014 tayyebi et al 2016 here we present a simulation model that serves as an integrated platform for educational users to test and evaluate how changes in land cover use and management affect the production of multiple ecosystem services in an agricultural watershed this open source web application people in ecosystems watershed integration pewi http www nrem iastate edu pewi accomplishes educational objectives by making complex relationships between land use ecosystem function and ecosystem services more transparent while eliminating the need for extensive user supplied ecological knowledge and information common to advanced decision making tools pewi features an interactive platform which allows broad public audiences to easily explore visualize learn and discuss complex issues associated with ecosystem services to our knowledge pewi is unique among available tools in combining the simulation of multiple ecosystem service outcomes with game like qualities including a stand alone virtual environment communicative visual display and instantaneous user interactivity previous publications presenting pewi schulte et al 2010 chennault et al 2016 summarized the pewi v1 and v2 models respectively most recently chennault et al 2016 introduced the expanded categories of ecosystem services modeled in pewi v2 and demonstrated the usefulness of the lessons and exercises in the pewi library however these publications have yet to present the scientific rationale for the modeling of each service nor any quantification of the inputs and outputs in this manuscript and its accompanying supplementary materials appendix a we provide the full model formulation and equations within pewi v2 publishing the model equations fill an important knowledge gap in understanding the trade offs in multiple ecosystem service benefits in us corn belt agriculture settings the most recent release pewi v3 retained the v2 model but has significantly improved pewi s web application through testing and a more streamlined and modular code which we also address in this paper we believe that publishing the full model formulation testing details and structure of the underlying code can further our goal of making pewi a more widely collaborative model among the open source ecological modeling community we also present and analyze five basic land use scenarios to demonstrate the results of the model 2 materials and methods 2 1 data controls and outcomes the pewi model fig 1 is static in its predefined physiographic properties of the virtual watershed random in assignment of seven annual precipitation levels and dynamic in its incorporation of user created land use patterns users choose among 15 land cover use and management options hereafter land use to simplify to assign to grid cell locations comprising the watershed land use configurations physiographic properties soil class drainage class topography watershed boundaries etc and weather conditions serve as inputs for modeling ecosystem services outcomes reports provide users annual summaries of area in each land use type weather conditions number of strategic wetlands assigned and ecosystem services produced pewi s virtual watershed is informed by real world land use context and geographic assemblies but it is not a real world location users may evaluate environmental conditions us corn belt a highly productive agricultural region that supports myriad provisioning services at the expense of supporting regulating and cultural ecosystem services larsen et al 2019 specifically geographic data comprising the pewi watershed is derived from boone county and jasper county iowa which are associated with two landform regions the des moines lobe and the southern iowa drift plain respectively prior 1991 the des moines lobe region was created by geologically recent glacial activity which generated a relatively flat poorly drained landscape dotted with prairie potholes and other depressions to enhance productivity of annual row crops in the region s wetland areas extensive tile drainage networks were installed by contrast the older glacial activity in the southern iowa drift plain region enabled time for streams and rivers to form sloping hills and as a result the region historically has included more pasture grazing and tree cover than the des moines lobe region including multiple regions in pewi provides users with opportunities to consider distinct land use and management challenges that arise in different physical geographies while the data are derived from real locations the spatial configuration of the watershed s topography soil conditions and drainage within pewi is virtual and unique we made the decision to develop pewi as a virtual location for educational purposes environmental conditions and challenges associated with two different landforms can be simultaneously considered and more generalized learning can be facilitated a virtual location can also overcome personal psychological barriers about what is supposed to be where the pewi watershed is composed of 20 subwatersheds table s1 and 593 individual grid cells each grid cell represents up to approximately 4 ha which maps to a soil map series and its associated iowa soil properties and interpretations database ispaid data set miller et al 2010a we incorporated historical annual precipitation data from iowa to simulate weather variability across years in pewi idals et al 2017 based upon these data we randomly assigned predefined weather conditions for years 1 3 and an initialization year 0 from seven annual precipitation levels between 62 4 and 114 6 cm as model inputs table s2 the pewi web interface fig 2 contains a watershed map loaded with a predefined year 1 baseline land use configuration 100 conventional corn which remains the same until users choose among the 15 different land use types and apply them to the watershed table 1 years 2 and 3 pre load with the previous year s user configuration until users modify their land use patterns users may evaluate environmental conditions including annual precipitation levels and maps of watershed physiographic properties to inform their land use decisions fig 1 within the pewi web interface users can access maps of predefined physiographic property data with flood frequency drainage class and soil class data for each soil map series obtained from ispaid miller et al 2010a the other two available maps show users realistically delineated subwatershed boundaries and strategic wetland location data topographic relief data with slopes ranging 0 18 table s3 were also obtained from ispaid and may be visualized on the interactive watershed by toggling the t key on the keyboard and turned off by again toggling the t key the pewi model equations make use of additional physiographic characteristics from ispaid that are not presented to users corn suitability rating an index rating soil type suitability for row crop production yield rates for corn soybean and alfalfa brome slope range hydrologic group soil texture surface horizon subsoil group b horizon only permeability and an erodibility factor kw the supplementary materials appendix a provide full details on use of these factors in the model pewi presents outcomes to users in three forms 1 numeric output of nine crop and livestock production three water quality two soil quality and two habitat indicators presented in units appropriate to the factor of each ecosystem service indicator 2 indexed scores for the same 16 ecosystem service indicators on a scale of from 0 the lowest possible value for each indicator to 100 the highest fig 3 and 3 watershed maps for two measures of water quality and one measure of soil quality presenting outcome data as index scores facilitates user comparisons among diverse types of measurements making tradeoff assessment less abstract e g among results as different as corn yield and nitrate concentration by associating outcomes with a relative index rather than monetary values it also allows users to value ecosystem services on their own terms rather than imposing external socially constructed values to facilitate this process we converted all measured unit based outcome to unitless index scores on a straight line basis with scores ranging between 0 the lowest score attainable in pewi and 100 the highest score attainable in pewi a higher index score corresponds to enhanced functionality in the watershed thus serving as a relative way to compare and evaluate various user determined land use patterns pewi presents its scores in tabular form and in an interactive graphic plot that allows users to compare scores for all ecosystem service indicators across three years fig 3 the interactive watershed maps for ecosystem service indicators enable users to spatially target yield water and soil quality improvements pewi is an open source application accessible at https github com nrem pewi its web based interface is coded using a combination of javascript ecma international 2018 css mozilla and individual contributors 2019a php achour et al 2019 and html5 mozilla and individual contributors 2019b its front end framework is built on the javascript d3 library bostock 2019 and jquery the jquery foundation 2019 a comprehensive object oriented redesign of the code structure was conducted to ensure long term maintainability eliminate repetitive code and make the project more usable for the open source software community pewi includes a glossary that provides text and or video descriptions of all land uses and management practices the environmental context physical features and precipitation ecosystem service modules and user controls a 2 minute introductory video and other tutorials pewi 2017 and tutorials on pewi are available online 2 2 modules pewi computes and outputs 16 ecosystem service indicators in four categories habitat soil quality water quality and yield table 2 various land use configurations weather conditions and predefined physiographic properties jointly affect multiple ecosystem service outcomes which pewi tracks simultaneously we initially based model equations on literature review empirical data existing models and expert consultation and finalized equations using a combination of testing sensitivity analysis and expert review descriptions of ecosystem service indicators rationale for incorporating them within pewi and summaries of associated calculations are more fully documented below with additional supporting information in the supplementary material appendix a 2 2 1 habitat pewi reports two ecosystem service indicators within the habitat category biodiversity and game wildlife the biodiversity indicator in pewi presents a relative measure of how well a landscape pattern maintains habitat suitability at the watershed scale for native species fischer et al 2006 based upon landscape configuration and composition fahrig 2017 fahrig et al 2011 we consider biodiversity as a supporting service due to its linkages with other ecosystem services such as the regulating services of pollination and pest control which are not currently incorporated into pewi as well as a cultural service due to the intrinsic value some people place on native biota mace et al 2012 the game wildlife index is similar to the biodiversity index but represents a provisioning and cultural ecosystem service due to its association with hunting arnett and southwick 2015 it is adjusted to reflect less sensitivity to need for native habitats and greater need to reach a minimum threshold area for land use types that support each specific game species considered here including white tailed deer odocoileus virginianus mallard duck anas platyrhynchos wild turkey meleagris gallopavo ring neck pheasant phasianus colchicus bobwhite quail colinus virginianus and sport fish e g largemouth bass micropterus salmoides these are popular game species in the us corn belt region as with all modules in pewi the biodiversity and game wildlife indicator scores are relativized such that the lowest calculated value mapped to 0 and the highest calculated value mapped to 100 however unlike other modules which calculate absolute values e g nitrate n concentration biodiversity and game wildlife are modeled with a relative points system ranging from 0 to 10 thus the indicator score simply equals the point totals multiplied by 10 2 2 1 1 biodiversity the biodiversity model in pewi is a scoring system ranging 0 to 10 with 10 indicating a pewi landscape that best maintains habitat quality the additive score is distributed among five sub scores table 3 1 the combined percent area in the three most habitat conserving land uses conservation forest grassland wetland awarding up to 4 0 points 2 the combined percent area in the three most habitat conserving land uses conservation forest grassland wetland and three high diversity land uses conventional forest mixed fruit and vegetable rotational grazing awarding up to 1 5 points 3 the combined percent area in all non corn or soybean land uses awarding up to 1 5 points 4 a combination of percent area in wetland and strategic placement of wetlands awarding up to 1 5 points and 5 the percent of the stream length that is buffered awarding up to 1 5 points rationale supporting these calculations follows with additional information in the supplementary material appendix a table s4 the first three calculations form a hierarchical structure that awards points primarily for more habitat supporting vegetation types and secondarily for agricultural land use types that better support wildlife richness and abundance relative to a conventionally row cropped system as an agricultural matrix can provide beneficial ecosystem functions as long as it has a similar vegetation structure to patches of native vegetation fischer et al 2006 additionally perennial non native vegetation and land uses e g biomass production may provide habitat for different species as long as the production system maintains structural similarities to historically natural habitat areas in the same landscape fahrig et al 2011 wetlands provide invertebrate and amphibian habitat with prairie pothole wetlands being especially important for birds best et al 1995 hunter jr 2005 stream buffers protect sensitive aquatic ecosystems and can provide corridors that connect patches of native vegetation fischer et al 2006 streams and riparian areas provide habitat for diverse and abundant wildlife and land managers can use strips of vegetation in these zones to protect against agricultural runoff and conserve these sensitive ecosystems hunter jr 2005 2 2 1 2 game wildlife game wildlife also ranges from a score of 0 to 10 with 10 indicating a pewi landscape that best maintains game habitat quality based on six additive sub calculations table 4 1 the percent area in conservation forest awarding up to 1 0 point 2 the percent area in grassland awarding up to 1 0 point 3 the percent area in wetland awarding up to 1 0 point 4 the combined percent area in all three natural land uses conservation forest prairie wetland and three additional high diversity land uses conventional forest mixed fruit and vegetable rotational grazing awarding up to 4 0 points 5 the combined percent area in all non corn or soybean land uses awarding up to 1 5 points and 6 the percent of the stream length that is buffered awarding up to 1 5 points rationale supporting the game wildlife calculations includes the following with additional information available in the supplementary material appendix a table s5 incorporating at least some forest into an agricultural landscape is known to support game wildlife including northern bobwhite quail wild turkey and white tailed deer brennan 1999 mcroberts et al 2014 incorporating at least some grassland into an agricultural landscape supports game wildlife including northern bobwhite quail and ring necked pheasant brennan 1999 giudice and ratti 2001 prairie pothole wetlands are important for birds especially water nesting bird species best et al 1995 hunter jr 2005 incorporating at least some wetland into an agricultural landscape supports game wildlife such as mallards drilling et al 2002 and ring necked pheasants giudice and ratti 2001 pewi awards points for percent of stream buffered based on fischer et al 2006 principle that stream buffers protect sensitive aquatic ecosystems and the organisms that reside there including sport fish and that corridors connect patches of native vegetation together the game wildlife score calculations account for the effects of land use type land management and landscape pattern on native species habitat 2 2 2 soil quality pewi presents two indicators of soil quality carbon sequestration and erosion control carbon sequestration in an agricultural context serves as a strategy to improve the long term health and productivity of soil and helps offset atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions fissore et al 2010 lal 2011 agricultural lands have been shown to positively sequester carbon and increase overall carbon storage capacity in response to various types of field management e g use of cover crops and land use change post et al 2004 erosion in excess has documented negative impacts on soil health leading to diminished crop productivity and when deposited in surface waters impairs aquatic stream habitat bennett and wells 2019 idals et al 2017 li et al 2016 as measures of soil quality both carbon sequestration and erosion control are considered supporting services mea 2005 over longer time periods beyond the 3 years modeled in pewi carbon sequestration is also considered a regulating service due to its impact on climate erosion control is also linked with the regulating service of water purification as soil that moves with wind or water can become serious air and water pollutants blanco canqui and lal 2008 turner and rabalais 2003 2 2 2 1 carbon sequestration the carbon sequestration model in pewi presents a measure of potential sequestered carbon in the soil resulting from vegetation conversion of an annual conventional row crop land use to alternative land use or land management practices annual per hectare carbon sequestration rates in pewi range from 0 40 mg with conversion to conservation corn or conservation soybean land use types to 4 69 mg with conversion to the short rotation woody bioenergy land use type table s6 a meta analysis conducted by fissore et al 2010 summarized available empirical data on carbon sequestration rates associated with changes in land use land cover we assigned the summary rates which serve as the primary source for soil carbon sequestration calculations to 13 land use types in pewi for the two remaining pewi land use types alfalfa and switchgrass crops we based calculations on empirical data from iowa al kaisi et al 2005 due to the gap in published empirical data regarding carbon sequestration in mixed fruits and vegetable systems at the time of pewi s development we incorporated expert knowledge suggesting no appreciable increases in carbon sequestration cynthia cambardella usda agricultural research service personal communication 2 2 2 2 erosion control pewi quantifies gross erosion as the amount of soil loss per year in the watershed from rill erosion interrill erosion and ephemeral gully erosion table s7 high gross erosion translates to low erosion control and thus a low index score and vice versa pewi provides estimates for rill and interrill erosion based on the widely used revised universal soil loss equation rulse renard et al 1997 the rusle soil loss calculation takes the product of five factors rainfall erosivity factor r soil erodibility factor k slope length steepness factor ls cover management factor c and practice support factor p renard et al 1997 table s7 parameterization of these factors within pewi can be found in the supplementary material appendix a rusle was calculated on a grid cell basis and then summed to develop a watershed estimate ephemeral gully erosion is soil movement that forms small channels where water flow concentrates with runoff it is considered as an important factor in agricultural landscapes with highly erodible soil little crop residue or crop harvest soil disturbance usda nrcs 1997 because rusle does not consider ephemeral gully erosion we incorporated a calculation using the statewide annual estimates for iowa usda nrcs 1997 annual estimates of 6 7 mg ha 1 for iowa upward by 50 to 10 1 mg ha 1 for conventional annual row crop practices and downward by 50 to 3 4 mg ha 1 for conservation annual row crop practices thomas isenhart iowa state university personal communication because modeling the relationships between ephemeral gully erosion and row cropping practices is an active area of research where the relationships are not yet settled bennett and wells 2019 idals et al 2017 the 50 upward and downward adjustments reflect directionally accurate models based on the generalized effects of conservation practices on ephemeral gully erosion annual gross erosion rates in pewi range from 0 04 137 mg ha 1 2 2 3 water quality pewi provides three indicators of water quality nitrate pollution control phosphorus pollution control and sediment control all are considered regulating services mea 2005 we report all three because of their different impacts on human health and economy and on ecosystem function nitrate pollution is a well known public health problem that negatively affects human health when exceeding a contamination level of 10 mg l 1 in drinking water limits set forth in the national primary drinking water regulations 40 c f r 141 2010 excess nitrate further impairs aquatic ecosystems and disrupts human activity at various scales downstream e g from local fishing streams to large hypoxic zones in gulf regions turner and rabalais 2003 transport of phosphorus from agricultural fields into surface waters has negative consequences where aquatic eutrophication threatens aquatic species and human economy at scales ranging from the local to regional scales jacobson et al 2011 jones and schilling 2011 turner and rabalais 2003 phosphorus and sediment are tightly linked because some forms of phosphorus bind to and move with sediment 2 2 3 1 nitrate pollution control nitrate pollution control within pewi is the indexed inverse of the annual mean nitrate nitrogen n concentration levels in surface water from the outlet of the model watershed where low levels of concentration correspond to high levels of control and vice versa the calculation for watershed annual mean nitrate n concentration averages subwatershed nitrate n concentration weighted by subwatershed area proportional to watershed area the subwatershed nitrate n concentration incorporates information on precipitation the extent of conventional and conservation row crop land uses and the presence of wetland land cover in strategic locations table s8 the equations are based on the schilling and libra 2000 conclusion that watershed size impacts the relationship between the percent of the watershed in row crops and the expected nitrate n concentrations in surface water specific details on module formulation and parameterization can be found in the supplementary material appendix a mean annual nitrate n concentration in pewi ranges from 2 to 29 54 mg l 1 pewi also generates a map for users to evaluate the percent contribution of each subwatershed to the overall watershed nitrate n concentration pewi calculates the percent contribution of each subwatershed as the product of subwatershed nitrate n concentration and the ratio of subwatershed area to watershed area table s8 2 2 3 2 phosphorus pollution control phosphorus pollution control is reported as the indexed inverse of annual in stream phosphorus loading in pewi the calculation incorporates three phosphorus delivery pathways to surface waters phosphorus bound to sediment and moving with erosion dissolved phosphorus moving with surface water in runoff and dissolved phosphorus moving with subsurface water usda nrcs 2004 pollution control is calculated for each grid cell and values are summed to yield watershed annual in stream phosphorus delivery table s9 we used the iowa phosphorus index p index as the bases for our calculations and selected index parameter values based on iowa idals et al 2017 usda nrcs 2004 and expert consultation matthew helmers and thomas isenhart iowa state university personal communication specific information on module formulation and parameterization can be found in the supplementary material appendix a 2 2 3 3 sediment pollution control to calculate sediment pollution control we modified the phosphorus pollution control equation presented in the above section to report it as the indexed inverse of annual in stream sediment delivery specifically we removed two factors from the erosion calculation described above that convert sediment to phosphorus enrichment factor and soil test phosphorus stp erosion factor the enrichment factor adjusts the erosion component to account for soils with higher concentrations of phosphorus and the stp erosion factor converts sediment delivery to sediment bound phosphorus based on estimates of soil phosphorus concentration usda nrcs 2004 three remaining multiplicative factors buffer factor gross erosion and sediment delivery ratio provide the pewi estimate of the total amount of sediment delivery to a stream table s12 2 2 4 yield yield calculations in pewi provide estimates of marketable crop and livestock production for several land use types in the watershed table s13 in terms of ecosystem services crop and livestock production provides primarily food fuel and feed for consumers as well as a source of producer income that benefits individual and community livelihoods all are considered provisioning services mea 2005 the general formula for crop and livestock production is the sum total of production across the watershed for each yield type table s14 production for each grid cell equals the product of three factors grid cell area yield base rate per unit area which is a function of yield type and yield precipitation factor the yield precipitation factor reduces base yields in years of extreme climate conditions for selected yield types table s15 the remainder of this section presents models of yield base rate per unit area for each yield type tables s13 s16 s21 2 2 4 1 corn and soybean yields we derived corn yield estimates for conventional corn zea mays l and conservation corn and soybean yield estimates for conventional soybean and conservation soybean glycine max l merr from ispaid data that models corn yield for each soil mapping unit assuming high level management miller et al 2010a table s16 ispaid derives soybean yield for each soil mapping unit based on a percentage of corn yield equivalent to 29 for model simplification we assumed no yield difference between conventional and conservation row crops for multiple reasons first we assumed that crop yield differences are primarily driven by weather and soils as well as management factors not modeled in pewi i e crop genetics plant spacing fertilization these factors are likely to have a greater impact on yield than the implementation of practices we associated with conservation i e cover crops and no till relatedly the pewi model assumes that conservation practices necessitating the removal of crop production areas are strategically located in areas of the field that are low yielding in conventional crop systems basso et al 2019 brandes et al 2016 2 2 4 2 alfalfa hay and grass hay yields ispaid also provides estimates of alfalfa hay for stands of alfalfa medicago sativa l and grass hay yields for stands of either bromegrass bromus inermis leyss or orchard grass dactylis glomerata l we used these estimates for alfalfa and grass hay land use types table s17 setting minimum base yield rates of 8 07 mg ha 1 for alfalfa and grass hay emily heaton and matthew liebman iowa state university personal communication 2 2 4 3 permanent pasture and rotational grazing yields permanent pasture and rotational grazing land use types both have potential to support a wide range of ruminant livestock we used pewi alfalfa hay and grass hay yield potentials to estimate the number of cattle that each ispaid soil mapping unit supports however note that the pewi model does not allocate production from areas in alfalfa or grass hay land use types to support cattle only production from areas in permanent pasture and rotational grazing land use types yield base rate multiplies forage production alfalfa base rate by a utilization intake ratio percentage of seasonal utilization of forage production to total intake over the grazing season per animal usda nrcs 2008 table s18 instead of reporting animal unit months aum which may be unfamiliar to a broad public audience pewi calculates the number of grazing cattle supported per grazing season we also implicitly assumed that cattle outside of grazing season require additional inputs including feed water and shelter 2 2 4 4 mixed fruit and vegetable yield for mixed fruit and vegetable crops we selected grapes vitis spp green beans phaseolus vulgaris squash cucurbita pepo and strawberries fragaria ananassa as examples of crops that are increasingly popular among iowa fruit and vegetable producers and have high demand in local and regional metropolitan markets bregendahl and enderton 2013 swenson 2011 for green beans squash and strawberries we used yield values published by iowa state university extension with downward adjustments for unfavorable soil textures taber 2008 table s19 due to a lack of grape yield information from iowa we used regionally similar data from new york state that indicated elvira grape yields of 17 6 mg ha 1 delate and friedrich 2004 post and robinson 1995 and applied a soil texture multiplier adjustment we based the multiplier upon relationships between soil types and vegetable crop adaptation taber 2008 2 2 4 5 wood yield pewi estimates wood production for conventional forest and conservation forest land use types based on soil mapping unit yield ranging from the 2007 iowa woodland suitability composite idnr and usda nrcs 2007 table s20 base yield estimates assume selection of tree species suitable for a given location as recommended in the iowa woodland suitability composite to account for potential yield differences due to management practices in conservation forest land use types we applied a 30 reduction to wood production estimates from the iowa woodland suitability composite for conservation forest yield 2 2 4 6 switchgrass yield bioenergy crops are a potential market in the us corn belt heaton et al 2013 for pewi we selected herbaceous perennial crops and short rotation woody crops to represent the potential of the watershed to produce bioenergy for the land use category herbaceous perennial bioenergy switchgrass panicum virgatum l biomass yields range between 4 39 and 6 61 mg ha 1 which we scaled based on a modification to ispaid corn suitability ratings csr emily heaton iowa state university personal communication table s21 switchgrass is the pewi herbaceous perennial bioenergy crop since it is the most developed perennial dedicated energy crop in the region langholtz et al 2016 based on expert consultation for the level of yields in pewi we assumed no added inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization emily heaton iowa state university personal communication 2 2 4 7 short rotation woody biomass yield pewi provides biomass yield estimates for production of short rotation woody bioenergy crops based on 10 year aspen populus alba p grandidentata biomass of 224 mg ha 1 manatt et al 2013 for annual production figures we assumed temporally spaced plantings such that one tenth of an area in production becomes ready for harvest each year thus annual production of biomass equals 22 4 mg ha 1 2 3 feedbacks among modules some ecosystem service indicators within pewi draw upon the same computations e g erosion pollution control and phosphorus pollution control both use gross erosion calculations and thus outcomes are correlated outcomes are also correlated because changes in precipitation or land use actions can jointly affect multiple indicators simultaneously for example rainfall jointly affects crop yields and water quality measures hatfield et al 2009 miller et al 2010b the selection of a greater proportion of perennial versus annual land uses jointly improves habitat soil quality and water quality indicators as supported by the majority of scientific studies asbjornsen et al 2014 ecosystem service indicators are not otherwise interactive i e the output for one indicator is not used in calculating another indicator in the current version of pewi 2 4 model performance and sensitivity because the pewi watershed is a virtual location informed by real world geographic assemblies and is not an actual location we could not perform model calibration and validation using field collected data instead comprehensive testing was carried out to ensure all modules and subcalculations preformed exactly as described in the model each module was broken down into its respective subcalculations for analysis if a subcalculation includes additional formulas the process was repeated until only a single output variable remained all output variables were evaluated to determine the impact of different input variables inputs that tend to have a large impact on outputs include current and previous year precipitation rates and land use especially at strategic wetland locations or along the stream a total of 6131 individual test cases were run using this methodology all errors and inconsistencies found were methodically located and corrected in the pewi software code to represent model performance and sensitivity we created and ran six basic land use scenarios that illustrate the model s learning objectives the results of which we present in the following section the first five basic and contrasting land use scenarios with static and average precipitation conditions in pewi depict model performance these land use scenarios were produced by interactively changing the land use of the whole watershed to all 1 conventional corn 2 conservation corn 3 conservation forest 4 prairie and 5 rotational grazing and then recording ecosystem service outputs precipitation was held constant at the average precipitation of 81 7 cm yr 1 we also assumed average precipitation for the previous year we chose these land uses because of well known qualitative differences e g annual versus perennial vegetation type herbaceous versus woody vegetation type including versus excluding a livestock component that easily correspond to contrasting quantitative differences in pewi s outputs thus highlighting model performance for illustrative purposes we also created and ran a sixth basic land use scenario to depict the impact of varying precipitation conditions on ecosystem service outcomes the land use type for this scenario is conventional corn we converted all of the land use within the watershed to conventional corn and varied the precipitation to seven different precipitation levels coded within pewi 3 results in this section we present ecosystem service results of the model for six different scenarios although more complex scenarios are possible in pewi e g fig 2 in this section we describe results of five basic land use scenarios with average precipitation conditions and one basic land use scenario across varying precipitation conditions to illustrate the ecological lessons that pewi can support through comparisons across even the simplest of user generated scenarios the pewi model calculates annual results across three years producing absolute measurements and indexed scores for 16 ecosystem services as well as outcome maps for two water quality and one soil quality measure the results span between scores of 0 and 100 scaling from lowest to highest level of ecosystem service benefits no single land use receives scores of 100 across all ecosystem services hence users must consider tradeoffs among ecosystem service outputs in the pewi model in the first five scenarios we chose a single land use for each scenario and assumed average precipitation conditions of 81 7 cm in the current year as well as the preceding year the scenarios have the following land uses respectively conservation corn conservation forest conventional corn prairie and rotational grazing fig 4 of the five scenarios with average precipitation levels the scenario comprised of 100 conventional corn performs very well in terms of crop yield but poorest among all land use types in this example in terms of other ecosystem service outcomes conservation corn provides equally high crop yields but performs better on other ecosystem service outcomes than conventional corn by comparison perennial land uses each exhibit additional improvements on the other ecosystem service outcomes over conservation corn with tradeoffs exhibited in terms of preferences between annual commodity crops alternative crops and livestock and non production in the case of prairie the extent of improvement varies by land use as well as by ecosystem service to use biodiversity as an example conventional corn results in a score of zero as it provides the lowest level habitat support of pewi land uses conservation corn provides modest improvements upon biodiversity and rotational grazing produces an even higher biodiversity index score than either conventional corn or conservation corn finally conservation forest and prairie land use types score even higher than rotational grazing yet none of the five land uses scores the maximum of 100 because the model requires restoration of at least some strategically located wetlands to optimize support for habitat see 2 2 1 1 biodiversity in the sixth scenario fig 5 we chose a single land use conventional corn and recorded the current year results for varying levels of precipitation in the current year and preceding year only three ecosystem service outcomes nitrate control sediment control and yield respond to varying levels of precipitation nitrate n concentration not only varies by precipitation level in the current year but also depends on interannual precipitation patterns erosion and yield present no interannual precipitation effects fig 5 see supplementary material appendix a as expected for conventional corn increasing precipitation has negative effects on both erosion control and nitrate control while both extreme dry and wet conditions impact yield quantities these scenarios provide a few important examples of results from the pewi model model calculations constants estimated parameter values and minimum and maximum results and are presented in the supplementary material appendix a 4 discussion 4 1 learning objectives as societies evaluate their present use of ecosystem services and the need to sustain them far into the future educational modeling can provide broad public audiences access to the science needed to address local and global ecosystem challenges that affect human wellbeing costanza et al 2014 long et al 2014 we developed pewi as an educational watershed simulation model that serves as an integrated ecosystem service tradeoffs tool around which users may evaluate how changes to land use affect the types and levels of ecosystem services produced users interact with the environment land use ecosystem service outcomes and the relationships between them in a virtual watershed without other barriers posed by land use decision making in the real world such as time cost and ownership users construct preferences for ecosystem services through an iterative process of learning where evaluation of outcomes informs further modifications to land use configurations to meet user objectives anderson et al 2020 the six basic scenarios presented in the results section provide one possible starting point for that iterative learning process with subsequent modifications enabling users to explore nuanced tradeoffs and co benefits between types and levels of agricultural products and other ecosystem services generated in a watershed we designed pewi to meet multiple learning objectives including improved understanding of basic ecological functions e g levels of habitat provided by diverse perennial land use types versus annual row crops the interplay of ecological functions and conservation practices e g increases in erosion control with conservation corn and soybean versus conventional corn and conventional soybean spatial targeting for ecosystem service production e g multifunctional benefits of buffering streams and restoring strategically placed wetlands the impacts of interannual variability of rainfall on ecosystem services e g decreases in nitrate control in annual row crop systems and land use tradeoffs e g types and levels of agricultural products vary with the levels of ecosystem services anderson et al 2020 of these objectives the six simple scenarios we presented in the results section allow users to begin examining all but one spatial targeting adding increased complexity to these simple scenarios through spatial targeting users might next apply stream buffers or convert areas to wetlands based on pewi s pre supplied maps of strategic wetland locations through such exploration users can answer questions such as which scenario presents better nitrate control a landscape with conventional corn and strategic placement of wetlands or a landscape with 100 conservation corn and no strategic wetlands while designed to be relevant to public audiences in the us corn belt pewi s accessible conceptual framework and general relationships provide lessons that transfer to a variety contexts anderson et al 2020 for example agricultural land uses based on annual crops such as corn and soybeans pose tradeoffs world over between provisioning versus other types of ecosystem services power 2010 in the results section the two annual row crop scenarios conventional corn and conservation corn provide high levels of agricultural yields but with lower levels of other services even with modest improvements to non provisioning services the conservation corn land use still results in much lower levels of biodiversity and game wildlife compared to the prairie scenario fig 4 after evaluating these results pewi users might then experiment with perennial crop and livestock land use types such as hay alfalfa and rotational grazing which provide a more balanced array of ecosystem services but with concomitant declines in the provisioning of agricultural yields at least in the short term asbjornsen et al 2014 li et al 2016 robertson et al 2014 analyzing the results from the rotational grazing scenario for example users can learn how agricultural landscapes composed of land uses that incorporate native species and more structurally complex vegetation better support native biodiversity fahrig et al 2011 fischer et al 2006 hunter jr 2005 while such lessons might seem obvious to ecosystem service scientists they are not necessarily obvious to members of the broader public costanza et al 2014 thompson et al 2016 after exploring the tradeoffs among these and other basic scenarios we expect pewi users to creatively experiment on their own with increasingly complex land use designed with decisions informed by the base layer physical feature maps in pewi alternatively users can complete any of the designed lesson plan activities accessible through the pewi website 4 2 user activity and experience the current version of pewi v3 is a web based application of an original spreadsheet based pewi model schulte et al 2010 in comparison to v1 v2 3 are delivered in a user friendly web based format and offer an expanded watershed area added land use and management options a temporal component varied interannual weather conditions new physiographic maps an expanded set of ecosystem service indicators improved graphics and visualization and enhanced user interaction all ecosystem service indicator modules were also updated to reflect progress in ecosystem service research pewi v2 was initially launched in beta form in october 2014 and was fully released in july 2016 chennault et al 2016 pewi v3 was released in december 2017 web use statistics indicate in 2019 pewi was been used by 2509 unique visitors representing all continents with the greatest usage coming from the us canada china and the uk we have used pewi with a variety of age groups including middle school students high school students college undergraduates graduate students and adult learners and evaluated the learning opportunities it provides according to next generation science standards ngss lead states 2016 and agriculture food and natural resources standards ncae national council for agricultural education 2015 while formal evaluation data are not yet available our experience using pewi in formal classrooms is that the defined learning objectives can be met when use of the model is paired with structured learning materials as provided on pewi s supporting website www nrem iastate edu pewi group activities and discussion and or guidance from instructors in non formal adult learning contexts including workshops with farmers agricultural educators and other agricultural stakeholders we observed pewi users develop increasingly complex scenarios that triggered discussions on topics important to multifunctional landscapes management for example sustainable rates of soil erosion water quality impairments loss of agrotourism income and the potential markets based on perennial crops which otherwise are not readily discussed atwell et al 2009 larsen et al 2019 pewi may inhabit a unique niche in comparison to other ecosystem service models thus far the modeling community has placed the most effort on developing models that can predict the delivery of ecosystem services from spatially explicit land use arrangements in the real world historically most models have focused on just one to a few ecosystem services although more recently effort has been placed on developing modeling platforms such as those reviewed by bagstad et al 2013 that can simultaneously assess whole suites of ecosystem services running these models requires substantial expertise time and user supplied data essential ingredients for accurate prediction but barriers to use beyond scientific and technical communities bagstad et al 2013 developing simpler models to engage public audiences in ecosystem service concepts is a frontier costanza et al 2014 goldstein et al 2012 and existing tools tend to fall into two categories those that associate with real locations through google maps or a similar interface e g aries villa et al 2014 inforest virginia department of forestry 2014 itree hilde and paterson 2014 model my watershed gill et al 2014 smartscape tayyebi et al 2016 and those built for a virtual environment e g pewi chennault et al 2016 pimp your landscape f√ºrst et al 2010 rock your watershed isu 2012 while the simpler models in the real world category offer a higher level of credibility from a decision making standpoint the virtual landscape in pewi can bolster creative exploration of ecological relationships and watershed principles without tying users to personal psychological barriers or social norms about what land uses are supposed to be in particular real world locations pewi also enhances understanding of ecological decision making factors by incorporating a broader suite of ecosystem services and greater flexibility to spatially target changes to land use patterns and conservation practices than many of the simpler real world models other distinctive features of pewi include substantially shorter web based only training requirements bypassing any in person training sessions needed for still complex simpler modeling platforms models built for a virtual environment are better suited for education because they are quicker to learn and more game like in quality hagen 2016 among these pewi offers substantial scientific depth a pleasing display a high level of interactivity and spatially explicit decision making and the greatest number of land use options and ecosystem service indicators hagen 2016 we suggest that pewi s forte is in rapidly facilitating user understanding of general relationships between land use and ecosystem services and that it may provide a gateway to either using models that predict ecosystem service outcomes for real world locations or the outputs from such models in decision making 4 3 future model development we performed extensive literature review and repeatedly consulted subject experts in building pewi s modules yet we perceive substantial opportunity for module refinement moving forward for example parameterization of pewi s nitrogen pollution control module could be improved for the perennial land use types of alfalfa pasture and switchgrass the relationship between these land uses and the water quality impairment of nitrate n pollution is not well understood at a watershed scale or how variability in management including fertilization affects that relationship the schilling and libra 2000 estimate incorporated into pewi only evaluated crops corn and soybean as did the lawlor curve lawlor et al 2008 used in the iowa nutrient reduction strategy idals et al 2017 we used data from unmanaged grasslands to represent the performance of pasture land use types because we could not find more specific data there is also substantial uncertainty associated with pewi s carbon sequestration module because the existing literature is conflicting fissore et al 2010 meta analysis published on carbon sequestration potential in the midwest us found large standard deviations in published carbon sequestration data and subsequent literature review by cambardella et al 2012 pointed to a relatively poor understanding of the mechanisms that determine soc changes in response to land management practices p 52 lack of scientific understanding and uncertainty in model formulation and the selection of parameters presented a challenge in pewi s development and thus provides an opportunity for future refinement both in terms of updating the modules as further knowledge is developed as well as finding ways to represent scientific uncertainty where it exists without diminishing the value of the tool for its intended audience kiili 2005 5 conclusions pewi s niche is as an open source scientifically grounded ecological model for engaging a broad public audience in concepts of land use the environment ecosystem services and tradeoffs in an agricultural context pewi integrates general scientific principles with the best available local data through quantitative models embedded in an appealing interactive platform pewi allows users to evaluate how changes to agricultural land management affect the production of multiple ecosystem services and in time may facilitate the design of land use arrangements that satisfy both individual and societal needs as an open source tool we hope other scientists and programmers will contribute data and code to improve and expand pewi s capacity into the future credit author

24806,as the largest carbon emission country china is struggling with the carbon outsourcing problem at inter provincial and international scale identifying the role of each provincial region is helpful for mitigation adaptation policy by local government based on the multi scale input output model msio the characteristics of subnational carbon flow pattern embodied in domestic and international trade for china in 2010 are analyzed in a global economy system results show that the net export of emissions for the whole of china was 903 4 mtco2e due to regional heterogeneity in economic development and natural resource endowments different subnational regions present multi carbon flow patterns categorized into resource supplier where outflow is greater than inflow such as inner mongolia self sufficient type where local consumption ratio is greater than 50 such as qinghai consumer where inflow is greater than outflow such as beijing as well as trade hub center and final producer where both inflow and outflow are large such as jiangsu this study lays a foundation for emission reduction responsibility division and regional mitigation cooperation at subnational scale targeted policies implications at subnational scale are recommended for each type accordingly keywords msio subnational scale carbon emissions mitigation policy 1 introduction as the world s largest co2 emitter china is challenging multifaceted pressure from international community on the one hand china has been observed as carbon leak destination for many countries wiebe et al 2012a b shi et al 2017 meng et al 2017 tian et al 2018 although the trend has been curbed the absolute amount of carbon emission driven by international export remains huge taking up more than 23 of production based carbon emission in 2007 liu et al 2016 on the other hand after achieving the 40 45 carbon intensity cutting promise in 2018 which is 3 years earlier than the original promise china has further shown its strong determination to mitigate climate change by promising the world to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions intensity by 60 65 from 2005 by 2030 shao et al 2018 the inhomogeneity of subnational regions aggravated the stringent control of carbon emission in provincial level and led to carbon imbalance and outsource inside china jiang et al 2015 feng et al 2013 shao et al 2018 although china is usually treated as an ensemble in climate change research there are pronounced differences in economic development technology and levels of consumption and pollution between the well developed coastal provinces and the less developed central and western provinces according to the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 each subnational region was allocated mandatory energy saving and carbon emission mitigation targets which was slightly higher than that in the previous plans shao et al 2018 the achievement degree of the plan will be assessed by the central government as an important performance evaluation indicator zhang 2015 causing more emission reduction pressures to local government due to more frequent carbon imbalance and outsource approximately 60 of china s production based carbon emissions were driven by inter provincial trade in 2007 zhong et al 2015 large amounts of co2 are emitted in poorer western regions to support consumption and exports in the richer eastern regions feng et al 2013 su and ang 2014 weitzel and ma 2014 therefore characteristics of subnational carbon flow patterns for different type of province are urgently needed to analyzed in order to formulate the targeted mitigation policy accordingly determining the roles of provincial regions in the embodied carbon emission system needs the calculation production based and consumption based carbon emissions of provincial regions and the analysis of interactions between regions domestic and international both production based accounting pba and consumption based accounting cba carbon emissions could be accounted by environmentally extended input output eeio model pan et al 2018 within which the inter industrial linkages within a national or subnational economic system can be described kitzes 2013 environmental extended multi regional input output ee mrio analysis can be used for tracing both the international and inter provincial carbon flows as well as identifying reduction responsibility and quotas properly within china both from production based and consumption based perspectives feng et al 2013 tukker and dietzenbacher 2013 for example wang et al 2018 investigated the carbon footprint and embodied co2 transfer in 30 provinces of china their results indicated that china s carbon footprint grew from 5230 mt to 6922 mt in 2007 2010 the provincial regions with relative large footprints and huge per capita footprints were mainly located in eastern developed regions along the coast and several highly populated ones this study reviewed previous researches on carbon flow analysis in china at different scales using multi regional input output mrio as listed in table 1 traditional chinese mrio make the calculation of the carbon footprint associated with domestic supply chains and interprovincial trading possible but fail to distinguish the range of policies employed to produce international exports and imports multi scale input output msio model which links chinese mrio to the world economy is beneficial to clarify the provincial region based carbon flow paths within a trade network both domestic and cross border ones liu et al 2015a b bachmann et al 2015 it can providing a more comprehensive analysis of regional interdependencies at multi scales economy mi et al 2017 linked a chinese mrio table to a global mrio model based on gtap database showing that less economically developed regions shifted from being net emission exporters to being net emission importers further international emission trade destinations partially shifted from developed countries to developing countries feng et al 2013 tracked co2 emissions embodied in products traded among chinese provinces and internationally and found 57 of china s emissions are related to goods that are consumed outside of the province where they are produced meng et al 2018 employed a global environmentally extended multi scale input output model to explore spatial distribution of beijing s carbon flows in the local domestic regions and the worldwide economies their research showed that beijing is typically a net importer of carbon flow domestic regions support nearly 96 56 of the net carbon inflows driven by beijing s final demand and are located at the bottom of the global production supply chain similar studies with msio model were also summarized in table 1 according to the table 1 some research already focused on the carbon imbalance problem inside the country and described the exact embodied carbon flow form origin to destination however few studies concentrate on the embodied carbon flow feature of each province cities and make a specific classification which is helpful for the mitigation responsibility division from provincial level this paper aim to analyzing embodied carbon flow pattern of provincial region considering the inter provincial interaction and embodied carbon trade between provincial region and foreign region we will identify the role of different provincial regions in the current hidden carbon flow system different provinces will be classified according to their production based carbon emissions consumption carbon emissions the drivers and destinations of trade embodied carbon emissions different suggestions are offered for different roles the paper is organized as follows 1 introduction to the calculating methodology and data source 2 calculated and cataloged the embodied carbon emissions pattern of 30 chinese provinces and cities 3 drawing conclusions and policy implications based on results 2 method 2 1 environmentally extended input output analysis the basic linear equation of the mrio model is 1 x i a 1 y x x 1 x 2 x 3 x m a a 11 a 12 a 13 a 1 m a 21 a 22 a 23 a 2 m a 31 a m 1 a 32 a m 2 a 33 a 3 m a m 3 a m m y y 11 y 12 y 13 y 1 m y 21 y 22 y 23 y 2 m y 31 y m 1 y 32 y m 2 y 33 y 3 m y m 3 y m m where x x i s is the vector of total output and x i s is the total output of sector i in region s i is the identity matrix and i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix the technical coefficient submatrix a rs a ij rs is given by a ij rs z ij rs x j s in which z ij rs represents the inter sectoral monetary flows from sector i in region r to sector j in region s and x j s is the total output of sector j in region s y rs y i rs is the final demand matrix and y i rs is the final demand of region s for the goods of sector i from region r this economic input output equation is extended by incorporating the carbon satellite account e identified as the carbon emissions of each sector to calculate the co2 emissions embodied in goods and services carbon emissions can be mathematically expressed as 2 c e i a 1 y where c is the total emissions embodied in goods and services used for final demand e e x 1 x0001 is the sectoral direct carbon emission intensity as the amount of impact caused by one unit of total output 2 2 environmental extended multi scale input output model the core of the developed extended multi scale input output model ee msio model is an input and output three tier structure which allows the opening the box of interaction between countries between domestic provincial regions and other countries and between domestic provincial regions as china is one of the 41 regions in the world input output database wiod the chinese input output table in the wiod is disaggregated into 30 province level tables based on the input output tables within the chinese mrio model this model consists of 30 provinces including four municipalities except tibet and taiwan the wiod s international import and export matrices for china were also disaggregated and allocated to the 30 provinces based on provincial exports and imports in the chinese mrio table international exports for each sector in each province were distributed among importing sectors in foreign countries at the same ratio as china s total exports the detailed equation follows 3 t i j p s t i j c s s j t i j c s s j t i j p s where t i j p s is the export monetary flow from the ith sector in region p to the jth sector in region s in the wiod table t i j c s is the total export monetary flow from china to region s in the wiod table the same formula can also be used to evaluate t i j s p in this way two already existing and possibly conflicting mrio datasets referred to different spatial scales inter provincial and international at start are merged into one multi scale model in particular the mrio data of chinese provinces in 2010 data source from institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences liu et al 2014 which has been used in many published researches like shao et al 2018 is merged with the year 2010 world input output table wiot which is based on the wiod we further merge the other regions in wiod into five areas in the following result part see appendix 1 for details this computation is performed following the same method developed in our previous studies meng et al 2018 nawab et al 2019a b meng et al 2017 2 3 data source in this study the environmental satellite account includes direct carbon emissions of 70 regions from domestic provincial regions nations around the world the carbon emission data for the 40 wiod global regions are from wiod database for 30 subnational regions within china carbon emissions are not officially published annually thus detailed data processing and sources for carbon emissions needed to be defined the carbon emission inventories considered energy use and non energy use only including agriculture production in the form of carbon dioxide equivalents co2e including carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o based on the kyoto protocol it reports them together as carbon dioxide equivalents co2e by global warming potentials gwps over a 100 year period at the ratio of 1 21 310 for co2 ch4 n2o carbon emissions of 30 chinese provincial areas were calculated based on the ipcc approach the specific emission inventory building and calculation process and detailed data sources of this study can refer to our previous research meng et al 2018 in addition the gdp data of the provinces used in this paper are derived from china statistical yearbook 2011 the detailed data source are provided in table 2 3 results 3 1 flow analysis overall china exported 1655 46 mtco2e in 2010 based on production based accounting perspective but only imported 752 06 mtco2e based on consumption based accounting perspective almost half of the exported embodied carbon therefore china played the role of a net exporter for almost all the regions in the world except for brazil russian and taiwan a province of china the detailed sources and destinations for the carbon inflow and outflow in each subnational region is shown in fig 1 from a production based perspective hebei shandong shanxi henan inner mongolia are the top five typical producer provinces form fig 1 it shows that north area central coast area and north american free trade agreement nafta are the largest destinations of carbon outflows in hebei he shandong s international exports embodied carbon accounted for 37 15 of total production based carbon emissions which is greater than that of hebei north and northeast are the main destinations of carbon outflows in inner mongolia especially jilin receiving the largest flows with very light flows going to international regions from the consumption based perspective hebei shandong jilin jiangsu zhejiang and guangdong are identified as typical consumer provinces for hebei and shandong they have similar carbon inflows pattern intensively from central and north area especially from shanxi province sx while shandong carbon inflow came from international regions is 2 61 times than that of hebei jilin s carbon inflow sources are concentrated in the north and northeast areas especially inner mongolia owns the largest carbon outflow to jilin while jiangsu and zhejiang provinces carbon inflows are jointly originating from north and the central area southwest area is the largest carbon inflow source for guangdong province the typical routes with intensive carbon flows between subnational regions can be identified in fig 1 including north area north area north area central coast area northeast area northeast area central area north area central area central coast area and northwest area north these areas are geographically close and have large differences in demographic characteristics from the perspective of international import and export the north central coast and southern coast areas are the main international embodied carbon outflow source and also the main international embodied carbon inflow destination from the specific destination and source the ratio between the export volume of different countries there is no big difference among different provincial regions for the net carbon transfer between china s provincial regions beijing shanghai tianjin zhejiang jilin guangdong jiangxi shaanxi guangxi qinghai these ten provinces are net carbon import areas see fig 2 headed by the three municipalities directly under the central government beijing accounted for 24 34 of all net import cities with shanghai and tianjin accounting for 21 60 and 14 16 respectively accounting for 60 10 of the total among the remaining 20 net carbon producing provinces inner mongolia is the largest net outflow province with a net outflow value accounting for 17 18 of all net outflow provinces followed by hebei and shanxi the two provinces around beijing and tianjin accounted for 14 92 and 12 59 of the net outflow respectively and assumed the role of carbon supplier in the municipality the top five routes of net transfer are inner mongolia jilin shanxi shandong hebei zhejiang inner mongolia shandong and hebei jiangsu 3 2 feature analysis the structural pattern of embodied carbon in different provinces is represented in fig 3 from the perspective of the total amount of production based accounting pba carbon the top five provinces are shandong hebei jiangsu henan and inner mongolia the sum of pba carbon in these five provinces constitutes the 32 20 of all pba carbon emissions in 30 provinces the top five provinces have some common characteristics reflected in population and industry structure the population of the five provinces accounts for 27 24 of the total population of mainland china secondly shandong hebei henan and inner mongolia are all important industrial bases in china the proportion of industrial added value in gdp of these four provinces was around 50 in 2010 in 2010 the total gdp of the five provinces accounted for 32 88 of mainland china s total gdp this ratio is equal to the proportion of carbon emissions which indicates that economic development still depended on carbon emissions to some extent the consumption based accounting cba carbon of most provinces is smaller than pba carbon the top five provinces with embodied carbon are shandong guangdong jiangsu hebei and henan the sum of consumption carbon emissions in these five provinces accounted for 54 77 of total consumption carbon emissions based on the pba and cba order we can see the sequence of provinces is almost corresponded some provinces have a different position based on pba and cba separately guangdong ranked sixth in terms of production and its ranking rose to second place from the perspective of consumption the total gdp of guangdong accounted for 11 14 of the whole country s gdp in 2010 its economic structure was dominated by high tech industries with low carbon intensity in 2010 the tertiary industry accounted for 45 40 of gdp the unit gdp carbon intensity of guangdong was 1 15 tco2e 104 yuan in contrary inner mongolia ranked fifth in terms of production and became the ninth in terms of consumption compared with guangdong inner mongolia s unit gdp carbon emission intensity is 1 61 tco2e 10 000 yuan 40 larger than guangdong province in the fig 3 b 30 provinces can be divided into four types based on two lines x 1 0 and y 1 0 they are provinces whose total export was larger than local consumption but total import was smaller than local consumption a type 6 provinces total export was larger than local consumption and total import was also larger than local consumption b type 9 provinces total export was smaller than local consumption and total import was also smaller than local consumption c type 13 provinces total export was smaller than local consumption but total import was larger than local consumption d type 2 provinces the provinces with a large export type a and b bore the role of important carbon suppliers in the supply chain the amount of exported embodied carbon exceeded the amount of local consumption the average proportion of embodied carbon from exports is 57 82 for a type the value of imports is relatively small which shows that most of the a type areas are resource exporting areas 78 of the b type provinces are located in coastal areas these provinces have high import embodied carbon and high export embodied carbon they were important trade nodes and the final processor of intermediate products such as guangdong jiangsu shanghai and tianjin most of the c type provinces are located in inland areas qinghai gansu hunan and xinjiang are typical ones their local consumption accounts for more than 50 of its production perspective based carbon finally for d type provinces there are only two nodes jiangxi and beijing the abscissa value of jiangxi is 1 042 which could be classified as c almost therefore the only node that actually shows high import and low export characteristics is beijing in fact beijing s ordinate is 0 96 very close to 1 its ratio of imported implied carbon to local consumption embodied carbon is as high as 3 17 according to the fig 3 c and fig 3 d more detailed patterns are identified based on the reliance on domestic or international embodied carbon comparing the third and fourth plots especially the relative position difference of the auxiliary y x rays the proportion of international exports is much larger than the proportion of international imports for most provinces cities in mainland china which is consistent with the conclusion of the first part fig 3 c can be used to analyze the difference in demand between domestic and international imports by different consumers provinces and regions with high import ratios act as a consumer in the supply chain considering the typical municipalities except for chongqing did not show the consumer characteristics for the source of embodied carbon beijing shanghai and tianjin rely more on domestic imports compared to foreign imports domestic imports of embodied carbon emissions accounted for 64 49 of their own consumption of carbon emissions fig 3 d shows the difference in supply capacity of different producers for the domestic and international markets firstly guangdong shanghai zhejiang jiangsu and other regions are more prominent among all the foreign exporters their proportion of international exports is in the leading position in mainland china having an average proportion of international exports of their own pba carbon of 29 48 in addition the proportion of international exports in guangdong zhejiang and fujian is higher than their proportion of domestic exports located on the left side of the x y reference line for the domestic export oriented regions inner mongolia hebei and other provinces are in a leading position in domestic exports with an average domestic exports accounting for 50 68 as analyzed in the previous section inner mongolia and hebei are major industrial provinces and the geographical locations of the two province is close to beijing and tianjin two regions with high domestic demand 3 3 intensity analysis china s trade volume is characterized by carbon intensive exports looking to fig 4 for china the intensity of carbon embodied in international exports was 1 48 tco2e 104 yuan i e 2 times the intensity of carbon embodied in international imports the figure indicated that the trend when degree of economic development is lower the intensity of implied carbon in both international exports and domestic exports is higher while there is no obvious correlation between the embodied carbon intensity of international imports and the level of economic development even beijing is similar to the international imports embodied carbon intensity of sichuan whose gdp per capita is much lower it proves that there is no significant difference in the choice of internationally imported goods between provinces cities domestic import embodied carbon varies like a normal distribution with economic development changes the regions with the highest and lowest levels of economic development have lower domestic export embodied carbon while those at the middle upper or middle lower levels have higher domestic import embodied carbon intensity it may be because provinces cities with higher levels of economic development may choose more international imports such as cities such as beijing and shanghai on high embodied carbon density products while low economy regions rely more on their own resource development gansu yunnan guizhou etc intensity analysis helps to locate the location of a specific province city in the embodied carbon trade network accurately taking beijing as an example it is located at the bottom of the global production supply chain transferring the embodied carbon flow to the origin by domestic and international imports such a trade structure is beneficial to beijing in terms of carbon emissions reduction see fig 4 beijing s per capita gdp ranked second in china the carbon flow embodied in domestic imported products was 1 56 tco2e 104 yuan i e four times the intensity of carbon embodied in domestic exports in parallel carbon flow embodied in international imports was 0 80 tco2e 104 yuan i e 1 5 times the intensity of the carbon flow embodied in international exports beijing mainly exports low carbon products with high values to developed countries and imports carbon intensive products from domestic regions in china 4 discussion and policy implication 4 1 effective mitigation measure due to different roles the emission reduction policies in china are mainly production based methods aimed at reducing emission intensity such as carbon capture technology for thermal power plants from the perspective of consumption based accounting it is necessary to focus on the demand side such as affecting consumer behavior advocating a lower carbon lifestyle and so on based on the results of our research in addition to the above two measures provinces cities that play different roles in the trade flows of carbon emissions should adopt different and more targeted emission reduction measures in the 3 2 results section we divided the provinces into abcd 4 categories by comparing the total consumption of imports and exports for a type provinces whose total export was larger than local consumption but total import was smaller than local consumption it is more often a producer of intermediate materials than a producer of the final product and its targeted emission reduction measures are on the production side many provinces in the a type have low urbanization rates and should pay attention on the relatively high rural area for such provinces the agricultural sector s emissions are more dispersed than the industrial sector and was often neglected which needs more socioeconomic measure to solve chen et al 2018 for the b type provinces it is a typical final production with huge input and huge output measures to improve productivity should be adopted such as improving the efficiency of the use of metals and cement raw materials as well as develop sustainable power sector cheng et al 2019 in enterprises such as jiangsu zhejiang and guangdong further to reduce the emission drivers for a type provinces achieving the goal of total emission reducing for typical end customer provinces demand side measures can be taken such as promoting a lifestyle to reduce emissions in beijing and shanghai for provinces cities that do not show dependence on the outside world in the entire embodied carbon trade network they should pay attention to multiple aspects focusing on both end of life reductions and on the demand side 4 2 allocation of emission responsibilities in practice trade embodied carbon can be divided into two parts one part represents the carbon dioxide emissions generated by the region s own final consumption this part can be considered as the self emission reduction responsibility of the target area the other part is the inter provincial trade embodied carbon which represents the spillover effect of carbon dioxide emissions due to final consumption in other regions the carbon emissions of the provinces cities where the raw materials are produced are determined by the production needs of the provinces that are to be transferred in the next step and the emissions of such provinces are further driven by the demand of the provinces as the final consumers from the consumer s point of view not only the final consumer but also the final producer of the intermediate product should bear some responsibility in other studies this is often overlooked in our research we can better distinguish the responsibilities of the two countries by defining the embodied carbon trade relationship between the provinces which helps to divide the responsibility better specifically since local consumption carbon accounts for the majority of regional co2 emissions this indicator can be used as a baseline for allocating regional carbon credits inter provincial trade embodied carbon can be used as a factor in adjusting the responsibility of the province cities for its consumer final producer intermediate producer the development of regional integration has provided great possibilities for accounting from the different perspective we have noticed that china is advancing the regional coordinated development such as the construction of the beijing tianjin hebei guangdong hong kong macao bay areas this integrated development provides a better platform for collaboration and technology transfer between regions our research will serve the process of integrated development 5 conclusion based on the multi scale and multi regional input output model we used the wiod database to establish connections with china s inter provincial multi regional input output data and analyzed the characteristics of china s trade embodied carbon flows in 2010 at a subnational scale 1 research shows that for china as a whole the net export of emissions in 2010 was 903 4 mtco2e the final destinations of embodied carbon transfer are mainly concentrated in developed countries in north america and the european union for different subnational regions the destinations of embodied carbon outflows are largely related to their geographical locations the north area central coast area and southern coast area are where international embodied carbon main outflow source 2 due to the differences in economic development and natural resource endowments different provinces play different roles in the process of carbon transfer by analyzing the carbon emission patterns of all provinces they can be categorized into resource supplier self sufficient type consumer as well as trade center and final producer where both inflow and outflow are large if a province s exports are further differentiated in terms of final destination domestic or international the proportion of international exports in coastal areas is dominant whereas inland areas with rich resources mainly supply embodied carbon domestically within china municipalities rely more on domestic imports than on international imports compared to coastal provinces 3 from the perspective of an intensity analysis the intensity of internationally exported embodied carbon is 1 48 tco2e 104 yuan which is twice the intensity of internationally imported carbon there is a trend that when degree of economic development is lower the intensity of implied carbon in both international exports and domestic exports is higher our research provides different types of emission reduction policy choices for different role provinces cities and also sorts out the division of emission reduction responsibilities in the future under the policy of coordinated regional development the transfer of funds and technology between provinces will be more feasible the msio based method has certain limitations on the one hand we rely on the wiod database the comparability and resolution of our results largely depend on the construction of international input output database in addition if there are input output table data between cities within a province this model can be further extended to the city provincial region national scale using the same method the imperfection of basic data is still a big obstacle for modeling credit authorship contribution statement junmei hu investigation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing gengyuan liu conceptualization

24806,as the largest carbon emission country china is struggling with the carbon outsourcing problem at inter provincial and international scale identifying the role of each provincial region is helpful for mitigation adaptation policy by local government based on the multi scale input output model msio the characteristics of subnational carbon flow pattern embodied in domestic and international trade for china in 2010 are analyzed in a global economy system results show that the net export of emissions for the whole of china was 903 4 mtco2e due to regional heterogeneity in economic development and natural resource endowments different subnational regions present multi carbon flow patterns categorized into resource supplier where outflow is greater than inflow such as inner mongolia self sufficient type where local consumption ratio is greater than 50 such as qinghai consumer where inflow is greater than outflow such as beijing as well as trade hub center and final producer where both inflow and outflow are large such as jiangsu this study lays a foundation for emission reduction responsibility division and regional mitigation cooperation at subnational scale targeted policies implications at subnational scale are recommended for each type accordingly keywords msio subnational scale carbon emissions mitigation policy 1 introduction as the world s largest co2 emitter china is challenging multifaceted pressure from international community on the one hand china has been observed as carbon leak destination for many countries wiebe et al 2012a b shi et al 2017 meng et al 2017 tian et al 2018 although the trend has been curbed the absolute amount of carbon emission driven by international export remains huge taking up more than 23 of production based carbon emission in 2007 liu et al 2016 on the other hand after achieving the 40 45 carbon intensity cutting promise in 2018 which is 3 years earlier than the original promise china has further shown its strong determination to mitigate climate change by promising the world to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions intensity by 60 65 from 2005 by 2030 shao et al 2018 the inhomogeneity of subnational regions aggravated the stringent control of carbon emission in provincial level and led to carbon imbalance and outsource inside china jiang et al 2015 feng et al 2013 shao et al 2018 although china is usually treated as an ensemble in climate change research there are pronounced differences in economic development technology and levels of consumption and pollution between the well developed coastal provinces and the less developed central and western provinces according to the 13th five year plan 2015 2020 each subnational region was allocated mandatory energy saving and carbon emission mitigation targets which was slightly higher than that in the previous plans shao et al 2018 the achievement degree of the plan will be assessed by the central government as an important performance evaluation indicator zhang 2015 causing more emission reduction pressures to local government due to more frequent carbon imbalance and outsource approximately 60 of china s production based carbon emissions were driven by inter provincial trade in 2007 zhong et al 2015 large amounts of co2 are emitted in poorer western regions to support consumption and exports in the richer eastern regions feng et al 2013 su and ang 2014 weitzel and ma 2014 therefore characteristics of subnational carbon flow patterns for different type of province are urgently needed to analyzed in order to formulate the targeted mitigation policy accordingly determining the roles of provincial regions in the embodied carbon emission system needs the calculation production based and consumption based carbon emissions of provincial regions and the analysis of interactions between regions domestic and international both production based accounting pba and consumption based accounting cba carbon emissions could be accounted by environmentally extended input output eeio model pan et al 2018 within which the inter industrial linkages within a national or subnational economic system can be described kitzes 2013 environmental extended multi regional input output ee mrio analysis can be used for tracing both the international and inter provincial carbon flows as well as identifying reduction responsibility and quotas properly within china both from production based and consumption based perspectives feng et al 2013 tukker and dietzenbacher 2013 for example wang et al 2018 investigated the carbon footprint and embodied co2 transfer in 30 provinces of china their results indicated that china s carbon footprint grew from 5230 mt to 6922 mt in 2007 2010 the provincial regions with relative large footprints and huge per capita footprints were mainly located in eastern developed regions along the coast and several highly populated ones this study reviewed previous researches on carbon flow analysis in china at different scales using multi regional input output mrio as listed in table 1 traditional chinese mrio make the calculation of the carbon footprint associated with domestic supply chains and interprovincial trading possible but fail to distinguish the range of policies employed to produce international exports and imports multi scale input output msio model which links chinese mrio to the world economy is beneficial to clarify the provincial region based carbon flow paths within a trade network both domestic and cross border ones liu et al 2015a b bachmann et al 2015 it can providing a more comprehensive analysis of regional interdependencies at multi scales economy mi et al 2017 linked a chinese mrio table to a global mrio model based on gtap database showing that less economically developed regions shifted from being net emission exporters to being net emission importers further international emission trade destinations partially shifted from developed countries to developing countries feng et al 2013 tracked co2 emissions embodied in products traded among chinese provinces and internationally and found 57 of china s emissions are related to goods that are consumed outside of the province where they are produced meng et al 2018 employed a global environmentally extended multi scale input output model to explore spatial distribution of beijing s carbon flows in the local domestic regions and the worldwide economies their research showed that beijing is typically a net importer of carbon flow domestic regions support nearly 96 56 of the net carbon inflows driven by beijing s final demand and are located at the bottom of the global production supply chain similar studies with msio model were also summarized in table 1 according to the table 1 some research already focused on the carbon imbalance problem inside the country and described the exact embodied carbon flow form origin to destination however few studies concentrate on the embodied carbon flow feature of each province cities and make a specific classification which is helpful for the mitigation responsibility division from provincial level this paper aim to analyzing embodied carbon flow pattern of provincial region considering the inter provincial interaction and embodied carbon trade between provincial region and foreign region we will identify the role of different provincial regions in the current hidden carbon flow system different provinces will be classified according to their production based carbon emissions consumption carbon emissions the drivers and destinations of trade embodied carbon emissions different suggestions are offered for different roles the paper is organized as follows 1 introduction to the calculating methodology and data source 2 calculated and cataloged the embodied carbon emissions pattern of 30 chinese provinces and cities 3 drawing conclusions and policy implications based on results 2 method 2 1 environmentally extended input output analysis the basic linear equation of the mrio model is 1 x i a 1 y x x 1 x 2 x 3 x m a a 11 a 12 a 13 a 1 m a 21 a 22 a 23 a 2 m a 31 a m 1 a 32 a m 2 a 33 a 3 m a m 3 a m m y y 11 y 12 y 13 y 1 m y 21 y 22 y 23 y 2 m y 31 y m 1 y 32 y m 2 y 33 y 3 m y m 3 y m m where x x i s is the vector of total output and x i s is the total output of sector i in region s i is the identity matrix and i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix the technical coefficient submatrix a rs a ij rs is given by a ij rs z ij rs x j s in which z ij rs represents the inter sectoral monetary flows from sector i in region r to sector j in region s and x j s is the total output of sector j in region s y rs y i rs is the final demand matrix and y i rs is the final demand of region s for the goods of sector i from region r this economic input output equation is extended by incorporating the carbon satellite account e identified as the carbon emissions of each sector to calculate the co2 emissions embodied in goods and services carbon emissions can be mathematically expressed as 2 c e i a 1 y where c is the total emissions embodied in goods and services used for final demand e e x 1 x0001 is the sectoral direct carbon emission intensity as the amount of impact caused by one unit of total output 2 2 environmental extended multi scale input output model the core of the developed extended multi scale input output model ee msio model is an input and output three tier structure which allows the opening the box of interaction between countries between domestic provincial regions and other countries and between domestic provincial regions as china is one of the 41 regions in the world input output database wiod the chinese input output table in the wiod is disaggregated into 30 province level tables based on the input output tables within the chinese mrio model this model consists of 30 provinces including four municipalities except tibet and taiwan the wiod s international import and export matrices for china were also disaggregated and allocated to the 30 provinces based on provincial exports and imports in the chinese mrio table international exports for each sector in each province were distributed among importing sectors in foreign countries at the same ratio as china s total exports the detailed equation follows 3 t i j p s t i j c s s j t i j c s s j t i j p s where t i j p s is the export monetary flow from the ith sector in region p to the jth sector in region s in the wiod table t i j c s is the total export monetary flow from china to region s in the wiod table the same formula can also be used to evaluate t i j s p in this way two already existing and possibly conflicting mrio datasets referred to different spatial scales inter provincial and international at start are merged into one multi scale model in particular the mrio data of chinese provinces in 2010 data source from institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences liu et al 2014 which has been used in many published researches like shao et al 2018 is merged with the year 2010 world input output table wiot which is based on the wiod we further merge the other regions in wiod into five areas in the following result part see appendix 1 for details this computation is performed following the same method developed in our previous studies meng et al 2018 nawab et al 2019a b meng et al 2017 2 3 data source in this study the environmental satellite account includes direct carbon emissions of 70 regions from domestic provincial regions nations around the world the carbon emission data for the 40 wiod global regions are from wiod database for 30 subnational regions within china carbon emissions are not officially published annually thus detailed data processing and sources for carbon emissions needed to be defined the carbon emission inventories considered energy use and non energy use only including agriculture production in the form of carbon dioxide equivalents co2e including carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o based on the kyoto protocol it reports them together as carbon dioxide equivalents co2e by global warming potentials gwps over a 100 year period at the ratio of 1 21 310 for co2 ch4 n2o carbon emissions of 30 chinese provincial areas were calculated based on the ipcc approach the specific emission inventory building and calculation process and detailed data sources of this study can refer to our previous research meng et al 2018 in addition the gdp data of the provinces used in this paper are derived from china statistical yearbook 2011 the detailed data source are provided in table 2 3 results 3 1 flow analysis overall china exported 1655 46 mtco2e in 2010 based on production based accounting perspective but only imported 752 06 mtco2e based on consumption based accounting perspective almost half of the exported embodied carbon therefore china played the role of a net exporter for almost all the regions in the world except for brazil russian and taiwan a province of china the detailed sources and destinations for the carbon inflow and outflow in each subnational region is shown in fig 1 from a production based perspective hebei shandong shanxi henan inner mongolia are the top five typical producer provinces form fig 1 it shows that north area central coast area and north american free trade agreement nafta are the largest destinations of carbon outflows in hebei he shandong s international exports embodied carbon accounted for 37 15 of total production based carbon emissions which is greater than that of hebei north and northeast are the main destinations of carbon outflows in inner mongolia especially jilin receiving the largest flows with very light flows going to international regions from the consumption based perspective hebei shandong jilin jiangsu zhejiang and guangdong are identified as typical consumer provinces for hebei and shandong they have similar carbon inflows pattern intensively from central and north area especially from shanxi province sx while shandong carbon inflow came from international regions is 2 61 times than that of hebei jilin s carbon inflow sources are concentrated in the north and northeast areas especially inner mongolia owns the largest carbon outflow to jilin while jiangsu and zhejiang provinces carbon inflows are jointly originating from north and the central area southwest area is the largest carbon inflow source for guangdong province the typical routes with intensive carbon flows between subnational regions can be identified in fig 1 including north area north area north area central coast area northeast area northeast area central area north area central area central coast area and northwest area north these areas are geographically close and have large differences in demographic characteristics from the perspective of international import and export the north central coast and southern coast areas are the main international embodied carbon outflow source and also the main international embodied carbon inflow destination from the specific destination and source the ratio between the export volume of different countries there is no big difference among different provincial regions for the net carbon transfer between china s provincial regions beijing shanghai tianjin zhejiang jilin guangdong jiangxi shaanxi guangxi qinghai these ten provinces are net carbon import areas see fig 2 headed by the three municipalities directly under the central government beijing accounted for 24 34 of all net import cities with shanghai and tianjin accounting for 21 60 and 14 16 respectively accounting for 60 10 of the total among the remaining 20 net carbon producing provinces inner mongolia is the largest net outflow province with a net outflow value accounting for 17 18 of all net outflow provinces followed by hebei and shanxi the two provinces around beijing and tianjin accounted for 14 92 and 12 59 of the net outflow respectively and assumed the role of carbon supplier in the municipality the top five routes of net transfer are inner mongolia jilin shanxi shandong hebei zhejiang inner mongolia shandong and hebei jiangsu 3 2 feature analysis the structural pattern of embodied carbon in different provinces is represented in fig 3 from the perspective of the total amount of production based accounting pba carbon the top five provinces are shandong hebei jiangsu henan and inner mongolia the sum of pba carbon in these five provinces constitutes the 32 20 of all pba carbon emissions in 30 provinces the top five provinces have some common characteristics reflected in population and industry structure the population of the five provinces accounts for 27 24 of the total population of mainland china secondly shandong hebei henan and inner mongolia are all important industrial bases in china the proportion of industrial added value in gdp of these four provinces was around 50 in 2010 in 2010 the total gdp of the five provinces accounted for 32 88 of mainland china s total gdp this ratio is equal to the proportion of carbon emissions which indicates that economic development still depended on carbon emissions to some extent the consumption based accounting cba carbon of most provinces is smaller than pba carbon the top five provinces with embodied carbon are shandong guangdong jiangsu hebei and henan the sum of consumption carbon emissions in these five provinces accounted for 54 77 of total consumption carbon emissions based on the pba and cba order we can see the sequence of provinces is almost corresponded some provinces have a different position based on pba and cba separately guangdong ranked sixth in terms of production and its ranking rose to second place from the perspective of consumption the total gdp of guangdong accounted for 11 14 of the whole country s gdp in 2010 its economic structure was dominated by high tech industries with low carbon intensity in 2010 the tertiary industry accounted for 45 40 of gdp the unit gdp carbon intensity of guangdong was 1 15 tco2e 104 yuan in contrary inner mongolia ranked fifth in terms of production and became the ninth in terms of consumption compared with guangdong inner mongolia s unit gdp carbon emission intensity is 1 61 tco2e 10 000 yuan 40 larger than guangdong province in the fig 3 b 30 provinces can be divided into four types based on two lines x 1 0 and y 1 0 they are provinces whose total export was larger than local consumption but total import was smaller than local consumption a type 6 provinces total export was larger than local consumption and total import was also larger than local consumption b type 9 provinces total export was smaller than local consumption and total import was also smaller than local consumption c type 13 provinces total export was smaller than local consumption but total import was larger than local consumption d type 2 provinces the provinces with a large export type a and b bore the role of important carbon suppliers in the supply chain the amount of exported embodied carbon exceeded the amount of local consumption the average proportion of embodied carbon from exports is 57 82 for a type the value of imports is relatively small which shows that most of the a type areas are resource exporting areas 78 of the b type provinces are located in coastal areas these provinces have high import embodied carbon and high export embodied carbon they were important trade nodes and the final processor of intermediate products such as guangdong jiangsu shanghai and tianjin most of the c type provinces are located in inland areas qinghai gansu hunan and xinjiang are typical ones their local consumption accounts for more than 50 of its production perspective based carbon finally for d type provinces there are only two nodes jiangxi and beijing the abscissa value of jiangxi is 1 042 which could be classified as c almost therefore the only node that actually shows high import and low export characteristics is beijing in fact beijing s ordinate is 0 96 very close to 1 its ratio of imported implied carbon to local consumption embodied carbon is as high as 3 17 according to the fig 3 c and fig 3 d more detailed patterns are identified based on the reliance on domestic or international embodied carbon comparing the third and fourth plots especially the relative position difference of the auxiliary y x rays the proportion of international exports is much larger than the proportion of international imports for most provinces cities in mainland china which is consistent with the conclusion of the first part fig 3 c can be used to analyze the difference in demand between domestic and international imports by different consumers provinces and regions with high import ratios act as a consumer in the supply chain considering the typical municipalities except for chongqing did not show the consumer characteristics for the source of embodied carbon beijing shanghai and tianjin rely more on domestic imports compared to foreign imports domestic imports of embodied carbon emissions accounted for 64 49 of their own consumption of carbon emissions fig 3 d shows the difference in supply capacity of different producers for the domestic and international markets firstly guangdong shanghai zhejiang jiangsu and other regions are more prominent among all the foreign exporters their proportion of international exports is in the leading position in mainland china having an average proportion of international exports of their own pba carbon of 29 48 in addition the proportion of international exports in guangdong zhejiang and fujian is higher than their proportion of domestic exports located on the left side of the x y reference line for the domestic export oriented regions inner mongolia hebei and other provinces are in a leading position in domestic exports with an average domestic exports accounting for 50 68 as analyzed in the previous section inner mongolia and hebei are major industrial provinces and the geographical locations of the two province is close to beijing and tianjin two regions with high domestic demand 3 3 intensity analysis china s trade volume is characterized by carbon intensive exports looking to fig 4 for china the intensity of carbon embodied in international exports was 1 48 tco2e 104 yuan i e 2 times the intensity of carbon embodied in international imports the figure indicated that the trend when degree of economic development is lower the intensity of implied carbon in both international exports and domestic exports is higher while there is no obvious correlation between the embodied carbon intensity of international imports and the level of economic development even beijing is similar to the international imports embodied carbon intensity of sichuan whose gdp per capita is much lower it proves that there is no significant difference in the choice of internationally imported goods between provinces cities domestic import embodied carbon varies like a normal distribution with economic development changes the regions with the highest and lowest levels of economic development have lower domestic export embodied carbon while those at the middle upper or middle lower levels have higher domestic import embodied carbon intensity it may be because provinces cities with higher levels of economic development may choose more international imports such as cities such as beijing and shanghai on high embodied carbon density products while low economy regions rely more on their own resource development gansu yunnan guizhou etc intensity analysis helps to locate the location of a specific province city in the embodied carbon trade network accurately taking beijing as an example it is located at the bottom of the global production supply chain transferring the embodied carbon flow to the origin by domestic and international imports such a trade structure is beneficial to beijing in terms of carbon emissions reduction see fig 4 beijing s per capita gdp ranked second in china the carbon flow embodied in domestic imported products was 1 56 tco2e 104 yuan i e four times the intensity of carbon embodied in domestic exports in parallel carbon flow embodied in international imports was 0 80 tco2e 104 yuan i e 1 5 times the intensity of the carbon flow embodied in international exports beijing mainly exports low carbon products with high values to developed countries and imports carbon intensive products from domestic regions in china 4 discussion and policy implication 4 1 effective mitigation measure due to different roles the emission reduction policies in china are mainly production based methods aimed at reducing emission intensity such as carbon capture technology for thermal power plants from the perspective of consumption based accounting it is necessary to focus on the demand side such as affecting consumer behavior advocating a lower carbon lifestyle and so on based on the results of our research in addition to the above two measures provinces cities that play different roles in the trade flows of carbon emissions should adopt different and more targeted emission reduction measures in the 3 2 results section we divided the provinces into abcd 4 categories by comparing the total consumption of imports and exports for a type provinces whose total export was larger than local consumption but total import was smaller than local consumption it is more often a producer of intermediate materials than a producer of the final product and its targeted emission reduction measures are on the production side many provinces in the a type have low urbanization rates and should pay attention on the relatively high rural area for such provinces the agricultural sector s emissions are more dispersed than the industrial sector and was often neglected which needs more socioeconomic measure to solve chen et al 2018 for the b type provinces it is a typical final production with huge input and huge output measures to improve productivity should be adopted such as improving the efficiency of the use of metals and cement raw materials as well as develop sustainable power sector cheng et al 2019 in enterprises such as jiangsu zhejiang and guangdong further to reduce the emission drivers for a type provinces achieving the goal of total emission reducing for typical end customer provinces demand side measures can be taken such as promoting a lifestyle to reduce emissions in beijing and shanghai for provinces cities that do not show dependence on the outside world in the entire embodied carbon trade network they should pay attention to multiple aspects focusing on both end of life reductions and on the demand side 4 2 allocation of emission responsibilities in practice trade embodied carbon can be divided into two parts one part represents the carbon dioxide emissions generated by the region s own final consumption this part can be considered as the self emission reduction responsibility of the target area the other part is the inter provincial trade embodied carbon which represents the spillover effect of carbon dioxide emissions due to final consumption in other regions the carbon emissions of the provinces cities where the raw materials are produced are determined by the production needs of the provinces that are to be transferred in the next step and the emissions of such provinces are further driven by the demand of the provinces as the final consumers from the consumer s point of view not only the final consumer but also the final producer of the intermediate product should bear some responsibility in other studies this is often overlooked in our research we can better distinguish the responsibilities of the two countries by defining the embodied carbon trade relationship between the provinces which helps to divide the responsibility better specifically since local consumption carbon accounts for the majority of regional co2 emissions this indicator can be used as a baseline for allocating regional carbon credits inter provincial trade embodied carbon can be used as a factor in adjusting the responsibility of the province cities for its consumer final producer intermediate producer the development of regional integration has provided great possibilities for accounting from the different perspective we have noticed that china is advancing the regional coordinated development such as the construction of the beijing tianjin hebei guangdong hong kong macao bay areas this integrated development provides a better platform for collaboration and technology transfer between regions our research will serve the process of integrated development 5 conclusion based on the multi scale and multi regional input output model we used the wiod database to establish connections with china s inter provincial multi regional input output data and analyzed the characteristics of china s trade embodied carbon flows in 2010 at a subnational scale 1 research shows that for china as a whole the net export of emissions in 2010 was 903 4 mtco2e the final destinations of embodied carbon transfer are mainly concentrated in developed countries in north america and the european union for different subnational regions the destinations of embodied carbon outflows are largely related to their geographical locations the north area central coast area and southern coast area are where international embodied carbon main outflow source 2 due to the differences in economic development and natural resource endowments different provinces play different roles in the process of carbon transfer by analyzing the carbon emission patterns of all provinces they can be categorized into resource supplier self sufficient type consumer as well as trade center and final producer where both inflow and outflow are large if a province s exports are further differentiated in terms of final destination domestic or international the proportion of international exports in coastal areas is dominant whereas inland areas with rich resources mainly supply embodied carbon domestically within china municipalities rely more on domestic imports than on international imports compared to coastal provinces 3 from the perspective of an intensity analysis the intensity of internationally exported embodied carbon is 1 48 tco2e 104 yuan which is twice the intensity of internationally imported carbon there is a trend that when degree of economic development is lower the intensity of implied carbon in both international exports and domestic exports is higher our research provides different types of emission reduction policy choices for different role provinces cities and also sorts out the division of emission reduction responsibilities in the future under the policy of coordinated regional development the transfer of funds and technology between provinces will be more feasible the msio based method has certain limitations on the one hand we rely on the wiod database the comparability and resolution of our results largely depend on the construction of international input output database in addition if there are input output table data between cities within a province this model can be further extended to the city provincial region national scale using the same method the imperfection of basic data is still a big obstacle for modeling credit authorship contribution statement junmei hu investigation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing gengyuan liu conceptualization

24807,dynamic energy budget deb theory provides a framework for quantifying metabolic processes and biological rates deb models have been widely applied to aquaculture species but this type of model has great potential for application to fisheries for stock assessment and enhancement the shrimp fenneropenaeus chinensis widely distributed along the coast of china and korea is the most important fisheries and aquaculture species in china with the amp method deb parameters were estimated for the population along the coast of china the parameter estimation achieved an overall goodness of fit with mre of 0 131 and smse of 0 178 in comparison with similar species the values of a few main parameters are relatively high including reserve capacity em somatic maintenance ·πóm and allocation fraction to growth and somatic maintenance Œ∫ this may reflect an adaptation to variation of environmental conditions the model can predict the physiological behaviours including respiration ammonia excretion and feeding rates reasonably well it shows overall capability to predict the growth and reproduction with acceptable confidence in three main geographic regions there are clear differences between the female and male with much faster growth rate of the former validations of the model have shown that it can adequately predict growth of the shrimp in both its natural distribution waters and land based culture systems this study provides important information for further development of modeling tools which can contribute to estimating the carrying capacity for stock enhancement and optimizing production from integrated multi trophic aquaculture keywords deb model shrimp parameterisation application aquaculture stock enhancement 1 introduction the shrimp fenneropenaeus chinensis is the commercially important species in china and korea liu et al 2003 it is mainly distributed in the bohai sea yellow sea and along the southern coast of the korean peninsula the species once supported one of the most valuable fisheries in northern china contributing approximately 80 of the total shrimp production deng and ye 2001 annual landing reached 40 000 tons in 1979 wang et al 2006 but since mid 1980s these shrimp fisheries underwent continual decline overfishing and habitat destruction led to collapse of the shrimp fisheries in the early 1990s wang et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 song et al 2018 over recent decades hatchery technology has provided a promising synergy between capture fisheries and aquaculture integration of aquaculture with capture fisheries offers potential opportunities to restore and augment some coastal fisheries through the release of cultured juveniles a stock enhancement and translocation program for f chinensis was initiated in 1984 to re build the depleted stock through the release of hatchery reared juveniles zhang et al 2009 large scale releases did not start until the 1990s in china wang et al 2006 a great number of juveniles has been released annually both within and outside the natural distribution waters of this species and the present shrimp fisheries are almost entirely dependent on these hatchery releases song et al 2018 appropriate management to restore stocks extinguished by commercial fishing often includes stock enhancement from the release of cultured individuals hilborn 1998 leber 2002 although the release of the shrimp has delivered considerable economic benefit in china the number of releases has been largely based on availability of juveniles produced in hatcheries despite a continuing increase in the number of releases little attention has been paid to the ecological carrying capacity of the environment to sustain these releases there is an increased awareness that simply producing and releasing large numbers of shrimps without addressing the ecological carrying capacity is unlikely to have the desired outcome lin et al 2013 2018 ecological carrying capacity is one of the important limitations in need of evaluation to ensure successful stock enhancement of the shrimp ecological processes affecting shrimp distribution in natural waters are complex involving in fluctuations in the abundance and production of prey and predation organisms within a changeable abiotic environment the system dynamics are influenced by localised hydrodynamic properties as well as those from adjacent areas stock enhancement via release of juveniles potentially increases complexity in their habitat ecosystem there are a few modeling approaches for estimating the carrying capacity of embayments for shrimp enhancement lin et al 2013 2018 but these studies were based on assuming static rather than dynamic conditions an ecosystem model is an appropriate means to help understand the functioning and estimate the carrying capacity of an ecosystem within the limitations imposed by the assumptions of the model mckindsey et al 2006 chapman and byron 2018 the energetic of individuals is an important but often elusive component of an ecosystem model guyondet et al 2010 filgueira et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 therefore development of a dynamic energy budget deb model despite a myriad of assumption is a first step toward development of ecosystem models for estimating the carrying capacity of shrimp stock enhancement in the waters in which they are distributed furthermore a deb model can quantify metabolic processes and the associated biological rates including feeding and growth which are of interest for aquaculture shrimp is the most important aquaculture organism and comprises a key trophic level in integrated multitrophic aquaculture imta experiments have been conducted to coculture the shrimp with various species to reduce waste and increase productivity of culture ponds yu et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 fu et al 2019 however biomass stocking densities of the culture species must be determined by means of imta models ren et al 2012 the deb model is an important component of an imta model for optimizing stocking biomass at each trophic level to produce an effective economic yield for sustainable aquaculture ren et al 2012 the purpose of this study is to parameterise a deb model for f chinensis to simulate its energetics and growth performance in both land based culture and its natural distribution ecosystems with zero variate and univariate data the model was parameterised using amp method the set of parameters represents the shrimp population in bohai yellow and east china seas we hope that the model will provide an important component of ecosystem models to be used as a quantitative tool to estimate carrying capacity for the shrimp stock enhancement as well as contribute to an imta model for guiding sustainable aquaculture practice we discuss the uncertainty and requirement for further improvement of the model 2 methods 2 1 the model a deb model is based on the deb theory to describe the rate at which an organism assimilates and utilises energy from environment throughout its life cycle for maintenance growth maturation and reproduction kooijman 2010 we used the abj deb model with metabolic acceleration marques et al 2018 for the shrimp with three life stages including embryo juvenile and adult the shrimp neither feed nor reproduce at embryo stage but juvenile shrimp starts to feed after reaching maturity threshold for birth eh b adult shrimp feed and reproduce when they reach the maturity threshold eh p it is assumed that the shrimp changes in shape during the early juvenile period such that surface area is proportional to volume which then leads to metamorphosis before reaching the adult shape apart from aging there are four state variables of the model including the structural volume v the reserve energy e the cumulated energy allocated to maturity eh and the reproduction buffer er a schematic diagram showing energy flows and abj deb model equations are presented in ren et al 2020 briefly the energy uptake follows a type ii functional response to food concentrations the energy assimilated from the environment is immediately incorporated into the reserve pool the energy allocation follows the Œ∫ rule the fixed ratio Œ∫ of the reserve is utilised for somatic maintenance and growth whereas the remaining fraction 1 Œ∫ is allocated to the maintenance of maturity level and development in juveniles and reproduction in adults maintenance process has priority over growth and development or reproduction temperature affects all rates following the arrhenius relationship 2 2 sources of empirical data for parameterisation there are two populations of f chinensis with one distributed in the chinese waters and the other off the korean peninsula body size in the former population is much larger than that of the latter the two populations are reproductively isolated from each other deng et al 1990 for parameterisation we used empirical data from the chinese population there is little difference in body size between females and males smaller than 7 cm in total length thereafter the growth of the female accelerates and the difference of body size increases physiological rates depend on temperature and follow the arrhenius relationship without comprehensive data for the relationship between respiration and temperature the relationship between temperature and growth rate was used to determine the arrhenius temperature ta the growth rate increased up to 31 c and then decreased beyond this temperature tian et al 2006 the estimated arrhenius temperature is 8700 k the temperature tolerance range was wide and performance breadth was between 277 and 306 k this range is consistent with the reported tolerance range wang 2013 the shrimp f chinensis naturally distributes in two main areas including bohai sea and yellow sea for univariate growth data in bohai sea we used the release and capture data deng et al 1990 the shrimp larvae were released in may each year and the growth was monitored thereafter until late october when the population starts to migrate out of the bohai sea towards the overwintering ground in the middle of the yellow sea the temperature increases in the coastal water of the bohai sea during this period food was generally abundant in the yellow sea growth data were obtained from bottom trawl surveys chen et al 1990 surveys were conducted every 10 days during july november period of 1971 1984 and 1985 body length and wet weight of the female and male were separately measured in each survey age was back calculated from spawning dates in mid may note that it is not possible to separate the data by cohorts with the available information so the pool of growth data from these surveys was used in the analysis shrimp larvae have also been released into the coastal waters of the east china sea from late 1980 s this region is outside the natural distribution area of the species for the present study we used the published age and growth data collected in bi monthly samplings during the period of may october 1990 zhang 2001 there were no time series temperature data during sampling periods in all three regions but the temperature generally increases considerably from may to october averages of 25 26 and 27 c were used respectively for the growth data in the bohai yellow and east china seas physiological data were sourced from several experimental studies the rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion were measured in factorially designed experiments the experiments were conducted in individuals with wet weight ranging from 0 18 17 30 g at three temperatures 20 25 and 30 c zhang et al 1998 physiological information for an additional temperature 34 c was obtained from different experiment tian et al 2004 similarly an experiment measuring food uptake rates was conducted under a range of body size and temperature conditions qiao et al 1992 feeding rates were measured in shrimps fed with either live or artificial feed we only used those data involving live feed to better reflect natural conditions these data provide size specific feeding rates under a range of temperatures because body size of individuals was only over a small range it was not appropriate to establish the relationship between the feeding rate and body size to provide univariate data for feed rate vs body size we used the back calculated feeding rate from a long term growth experiment zhang et al 1983 individuals were grown in a culture pond and fed with saturated feed for a period of two months food consumption and growth were monitored weekly the initial average wet weight was 1 2 g and final weight was 27 0 g the temperature was reported in a range of 16 28 c but a time series temperature was not recorded a mean value of 26 c was used for the dataset the gonad development starts in february and spawning occurs in may the shrimp may spawn once a year and the maximum

middle of may and post larvae drift towards the coastline in june they move further into shallow water 10 m depth nursery grounds where they live for over two months by late august to early september juveniles commence migrating into deep waters ahead of mating in october in mid november when the temperature declines the shrimp migrate southward to arrive in the overwintering ground in the yellow

the westward region deng et al 1990 wang 2013 3 2 application data the model was applied to simulate growth of the shrimp in its main distribution waters of bohai and yellow seas and a land based culture pond and hatchery conditions all data described in this section are independent and are only used for the purpose of model validation and application presented in section 5 3 below the data in bohai sea were obtained from a releasing program in which growth was monitored during may september 2012 xiao et al 2014 similarly growth data were collected in northern yellow sea during june october 2015 liu et al 2016 the pond culture of the shrimp is popular in northern china length and weight data were collected in one of land based culture ponds in panjing off liaoning peninsula zhao and wang 2007 the model was also validated with growth data of early juvenile stages with two datasets one was the growth of juveniles inside hatchery at controlled conditions including temperature 28 30 2 c salinity 29 32 and ph 7 4 8 1 and dissolved oxygen 5 0 6 8 mg l 1 zhang et al 2008 the shrimps were fed with artificial pallets in four times a day the other dataset was the growth of juveniles in experimental ponds at controlled environments with mean temperature 24 1 c salinity 33 47 ph 8 19 and dissolved oxygen 6 62 mg l 1 zhang et al 2020 in experimental pond juvenile shrimps were fed with artemia sp with a frequency of four times per day sea surface temperature was used for model input in yellow sea fig 2 a song et al 2019 bohai sea is a shallow and semi closed sea consisting of a few bays with some variation of temperature between bays to be consistent with growth data we used the monitoring data in the same area as for growth data yuan et al 2015 the temperature for land based pond culture was obtained from monitoring values over the growth period the temperature in pond was largely influenced by air temperature and was generally higher than sea surface temperature during the most growth period the time series data for food density are one of the most important variables driving energetics of organisms the shrimp consumes a wide variety of different organisms with over forty prey species deng et al 1990 zhang et al 2015 the main species include bivalvia mysidacea amphipoda ostracoda and coscinodiscus sp although these studies provided general information for variations of prey species composition it is not possible to obtain time series food biomass for the shrimp from the published form of data following ren et al 2020 we compiled biomass information for some of most abundant prey species and constructed a food index based on a weighted sum of the available data fig 2b this food index was used to calculate the functional response f 4 results 4 1 model parameters the univariate data in section 3 2 were used for model parameterisation the result showed that the model output was in agreements with the observed data most of the predicted zero variate data are close to the observations but there are some uncertainties table 1 the model underestimated the length at metamorphosis but overestimated length at puberty the ultimate weight was slightly overestimated the mismatches may have been due to uncertainties in observations overall the parameter estimation resulted in an acceptable goodness of fit with mre of 0 131 and smse of 0 178 the relatively high values of mre and smse partially reflect the uncertainties of observations and the large heterogeneity among physiological rates including feeding respiration and ammonia excretion the quality of growth data in some regions also contributed to the uncertainty this will be discussed further in a later section the deb parameters were estimated at a reference temperature of 20 c table 2 the estimated value for energy conductance is close to the default value the value for allocation fraction to growth and somatic maintenance is relatively high indicating low energy allocation for reproduction this is consistent with high levels of energy required for somatic maintenance and for synthesising each unit volume of somatic structure the shrimp has a high assimilation rate and reserve capacity 4 2 predictions of univariate data growth in length and weight can be predicted by the model for the three main geographic distributions of the shrimp fig 3 there is little difference in growth between the female and male before 50 days in age deng et al 1990 after 50 days the growth rate of the female accelerates to become much higher than that of the male both length and weight can be predicted in the bohai sea fig 3a b the model generally estimated the growth trajectories in the yellow sea fig 3c d but slightly overestimated the length of the male in the east china sea the model predictions generally matched the observations but length of the male was slightly overestimated fig 3e f the relationship between length and weight is well predicted by the model r2 0 98 p 0 01 fecundity shows a linear increase trend with body weight within the observed size range which was well predicted by the model fig 4 this size range represents 1 year old individuals the model can predict the size specific oxygen consumption rates in response to changes of temperature fig 5 a the rate increases with temperature until 31 c and thereafter decreases with further increases in temperature similarly the ammonia excretion rate shows the same trend with temperature fig 5b the size dependent respiration rate shows a decreasing pattern with body length and temperature within the temperature range tested fig 6 the modelled size specific feeding rates are in agreement with the observations within a wet weight range of 3 5 12 0 g under a temperature range of 23 30 c fig 7 it shows a decreasing pattern with body size but an increase with temperature the feeding rates from a long term growth experiment with a saturating feed level were monitored bi weekly although a time series temperature data was no available rates were effectively predicted with an average temperature of 26 c the feeding rate increases hyperbolically with body size fig 8 4 3 model validation the independent data described in section 4 2 were used for model validation and application the model simulations matched the observations reasonably well fig 9 the growth rate was higher in northern yellow sea than in bohai sea the stock was dominated by the released individuals and the variation in growth would be largely ascribed to variations in stocking densities between areas wu et al 2016 lin et al 2018 the simulated growth of the shrimp is also consistent with the observations in the land based pond culture systems the growth rate was considerably lower in the pond than in bohai and northern yellow seas although there is no information about the stocking density it was generally higher in land based culture ponds than in the natural environment zhao and wang 2007 jiang et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 therefore this variation of growth would reflect difference in food availability the growth trajectories of juveniles were also reproduced by the model fig 10 the growth was faster in hatchery condition than in experimental pond this difference in growth was resulted from differences of both temperature and food levels btemperature was higher in hatchery than in ponds similarly the f value was 15 higher in hatchery than in ponds https baike baidu com item ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂØπËôæ 1431786 fr aladdin 5 discussion the parameterisation of the abj model for the shrimp f chinensis showed promising results because the predicted zero variate data generally match the observations well the model can reproduce physiological processes including respiration ammonia excretion and feeding rates it has shown overall capability to predict growth and reproduction with acceptable confidence validation of the model to data proved successful as it can reasonably predict the growth of the shrimp in both land based culture and its distribution ecosystems over recent decades there have been many physiological and biological studies on f chinensis providing relatively abundant data for deb model parameterisation of the species based on the scale lika et al 2011 the completeness of available data is ranked as high as 4 7 for this shrimp although the parameter estimation has resulted in acceptable goodness of fit there are some differences between the observed and predicted values the source of data could have contributed to these uncertainties for example length at metamorphosis was underestimated which could be due to variation of experimental temperature li and xiang 2002 ultimate weight was overestimated it is reasonable to assume that the observed maximum weight is generally smaller than the ultimate weight because the food is usually not always abundant in the natural environments over the entire life span of the shrimp in addition some variations among the univariate data would have contributed to mre and smse values for example both respiration and ammonia excretion rates were measured in individuals with wet weight between 0 18 17 30 g zhang et al 1998 this wide range in body size would have created some uncertainties in size specific rates because physiological rates increase hyperbolically with body size in addition there are also some uncertainties in some of the growth data particularly from the yellow sea where the growth data consist of three cohorts there could have been difference in the growth rate between cohorts which reflects variation in food availability future improvement of the model can be achieved through using high quality data from appropriately designed sampling and experimentation the values of assimilation rate and reserve capacity are noticeably high for the shrimp compared with those of other shrimps including crangon crangon campos et al 2009 penaeus semisulcatus kooijman 2019 and pandalus borealis augustine and kooijman 2017 this may reflect adaptation of the organism to variation in environmental conditions growth trajectories for both length and weight indicate that fast growth occurs during the spring and summer seasons before september chen et al 1990 deng et al 1990 growth in weight remains relatively high until november when individuals start to migrate to the overwintering ground in the middle of the yellow sea deng et al 1990 wang 2013 during the winter period in january march low food availability associated with sea temperatures could result in energy requirements for maintenance that exceed energy uptake from the environment a high energy reserve enables the organism to endure long periods of starvation the parameterisation of the model has resulted in the highest value of the scaled functional response f value for growth of the shrimp in the bohai sea and the lowest value in the east china sea however the mean water temperature of these regions is in a reverse order from low to high bohai sea yellow sea east china sea wang et al 2018 this inverse relationship between f and water temperature may reflect difference of environmental conditions particularly nutritional values of the shrimp s prey organisms generally the biomass density of organisms increases towards the poles while the production decreases these quality and quantity aspects are not independent for example the nutrient uptake by algae strongly depends on temperature but the dependence of photosynthesis on temperature is less strongly this would result in carbohydrates of algae being richer in low temperature environment than in high temperature systems consequently there is more energy available for the high trophic predators in colder environment the finding of the inverse relationship between f and water temperature suggests that a deb model can be used to not only predict energetics of organisms in response to dynamic environment but also help investigate environmental conditions there are two populations of the species that are reproductively isolated from each other one population is distributed in the bohai and yellow seas of china whilst the other along the coast of the western korean peninsula deng et al 1990 wang 2013 the body size of the former is larger than that of the latter the parameterisation of the present model is based on physiological and biological information of the shrimp in the coastal water of china and hence may not be directly applicable to the population along the korean coast lack of available information prevents us from comparing energetic behaviours between these populations further modeling work is required to parameterise the deb model specially for the population along the coast of korea stock enhancement and restocking of the shrimp have been conducted over three decades in china zhang et al 2015 xu et al 2016 lin et al 2018 the optimum number for release could not be estimated due to a lack of appropriate tools lin et al 2013 2018 in some area the stocking density could have been over the ecological carrying capacity which would not only limit the food supply to the shrimp but also cause ecological impact the considerable variation in growth rate was resulted from difference in food availability between ecosystems for sustainable management of the shrimp fisheries the number of releases should be based on ecological carrying capacity of the ecosystems because the ecosystem of the shrimp s habitation waters involves in complex interactions among biological organisations and their environment the functioning of the ecosystem and environmental impact of released shrimps can only be interpreted by means of ecosystem models the present deb model for f chinensis provides an important component for an ecosystem model used as a management tool for estimating carrying capacity and assessing ecological impact of the stock enhancement the development of the deb model for f chinensis does not only have potential future application for informing management of stock enhancement activities but also can help improve understanding of the energetics and ecosystem functioning of aquaculture systems for this highly important species with success of hatchery production and declines in wild fisheries the shrimp has become one of the main aquaculture species in china from 1988 to 1993 the f chinensis aquaculture consecutively ranked the first in the world with annual production over 200 000 tons wang 2013 however the outbreak of white spot syndrome virus in 1993 caused massive mortality and the chinese aquaculture industry suffered considerable economic loss although there were several factors contributing to the outbreak of the virus importantly overstocking leading to deterioration in aquaculture environment was among them zhou 2016 the deb model applied in this study may help understand the physiological responses of the species to dynamic environmental conditions and the growth performance under various aquaculture scenarios it can also serve as one of important components for an imta ecosystem model for optimizing stocking density under different culture and environmental conditions to reduce the risk of future overstocking credit authorship contribution statement tao yang data curation formal analysis resources writing

24807,dynamic energy budget deb theory provides a framework for quantifying metabolic processes and biological rates deb models have been widely applied to aquaculture species but this type of model has great potential for application to fisheries for stock assessment and enhancement the shrimp fenneropenaeus chinensis widely distributed along the coast of china and korea is the most important fisheries and aquaculture species in china with the amp method deb parameters were estimated for the population along the coast of china the parameter estimation achieved an overall goodness of fit with mre of 0 131 and smse of 0 178 in comparison with similar species the values of a few main parameters are relatively high including reserve capacity em somatic maintenance ·πóm and allocation fraction to growth and somatic maintenance Œ∫ this may reflect an adaptation to variation of environmental conditions the model can predict the physiological behaviours including respiration ammonia excretion and feeding rates reasonably well it shows overall capability to predict the growth and reproduction with acceptable confidence in three main geographic regions there are clear differences between the female and male with much faster growth rate of the former validations of the model have shown that it can adequately predict growth of the shrimp in both its natural distribution waters and land based culture systems this study provides important information for further development of modeling tools which can contribute to estimating the carrying capacity for stock enhancement and optimizing production from integrated multi trophic aquaculture keywords deb model shrimp parameterisation application aquaculture stock enhancement 1 introduction the shrimp fenneropenaeus chinensis is the commercially important species in china and korea liu et al 2003 it is mainly distributed in the bohai sea yellow sea and along the southern coast of the korean peninsula the species once supported one of the most valuable fisheries in northern china contributing approximately 80 of the total shrimp production deng and ye 2001 annual landing reached 40 000 tons in 1979 wang et al 2006 but since mid 1980s these shrimp fisheries underwent continual decline overfishing and habitat destruction led to collapse of the shrimp fisheries in the early 1990s wang et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 song et al 2018 over recent decades hatchery technology has provided a promising synergy between capture fisheries and aquaculture integration of aquaculture with capture fisheries offers potential opportunities to restore and augment some coastal fisheries through the release of cultured juveniles a stock enhancement and translocation program for f chinensis was initiated in 1984 to re build the depleted stock through the release of hatchery reared juveniles zhang et al 2009 large scale releases did not start until the 1990s in china wang et al 2006 a great number of juveniles has been released annually both within and outside the natural distribution waters of this species and the present shrimp fisheries are almost entirely dependent on these hatchery releases song et al 2018 appropriate management to restore stocks extinguished by commercial fishing often includes stock enhancement from the release of cultured individuals hilborn 1998 leber 2002 although the release of the shrimp has delivered considerable economic benefit in china the number of releases has been largely based on availability of juveniles produced in hatcheries despite a continuing increase in the number of releases little attention has been paid to the ecological carrying capacity of the environment to sustain these releases there is an increased awareness that simply producing and releasing large numbers of shrimps without addressing the ecological carrying capacity is unlikely to have the desired outcome lin et al 2013 2018 ecological carrying capacity is one of the important limitations in need of evaluation to ensure successful stock enhancement of the shrimp ecological processes affecting shrimp distribution in natural waters are complex involving in fluctuations in the abundance and production of prey and predation organisms within a changeable abiotic environment the system dynamics are influenced by localised hydrodynamic properties as well as those from adjacent areas stock enhancement via release of juveniles potentially increases complexity in their habitat ecosystem there are a few modeling approaches for estimating the carrying capacity of embayments for shrimp enhancement lin et al 2013 2018 but these studies were based on assuming static rather than dynamic conditions an ecosystem model is an appropriate means to help understand the functioning and estimate the carrying capacity of an ecosystem within the limitations imposed by the assumptions of the model mckindsey et al 2006 chapman and byron 2018 the energetic of individuals is an important but often elusive component of an ecosystem model guyondet et al 2010 filgueira et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 therefore development of a dynamic energy budget deb model despite a myriad of assumption is a first step toward development of ecosystem models for estimating the carrying capacity of shrimp stock enhancement in the waters in which they are distributed furthermore a deb model can quantify metabolic processes and the associated biological rates including feeding and growth which are of interest for aquaculture shrimp is the most important aquaculture organism and comprises a key trophic level in integrated multitrophic aquaculture imta experiments have been conducted to coculture the shrimp with various species to reduce waste and increase productivity of culture ponds yu et al 2016 zheng et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 fu et al 2019 however biomass stocking densities of the culture species must be determined by means of imta models ren et al 2012 the deb model is an important component of an imta model for optimizing stocking biomass at each trophic level to produce an effective economic yield for sustainable aquaculture ren et al 2012 the purpose of this study is to parameterise a deb model for f chinensis to simulate its energetics and growth performance in both land based culture and its natural distribution ecosystems with zero variate and univariate data the model was parameterised using amp method the set of parameters represents the shrimp population in bohai yellow and east china seas we hope that the model will provide an important component of ecosystem models to be used as a quantitative tool to estimate carrying capacity for the shrimp stock enhancement as well as contribute to an imta model for guiding sustainable aquaculture practice we discuss the uncertainty and requirement for further improvement of the model 2 methods 2 1 the model a deb model is based on the deb theory to describe the rate at which an organism assimilates and utilises energy from environment throughout its life cycle for maintenance growth maturation and reproduction kooijman 2010 we used the abj deb model with metabolic acceleration marques et al 2018 for the shrimp with three life stages including embryo juvenile and adult the shrimp neither feed nor reproduce at embryo stage but juvenile shrimp starts to feed after reaching maturity threshold for birth eh b adult shrimp feed and reproduce when they reach the maturity threshold eh p it is assumed that the shrimp changes in shape during the early juvenile period such that surface area is proportional to volume which then leads to metamorphosis before reaching the adult shape apart from aging there are four state variables of the model including the structural volume v the reserve energy e the cumulated energy allocated to maturity eh and the reproduction buffer er a schematic diagram showing energy flows and abj deb model equations are presented in ren et al 2020 briefly the energy uptake follows a type ii functional response to food concentrations the energy assimilated from the environment is immediately incorporated into the reserve pool the energy allocation follows the Œ∫ rule the fixed ratio Œ∫ of the reserve is utilised for somatic maintenance and growth whereas the remaining fraction 1 Œ∫ is allocated to the maintenance of maturity level and development in juveniles and reproduction in adults maintenance process has priority over growth and development or reproduction temperature affects all rates following the arrhenius relationship 2 2 sources of empirical data for parameterisation there are two populations of f chinensis with one distributed in the chinese waters and the other off the korean peninsula body size in the former population is much larger than that of the latter the two populations are reproductively isolated from each other deng et al 1990 for parameterisation we used empirical data from the chinese population there is little difference in body size between females and males smaller than 7 cm in total length thereafter the growth of the female accelerates and the difference of body size increases physiological rates depend on temperature and follow the arrhenius relationship without comprehensive data for the relationship between respiration and temperature the relationship between temperature and growth rate was used to determine the arrhenius temperature ta the growth rate increased up to 31 c and then decreased beyond this temperature tian et al 2006 the estimated arrhenius temperature is 8700 k the temperature tolerance range was wide and performance breadth was between 277 and 306 k this range is consistent with the reported tolerance range wang 2013 the shrimp f chinensis naturally distributes in two main areas including bohai sea and yellow sea for univariate growth data in bohai sea we used the release and capture data deng et al 1990 the shrimp larvae were released in may each year and the growth was monitored thereafter until late october when the population starts to migrate out of the bohai sea towards the overwintering ground in the middle of the yellow sea the temperature increases in the coastal water of the bohai sea during this period food was generally abundant in the yellow sea growth data were obtained from bottom trawl surveys chen et al 1990 surveys were conducted every 10 days during july november period of 1971 1984 and 1985 body length and wet weight of the female and male were separately measured in each survey age was back calculated from spawning dates in mid may note that it is not possible to separate the data by cohorts with the available information so the pool of growth data from these surveys was used in the analysis shrimp larvae have also been released into the coastal waters of the east china sea from late 1980 s this region is outside the natural distribution area of the species for the present study we used the published age and growth data collected in bi monthly samplings during the period of may october 1990 zhang 2001 there were no time series temperature data during sampling periods in all three regions but the temperature generally increases considerably from may to october averages of 25 26 and 27 c were used respectively for the growth data in the bohai yellow and east china seas physiological data were sourced from several experimental studies the rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion were measured in factorially designed experiments the experiments were conducted in individuals with wet weight ranging from 0 18 17 30 g at three temperatures 20 25 and 30 c zhang et al 1998 physiological information for an additional temperature 34 c was obtained from different experiment tian et al 2004 similarly an experiment measuring food uptake rates was conducted under a range of body size and temperature conditions qiao et al 1992 feeding rates were measured in shrimps fed with either live or artificial feed we only used those data involving live feed to better reflect natural conditions these data provide size specific feeding rates under a range of temperatures because body size of individuals was only over a small range it was not appropriate to establish the relationship between the feeding rate and body size to provide univariate data for feed rate vs body size we used the back calculated feeding rate from a long term growth experiment zhang et al 1983 individuals were grown in a culture pond and fed with saturated feed for a period of two months food consumption and growth were monitored weekly the initial average wet weight was 1 2 g and final weight was 27 0 g the temperature was reported in a range of 16 28 c but a time series temperature was not recorded a mean value of 26 c was used for the dataset the gonad development starts in february and spawning occurs in may the shrimp may spawn once a year and the maximum fecundity is about 1 5 million eggs chen 2001 size dependent fecundity data were collected in the bohai sea deng et al 1990 the female wet weight ranged between 50 and 110 g with fecundity in a range of 0 5 1 1 million eggs 2 3 parameter estimation there was high heterogeneity among some univariate data including rates of oxygen consumption ammonia excretion and feeding this variation could have been arisen from process error uncertainties during physiological measurements in order to offset this variation less weight is given to these data for parameter estimation parameters of the shrimp deb model were estimated from both zero variate and univariate data with the amp procedure the improved version of the covariation method marques et al 2019 the covariation method links the parameters to experimental and field observations at different life stages and approximates the parameter to minimize the difference between observed and predicted values following lika et al 2011 we assigned a value of 4 7 for the completeness of real data the overall goodness of fit is assessed with mean relative error mre and symmetric mean squared error smse goodness of fit of the model predictions was assessed with relative error estimates for each zero variate data point and univariate data set the mean relative error estimate was estimated for the whole model 3 model application 3 1 distribution

juveniles commence migrating into deep waters ahead of mating in october in mid november when the temperature declines the shrimp migrate southward to arrive in the overwintering ground in the yellow

hatchery condition than in experimental pond this difference in growth was resulted from differences of both temperature and food levels btemperature was higher in hatchery than in ponds similarly the f value was 15 higher in hatchery than in ponds https baike baidu com item ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂØπËôæ 1431786 fr aladdin 5 discussion the parameterisation of the abj model for the shrimp f chinensis showed promising results because the predicted zero variate data generally match the observations well the model can reproduce physiological processes including respiration ammonia excretion and feeding rates it has shown overall capability to predict growth and reproduction with acceptable confidence validation of the model to data proved successful as it can reasonably predict the growth of the shrimp in both land based culture and its distribution ecosystems over recent decades there have been many physiological and biological studies on f chinensis providing relatively abundant data for deb model parameterisation of the species based on the scale lika et al 2011 the completeness of available data is ranked as high as 4 7 for this shrimp although the parameter estimation has resulted in acceptable goodness of fit there are some differences between the observed and predicted values the source of data could have contributed to these uncertainties for example length at metamorphosis was underestimated which could be due to variation of experimental temperature li and xiang 2002 ultimate weight was overestimated it is reasonable to assume that the observed maximum weight is generally smaller than the ultimate weight because the food is usually not always abundant in the natural environments over the entire life span of the shrimp in addition some variations among the univariate data would have contributed to mre and smse values for example both respiration and ammonia excretion rates were measured in individuals with wet weight between 0 18 17 30 g zhang et al 1998 this wide range in body size would have created some uncertainties in size specific rates because physiological rates increase hyperbolically with body size in addition there are also some uncertainties in some of the growth data particularly from the yellow sea where the growth data consist of three cohorts there could have been difference in the growth rate between cohorts which reflects variation in food availability future improvement of the model can be achieved through using high quality data from appropriately designed sampling and experimentation the values of assimilation rate and reserve capacity are noticeably high for the shrimp compared with those of other shrimps including crangon crangon campos et al 2009 penaeus semisulcatus kooijman 2019 and pandalus borealis augustine and kooijman 2017 this may reflect adaptation of the organism to variation in environmental conditions growth trajectories for both length and weight indicate that fast growth occurs during the spring and summer seasons before september chen et al 1990 deng et al 1990 growth in weight remains relatively high until november when individuals start to migrate to the overwintering ground in the middle of the yellow sea deng et al 1990 wang 2013 during the winter period in january march low food availability associated with sea temperatures could result in energy requirements for maintenance that exceed energy uptake from the environment a high energy reserve enables the organism to endure long periods of starvation the parameterisation of the model has resulted in the highest value of the scaled functional response f value for growth of the shrimp in the bohai sea and the lowest value in the east china sea however the mean water temperature of these regions is in a reverse order from low to high bohai sea yellow sea east china sea wang et al 2018 this inverse relationship between f and water temperature may reflect difference of environmental conditions particularly nutritional values of the shrimp s prey organisms generally the biomass density of organisms increases towards the poles while the production decreases these quality and quantity aspects are not independent for example the nutrient uptake by algae strongly depends on temperature but the dependence of photosynthesis on temperature is less strongly this would result in carbohydrates of algae being richer in low temperature environment than in high temperature systems consequently there is more energy available for the high trophic predators in colder environment the finding of the inverse relationship between f and water temperature suggests that a deb model can be used to not only predict energetics of organisms in response to dynamic environment but also help investigate environmental conditions there are two populations of the species that are reproductively isolated from each other one population is distributed in the bohai and yellow seas of china whilst the other along the coast of the western korean peninsula deng et al 1990 wang 2013 the body size of the former is larger than that of the latter the parameterisation of the present model is based on physiological and biological information of the shrimp in the coastal water of china and hence may not be directly applicable to the population along the korean coast lack of available information prevents us from comparing energetic behaviours between these populations further modeling work is required to parameterise the deb model specially for the population along the coast of korea stock enhancement and restocking of the shrimp have been conducted over three decades in china zhang et al 2015 xu et al 2016 lin et al 2018 the optimum number for release could not be estimated due to a lack of appropriate tools lin et al 2013 2018 in some area the stocking density could have been over the ecological carrying capacity which would not only limit the food supply to the shrimp but also cause ecological impact the considerable variation in growth rate was resulted from difference in food availability between ecosystems for sustainable management of the shrimp fisheries the number of releases should be based on ecological carrying capacity of the ecosystems because the ecosystem of the shrimp s habitation waters involves in complex interactions among biological organisations and their environment the functioning of the ecosystem and environmental impact of released shrimps can only be interpreted by means of ecosystem models the present deb model for f chinensis provides an important component for an ecosystem model used as a management tool for estimating carrying capacity and assessing ecological impact of the stock enhancement the development of the deb model for f chinensis does not only have potential future application for informing management of stock enhancement activities but also can help improve understanding of the energetics and ecosystem functioning of aquaculture systems for this highly important species with success of hatchery production and declines in wild fisheries the shrimp has become one of the main aquaculture species in china from 1988 to 1993 the f chinensis aquaculture consecutively ranked the first in the world with annual production over 200 000 tons wang 2013 however the outbreak of white spot syndrome virus in 1993 caused massive mortality and the chinese aquaculture industry suffered considerable economic loss although there were several factors contributing to the outbreak of the virus importantly overstocking leading to deterioration in aquaculture environment was among them zhou 2016 the deb model applied in this study may help understand the physiological responses of the species to dynamic environmental conditions and the growth performance under various aquaculture scenarios it can also serve as one of important components for an imta ecosystem model for optimizing stocking density under different culture and environmental conditions to reduce the risk of future overstocking credit authorship contribution statement tao yang data curation formal analysis resources writing

24808,covid 19 pandemic is a global threat to human health and economy that requires urgent prevention and monitoring strategies several models are under study to control the disease spread and infection rate and to detect possible factors that might favour them with a focus on understanding the correlation between the disease and specific geophysical parameters however the pandemic does not present evident environmental hindrances in the infected countries nevertheless a lower rate of infections has been observed in some countries which might be related to particular population and climatic conditions in this paper infection rate of covid 19 is modelled globally at a 0 5 resolution using a maximum entropy based ecological niche model that identifies geographical areas potentially subject to a high infection rate the model identifies locations that could favour infection rate due to their particular geophysical surface air temperature precipitation and elevation and human related characteristics co 2 and population density it was trained by facilitating data from italian provinces that have reported a high infection rate and subsequently tested using datasets from world countries reports based on this model a risk index was calculated to identify the potential world countries and regions that have a high risk of disease increment the distribution outputs foresee a high infection rate in many locations where real world disease outbreaks have occurred e g the hubei province in china and reports a high risk of disease increment in most world countries which have reported significant outbreaks e g western u s a overall the results suggest that a complex combination of the selected parameters might be of integral importance to understand the propagation of covid 19 among human populations particularly in europe the model and the data were distributed through open science web services to maximise opportunities for re usability regarding new data and new diseases and also to enhance the transparency of the approach and results keywords ecological niche modelling coronavirus sars cov 2 covid 19 maximum entropy 1 introduction the spread of the covid 19 pandemic caused by the sars cov 2 virus is significantly afflicting both society and the global economy and urgently calls for the development of systems capable of monitoring and predicting the risk of infection the modelling of sars cov 2 spread is being approached with heterogeneous methodologies ranging from pure time series analysis to ecological models using climatic parameters especially temperature and humidity giuliani et al 2020 nickbakhsh et al 2020 sajadi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however the pandemic seems to be spreading in all world cities without evident environmental hindrances nevertheless some countries are experiencing a lower rate of disease cases that might be related to their particular population and climatic conditions but the exact effect of these conditions on infection rate is still unclear roser et al 2020 several approaches have been used to estimate the potential spatial outreach of the virus and the geophysical and climatic data that may foster disease transmission ecological niche models enms have been extensively and effectively used in this context costa and peterson 2012 davison 2007 misra and kalita 2010 wahlgren 2011 zhang et al 2019 enms aim is to predict the presence of a particular species in a geographical area by correlating species specific occurrence records in its native habitat presence records with specific environmental parameters elith and leathwick 2009 the species niche can be defined as the space within a hypervolume of numerical vectors corresponding to environmental parameter ranges which is correlated with the species presence and that fosters population persistence hutchinsonian ecological niche accuracy in the identification of this hypervolume can also be enhanced if the species absence information is included in the model as either expert estimated or mathematically simulated information chuine and beaubien 2008 coro et al 2016 2015b pearson 2012 peterson et al 2011 enms have heterogeneous approaches and implementations for example they can explicitly model a species environmental preferences and physiological limits mechanistic models or they can automatically estimate the correlation between the parameter vectors and the species presence correlative models once the model has estimated the species ecological niche it can then project the niche characteristics across the native geographical area to reproduce the actual species distribution and subsequently extrapolate across another area even at the global scale to discover new potential suitable places for the species persistence most enms that predict virus spread use correlative approaches implemented as machine learning or statistical models these models can reach a high prediction accuracy on disease outreach because viruses and pandemics are known to be supported by particular geophysical characteristics and potentially by ecological and socioeconomic changes carlson et al 2016 earn et al 2000 morse et al 2012 scheffer 2009 scheffer and van nes 2018 enms have been extensively used to discover these characteristics directly or indirectly by tracing viruses principal vectors fuller et al 2013 linden 2006 medley 2010 peterson et al 2006 samy et al 2016 signorini et al 2014 tachiiri et al 2006 valiakos et al 2014 walton et al 2010 zhu and peterson 2014 in particular the maximum entropy model maxent has been often used as an enm due to its flexibility to work with both presence and presence absence data scenarios coro et al 2015b 2013 elith et al 2011 phillips et al 2004 also maxent can estimate the influence of each parameter on the identification of the niche i e the most important parameters to understand a virus preferred conditions for these reasons maxent has often been used to trace the ecological niche of a virus based on pure geophysical parameters or human related parameters e g population density and urbanised area and also to understand how climate change might foster the virus spread koch et al 2016 miller et al 2012 peristeraki et al 2006 samy and peterson 2016 in this paper maxent is used to estimate a global scale distribution of sars cov 2 high infection rate and consequently of potential covid 19 high spread rate differing from the other cited works this model concentrates on infection rate rather than on absolute spread numbers further the proposed model uses a complex combination of parameters to identify locations that could favour infection due to their particular geophysical and human related characteristics as a result it predicts a high probability of infection increase in many actual known infection areas e g the hubei province in china the presented enm is trained based on locations in italy that have reported a high rate of new infections also it facilitates geophysical surface air temperature precipitation and elevation and human related carbon dioxide and population density data vectors associated with these locations the implemented model produces a probability map where higher values indicate a correlation with high infection rate lower non zero values indicate a lower correlation and zero indicates unsuitable conditions for infection increase a risk index is also calculated out of the produced probability distribution and identifies most world countries with known high covid 19 spread rate as high risk zones overall the present work suggests that the involved parameters may play a key role in monitoring covid 19 spread rate the research question answered by the present work is given the climatic geophysical and human related parameters that other studies have individually correlated with a high covid 19 infection rate and that are publicly accessible can we infer their overall weights and predict infection rate with high accuracy this paper is organised in the following way section 2 describes the used data and the modelling approach and subsequently section 3 reports performance evaluation metrics model s parametrisation and performance at predicting global high infection rate zones section 4 discusses results and conclusions reporting the possible applications and future extensions of the presented model 2 material and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 data selection methodology and data availability the methodology presented in this paper aims to be repeatable reproducible and re usable for experiments on covid 19 and other diseases for this reason only data which met the principles of findability accessibility interoperability and re usability were used fair data geospatial data accessible through representational standards published on public geospatial services were preferred in order to maximise their usage in the implemented model and further experiments all used data table 1 were post processed and transformed into gridded raster files and were made available through the zenodo open access repository coro 2020a and the unidata thredds service of the d4science e infrastructure coro 2020b while respecting their primary sources citation requirements the model used an annual data set so as not to be limited to the last winter spring season 2 1 2 training and test data the italian civil protection department the national body that deals with emergency events publishes daily updates on the number of people infected recovered and mortalities from covid 19 per region and province italian civil protection department 2020 data up to the end of march 2020 fig 1 a i e the period of maximum infection rate in italy were used as a reference to identify locations with high infection rates on the basis of the derivative of the values among all available covid 19 global reports italian data are particularly applicable to train an enm because i italy has been the first european country to be both heavily impacted by the virus and to study the virus and ii infections in italy have been reported on the basis of tens of thousands blanket tests in italy a correlation between temperature and humidity increase and covid 19 spread has been assessed italian ministry of health 2020 scafetta 2020 tuscany regional health agency 2020 in agreement with studies on other areas section 2 1 3 indeed despite the easing of the lockdown to lower levels and the consequential increase of human interactions the disease spread has been decreasing from may 2020 gedi 2020 at the end of april 2020 the italian prime minister presented a plan of progressive lockdown level reduction which also included possible regional restrictions in the case of a localised disease rate increase italian government 2020 however significant increments were not observed and thus special regional restrictions were not applied to better understand this phenomenon italy has started national projects to investigate the cause and effect relationships between the lockdown environmental factors and tourism and to publish data and results under fair principles cnr 2020 due to this range of considerations italy presents an optimum scenario to apply the proposed analysis however other countries are experiencing a high infection rate but have climatic conditions that are very different from the european ones the identification of all these conditions would require more significant research and data collection initiatives for the scopes of the presented experiment italian locations with a high virus infection rate were selected by first calculating average rates of infected people per province and then by studying the distribution of these quantities a total of 54 provinces was selected by applying this approach the detailed table is available in coro 2020a a chi squared test confirmed that the distribution of infection rates could be approximated by a log normal distribution consequently provinces with a high infection rate were identified and selected as those with infection rates over the geometric mean of the rates these data were used as reference observations of the modelled phenomenon to train an ecological niche model it is worth noting that using average infection rate instead of absolute infection counts helps reducing a data bias due to the number of undetected cases of infection in italy john hopkins university publishes daily updates regarding covid 19 infections and mortality statistics by collecting reports from the world countries dong et al 2020 data are given at a national scale for most countries and at a regional scale for other countries e g china u s a and canada fig 1 b unfortunately reports from different countries are poorly comparable between them given the different countries approaches to disease identification and monitoring reuters 2020 thus mixing these data with italian province data was not optimal for modelling nevertheless global data were used as a reference to test the prediction performance of an aggregated risk index built upon the model s output section 2 3 to this aim the countries regions with the highest infection rates were selected using the same statistical analysis applied to italian data which resulted in 72 locations the detailed table is available in coro 2020a 2 1 3 input parameters surface air temperature and precipitation the nasa earth exchange platform hosts long term daily forecasts between 1950 and 2100 at a 0 25

of average surface air temperature and precipitation figs 1 c and d were used due to their correlation with covid 19 and similar viruses casanova et al 2010 chan et al 2011 chaudhuri et al 2020 ficetola and rubolini 2020 ma et al 2020 oliveiros et al 2020 qi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and their general coupled involvement in virus ecological niche models carlson et al 2016 fuller et al 2013 patz 1998 valiakos et al 2014 additionally precipitation was also used as a surrogate of humidity baskerville and cobey 2017 chen et al 2012 masunaga 2012 italian provinces present a high variability of surface air temperature and precipitation at the same elevation there are temperature differences as high as 7 and precipitation differing of more than one order of magnitude this variability increases the representativeness of italian provinces as a training set elevation the united states national geophysical data center ngdc hosts a global dataset of elevation and depth at a

human related activity which are generally correlated with virus spread and may foster covid 19 spread bbc 2020 clay et al 2018 godzinski and suarez castillo 2019 han et al 2020 ispra 2020 lam et al 2016 liu et al 2019 tasci et al 2018 ye et al 2016 alternative parameters of co 2 correlated with air pollution were also tested but produced more adverse results section 3 2 population density studies on complex systems dynamics have highlighted that epidemics happen only beyond a critical threshold of population density that depends on infectivity recovery and mortality rates earn et al 2000 scheffer 2009 the center for international earth science information network openly publishes up to date population density data as gridded datasets with resolutions ranging from30 to 1 warszawski et al 2017 for the scopes of this paper the gridded population of the world dataset version 4 was used at a 0 5 resolution fig 1 g to include population density factors that could be correlated with infection rate 2 2 modelling the experiment presented required training of maxent models with several alternative parametrisations in order to identify the model with the highest performance and the best combination of parameters section 2 3 to this aim the gcube dataminer cloud computing platform was used this is an open source system that is able to process big data and offers over 400 free to use processes as a service from multiple domains assante et al 2019 coro et al 2015a this platform maximises the re usability of processes through a standard web processing service wps interface coro et al 2017 further dataminer parallelises the training of models on a network of 100 machines while choosing the best computational configuration among a range of powerful multi core virtual machines ubuntu 14 04 5 lts x86 64 with 16 virtual cpus 16 gb of random access memory and 100 gb of storage capacity additionally the system stores all trained models and their respective parametrisations under the standard and exportable prov o ontological format lebo et al 2013 this representation allows to recover the complete set of input output data and metadata which enable any other authorised user to reproduce and repeat an experiment provenance of the computation the open science concepts of re usability of processes and of reproducibility and repeatability of the experiments allow the implementation of a methodology that can in principle be extended to analyse other diseases section 4 to this aim dataminer hosts a maxent model as a service cnr 2019 phillips et al 2019 which can work on textual input files csvs that include pairs of coordinates related to a certain phenomenon and fair input geospatial data the wps interface allows i inclusion of this service in complex workflows through a wide range of workflow management systems which support this standard berthold et al 2009 qgis 2011 wolstencroft et al 2013 and ii re use of the service across multiple domains coro et al 2015b 2013 coro and trumpy 2020b coro et al 2018 2 2 1 model description maxent is a machine learning model commonly used in ecological niche modelling baldwin 2009 coro et al 2015b 2018 phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudik 2008 phillips et al 2004 it simulates a probability density function œÄ x defined on real valued vectors of parameters x taken at locations where a species occurs in its native habitat coro et al 2018 pearson 2012 the advantage of maxent with respect to other models is that it can learn from positive examples only thus it does not necessarily need absence data which are instead automatically estimated considering the high infection rate of italian provinces as species occurrences the parameters associated with these areas were treated as a positive example of input vectors to train the model one drawback of maxent is that its prediction performance is very sensitive to data quality elith and leathwick 2009 an additional consideration for using only italian data and not combining data from other countries reuters 2020 the maxent training algorithm adjusts the model s internal variables so that i the simulated density function œÄ x is compliant with pre calculated mean values at training set locations and ii the entropy of the density function h œÄ x ln œÄ x is maximum for these locations elith et al 2011 maxent maximises the entropy function for training locations divided by the entropy values of the parameters of random points taken in the training set area background points phillips et al 2006 the model involves a linear combination of the input parameters whose coefficients reproduce the influence of each variable on the prediction of the training set locations percent contribution further the model estimates the dependency of the performance on the permutation of each parameter in the training vectors permutation importance in this experiment maxent uses the data vectors x of italian high infection rate provinces and of background points in italy to estimate the probability density œÄ x p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e x that a location would foster a high infection rate to this aim the model estimates the ratio between the probability density f x of the vectors across italy and the probability density in the high infection rate locations f 1 x the bayes rule defines the relation between p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e x f x and f 1 x p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e x f 1 x p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e f x with p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e being the prior distribution of high infection rate zones in italy prevalence fixed to 0 5 by default i e no prior assumption is given maxent hypothesises that the optimal f 1 x distribution is the closest distribution to f x because without any training set location there would be no expectation about certain conditions over the others i e f x is a null model for f 1 x also the model constraints f 1 x to reflect the observations on the training set i e f 1 x should estimate high probability on parameters values close to the parameters means over the training set the model uses kullback leibler divergence relative entropy to measure the distance between the two functions d f 1 x f x x f 1 x l o g 2 f 1 x f x the aim of the training algorithm is to minimise this distance under the above constraints which in turn maximises the entropy of the target probability density it can be demonstrated that this characterization uniquely determines f 1 x as belonging to the following family of gibbs distributions phillips et al 2006 f 1 x f x e Œ∑ x with Œ∑ x Œ± Œ≤ h x Œ± being a normalization constant that makes f 1 x sum to 1 h being an optional transformation of the vectors x that possibly models complex relationships between parameters Œ≤ being the vector of coefficients that reports the percent contribution of each parameter thus the ratio f 1 x f x is equal to e Œ∑ x i e maxent needs to solve a log linear model based on the background and training vectors to estimate the Œ± and Œ≤ parameters which can be implemented through a penalised maximum likelihood algorithm phillips and dud 2008 after the training phase the parameters percent contribution can be used to select the most influential parameters for the model this potentially allows to use maxent as a filter to select those parameters carrying the highest quantity of information coro et al 2015b 2013 2018 a maxent model trained on 0 5 resolution parameters can be reasonably used to produce probability distributions at the same resolution given the semantics of the selected training locations the model produced a distribution function that could be interpreted as a global scale probability

and specificity are equal and iii the minimum threshold at which all training locations are correctly classified as high infection rate areas in order to numerically estimate the prediction performance of the trained model a risk index was also calculated defined as the normalised density of non zero maxent probability locations coro et al 2018 mcgeoch et al 2006 for all countries regions reported in the global dataset of infection rates section 2 1 high risk zones were identified as those with a risk index higher than the geometric mean of the risk values accuracy on the correct identification of high infection rate countries regions as high risk zones was calculated as n o f h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e a r e a s i d e n t i f i e d o v e r a l l n o f h i g h i

statistical coefficient estimates the agreement between the two classifications with respect to purely random classifications agreement by chance an overall interpretation of this value was assigned using fleiss tables fleiss 1971 3 results 3 1 global scale distribution and performance the maxent model was trained using different combinations of parameters associated with italian locations reporting a high rate of infections up to the end of march 2020 section 2 1 training the model on all parameters produced the highest auc and optimal estimates for the three model s thresholds table 2 a when the model was trained with any other parameter subset auc resulted lower this property indicates that all parameters bring useful information to estimate training set locations correctly nevertheless the percent contribution and permutation importance of carbon dioxide surface air temperature and precipitation are much higher than the ones of elevation and population density table 3 the model using all parameters also indicates a correlation with high infection rate for particular parameter ranges i e the boundaries of the niche hypervolume co 2 has the highest correlation around 0 03 0 01 0 08 g c m 2 d a y 1 moderate high air temperature around 11 8 8 0 16 0 c moderate low and precipitation around 0 3 0 2 0 45 10 4 k g m 2 s 1 moderate the model was projected at the global scale to produce a global infection rate probability distribution at a 0 5 resolution fig 2 for each cell this map reports the probability that the cell has suitable conditions for infection increase locations with a value higher than the balanced threshold œÄ x 0 4 can be classified as high infection rate locations whereas the other two thresholds indicate medium infection rate 0 1 œÄ x 0 4 and low infection rate 0 008 œÄ x 0 1 locations zero probability locations indicate unsuitable areas for an infection rate increase as a qualitative evaluation it can be observed that the model correctly and precisely identifies the locations of real world high infection rates e g the hubei chinese region western united states and most of europe instead wrongly classified places are for example peru and brazil that have parameter ranges out of the niche hypervolume the identification of the climatic geophysical parameters fostering infection rate increase in these countries would require further research based on a more extensive and globally shared data collection section 3 3 in order to quantify the prediction accuracy of the map the risk index was used to select high risk zones and compare them with global reports of high infection rates fig 3 and table 2 b accuracy at predicting high infection rate countries region reached 77 25 and the overall agreement 0 46 was good according to fleiss classification this result indicates that most countries regions are correctly and non randomly classified and thus the model has extracted a correct characterisation of the actual risk of infection increase based on the considered parameters 3 2 the weight of the co 2 parameter the high correlation of co 2 with high infection rate requires a further investigation starting from the correlation between air pollution and covid 19 spread section 2 1 4 the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service provides fair data correlated with greenhouse gas concentration and fluxes i e methane ch 4 nitrous oxide n 2 o and co 2 cams 2020 the ch 4 and n 2 o influence on prediction performance was evaluated by substituting these parameters to co 2 in the all parameter model individual models and then by using them together with co 2 mixed model the aggregated data used for this analysis were published as fair data on zenodo coro 2020a executing the maxent individual models revealed that ch 4 and n 2 o have a much lower percent contribution 52 for both models to infection rate prediction than co 2 87 2 furthermore their individual models reported a lower auc 0 90 v s 0 994 of the co 2 model however in these models ch 4 and n 2 o were always the parameters having the highest percent contribution to infection rate prediction this property indicates that the parameters correlated with greenhouse gases concentration are of high importance for prediction accuracy which confirms the correlation between air pollution and infection rate highlighted by other studies section 2 1 4 the mixed model further confirmed this result because it gained the same performance as the co 2 individual model to predict high risk zones 77 25 however the mixed model reported a much higher percent contribution of co 2 85 9 than of ch 4 0 4 and n 2 o 0 4 this result indicates that ch 4 and n 2 o are not adding a substantially more predictive information than co 2 overall this analysis indicates that co 2 is the correct choice to represent air pollution in the experiment 3 3 training and input data completeness in order to evaluate if italian provinces were a sufficient representative training set for the reported experiment the all parameter maxent model was executed by incrementally adding more world areas to the training set first the geographical areas of large cities correctly predicted by the original model were added i e madrid london istanbul buenos aires this operation did not change the model s risk prediction performance 77 25 which indicates that italian provinces are strong representation of the correctly detected world cities as an additional step world city areas that were wrongly predicted by the original model were incrementally introduced i e s√£o paulo lima santiago de chile guayaquil this process produced a continuously decreasing auc also if ch 4 and n 2 o were used instead of co 2 when involving these world cities one major effect on the parameter ranges was a change in the upper confidence limit which increased for temperature from 16 0 to 18 8 c and precipitation from 0 45 to 0 6 10 4 k g m 2 s 1 and the decreased for co 2 from 0 08 to 0 05 g c m 2 d a y 1 the decreasing auc indicates that these ranges are not able to make the model cover all the areas of the training set this result indicates that the used input parameters are insufficient to understand the infection rate increase in these areas independent of the use of italian provinces as the training set 4 discussion and conclusions this paper has presented a methodology to estimate a geographical probability distribution of high infection rate for sars cov 2 based on geophysical and human related parameters a risk index has been proposed based on this probability distribution to identify global countries and regions that would mostly favour a high infection rate a good concurrence with country reported data and a moderate high accuracy at predicting high infection rate countries regions indicates that the model was able to identify real conditions of increased infection rate in many world areas generally the model indicates a high infection rate in areas characterised by an annual moderate high level of co 2 moderate low temperatures and moderate precipitation the most notable result is that although the model was trained only with italian cities it assigns a high infection rate probability and a high risk classification to most real world scenarios where a high infection rate has been actually reported also the results indicate that climatic parameters such as air temperature and precipitation or air humidity play a critical role at defining locations that may be subject to a high infection rate the model also indicates a temperature range which other studies have also correlated with the spread of covid 19 sajadi et al 2020 additionally estimated high rates in moderate precipitation regions might be related to reduced transmission in high humidity zones wang et al 2020 carbon dioxide is the most influential parameter which is correlated directly with pollution which concurs with covid 19 spread han et al 2020 and indirectly with population density correlation with population density could be one reason for the lower influence of this parameter on prediction performance however the fact that all parameters are necessary to achieve the optimal model performance indicates that they all contain complementary information thus population density is not entirely covered by co 2 indeed it affirms the complex system dynamics theory that if a population is vulnerable to a virus and its density exceeds a threshold an epidemic will occur scheffer 2009 in the case of sars cov 2 the presented results indicate a likely scenario where after this threshold population density does not influence infection rate anymore this observation is valid in italy where provinces with population densities distant of almost two orders of magnitude have reported similar infection rates for a long period e g lucca and naples as for elevation the model indicates that this is not a discriminant feature as also demonstrated by the variability in the altitudes of high infection rate italian provinces however elevation brings some information to the model probably related to drier weather conditions because without this parameter the model s auc decreases currently the complete set of parameters correlated with covid 19 infection rate increase remains unknown the reported results indicate that the used parameters are sufficient to predict the situation in europe and in many world countries however there are additional unknown factors to be investigated in the misidentified countries e g brazil ecuador and peru the identification of all these factors is a broader question that goes beyond this paper and would require on the field data collection and a global scale effort also to make data available under fair principles the proposed open science oriented methodology is quickly reusable on new infections and epidemics for example to predict the risk that a particular country will be subject to a high rate of cases of a new infection also the results may be the basis of other models that may refine the resolution of the presented model and revise the parameters used one fundamental step is to collect and prepare fair data correlated to infection rate as open access standardised geospatial datasets the d4science e infrastructure can be used freely and openly to this aim moreover the maximum entropy process was published as a free to use service cnr 2019 intended for global health care systems and epidemic prevention organizations and for possibly contributing to covid 19 spread control overall the presented results clearly indicate and identify that the influence of geophysical climatic and human related parameters on covid 19 infection rate should be further investigated as a future extension the model will be enhanced by increasing the projection resolution to 0 1 on specific areas to produce regional scale distributions the corresponding cloud computing service will be used to i explore a more extensive set of parameters taken from open access repositories ii understand the importance of climatic factors with respect to human related factors in covid 19 infection rate and iii detect seasonal trends declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

24808,covid 19 pandemic is a global threat to human health and economy that requires urgent prevention and monitoring strategies several models are under study to control the disease spread and infection rate and to detect possible factors that might favour them with a focus on understanding the correlation between the disease and specific geophysical parameters however the pandemic does not present evident environmental hindrances in the infected countries nevertheless a lower rate of infections has been observed in some countries which might be related to particular population and climatic conditions in this paper infection rate of covid 19 is modelled globally at a 0 5 resolution using a maximum entropy based ecological niche model that identifies geographical areas potentially subject to a high infection rate the model identifies locations that could favour infection rate due to their particular geophysical surface air temperature precipitation and elevation and human related characteristics co 2 and population density it was trained by facilitating data from italian provinces that have reported a high infection rate and subsequently tested using datasets from world countries reports based on this model a risk index was calculated to identify the potential world countries and regions that have a high risk of disease increment the distribution outputs foresee a high infection rate in many locations where real world disease outbreaks have occurred e g the hubei province in china and reports a high risk of disease increment in most world countries which have reported significant outbreaks e g western u s a overall the results suggest that a complex combination of the selected parameters might be of integral importance to understand the propagation of covid 19 among human populations particularly in europe the model and the data were distributed through open science web services to maximise opportunities for re usability regarding new data and new diseases and also to enhance the transparency of the approach and results keywords ecological niche modelling coronavirus sars cov 2 covid 19 maximum entropy 1 introduction the spread of the covid 19 pandemic caused by the sars cov 2 virus is significantly afflicting both society and the global economy and urgently calls for the development of systems capable of monitoring and predicting the risk of infection the modelling of sars cov 2 spread is being approached with heterogeneous methodologies ranging from pure time series analysis to ecological models using climatic parameters especially temperature and humidity giuliani et al 2020 nickbakhsh et al 2020 sajadi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however the pandemic seems to be spreading in all world cities without evident environmental hindrances nevertheless some countries are experiencing a lower rate of disease cases that might be related to their particular population and climatic conditions but the exact effect of these conditions on infection rate is still unclear roser et al 2020 several approaches have been used to estimate the potential spatial outreach of the virus and the geophysical and climatic data that may foster disease transmission ecological niche models enms have been extensively and effectively used in this context costa and peterson 2012 davison 2007 misra and kalita 2010 wahlgren 2011 zhang et al 2019 enms aim is to predict the presence of a particular species in a geographical area by correlating species specific occurrence records in its native habitat presence records with specific environmental parameters elith and leathwick 2009 the species niche can be defined as the space within a hypervolume of numerical vectors corresponding to environmental parameter ranges which is correlated with the species presence and that fosters population persistence hutchinsonian ecological niche accuracy in the identification of this hypervolume can also be enhanced if the species absence information is included in the model as either expert estimated or mathematically simulated information chuine and beaubien 2008 coro et al 2016 2015b pearson 2012 peterson et al 2011 enms have heterogeneous approaches and implementations for example they can explicitly model a species environmental preferences and physiological limits mechanistic models or they can automatically estimate the correlation between the parameter vectors and the species presence correlative models once the model has estimated the species ecological niche it can then project the niche characteristics across the native geographical area to reproduce the actual species distribution and subsequently extrapolate across another area even at the global scale to discover new potential suitable places for the species persistence most enms that predict virus spread use correlative approaches implemented as machine learning or statistical models these models can reach a high prediction accuracy on disease outreach because viruses and pandemics are known to be supported by particular geophysical characteristics and potentially by ecological and socioeconomic changes carlson et al 2016 earn et al 2000 morse et al 2012 scheffer 2009 scheffer and van nes 2018 enms have been extensively used to discover these characteristics directly or indirectly by tracing viruses principal vectors fuller et al 2013 linden 2006 medley 2010 peterson et al 2006 samy et al 2016 signorini et al 2014 tachiiri et al 2006 valiakos et al 2014 walton et al 2010 zhu and peterson 2014 in particular the maximum entropy model maxent has been often used as an enm due to its flexibility to work with both presence and presence absence data scenarios coro et al 2015b 2013 elith et al 2011 phillips et al 2004 also maxent can estimate the influence of each parameter on the identification of the niche i e the most important parameters to understand a virus preferred conditions for these reasons maxent has often been used to trace the ecological niche of a virus based on pure geophysical parameters or human related parameters e g population density and urbanised area and also to understand how climate change might foster the virus spread koch et al 2016 miller et al 2012 peristeraki et al 2006 samy and peterson 2016 in this paper maxent is used to estimate a global scale distribution of sars cov 2 high infection rate and consequently of potential covid 19 high spread rate differing from the other cited works this model concentrates on infection rate rather than on absolute spread numbers further the proposed model uses a complex combination of parameters to identify locations that could favour infection due to their particular geophysical and human related characteristics as a result it predicts a high probability of infection increase in many actual known infection areas e g the hubei province in china the presented enm is trained based on locations in italy that have reported a high rate of new infections also it facilitates geophysical surface air temperature precipitation and elevation and human related carbon dioxide and population density data vectors associated with these locations the implemented model produces a probability map where higher values indicate a correlation with high infection rate lower non zero values indicate a lower correlation and zero indicates unsuitable conditions for infection increase a risk index is also calculated out of the produced probability distribution and identifies most world countries with known high covid 19 spread rate as high risk zones overall the present work suggests that the involved parameters may play a key role in monitoring covid 19 spread rate the research question answered by the present work is given the climatic geophysical and human related parameters that other studies have individually correlated with a high covid 19 infection rate and that are publicly accessible can we infer their overall weights and predict infection rate with high accuracy this paper is organised in the following way section 2 describes the used data and the modelling approach and subsequently section 3 reports performance evaluation metrics model s parametrisation and performance at predicting global high infection rate zones section 4 discusses results and conclusions reporting the possible applications and future extensions of the presented model 2 material and methods 2 1 data 2 1 1 data selection methodology and data availability the methodology presented in this paper aims to be repeatable reproducible and re usable for experiments on covid 19 and other diseases for this reason only data which met the principles of findability accessibility interoperability and re usability were used fair data geospatial data accessible through representational standards published on public geospatial services were preferred in order to maximise their usage in the implemented model and further experiments all used data table 1 were post processed and transformed into gridded raster files and were made available through the zenodo open access repository coro 2020a and the unidata thredds service of the d4science e infrastructure coro 2020b while respecting their primary sources citation requirements the model used an annual data set so as not to be limited to the last winter spring season 2 1 2 training and test data the italian civil protection department the national body that deals with emergency events publishes daily updates on the number of people infected recovered and mortalities from covid 19 per region and province italian civil protection department 2020 data up to the end of march 2020 fig 1 a i e the period of maximum infection rate in italy were used as a reference to identify locations with high infection rates on the basis of the derivative of the values among all available covid 19 global reports italian data are particularly applicable to train an enm because i italy has been the first european country to be both heavily impacted by the virus and to study the virus and ii infections in italy have been reported on the basis of tens of thousands blanket tests in italy a correlation between temperature and humidity increase and covid 19 spread has been assessed italian ministry of health 2020 scafetta 2020 tuscany regional health agency 2020 in agreement with studies on other areas section 2 1 3 indeed despite the easing of the lockdown to lower levels and the consequential increase of human interactions the disease spread has been decreasing from may 2020 gedi 2020 at the end of april 2020 the italian prime minister presented a plan of progressive lockdown level reduction which also included possible regional restrictions in the case of a localised disease rate increase italian government 2020 however significant increments were not observed and thus special regional restrictions were not applied to better understand this phenomenon italy has started national projects to investigate the cause and effect relationships between the lockdown environmental factors and tourism and to publish data and results under fair principles cnr 2020 due to this range of considerations italy presents an optimum scenario to apply the proposed analysis however other countries are experiencing a high infection rate but have climatic conditions that are very different from the european ones the identification of all these conditions would require more significant research and data collection initiatives for the scopes of the presented experiment italian locations with a high virus infection rate were selected by first calculating average rates of infected people per province and then by studying the distribution of these quantities a total of 54 provinces was selected by applying this approach the detailed table is available in coro 2020a a chi squared test confirmed that the distribution of infection rates could be approximated by a log normal distribution consequently provinces with a high infection rate were identified and selected as those with infection rates over the geometric mean of the rates these data were used as reference observations of the modelled phenomenon to train an ecological niche model it is worth noting that using average infection rate instead of absolute infection counts helps reducing a data bias due to the number of undetected cases of infection in italy john hopkins university publishes daily updates regarding covid 19 infections and mortality statistics by collecting reports from the world countries dong et al 2020 data are given at a national scale for most countries and at a regional scale for other countries e g china u s a and canada fig 1 b unfortunately reports from different countries are poorly comparable between them given the different countries approaches to disease identification and monitoring reuters 2020 thus mixing these data with italian province data was not optimal for modelling nevertheless global data were used as a reference to test the prediction performance of an aggregated risk index built upon the model s output section 2 3 to this aim the countries regions with the highest infection rates were selected using the same statistical analysis applied to italian data which resulted in 72 locations the detailed table is available in coro 2020a 2 1 3 input parameters surface air temperature and precipitation the nasa earth exchange platform hosts long term daily forecasts between 1950 and 2100 at a 0 25

of average surface air temperature and precipitation figs 1 c and d were used due to their correlation with covid 19 and similar viruses casanova et al 2010 chan et al 2011 chaudhuri et al 2020 ficetola and rubolini 2020 ma et al 2020 oliveiros et al 2020 qi et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and their general coupled involvement in virus ecological niche models carlson et al 2016 fuller et al 2013 patz 1998 valiakos et al 2014 additionally precipitation was also used as a surrogate of humidity baskerville and cobey 2017 chen et al 2012 masunaga 2012 italian provinces present a high variability of surface air temperature and precipitation at the same elevation there are temperature differences as high as 7 and precipitation differing of more than one order of magnitude this variability increases the representativeness of italian provinces as a training set elevation the united states national geophysical data center ngdc hosts a global dataset of elevation and depth at a 0 33 resolution etopo2 noaa 2001 which includes localised correction and integration of satellite ocean sounding and land data elevation has been used in several ecological niche models for viruses

human related activity which are generally correlated with virus spread and may foster covid 19 spread bbc 2020 clay et al 2018 godzinski and suarez castillo 2019 han et al 2020 ispra 2020 lam et al 2016 liu et al 2019 tasci et al 2018 ye et al 2016 alternative parameters of co 2 correlated with air pollution were also tested but produced more adverse results section 3 2 population density studies on complex systems dynamics have highlighted that epidemics happen only beyond a critical threshold of population density that depends on infectivity recovery and mortality rates earn et al 2000 scheffer 2009 the center for international earth science information network openly publishes up to date population density data as gridded datasets with resolutions ranging from30 to 1 warszawski et al 2017 for the scopes of this paper the gridded population of the world dataset version 4 was used at a 0 5 resolution fig 1 g to include population density factors that could be correlated with infection rate 2 2 modelling the experiment presented required training of maxent models with several alternative parametrisations in order to identify the model with the highest performance and the best combination of parameters section 2 3 to this aim the gcube dataminer cloud computing platform was used this is an open source system that is able to process big data and offers over 400 free to use processes as a service from multiple domains assante et al 2019 coro et al 2015a this platform maximises the re usability of processes through a standard web processing service wps interface coro et al 2017 further dataminer parallelises the training of models on a network of 100 machines while choosing the best computational configuration among a range of powerful multi core virtual machines ubuntu 14 04 5 lts x86 64 with 16 virtual cpus 16 gb of random access memory and 100 gb of storage capacity additionally the system stores all trained models and their respective parametrisations under the standard and exportable prov o ontological format lebo et al 2013 this representation allows to recover the complete set of input output data and metadata which enable any other authorised user to reproduce and repeat an experiment provenance of the computation the open science concepts of re usability of processes and of reproducibility and repeatability of the experiments allow the implementation of a methodology that can in principle be extended to analyse other diseases section 4 to this aim dataminer hosts a maxent model as a service cnr 2019 phillips et al 2019 which can work on textual input files csvs that include pairs of coordinates related to a certain phenomenon and fair input geospatial data the wps interface allows i inclusion of this service in complex workflows through a wide range of workflow management systems which support this standard berthold et al 2009 qgis 2011 wolstencroft et al 2013 and ii re use of the service across multiple domains coro et al 2015b 2013 coro and trumpy 2020b coro et al 2018 2 2 1 model description maxent is a machine learning model commonly used in ecological niche modelling baldwin 2009 coro et al 2015b 2018 phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudik 2008 phillips et al 2004 it simulates a probability density function œÄ x defined on real valued vectors of parameters x taken at locations where a species occurs in its native habitat coro et al 2018 pearson 2012 the advantage of maxent with respect to other models is that it can learn from positive examples only thus it does not necessarily need absence data which are instead automatically estimated considering the high infection rate of italian provinces as species occurrences the parameters associated with these areas were treated as a positive example of input vectors to train the model one drawback of maxent is that its prediction performance is very sensitive to data quality elith and leathwick 2009 an additional consideration for using only italian data and not combining data from other countries reuters 2020 the maxent training algorithm adjusts the model s internal variables so that i the simulated density function œÄ x is compliant with pre calculated mean values at training set locations and ii the entropy of the density function h œÄ x ln œÄ x is maximum for these locations elith et al 2011 maxent maximises the entropy function for training locations divided by the entropy values of the parameters of random points taken in the training set area background points phillips et al 2006 the model involves a linear combination of the input parameters whose coefficients reproduce the influence of each variable on the prediction of the training set locations percent contribution further the model estimates the dependency of the performance on the permutation of each parameter in the training vectors permutation importance in this experiment maxent uses the data vectors x of italian high infection rate provinces and of background points in italy to estimate the probability density œÄ x p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e x that a location would foster a high infection rate to this aim the model estimates the ratio between the probability density f x of the vectors across italy and the probability density in the high infection rate locations f 1 x the bayes rule defines the relation between p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e x f x and f 1 x p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e x f 1 x p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e f x with p h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e being the prior distribution of high infection rate zones in italy prevalence fixed to 0 5 by default i e no prior assumption is given maxent hypothesises that the optimal f 1 x distribution is the closest distribution to f x because without any training set location there would be no expectation about certain conditions over the others i e f x is a null model for f 1 x also the model constraints f 1 x to reflect the observations on the training set i e f 1 x should estimate high probability on parameters values close to the parameters means over the training set the model uses kullback leibler divergence relative entropy to measure the distance between the two functions d f 1 x f x x f 1 x l o g 2 f 1 x f x the aim of the training algorithm is to minimise this distance under the above constraints which in turn maximises the entropy of the target probability density it can be demonstrated that this characterization uniquely determines f 1 x as belonging to the following family of gibbs distributions phillips et al 2006 f 1 x f x e Œ∑ x with Œ∑ x Œ± Œ≤ h x Œ± being a normalization constant that makes f 1 x sum to 1 h being an optional transformation of the vectors x that possibly models complex relationships between parameters Œ≤ being the vector of coefficients that reports the percent contribution of each parameter thus the ratio f 1 x f x is equal to e Œ∑ x i e maxent needs to solve a log linear model based on the background and training vectors to estimate the Œ± and Œ≤ parameters which can be implemented through a penalised maximum likelihood algorithm phillips and dud 2008 after the training phase the parameters percent contribution can be used to select the most influential parameters for the model this potentially allows to use maxent as a filter to select those parameters carrying the highest quantity of information coro et al 2015b 2013 2018 a maxent model trained on 0 5 resolution parameters can be reasonably used to produce probability distributions at the same resolution given the semantics of the selected training locations the model produced a distribution function that could be interpreted as a global scale probability distribution for sars cov 2 high infection rate 2 3 evaluation metrics the model training phase estimates the average area under the curve auc i e the integral of the receiver operating characteristic

and specificity are equal and iii the minimum threshold at which all training locations are correctly classified as high infection rate areas in order to numerically estimate the prediction performance of the trained model a risk index was also calculated defined as the normalised density of non zero maxent probability locations coro et al 2018 mcgeoch et al 2006 for all countries regions reported in the global dataset of infection rates section 2 1 high risk zones were identified as those with a risk index higher than the geometric mean of the risk values accuracy on the correct identification of high infection rate countries regions as high risk zones was calculated as n o f h i g h i n f e c t i o n r a t e a r e a s i d e n t i f i e d o v e r a l l n o f h i g h i

statistical coefficient estimates the agreement between the two classifications with respect to purely random classifications agreement by chance an overall interpretation of this value was assigned using fleiss tables fleiss 1971 3 results 3 1 global scale distribution and performance the maxent model was trained using different combinations of parameters associated with italian locations reporting a high rate of infections up to the end of march 2020 section 2 1 training the model on all parameters produced the highest auc and optimal estimates for the three model s thresholds table 2 a when the model was trained with any other parameter subset auc resulted lower this property indicates that all parameters bring useful information to estimate training set locations correctly nevertheless the percent contribution and permutation importance of carbon dioxide surface air temperature and precipitation are much higher than the ones of elevation and population density table 3 the model using all parameters also indicates a correlation with high infection rate for particular parameter ranges i e the boundaries of the niche hypervolume co 2 has the highest correlation around 0 03 0 01 0 08 g c m 2 d a y 1 moderate high air temperature around 11 8 8 0 16 0 c moderate low and precipitation around 0 3 0 2 0 45 10 4 k g m 2 s 1 moderate the model was projected at the global scale to produce a global infection rate probability distribution at a 0 5 resolution fig 2 for each cell this map reports the probability that the cell has suitable conditions for infection increase locations with a value higher than the balanced threshold œÄ x 0 4 can be classified as high infection rate locations whereas the other two thresholds indicate medium infection rate 0 1 œÄ x 0 4 and low infection rate 0 008 œÄ x 0 1 locations zero probability locations indicate unsuitable areas for an infection rate increase as a qualitative evaluation it can be observed that the model correctly and precisely identifies the locations of real world high infection rates e g the hubei chinese region western united states and most of europe instead wrongly classified places are for example peru and brazil that have parameter ranges out of the niche hypervolume the identification of the climatic geophysical parameters fostering infection rate increase in these countries would require further research based on a more extensive and globally shared data collection section 3 3 in order to quantify the prediction accuracy of the map the risk index was used to select high risk zones and compare them with global reports of high infection rates fig 3 and table 2 b accuracy at predicting high infection rate countries region reached 77 25 and the overall agreement 0 46 was good according to fleiss classification this result indicates that most countries regions are correctly and non randomly classified and thus the model has extracted a correct characterisation of the actual risk of infection increase based on the considered parameters 3 2 the weight of the co 2 parameter the high correlation of co 2 with high infection rate requires a further investigation starting from the correlation between air pollution and covid 19 spread section 2 1 4 the copernicus atmosphere monitoring service provides fair data correlated with greenhouse gas concentration and fluxes i e methane ch 4 nitrous oxide n 2 o and co 2 cams 2020 the ch 4 and n 2 o influence on prediction performance was evaluated by substituting these parameters to co 2 in the all parameter model individual models and then by using them together with co 2 mixed model the aggregated data used for this analysis were published as fair data on zenodo coro 2020a executing the maxent individual models revealed that ch 4 and n 2 o have a much lower percent contribution 52 for both models to infection rate prediction than co 2 87 2 furthermore their individual models reported a lower auc 0 90 v s 0 994 of the co 2 model however in these models ch 4 and n 2 o were always the parameters having the highest percent contribution to infection rate prediction this property indicates that the parameters correlated with greenhouse gases concentration are of high importance for prediction accuracy which confirms the correlation between air pollution and infection rate highlighted by other studies section 2 1 4 the mixed model further confirmed this result because it gained the same performance as the co 2 individual model to predict high risk zones 77 25 however the mixed model reported a much higher percent contribution of co 2 85 9 than of ch 4 0 4 and n 2 o 0 4 this result indicates that ch 4 and n 2 o are not adding a substantially more predictive information than co 2 overall this analysis indicates that co 2 is the correct choice to represent air pollution in the experiment 3 3 training and input data completeness in order to evaluate if italian provinces were a sufficient representative training set for the reported experiment the all parameter maxent model was executed by incrementally adding more world areas to the training set first the geographical areas of large cities correctly predicted by the original model were added i e madrid london istanbul buenos aires this operation did not change the model s risk prediction performance 77 25 which indicates that italian provinces are strong representation of the correctly detected world cities as an additional step world city areas that were wrongly predicted by the original model were incrementally introduced i e s√£o paulo lima santiago de chile guayaquil this process produced a continuously decreasing auc also if ch 4 and n 2 o were used instead of co 2 when involving these world cities one major effect on the parameter ranges was a change in the upper confidence limit which increased for temperature from 16 0 to 18 8 c and precipitation from 0 45 to 0 6 10 4 k g m 2 s 1 and the decreased for co 2 from 0 08 to 0 05 g c m 2 d a y 1 the decreasing auc indicates that these ranges are not able to make the model cover all the areas of the training set this result indicates that the used input parameters are insufficient to understand the infection rate increase in these areas independent of the use of italian provinces as the training set 4 discussion and conclusions this paper has presented a methodology to estimate a geographical probability distribution of high infection rate for sars cov 2 based on geophysical and human related parameters a risk index has been proposed based on this probability distribution to identify global countries and regions that would mostly favour a high infection rate a good concurrence with country reported data and a moderate high accuracy at predicting high infection rate countries regions indicates that the model was able to identify real conditions of increased infection rate in many world areas generally the model indicates a high infection rate in areas characterised by an annual moderate high level of co 2 moderate low temperatures and moderate precipitation the most notable result is that although the model was trained only with italian cities it assigns a high infection rate probability and a high risk classification to most real world scenarios where a high infection rate has been actually reported also the results indicate that climatic parameters such as air temperature and precipitation or air humidity play a critical role at defining locations that may be subject to a high infection rate the model also indicates a temperature range which other studies have also correlated with the spread of covid 19 sajadi et al 2020 additionally estimated high rates in moderate precipitation regions might be related to reduced transmission in high humidity zones wang et al 2020 carbon dioxide is the most influential parameter which is correlated directly with pollution which concurs with covid 19 spread han et al 2020 and indirectly with population density correlation with population density could be one reason for the lower influence of this parameter on prediction performance however the fact that all parameters are necessary to achieve the optimal model performance indicates that they all contain complementary information thus population density is not entirely covered by co 2 indeed it affirms the complex system dynamics theory that if a population is vulnerable to a virus and its density exceeds a threshold an epidemic will occur scheffer 2009 in the case of sars cov 2 the presented results indicate a likely scenario where after this threshold population density does not influence infection rate anymore this observation is valid in italy where provinces with population densities distant of almost two orders of magnitude have reported similar infection rates for a long period e g lucca and naples as for elevation the model indicates that this is not a discriminant feature as also demonstrated by the variability in the altitudes of high infection rate italian provinces however elevation brings some information to the model probably related to drier weather conditions because without this parameter the model s auc decreases currently the complete set of parameters correlated with covid 19 infection rate increase remains unknown the reported results indicate that the used parameters are sufficient to predict the situation in europe and in many world countries however there are additional unknown factors to be investigated in the misidentified countries e g brazil ecuador and peru the identification of all these factors is a broader question that goes beyond this paper and would require on the field data collection and a global scale effort also to make data available under fair principles the proposed open science oriented methodology is quickly reusable on new infections and epidemics for example to predict the risk that a particular country will be subject to a high rate of cases of a new infection also the results may be the basis of other models that may refine the resolution of the presented model and revise the parameters used one fundamental step is to collect and prepare fair data correlated to infection rate as open access standardised geospatial datasets the d4science e infrastructure can be used freely and openly to this aim moreover the maximum entropy process was published as a free to use service cnr 2019 intended for global health care systems and epidemic prevention organizations and for possibly contributing to covid 19 spread control overall the presented results clearly indicate and identify that the influence of geophysical climatic and human related parameters on covid 19 infection rate should be further investigated as a future extension the model will be enhanced by increasing the projection resolution to 0 1 on specific areas to produce regional scale distributions the corresponding cloud computing service will be used to i explore a more extensive set of parameters taken from open access repositories ii understand the importance of climatic factors with respect to human related factors in covid 19 infection rate and iii detect seasonal trends declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

24809,the elasticity of population growth rate Œª is a notable statistic in population projection matrix models and has been used by many empirical researchers silvertown and his collaborators published a paper in 1996 in which they mapped elasticity vectors of stasis growth and fecundity for 84 plant species in a ternary plot and reported that the elasticity vector distribution of semelparous species 10 species was located in the upper left region of the ternary plot to understand and clarify why the elasticity vectors of semelparous species were distributed in the upper left region we conducted three analyses first we used 68 matrices of semelparous species populations in the compadre plant matrix database and plotted their elasticity vectors in the ternary plot second we constructed randomly generated population projection matrices for three archetypes where several biological assumptions were made and obtained their elasticity vector distributions we showed that the high fecundity and or immediate death after reproduction shifted the elasticity vector distribution to the upper left region of the plot third we examined the evolutionary change in the distribution using a population projection matrix model in which the trade off between fecundity and adult survival was incorporated the evolutionary trajectory derived from the trade off model showed that the evolutionary consequence of semelparity was located in the upper left more than was that of iteroparity in the ternary plot synthesizing the results derived from the three analyses we concluded that the distinctive distribution of the elasticity vectors of semelparous species is the outcome of natural selection under the trade off with low convexity and the outcome of the resultant big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction keywords comparative biology demographic simulation population matrix models evolutionary trajectory 1 introduction semelparity has been intensively studied in evolutionary demography since cole 1954 suggested an evolutionary reason for the development of semelparous species in plants and animals semelparous species such as salmon bamboos certain palm trees and monocarpic herbs show a specific demographic pattern specifically individuals die immediately after reproduction abandoning the opportunity for future reproduction because iteroparous species seem to be more advantageous than semelparous species because of their high frequency of reproduction high fecundity in semelparous species is considered to compensate for the eliminated future opportunity for reproduction under the trade off between fecundity and adult survival charnov and schaffer 1973 pianka 1976 1978 in fact several researchers have reported the high fecundity referred to big bang reproduction in monocarpic palm trees and monocarpic biennials harper and white 1974 pianka 1976 meekins and mccarthy 2002 pianka 1976 also characterized semelparity as big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction metcalf et al 2003 vaupel et al 2013 the author proposed a mathematical model to calculate the present offspring and the expectation of future offspring when mature individuals do not die immediately after reproduction and he obtained the mathematical conditions under which semelparity or iteroparity should be favoured furthermore many theoreticians have attempted to obtain these conditions using several mathematical formulations charnov and shaffer 1973 charlesworth 1980 bulmer 1985 takada 1995 therefore which life history i e semelparity or iteroparity is selected during the course of evolution is one of the central issues in evolutionary ecology silvertown et al 1996 also attempted to clarify the difference in demographic pattern between iteroparous and semelparous plants using elasticity analysis in matrix population models mpms the elasticity eij of the population growth rate Œª is a notable statistic in mpms and has been used by many empirical researchers and is defined as the relative change in Œª responding to the relative change in matrix elements aij as follows e ij lim Œ¥ a ij 0 Œ¥ Œª Œª Œ¥ a ij a ij a ij Œª Œª a ij pfister 1998 kaneko et al 1999 cruz rodriguez et al 2009 salguero g√≥mez and de kroon 2010 kaneko and takada 2014 the formula is 1 e ij a ij Œª v i w j k v k w k where vi or uj represents the i th or the j th element of the left or right eigenvector of the projection matrix in mpms respectively caswell et al 1984 de kroon et al 1986 caswell 2001 yokomizo et al 2017 silvertown et al proposed an elaborative idea to divide the elements of the elasticity matrix into three demographic processes i e fecundity growth and stasis the sum of the elasticities in each category was defined as e fecundity e growth and e stasis respectively silvertown and franco 1993 silvertown et al 1993 1996 franco and silvertown 1996 2004 because 2 e fecundity e growth e stasis 1 the elasticity vector e e fecundity e growth e stasis of any mpm can be plotted in the equilateral triangle with side 1 long fig 1 a the authors obtained the elasticity vectors for 84 plant species mapped them on a ternary plot and showed that the elasticity vector distribution in the ternary plot depended on its life form or life history fig 1b 1d there were three characteristic patterns in terms of the elasticity vector distribution of plants on ternary plots silvertown et al 1996 takada et al 2018 first few elasticity vectors were found in the lower half of the plot fig 1 second most of the elasticity vectors of perennial herbs fig 1c and trees fig 1d were concentrated in the upper right region third semelparous species were distributed in the upper left region of the plot where the changes in growth and fecundity had a stronger impact than that of stasis on the change in Œª fig 1b takada et al 2018 explored the reasons explaining the first two patterns however the third question i e why the elasticity vector distribution of semelparous species is so distinctive is still unanswered to understand and clarify why the elasticity vector distribution of semelparous species was distributed in the specific region we conducted three analyses in the present paper first we selected the matrices of semelparous species populations from the compadre plant matrix database and plotted their elasticity vectors in the ternary plot salguero g√≥mez et al 2015 we compared our new result to the result obtained by silvertown et al 1996 second we artificially constructed mpms whose elements were randomly generated from two probability distributions randomly generated population matrix rpm hereafter in constructing the rpms we set three archetypes a a semelparous type where the survival at the adult stage was always zero which means semelparous adult individuals die immediately after reproduction b an iteroparous type where the survival at the adult stage was positive and c a sparse semelparous type matrix where the individuals cannot grow quickly third we proposed an rpm model in which the trade off between fecundity and adult survival was incorporated to examine the evolutionary trajectory to semelparous or iteroparous species on the ternary plot the questions addressed in this study are i where are the elasticities of semelparous species in the compadre database located in the ternary plot ii does the inherent structure of semelparous species i e big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction shift the elasticity vector distribution and if so is this shift related to population growth rates iii how does the trade off between survival and fecundity influence the elasticity vector distributions and the evolution of life cycles 2 methods 2 1 elasticity analysis of semelparous species in the compadre database the compadre database ver 4 0 1 contains 2283 mean population projection matrices for 695 plant species and these matrices each represents the mean matrix of a single research site over the research period or of a single research time step over several research sites salguero g√≥mez et al 2015 to guarantee the projection matrices are of highest quality we applied 4 selection criteria a the stage specific survival rates were 1 because survival rates should not exceed 1 b the fecundity was explicitly measured because of the definition of semelparous species c the sampling periodicity 1 to keep the consistency of the time step of population growth rate and d the matrix was irreducible and primitive so that the elasticities can be calculated correctly see pp 79 91 in caswell 2001 among the selected high quality mean matrices we searched for semelparous type matrices in which individuals at the adult stage s produced offspring in the earlier stage s and their survival probabilities were zero we conducted the elasticity analysis for those 68 semelparous type matrices obtained the elasticities and summed them up to three components of a vector e e fecundity e growth e stasis this approach followed the description in silvertown et al 1996 i e the elements of elasticities categorized in f in 3 s s f f g s s s g g s s g g g s were summed to e fecundity and those in s were summed to e stasis and so on note that the selected matrices had a variety of matrix dimensions and the dimension was not always equal to four as exemplified by eq 3 additionally the number of elements categorized in f differed in each selected matrix the obtained elasticity vectors were plotted in a ternary plot to compare the results obtained from the compadre database and the results obtained by silvertown et al 1996 2 2 elasticity analysis of semelparous rpms to answer the second addressed question posed in the introduction we constructed 4 4 rpms with two basic demographic processes fecundity f and transition probabilities from j th stage to i th stage tij all the computer programmes used to construct the rpms were coded by mathematica 10 wolfram research inc the rpms contained only one fecundity element in t 14 i e 4 a 0 0 0 f t 21 t 22 t 23 0 t 31 t 32 t 33 0 t 41 t 42 t 43 0 it should be noted that here f represents the combined outcome of seed production and seedling establishment eq 4 is a random matrix of semelparous species because semelparity means that adult individuals die after reproduction and the survival probability i e the sum of t 24 t 34 and t 44 is zero therefore those elements are all equal to zero in eq 4 the fecundity f was chosen randomly from a poisson distribution with an average p and the transition probabilities tij were chosen from a uniform distribution we furthermore assumed that the elements of the first row are all zero except for fecundity element because the first stage of plants are biologically distinct from the other stages and the retrogression to the first stage is rare the details of how rpms were constructed are shown in supplementary material 1 to examine the elasticity vector distribution of rpms we established three archetypes the first archetype was used to compare the elasticity vector distributions of semelparous type rpms with different fecundities and to answer whether the high fertility was one of the causes that explained the biased elasticity vector distribution of semelparous species archetype i the matrix of this type a 1 has the same form as eq 4 where f 0 0 t i j 1 0 i t i j 1 for j 1 to 3 this semelparous rpm describes a life history where individuals can progress rapidly because the positive t 41and t 42 refer to rapid progression the second archetype was used to compare the elasticity vector distributions of semelparous type rpms and iteroparous type rpms and to examine whether the immediate death following reproduction in semelparous species is a cause of the specific elasticity distribution of semelparous species reported in silvertown et al 1996 archetype ii the type describes the life history of iteroparous species which do not die immediately after reproduction a 2 0 0 0 f t 21 t 22 t 23 0 t 31 t 32 t 33 0 t 41 t 42 t 43 t 44 where f 0 0 t i j 1 0 i t i j 1 for j 1 to 4 this rpm also allows for rapid progression the third archetype was used to compare the elasticity vector distributions of the rpms of this type and the real mpms in the compadre database and to understand the distribution obtained by the mpms in the compadre database 5 archetype iii a 3 0 0 0 f t 21 t 22 0 0 0 t 32 t 33 0 0 0 t 43 0 where f 0 0 t i j 1 0 i t i j 1 in matrix a 3 the positive elements are assigned only on 1 4 element and the diagonal and lower sub diagonal elements this rpm represents the life cycle of a species in which retrogression is not allowed and progression only happens slowly therefore individuals can progress only to the next stage of development we generated 3000 rpms for each archetype the elasticities 6a 0 0 0 e 14 e 21 e 22 e 23 0 e 31 e 32 e 33 0 e 41 e 42 e 43 0 in archetype i and iii and 6b 0 0 0 e 14 e 21 e 22 e 23 0 e 31 e 32 e 33 0 e 41 e 42 e 43 e 44 in archetype ii were calculated using the formula of elasticity in eq 1 caswell 2001 these elasticities were summed to obtain a vector e e fecundity e growth e stasis following the method explained in the introduction after silvertown et al 1996 the categorization of fecundity f growth g and stasis s in the rpms was as follows 7 0 0 0 f g s s 0 g g s 0 g g g s therefore e fecundity e 14 8 e growth e 21 e 31 e 32 e 41 e 42 e 43 e stasis e 22 e 23 e 33 e 44 the elasticity vectors e were plotted in a ternary plot for archetype i p 5 and 20 ii p 5 and iii p 5 five comparisons of the elasticity vector distributions were conducted between p 5 and 20 in archetype i between archetype i and ii when p 5 between Œª 1 and Œª 1 in archetype i between Œª 1 and Œª 1 in archetype ii and between Œª 1 and Œª 1 in archetype iii 2 3 a population projection matrix model with a trade off between fecundity and adult survival we proposed an rpm to examine the evolutionary explanation for the biased elasticity distribution in semelparity 9 0 0 0 f t 21 t 22 t 23 0 t 31 t 32 t 33 0 t 41 t 42 t 43 s where the transition probabilities tij ranged from 0 to 1 and the column sums were constrained to 1 the probabilities were generated randomly using a uniform probability distribution in a way similar to that described in section 2 2 we assumed a trade off between fecundity f and adult survival probability s to set the 1 4 and 4 4 elements in eq 9 the following three types of trade off curves were used 10a f 12 5 s 0 1 2 10 125 10b f 1 25 s 4 6 2 36 45 10c f 12 5 s 0 9 2 0 125 all the curves ranged from 0 to 0 8 in s and the maximum fecundity was 10 when s 0 and 0 when s 0 8 eq 10b is a rapidly decreasing curve compared to that in eq 10a and eq 10c is a concave curve fig 2 to examine the evolutionary trajectory of each trade off curve we calculated the dominant eigenvalue Œª of the generated matrices varying the pair of f and s given a set of randomly generated transition probabilities tij here we show how to obtain the evolutionary trajectory using a simple example first the transition probabilities tij in eq 9 are obtained so that the column sums are constrained to 1 say 0 0 0 0 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 next we chose several points on the trade off curve of eq 10b and obtained the fecundities f and the adult survivals s e g f s 2 0 649 4 0 495 6 0 336 8 0 170 and 10 0 then the values in the pairs are assigned to the 1 4 and 4 4 elements of the matrices from b 1 to b 5 as follows b 1 0 0 0 2 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 649 b 2 0 0 0 4 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 495 b 3 0 0 0 6 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 495 b 4 0 0 0 8 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 495 b 5 0 0 0 10 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 495 we calculated the population growth rates Œª of b 1 to b 5 and obtained 1 120 1 241 1 323 1 384 and 1 432 respectively for the matrices see fig 3 then we identified the direction to the point with a maximum Œª assuming that evolution occurs so that the Œª i e yearly fitness caswell 2001 metcalf and pavard 2007 increases during the course of evolution we assumed that a matrix with the maximum Œª was favoured and was finally selected in this example the evolutionary trajectory on the trade off curve is towards the left most point which means matrix b 5 is a consequence of evolution if the Œª at the left most point is the maximum semelparity is favoured in the course of evolution because the survival of adult individuals in b 5 is zero at that point otherwise iteroparity is favoured similarly the elasticity vectors e e fecundity e growth e stasis were calculated and plotted in a ternary plot to examine the evolutionary trajectory of elasticity vector on ternary plot see supplementary material 2 for details for each trade off curve the above procedure was iterated 3000 times by varying the transition probabilities tij and the 3000 consequences of evolution on the elasticity vector were plotted on a ternary plot some of them were derived from semelparous type matrices and others were derived from iteroparous type matrices 3 results 3 1 elasticity vector distribution of natural semelparous species we searched the matrices of semelparous species in the compadre plant matrix database and selected 68 matrices with high quality for 17 semelparous species table 1 supplementary material 3 there were three types of semelparous species i e biennial facultative biennial and semelparous perennial in our study a biennial species is a strict monocarpic species that obligately flowers in the second year a facultative biennial species flowers in the second year or in the succeeding years depending on the size of individuals or environmental conditions a semelparous perennial has a life span of more than two years and dies immediately after reproduction the numbers of each type of species were four four and nine respectively with populations of 26 9 and 33 respectively the elasticity vector distribution of these matrices was different from the results of silvertown et al 1996 the distribution was scattered from the upper left region to the lower right region fig 4 a although the distribution of facultative biennials was not scattered as much as the distributions of the other types the trends were common for all types of semelparous species however the mean was located in the upper central region as shown by silvertown group this result implies that the changes in growth and fecundity had a stronger impact than that of stasis on the change in Œª compared to the result for iteroparous herbs and trees fig 1 among the 68 populations a biennial herb alliaria petiolata had the greatest mean matrix data 18 populations and 18 elasticity vectors were plotted in fig 4a table 1 when extracting the elasticity vectors they were almost linearly scattered from the upper left region to the lower right region fig 4b the elasticity vectors of a petiolata populations whose population growth rates are less than 1 were plotted on the lower right region 3 2 elasticity vector distribution of three archetypes of rpms we constructed rpms of the first archetype under the condition that the average fecundity p was 5 and 20 3000 rpms each the obtained elasticity vectors were plotted on the ternary plot to examine the effect of high fecundity on the elasticity vector distribution fig 5 a and b when p 5 the distribution of the elasticity vectors was concentrated in the upper central region of the ternary plot the mean of the elasticity vectors was e fecundity e growth e stasis 0 363 0 535 0 102 the distribution in p 20 shifted to the upper left and the mean was e fecundity e growth e stasis 0 422 0 546 0 032 e fecundity increased and e stasis decreased with the increase in fecundity to examine the effect of natural selection the elasticity vectors of archetype i matrices were plotted and divided into two groups i e groups where Œªs were more than or less than 1 the distribution of the populations with Œª 1 was located more to the upper left than the distribution of the population with Œª 1 fig 5c the means were 0 379 0 543 0 078 and 0 270 0 487 0 243 respectively the populations with low growth rates would be selected out in the population dynamics and natural selection eventually caused an increase in the elasticity contribution of e fecundity and a decrease in the elasticity contribution of e stasis to examine the effect of immediate death after reproduction 3000 rpms of archetype ii were constructed when p average fecundity 5 archetype ii is the projection matrix of iteroparous species because the survival probabilities at the adult stage are positive the elasticity vector distribution of iteroparous rpms fig 5e was shifted to the lower right region compared to that of semelparous rpms fig 5a the mean was 0 292 0 446 0 262 the distribution of the populations with Œª 1 was located more to the upper left than that with Œª 1 fig 5f the means were 0 296 0 447 0 257 and 0 195 0 416 0 389 respectively the assumption in archetype iii individuals were neither allowed to retrogress nor to progress further than to its immediately superior stage led to the drastic change in the elasticity vector distribution fig 5g the distributions were linear the lines started from the corner of e fecundity 0 and the slope of the lines was 46 comparing two distributions in archetype iii depending on whether Œª or 1 a higher Œª caused the increase in the elasticity contribution of e fecundity and the decrease in the elasticity contribution of e stasis the trend is similar to the result in fig 5c and 5f 3 3 evolutionary trajectory of elasticity vector distribution in a trade off model we calculated the dominant eigenvalues Œª of the rpms in eq 9 varying the pair of fecundity f and adult survival s f s on a given trade off curve and we obtained the evolutionary consequence of the population projection matrix that had the maximum Œª we assumed that if the Œª was maximum when the adult survival was equal to zero semelparity was favoured during the course of evolution otherwise iteroparity was favoured we calculated the elasticity vectors of the rpms e e fecundity e growth e stasis to plot the evolutionary consequences of the elasticity vector on ternary plot we obtained 3000 evolutionary consequences of elasticity vectors from the 3000 randomly generated matrices for 3 trade off curves eq 10a to 10c in fig 2 in the case of eq 10a many iteroparity consequences were achieved fig 6 a in contrast most of the consequences were from semelparity matrices and only 9 dots of the consequences were of iteroparity when we assumed the trade off curve in eq 10b fig 6b in both cases the consequences of semelparity were located more in the upper left than were the consequences of iteroparity on the ternary plot all 3000 trials reached a semelparity outcome when the trade off curve was concave eq 10c semelparity was favoured more as the convexity decreases 4 discussion we explored the reason for the specific pattern of elasticity vector distribution in semelparous species by setting several archetypes of plant life history constructing a number of rpms and assuming a trade off between fecundity and adult survival in this section we address the 3 questions that we established in the introduction based on the results of the 3 methods i where are the elasticities of semelparous species in the compadre database located in the ternary plot the elasticity distribution of 68 populations of 17 semelparous species had larger variation than that of the result in silvertown et al 1996 the variation partly came from the variation among the populations of a single species as shown in fig 4b for alliaria petiolata the elasticity distribution varied from the upper left to the lower right the reason for the variation might be a variation in environmental conditions because the census data of the 18 populations were collected from upland coniferous forest to floodplain forest drayton and primack 1999 meekins and mccarthy 2002 however the mean of 68 elasticity vectors was located in the upper central region of ternary plot and was still more biased to the upper left than was the distribution for iteroparous species in fig 1c and 1d another interesting result was that the elasticity distribution of alliaria petiolata was almost linear the matrix dimensions in 15 of the 18 population matrices were 3 table 1 and the structure of the matrices was approximately the same as that of archetype iii which implied that the distribution was expected to lie around the line with an angle Œ∏ 41 see the last paragraph in supplementary material 4 furthermore the elasticity vector distributions for both obligatory biennials and semelparous perennials were almost linear fig 4a we speculated that the specific demography and life history of obligatory biennials and semelparous perennials resulted in a special structure of the population projection matrices and the special structure was a reason for the linear distribution ii does the inherent structure of semelparous species i e big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction shift the elasticity vector distribution and if so is this shift related to population growth rates when the fecundity in the population projection matrix was low p 5 the elasticity vectors of the semelparous rpms were located around the upper left region of the ternary plot in contrast the distribution shifted more to the upper left edge when the fecundity was high p 20 fig 5a and b this result implied that high fecundity led to an increase in the elasticity contribution of e fecundity and a decrease in the elasticity contribution of e stasis therefore big bang reproduction which is one of the important characteristics of semelparity could be one of the causes for the biased elasticity vector distribution for observed semelparous species silvertown et al 1996 fig 4 in the present paper the other characteristic in semelparous species i e immediate death after reproduction could be a cause that shifts the distribution towards the upper left because the mean of the elasticity vectors in fig 5a were shifted towards the upper left region compared to the result obtained from the rpms of iteroparous archetype ii fig 5e because the population growth rate in rpms can be considered as the annual fitness of populations with overlapping generations when the mutant type individuals occupy the population caswell 2001 metcalf and pavard 2007 whether Œª 1 or Œª 1 is a good criterion to evaluate whether the population with the rpms was driven out during the course of natural selection the elasticity vector distribution shifted to the upper left region when the result of 3000 rpms of archetype i in fig 5a was divided into the rpms of Œª 1 and Œª 1 fig 5c this result means that higher Œªs on average were associated with increased e fecundity and decreased e stasis values in archetype iii the distribution again moved to upper left when the Œªs were larger than 1 fig 5g therefore the viability of plant populations or whether Œª is larger than 1 or not could explain the shift to the upper left region in the elasticity distribution iii how does the trade off between survival and fecundity influence the elasticity vector distributions and the evolution of life cycles based on the above results in fig 5 we found that both big bang reproduction and population viability Œª 1 could be potential causes for the biased elasticity distribution observed for semelparous plants however big bang reproduction in semelparous species has been considered to be a qualitative trait related to immediate death after reproduction charnov and schaffer 1973 pianka 1976 1978 therefore the trade off between reproduction and adult survival is an important factor when we attempt to understand the characteristic life history traits of semelparous species and how the process is affected by natural selection we incorporated the trade off into a projection matrix model eqs 9 and 10 to examine the evolutionary trajectory both on the trade off curve and in a ternary plot of the elasticity vectors the result based on the maximization criterion for the population growth rate showed the trajectory to semelparity or iteroparity and the evolutionary consequences depending on the shapes of the trade off curves fig 6 the trajectory towards semelparity moved toward the upper left region in the ternary plot see the figure in supplementary material 2 reflecting the result that the increase in fecundity led to the shift towards the upper left region fig 5a and b comparing the evolutionary consequences of semelparity versus iteroparity the former was located more in the upper left than was the latter irrespective of the shape of the trade off curve fig 6 thus we concluded that the main causes of the distinctive distribution of the elasticity vectors of semelparous species were the specific trade off curve with low convexity and natural selection and the resultant big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction note that the stable distribution and the reproductive value changed in the process of natural selection and the elasticity vector became biased to the upper left region whether an evolutionary consequence is semelparity or iteroparity largely depends on the shape of trade off curve the more convex the trade off curve is the more iteroparity is selected as the evolutionary consequence this result is supported by theoretical studies by takada and nakajima 1992 and takada 1995 they constructed a projection matrix model incorporating the trade off between fecundity and adult survival and obtained a mathematical condition for the evolution of semelparity and iteroparity according to their results semelparity was likely to be favoured when the trade off curve was linear or less upwardly convex as shown in fig 2 their prediction fit well with our simulated result shown in fig 6 in fig 2 the curve of eq 10 2 decreases rapidly compared to that of eq 10 1 the rapid decrease biologically means that the large increase in the adult survival probability is realized by the large decrease in fecundity this result also means that the large sacrifice of the number of seeds is necessary to increase adult survival if the probability of seedling establishment remains constant furthermore the rapid decrease in the trade off curve is related to the cost of producing a seed if the cost is low sacrificing a large number of seeds is necessary to increase adult survival therefore the cost of producing a seed must be low in semelparous species in the present paper mathematical analyses on rpm were not conducted fully we obtained neither mathematical formula of the pgr distribution nor of right and left eigenvectors in rpms which resulted in the lack of mathematical formula of probability distribution of elasticity vectors because elasticity is calculated by using the eigenvectors see eq 1 the

24809,the elasticity of population growth rate Œª is a notable statistic in population projection matrix models and has been used by many empirical researchers silvertown and his collaborators published a paper in 1996 in which they mapped elasticity vectors of stasis growth and fecundity for 84 plant species in a ternary plot and reported that the elasticity vector distribution of semelparous species 10 species was located in the upper left region of the ternary plot to understand and clarify why the elasticity vectors of semelparous species were distributed in the upper left region we conducted three analyses first we used 68 matrices of semelparous species populations in the compadre plant matrix database and plotted their elasticity vectors in the ternary plot second we constructed randomly generated population projection matrices for three archetypes where several biological assumptions were made and obtained their elasticity vector distributions we showed that the high fecundity and or immediate death after reproduction shifted the elasticity vector distribution to the upper left region of the plot third we examined the evolutionary change in the distribution using a population projection matrix model in which the trade off between fecundity and adult survival was incorporated the evolutionary trajectory derived from the trade off model showed that the evolutionary consequence of semelparity was located in the upper left more than was that of iteroparity in the ternary plot synthesizing the results derived from the three analyses we concluded that the distinctive distribution of the elasticity vectors of semelparous species is the outcome of natural selection under the trade off with low convexity and the outcome of the resultant big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction keywords comparative biology demographic simulation population matrix models evolutionary trajectory 1 introduction semelparity has been intensively studied in evolutionary demography since cole 1954 suggested an evolutionary reason for the development of semelparous species in plants and animals semelparous species such as salmon bamboos certain palm trees and monocarpic herbs show a specific demographic pattern specifically individuals die immediately after reproduction abandoning the opportunity for future reproduction because iteroparous species seem to be more advantageous than semelparous species because of their high frequency of reproduction high fecundity in semelparous species is considered to compensate for the eliminated future opportunity for reproduction under the trade off between fecundity and adult survival charnov and schaffer 1973 pianka 1976 1978 in fact several researchers have reported the high fecundity referred to big bang reproduction in monocarpic palm trees and monocarpic biennials harper and white 1974 pianka 1976 meekins and mccarthy 2002 pianka 1976 also characterized semelparity as big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction metcalf et al 2003 vaupel et al 2013 the author proposed a mathematical model to calculate the present offspring and the expectation of future offspring when mature individuals do not die immediately after reproduction and he obtained the mathematical conditions under which semelparity or iteroparity should be favoured furthermore many theoreticians have attempted to obtain these conditions using several mathematical formulations charnov and shaffer 1973 charlesworth 1980 bulmer 1985 takada 1995 therefore which life history i e semelparity or iteroparity is selected during the course of evolution is one of the central issues in evolutionary ecology silvertown et al 1996 also attempted to clarify the difference in demographic pattern between iteroparous and semelparous plants using elasticity analysis in matrix population models mpms the elasticity eij of the population growth rate Œª is a notable statistic in mpms and has been used by many empirical researchers and is defined as the relative change in Œª responding to the relative change in matrix elements aij as follows e ij lim Œ¥ a ij 0 Œ¥ Œª Œª Œ¥ a ij a ij a ij Œª Œª a ij pfister 1998 kaneko et al 1999 cruz rodriguez et al 2009 salguero g√≥mez and de kroon 2010 kaneko and takada 2014 the formula is 1 e ij a ij Œª v i w j k v k w k where vi or uj represents the i th or the j th element of the left or right eigenvector of the projection matrix in mpms respectively caswell et al 1984 de kroon et al 1986 caswell 2001 yokomizo et al 2017 silvertown et al proposed an elaborative idea to divide the elements of the elasticity matrix into three demographic processes i e fecundity growth and stasis the sum of the elasticities in each category was defined as e fecundity e growth and e stasis respectively silvertown and franco 1993 silvertown et al 1993 1996 franco and silvertown 1996 2004 because 2 e fecundity e growth e stasis 1 the elasticity vector e e fecundity e growth e stasis of any mpm can be plotted in the equilateral triangle with side 1 long fig 1 a the authors obtained the elasticity vectors for 84 plant species mapped them on a ternary plot and showed that the elasticity vector distribution in the ternary plot depended on its life form or life history fig 1b 1d there were three characteristic patterns in terms of the elasticity vector distribution of plants on ternary plots silvertown et al 1996 takada et al 2018 first few elasticity vectors were found in the lower half of the plot fig 1 second most of the elasticity vectors of perennial herbs fig 1c and trees fig 1d were concentrated in the upper right region third semelparous species were distributed in the upper left region of the plot where the changes in growth and fecundity had a stronger impact than that of stasis on the change in Œª fig 1b takada et al 2018 explored the reasons explaining the first two patterns however the third question i e why the elasticity vector distribution of semelparous species is so distinctive is still unanswered to understand and clarify why the elasticity vector distribution of semelparous species was distributed in the specific region we conducted three analyses in the present paper first we selected the matrices of semelparous species populations from the compadre plant matrix database and plotted their elasticity vectors in the ternary plot salguero g√≥mez et al 2015 we compared our new result to the result obtained by silvertown et al 1996 second we artificially constructed mpms whose elements were randomly generated from two probability distributions randomly generated population matrix rpm hereafter in constructing the rpms we set three archetypes a a semelparous type where the survival at the adult stage was always zero which means semelparous adult individuals die immediately after reproduction b an iteroparous type where the survival at the adult stage was positive and c a sparse semelparous type matrix where the individuals cannot grow quickly third we proposed an rpm model in which the trade off between fecundity and adult survival was incorporated to examine the evolutionary trajectory to semelparous or iteroparous species on the ternary plot the questions addressed in this study are i where are the elasticities of semelparous species in the compadre database located in the ternary plot ii does the inherent structure of semelparous species i e big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction shift the elasticity vector distribution and if so is this shift related to population growth rates iii how does the trade off between survival and fecundity influence the elasticity vector distributions and the evolution of life cycles 2 methods 2 1 elasticity analysis of semelparous species in the compadre database the compadre database ver 4 0 1 contains 2283 mean population projection matrices for 695 plant species and these matrices each represents the mean matrix of a single research site over the research period or of a single research time step over several research sites salguero g√≥mez et al 2015 to guarantee the projection matrices are of highest quality we applied 4 selection criteria a the stage specific survival rates were 1 because survival rates should not exceed 1 b the fecundity was explicitly measured because of the definition of semelparous species c the sampling periodicity 1 to keep the consistency of the time step of population growth rate and d the matrix was irreducible and primitive so that the elasticities can be calculated correctly see pp 79 91 in caswell 2001 among the selected high quality mean matrices we searched for semelparous type matrices in which individuals at the adult stage s produced offspring in the earlier stage s and their survival probabilities were zero we conducted the elasticity analysis for those 68 semelparous type matrices obtained the elasticities and summed them up to three components of a vector e e fecundity e growth e stasis this approach followed the description in silvertown et al 1996 i e the elements of elasticities categorized in f in 3 s s f f g s s s g g s s g g g s were summed to e fecundity and those in s were summed to e stasis and so on note that the selected matrices had a variety of matrix dimensions and the dimension was not always equal to four as exemplified by eq 3 additionally the number of elements categorized in f differed in each selected matrix the obtained elasticity vectors were plotted in a ternary plot to compare the results obtained from the compadre database and the results obtained by silvertown et al 1996 2 2 elasticity analysis of semelparous rpms to answer the second addressed question posed in the introduction we constructed 4 4 rpms with two basic demographic processes fecundity f and transition probabilities from j th stage to i th stage tij all the computer programmes used to construct the rpms were coded by mathematica 10 wolfram research inc the rpms contained only one fecundity element in t 14 i e 4 a 0 0 0 f t 21 t 22 t 23 0 t 31 t 32 t 33 0 t 41 t 42 t 43 0 it should be noted that here f represents the combined outcome of seed production and seedling establishment eq 4 is a random matrix of semelparous species because semelparity means that adult individuals die after reproduction and the survival probability i e the sum of t 24 t 34 and t 44 is zero therefore those elements are all equal to zero in eq 4 the fecundity f was chosen randomly from a poisson distribution with an average p and the transition probabilities tij were chosen from a uniform distribution we furthermore assumed that the elements of the first row are all zero except for fecundity element because the first stage of plants are biologically distinct from the other stages and the retrogression to the first stage is rare the details of how rpms were constructed are shown in supplementary material 1 to examine the elasticity vector distribution of rpms we established three archetypes the first archetype was used to compare the elasticity vector distributions of semelparous type rpms with different fecundities and to answer whether the high fertility was one of the causes that explained the biased elasticity vector distribution of semelparous species archetype i the matrix of this type a 1 has the same form as eq 4 where f 0 0 t i j 1 0 i t i j 1 for j 1 to 3 this semelparous rpm describes a life history where individuals can progress rapidly because the positive t 41and t 42 refer to rapid progression the second archetype was used to compare the elasticity vector distributions of semelparous type rpms and iteroparous type rpms and to examine whether the immediate death following reproduction in semelparous species is a cause of the specific elasticity distribution of semelparous species reported in silvertown et al 1996 archetype ii the type describes the life history of iteroparous species which do not die immediately after reproduction a 2 0 0 0 f t 21 t 22 t 23 0 t 31 t 32 t 33 0 t 41 t 42 t 43 t 44 where f 0 0 t i j 1 0 i t i j 1 for j 1 to 4 this rpm also allows for rapid progression the third archetype was used to compare the elasticity vector distributions of the rpms of this type and the real mpms in the compadre database and to understand the distribution obtained by the mpms in the compadre database 5 archetype iii a 3 0 0 0 f t 21 t 22 0 0 0 t 32 t 33 0 0 0 t 43 0 where f 0 0 t i j 1 0 i t i j 1 in matrix a 3 the positive elements are assigned only on 1 4 element and the diagonal and lower sub diagonal elements this rpm represents the life cycle of a species in which retrogression is not allowed and progression only happens slowly therefore individuals can progress only to the next stage of development we generated 3000 rpms for each archetype the elasticities 6a 0 0 0 e 14 e 21 e 22 e 23 0 e 31 e 32 e 33 0 e 41 e 42 e 43 0 in archetype i and iii and 6b 0 0 0 e 14 e 21 e 22 e 23 0 e 31 e 32 e 33 0 e 41 e 42 e 43 e 44 in archetype ii were calculated using the formula of elasticity in eq 1 caswell 2001 these elasticities were summed to obtain a vector e e fecundity e growth e stasis following the method explained in the introduction after silvertown et al 1996 the categorization of fecundity f growth g and stasis s in the rpms was as follows 7 0 0 0 f g s s 0 g g s 0 g g g s therefore e fecundity e 14 8 e growth e 21 e 31 e 32 e 41 e 42 e 43 e stasis e 22 e 23 e 33 e 44 the elasticity vectors e were plotted in a ternary plot for archetype i p 5 and 20 ii p 5 and iii p 5 five comparisons of the elasticity vector distributions were conducted between p 5 and 20 in archetype i between archetype i and ii when p 5 between Œª 1 and Œª 1 in archetype i between Œª 1 and Œª 1 in archetype ii and between Œª 1 and Œª 1 in archetype iii 2 3 a population projection matrix model with a trade off between fecundity and adult survival we proposed an rpm to examine the evolutionary explanation for the biased elasticity distribution in semelparity 9 0 0 0 f t 21 t 22 t 23 0 t 31 t 32 t 33 0 t 41 t 42 t 43 s where the transition probabilities tij ranged from 0 to 1 and the column sums were constrained to 1 the probabilities were generated randomly using a uniform probability distribution in a way similar to that described in section 2 2 we assumed a trade off between fecundity f and adult survival probability s to set the 1 4 and 4 4 elements in eq 9 the following three types of trade off curves were used 10a f 12 5 s 0 1 2 10 125 10b f 1 25 s 4 6 2 36 45 10c f 12 5 s 0 9 2 0 125 all the curves ranged from 0 to 0 8 in s and the maximum fecundity was 10 when s 0 and 0 when s 0 8 eq 10b is a rapidly decreasing curve compared to that in eq 10a and eq 10c is a concave curve fig 2 to examine the evolutionary trajectory of each trade off curve we calculated the dominant eigenvalue Œª of the generated matrices varying the pair of f and s given a set of randomly generated transition probabilities tij here we show how to obtain the evolutionary trajectory using a simple example first the transition probabilities tij in eq 9 are obtained so that the column sums are constrained to 1 say 0 0 0 0 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 next we chose several points on the trade off curve of eq 10b and obtained the fecundities f and the adult survivals s e g f s 2 0 649 4 0 495 6 0 336 8 0 170 and 10 0 then the values in the pairs are assigned to the 1 4 and 4 4 elements of the matrices from b 1 to b 5 as follows b 1 0 0 0 2 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 649 b 2 0 0 0 4 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 495 b 3 0 0 0 6 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 495 b 4 0 0 0 8 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 495 b 5 0 0 0 10 0 256 0 547 0 178 0 0 282 0 174 0 638 0 0 140 0 081 0 080 0 495 we calculated the population growth rates Œª of b 1 to b 5 and obtained 1 120 1 241 1 323 1 384 and 1 432 respectively for the matrices see fig 3 then we identified the direction to the point with a maximum Œª assuming that evolution occurs so that the Œª i e yearly fitness caswell 2001 metcalf and pavard 2007 increases during the course of evolution we assumed that a matrix with the maximum Œª was favoured and was finally selected in this example the evolutionary trajectory on the trade off curve is towards the left most point which means matrix b 5 is a consequence of evolution if the Œª at the left most point is the maximum semelparity is favoured in the course of evolution because the survival of adult individuals in b 5 is zero at that point otherwise iteroparity is favoured similarly the elasticity vectors e e fecundity e growth e stasis were calculated and plotted in a ternary plot to examine the evolutionary trajectory of elasticity vector on ternary plot see supplementary material 2 for details for each trade off curve the above procedure was iterated 3000 times by varying the transition probabilities tij and the 3000 consequences of evolution on the elasticity vector were plotted on a ternary plot some of them were derived from semelparous type matrices and others were derived from iteroparous type matrices 3 results 3 1 elasticity vector distribution of natural semelparous species we searched the matrices of semelparous species in the compadre plant matrix database and selected 68 matrices with high quality for 17 semelparous species table 1 supplementary material 3 there were three types of semelparous species i e biennial facultative biennial and semelparous perennial in our study a biennial species is a strict monocarpic species that obligately flowers in the second year a facultative biennial species flowers in the second year or in the succeeding years depending on the size of individuals or environmental conditions a semelparous perennial has a life span of more than two years and dies immediately after reproduction the numbers of each type of species were four four and nine respectively with populations of 26 9 and 33 respectively the elasticity vector distribution of these matrices was different from the results of silvertown et al 1996 the distribution was scattered from the upper left region to the lower right region fig 4 a although the distribution of facultative biennials was not scattered as much as the distributions of the other types the trends were common for all types of semelparous species however the mean was located in the upper central region as shown by silvertown group this result implies that the changes in growth and fecundity had a stronger impact than that of stasis on the change in Œª compared to the result for iteroparous herbs and trees fig 1 among the 68 populations a biennial herb alliaria petiolata had the greatest mean matrix data 18 populations and 18 elasticity vectors were plotted in fig 4a table 1 when extracting the elasticity vectors they were almost linearly scattered from the upper left region to the lower right region fig 4b the elasticity vectors of a petiolata populations whose population growth rates are less than 1 were plotted on the lower right region 3 2 elasticity vector distribution of three archetypes of rpms we constructed rpms of the first archetype under the condition that the average fecundity p was 5 and 20 3000 rpms each the obtained elasticity vectors were plotted on the ternary plot to examine the effect of high fecundity on the elasticity vector distribution fig 5 a and b when p 5 the distribution of the elasticity vectors was concentrated in the upper central region of the ternary plot the mean of the elasticity vectors was e fecundity e growth e stasis 0 363 0 535 0 102 the distribution in p 20 shifted to the upper left and the mean was e fecundity e growth e stasis 0 422 0 546 0 032 e fecundity increased and e stasis decreased with the increase in fecundity to examine the effect of natural selection the elasticity vectors of archetype i matrices were plotted and divided into two groups i e groups where Œªs were more than or less than 1 the distribution of the populations with Œª 1 was located more to the upper left than the distribution of the population with Œª 1 fig 5c the means were 0 379 0 543 0 078 and 0 270 0 487 0 243 respectively the populations with low growth rates would be selected out in the population dynamics and natural selection eventually caused an increase in the elasticity contribution of e fecundity and a decrease in the elasticity contribution of e stasis to examine the effect of immediate death after reproduction 3000 rpms of archetype ii were constructed when p average fecundity 5 archetype ii is the projection matrix of iteroparous species because the survival probabilities at the adult stage are positive the elasticity vector distribution of iteroparous rpms fig 5e was shifted to the lower right region compared to that of semelparous rpms fig 5a the mean was 0 292 0 446 0 262 the distribution of the populations with Œª 1 was located more to the upper left than that with Œª 1 fig 5f the means were 0 296 0 447 0 257 and 0 195 0 416 0 389 respectively the assumption in archetype iii individuals were neither allowed to retrogress nor to progress further than to its immediately superior stage led to the drastic change in the elasticity vector distribution fig 5g the distributions were linear the lines started from the corner of e fecundity 0 and the slope of the lines was 46 comparing two distributions in archetype iii depending on whether Œª or 1 a higher Œª caused the increase in the elasticity contribution of e fecundity and the decrease in the elasticity contribution of e stasis the trend is similar to the result in fig 5c and 5f 3 3 evolutionary trajectory of elasticity vector distribution in a trade off model we calculated the dominant eigenvalues Œª of the rpms in eq 9 varying the pair of fecundity f and adult survival s f s on a given trade off curve and we obtained the evolutionary consequence of the population projection matrix that had the maximum Œª we assumed that if the Œª was maximum when the adult survival was equal to zero semelparity was favoured during the course of evolution otherwise iteroparity was favoured we calculated the elasticity vectors of the rpms e e fecundity e growth e stasis to plot the evolutionary consequences of the elasticity vector on ternary plot we obtained 3000 evolutionary consequences of elasticity vectors from the 3000 randomly generated matrices for 3 trade off curves eq 10a to 10c in fig 2 in the case of eq 10a many iteroparity consequences were achieved fig 6 a in contrast most of the consequences were from semelparity matrices and only 9 dots of the consequences were of iteroparity when we assumed the trade off curve in eq 10b fig 6b in both cases the consequences of semelparity were located more in the upper left than were the consequences of iteroparity on the ternary plot all 3000 trials reached a semelparity outcome when the trade off curve was concave eq 10c semelparity was favoured more as the convexity decreases 4 discussion we explored the reason for the specific pattern of elasticity vector distribution in semelparous species by setting several archetypes of plant life history constructing a number of rpms and assuming a trade off between fecundity and adult survival in this section we address the 3 questions that we established in the introduction based on the results of the 3 methods i where are the elasticities of semelparous species in the compadre database located in the ternary plot the elasticity distribution of 68 populations of 17 semelparous species had larger variation than that of the result in silvertown et al 1996 the variation partly came from the variation among the populations of a single species as shown in fig 4b for alliaria petiolata the elasticity distribution varied from the upper left to the lower right the reason for the variation might be a variation in environmental conditions because the census data of the 18 populations were collected from upland coniferous forest to floodplain forest drayton and primack 1999 meekins and mccarthy 2002 however the mean of 68 elasticity vectors was located in the upper central region of ternary plot and was still more biased to the upper left than was the distribution for iteroparous species in fig 1c and 1d another interesting result was that the elasticity distribution of alliaria petiolata was almost linear the matrix dimensions in 15 of the 18 population matrices were 3 table 1 and the structure of the matrices was approximately the same as that of archetype iii which implied that the distribution was expected to lie around the line with an angle Œ∏ 41 see the last paragraph in supplementary material 4 furthermore the elasticity vector distributions for both obligatory biennials and semelparous perennials were almost linear fig 4a we speculated that the specific demography and life history of obligatory biennials and semelparous perennials resulted in a special structure of the population projection matrices and the special structure was a reason for the linear distribution ii does the inherent structure of semelparous species i e big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction shift the elasticity vector distribution and if so is this shift related to population growth rates when the fecundity in the population projection matrix was low p 5 the elasticity vectors of the semelparous rpms were located around the upper left region of the ternary plot in contrast the distribution shifted more to the upper left edge when the fecundity was high p 20 fig 5a and b this result implied that high fecundity led to an increase in the elasticity contribution of e fecundity and a decrease in the elasticity contribution of e stasis therefore big bang reproduction which is one of the important characteristics of semelparity could be one of the causes for the biased elasticity vector distribution for observed semelparous species silvertown et al 1996 fig 4 in the present paper the other characteristic in semelparous species i e immediate death after reproduction could be a cause that shifts the distribution towards the upper left because the mean of the elasticity vectors in fig 5a were shifted towards the upper left region compared to the result obtained from the rpms of iteroparous archetype ii fig 5e because the population growth rate in rpms can be considered as the annual fitness of populations with overlapping generations when the mutant type individuals occupy the population caswell 2001 metcalf and pavard 2007 whether Œª 1 or Œª 1 is a good criterion to evaluate whether the population with the rpms was driven out during the course of natural selection the elasticity vector distribution shifted to the upper left region when the result of 3000 rpms of archetype i in fig 5a was divided into the rpms of Œª 1 and Œª 1 fig 5c this result means that higher Œªs on average were associated with increased e fecundity and decreased e stasis values in archetype iii the distribution again moved to upper left when the Œªs were larger than 1 fig 5g therefore the viability of plant populations or whether Œª is larger than 1 or not could explain the shift to the upper left region in the elasticity distribution iii how does the trade off between survival and fecundity influence the elasticity vector distributions and the evolution of life cycles based on the above results in fig 5 we found that both big bang reproduction and population viability Œª 1 could be potential causes for the biased elasticity distribution observed for semelparous plants however big bang reproduction in semelparous species has been considered to be a qualitative trait related to immediate death after reproduction charnov and schaffer 1973 pianka 1976 1978 therefore the trade off between reproduction and adult survival is an important factor when we attempt to understand the characteristic life history traits of semelparous species and how the process is affected by natural selection we incorporated the trade off into a projection matrix model eqs 9 and 10 to examine the evolutionary trajectory both on the trade off curve and in a ternary plot of the elasticity vectors the result based on the maximization criterion for the population growth rate showed the trajectory to semelparity or iteroparity and the evolutionary consequences depending on the shapes of the trade off curves fig 6 the trajectory towards semelparity moved toward the upper left region in the ternary plot see the figure in supplementary material 2 reflecting the result that the increase in fecundity led to the shift towards the upper left region fig 5a and b comparing the evolutionary consequences of semelparity versus iteroparity the former was located more in the upper left than was the latter irrespective of the shape of the trade off curve fig 6 thus we concluded that the main causes of the distinctive distribution of the elasticity vectors of semelparous species were the specific trade off curve with low convexity and natural selection and the resultant big bang reproduction and immediate death after reproduction note that the stable distribution and the reproductive value changed in the process of natural selection and the elasticity vector became biased to the upper left region whether an evolutionary consequence is semelparity or iteroparity largely depends on the shape of trade off curve the more convex the trade off curve is the more iteroparity is selected as the evolutionary consequence this result is supported by theoretical studies by takada and nakajima 1992 and takada 1995 they constructed a projection matrix model incorporating the trade off between fecundity and adult survival and obtained a mathematical condition for the evolution of semelparity and iteroparity according to their results semelparity was likely to be favoured when the trade off curve was linear or less upwardly convex as shown in fig 2 their prediction fit well with our simulated result shown in fig 6 in fig 2 the curve of eq 10 2 decreases rapidly compared to that of eq 10 1 the rapid decrease biologically means that the large increase in the adult survival probability is realized by the large decrease in fecundity this result also means that the large sacrifice of the number of seeds is necessary to increase adult survival if the probability of seedling establishment remains constant furthermore the rapid decrease in the trade off curve is related to the cost of producing a seed if the cost is low sacrificing a large number of seeds is necessary to increase adult survival therefore the cost of producing a seed must be low in semelparous species in the present paper mathematical analyses on rpm were not conducted fully we obtained neither mathematical formula of the pgr distribution nor of right and left eigenvectors in rpms which resulted in the lack of mathematical formula of probability distribution of elasticity vectors because elasticity is calculated by using the eigenvectors see eq 1 the distributions are fundamental and important in rpm analysis and should be solved in future declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements we sincerely thank prof roberto salguero g√≥mez prof
