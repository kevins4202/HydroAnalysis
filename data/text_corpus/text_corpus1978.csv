9890,reducing deep percolation dp across the field is one of the main objectives of a variable rate irrigation vri system under a semi humid climate a study was conducted in the north china plain during the 2016 and 2017 maize growing seasons in a 1 64 ha one quadrant plot irrigated by a vri centre pivot irrigation system the study was designed to quantify and compare the dp dynamics of three irrigation strategies including soil water balance swb measured soil water content swc and a combination of swb and rain forecasting for the next three days rf the area irrigated by the vri system was delineated into three management zones zones 1 2 and 3 based on the available soil water holding capacity awc based on the seasonal cumulative dp the zone specific crop coefficient kc for each zone was quantified to enhance the accuracy of the swb method the results indicated that high daily dp rates occurred during the initial and end growing seasons as well as following rainfall and irrigation events during the mid season the delay of dp after an intermittent large rainfall was observed in both seasons the cumulative dp in zone 2 with a medium awc and a uniform soil profile was 36 less than the mean values of dp for zones 1 and 3 compared to the swc and swb methods the cumulative dp for the rf treatment was reduced by 10 and 36 respectively during both seasons the maximum dp values were observed in zones 2 and 3 under the swb methods the swc method tended to increase the risk of dp for a coarse profile whereas a lower sandy content soil tended to increase the risk for the swb method the mean kc values derived based on dp for the initial mid season and end of the late season stages were 0 86 0 73 and 0 91 for zones 1 2 and 3 respectively with a 7 reduction compared to the kc without considering dp the seasonal crop water requirement determined by zone specific kc was reduced by 31 mm compared with the uniform kc in different management zones our results suggested that the rf method exhibited promise for reducing dp and the zone specific kc values were helpful to enhance the water savings of the swb method for a vri system keywords centre pivot precision irrigation semi humid site specific soil water balance summer maize 1 introduction variable rate irrigation vri management is an important and timely topic worldwide the potential benefits of vri include decreasing water or energy consumption evans and king 2012 lo et al 2016 optimizing crop yield and quality sadler et al 2002 ge et al 2008 and reducing the movement of water nutrients and agrochemicals below the plant root zone king et al 2006 vri technology has been fully developed and commercialized kranz et al 2012 sadler et al 2002 nevertheless field based research using vri with continuously moving sprinkler machines to provide clear and accurate information to the scientific community remains in its infancy evans et al 2013 o shaughnessy and rush 2014 zhao et al 2016 as a key factor influencing the promotion and application of vri technology a perfect irrigation decision support system still needs to be further developed evans et al 2013 irrigation strategies based on soil water content swc sensors and soil water balance swb models have typically been applied to schedule vris therefore the swc method could reduce the amount of irrigation and improve water use efficiency king et al 2006 sui et al 2015 li et al 2018 by monitoring the variations in soil water content in real time optimization of the measurement positions of soil water content sensors in each management zone vachaud et al 1985 zhao et al 2018 would improve the implementation accuracy of vri through sensor monitoring and the cost would be reduced comparatively the swb method could use the climatic data from a weather station to predict the availability of water to a crop both the low labour cost pitts et al 1990 and the capability to manage continuously moving sprinkler systems make the swb method one of the most widely used precision irrigation strategies o shaughnessy and rush 2014 sui and vories 2020 in recent years freely accessible online weather forecasts have been applied in irrigation strategies and these forecasts have mainly been used to determine crop reference evapotranspiration or evaluate model accuracy to improve irrigation scheduling perera et al 2016 chen et al 2021 deep percolation dp affects the availability of soil water to crops leading to nutrient leaching and groundwater pollution a reasonable irrigation decision should avoid a large amount of dp especially in semi humid climates at present the measurement of dp remains a challenge as a direct method in situ lysimeters are expensive and difficult to use on a large scale van der velde et al 2005 hatiye et al 2016 although it is not precise for monitoring the dynamics of water fluxes during 1 to 7 day interval hatiye et al 2016 especially for monitoring the peak flows of the percolation fluxes abbaspour et al 2001 a tensiometer system is commonly used to measure matric potential and thus provide indirect determinations of dp singh et al 1988 wang et al 2014 the applicability of richards equation models in predicting dp has also been evaluated stewart et al 2006 sella et al 2011 regardless of the calculation methods dp was reported to vary considerably over a field mainly due to the spatial variability of soil texture rice et al 1986 chen et al 2020 variable rate irrigation systems aim to identify and or reduce the spatial variability within large scale fields by dividing them into several management zones that are generally based on soil properties sui et al 2015 o shaughnessy et al 2016 li et al 2018 therefore these systems could potentially be used to reduce the dp value furthermore uncertainty in the amount and timing of precipitation leads to the risk of dp especially when rainfall occurs successively after an irrigation event wang et al 2014 2020 whether the coupling effects of irrigation dates for swc and swb methods and uncertain precipitation dates on the characteristics of dp differ in the management zones under a vri system requires further study the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of irrigation strategies swc swb and a combination of swb and rain forecasting for the next three days and soil properties on dp in three management zones with different available soil water holding capacities awcs and provide a dp optimization method for vri management in a semi humid climate and 2 determine the kc and crop water requirements based on the dp and obtain zone specific kc values to improve the accuracy of swb in vri management 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was conducted in the 2016 and 2017 maize growing seasons from june to september in zhuozhou 39 45 n and 115 85 e hebei province china the experimental region has a typical continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons the average annual precipitation is 563 mm with 400 mm occurring during the maize growing season the variable rate centre pivot irrigation system was retrofitted from a three span 140 m long centre pivot irrigation system with an overhang and mainly composed of a solenoid valve pressure regulator and a control unit zhao et al 2014 variable rate water application along the lateral and travel directions was achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the solenoid valve installed ahead of each sprinkler and the travel speed of the centre pivot respectively the experimental site was one 1 64 ha quadrant irrigated by the vri system in total 110 locations of a 12 m 12 m grid were sampled to calculate awc which was defined as the difference in volumetric water content between field capacity fc and wilting point for each grid three soil samples were collected from the upper 60 cm of the profile in 20 cm increments and the soil particle fractions sand silt and clay of each soil sample were determined using a granulometer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern uk then soil cores for 13 locations were collected from three soil depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm using 100 cm3 rings and fc was measured using the wilcox method wilcox 1962 a polynomial equation between fc and clay silt and sand percentiles was obtained for the 13 locations zhao et al 2017 the fc for other locations was interpolated using this equation the wilting point for each sampling location was estimated from the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 for the soil water pressure head h at 1500 kpa four management zones delineated with awc were arranged in this experimental site the areas of zone 1 z1 zone 2 z2 zone 3 z3 and zone 4 z4 were 0 33 0 76 0 17 and 0 28 ha respectively the main statistical characteristic values of the soil particle fractions awc and fc are listed in table 1 various soil profiles were detected in different management zones table 1 in z1 the soil sand content increased with increasing depth a small range of sand fractions and clay fractions were detected at different depths in z2 whereas an obvious clay layer at 20 40 cm depth was found in z3 zone 4 was the refilled soil after the burying of water pipelines with gravel in the 40 60 cm layer since it was difficult to monitor the dp at a depth of 80 cm it was not included in this paper the mean initial soil no3 n concentrations of the 0 100 cm layers were 6 1 8 4 and 9 1 mg kg 1 in 2016 and 11 2 7 7 and 6 0 mg kg 1 in 2017 for z1 z2 and z3 respectively additional details about the climate information soil parameters and vri system have been reported by zhao et al 2017 and li et al 2018 2 2 experimental design according to the areas of management zones z1 z2 and z3 were divided equally into four four and two subzones respectively in 2016 in these subzones the rainfed treatments w0 swc treatments w1 swb treatments w2 and rf treatments w3 were evaluated this experimental design resulted in 10 subzones z1w0 z1w1 z1w2 z1w3 z2w0 z2w1 z2w2 z2w3 z3w0 and z3w1 in 2017 two additional subzones of z3w2 and z3w3 were created and we found that the buffer zone between the adjacent zones was relatively small ranging from 0 to 2 m in the 2016 season resultantly there were 12 subzones in 2017 fig 1a during the two growing seasons an irrigation trigger point of 70 fc was used for the three irrigation strategies and a standard 20 mm was applied for an irrigation event for the w1 and w2 treatments in the w1 and w2 treatments the soil water content at depths of 0 40 cm measured at the beginning of the jointing stage was considered to be its initial value to trigger an irrigation event the soil water content for the w1 treatment was measured daily in the 20 40 cm layers to approximately represent the average soil water content in the top 60 cm layers in the 2016 season but the measured area was extended to the 0 40 cm layers to assess the layered texture in the soil profile during the 2017 season the soil water content for the w2 treatments was calculated daily based on the soil water balance equation allen et al 1998 to determine the irrigation date for the w3 treatments the irrigation depth was modified and 20 16 and 12 mm water was applied when light 10 mm moderate 10 25 mm and heavy 25 mm rainfall wang et al 2005 were forecasted for the following three days the weather reports were obtained from the national meteorological center of the china meteorological administration in the rainfed treatments additional irrigation was applied exclusively for seed emergence and to aid in fertilization in 2016 summer maize zea mays l qiangsheng no 928 was seeded on 16 june and harvested on 23 september for the rainfed treatments and on 6 october for the irrigated treatments due to the different maturation dates in 2017 summer maize zea mays l zhengdan no 958 was seeded on 14 june and was harvested on 27 september for all treatments in both seasons nitrogen n phosphorus p2o5 and potassium k2o fertilizers and pest and weed control were applied uniformly for all management zones based on local cultural practices for maximum yield potential 2 3 calculation of water flux at the bottom of root zone because 98 of roots for maize in the experimental region were concentrated in the 0 80 cm layer zhou et al 2008 the bottom of the root zone 80 cm depth served as the drainage interface the water flux at 80 cm depth q cm d 1 was estimated as follows 1 q k h h 70 h 90 20 where k h is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 h is the mean pressure head measured at depths of 70 and 90 cm and h70 and h90 cm are soil water potentials at 70 and 90 cm depths respectively which were obtained from the daily tensiometer readings at 8 00 h for each treatment two or three pairs of tensiometers soilspec australia near the selected trime t3 access tube were used to determine the water flux in total 28 pairs of tensiometers were installed fig 1b the van genuchten mualem model of soil hydraulic properties mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 was selected to calculate k h 2 k h k s θ h θ r θ s θ h 0 5 1 1 θ h θ r θ s θ h 1 m m 2 3 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 a h n m where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents cm3 cm 3 α cm 1 n and m both dimensionless are empirical shape parameters and m 1 1 n the mean hydraulic parameters for each treatment including θr θs α m n and ks estimated by rosetta software schaap et al 2001 are summarized in table 2 for each sample point where the tensiometers were installed the bulk density soil particle fractions and soil water content at 33 and 1500 kpa at a depth of 80 cm were selected to calculate the parameters mentioned above the average daily dp for a treatment mm was calculated using the following equation 4 d p m q m 5 d p m 1 n d p m where dpm is the daily deep percolation rate at 80 cm depth for the mth monitoring point in a treatment mm qm is the daily water flux at 80 cm depth for the mth monitoring point mm and n is the number of monitoring points for a given treatment 2 4 determination of soil water content crop water requirements and crop coefficients for the swb method a tdr trime tube system trime t3 imko ltd ettlingen germany was used to monitor the soil water content to ensure that each access tube represents the same area three to ten probes were placed for each treatment fig 1b for the w2 treatments crop water requirements eta mm were calculated every 7 10 days using the following soil water balance equation allen et al 1998 6 e t a i p δ s d p r o c r where i is gross irrigation applied mm p is total rainfall mm δs is variation in soil water storage in the 0 80 cm soil depths between two consecutive measurements of soil water content mm dp is deep percolation mm which was the sum of water flux at the 80 cm depth ro is runoff caused by irrigation mm which was ignored due to the weak topographic variations and the low irrigation rate for each event 20 mm and cr was water transported upward by capillary rise from a shallow water table towards the root zone which was also ignored since the ground water table depth in the area is approximately 50 m below ground surface the kc for each management zone was defined as zone specific kc it was calculated every 7 10 days using the single crop coefficient approach recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 and the daily kc value was obtained by interpolation the values of kc were calculated as follows 7 k c e t a e t 0 where eta is the crop water requirement mm and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm daily climate parameters for calculating et0 and the total precipitation were collected from a weather station watchdog 2000 spectrum technologies inc aurora ill installed approximately 100 m from the study field based on the previous two years of study in the same field yang 2014 single kc values for the whole field in the development stage mid season stage and end of the late season stage were 0 97 1 28 and 0 51 respectively the kc values suggested by fao 56 adjusted for the relative humidity and wind speed conditions kcr estimated by eq 7 adjusted for the dp and management zone condition kc1 and estimated kc2 and adjusted for management zone condition were compared three point values for kc were estimated every 7 10 days in this study to construct and describe the kc curves the mean kc during the initial mid season and end of the late season stages approximately 1 25 55 80 and 90 100 days after sowing respectively were defined as kc ini kc mid and kc end respectively 2 5 data analysis all data were analysed using the statistical product and service solutions spss 16 0 software package one way analysis of variance anova was used to measure the effect of awc or irrigation strategy swc swb and rf on dp with significance set at p 0 05 the coefficient of variation cv was used to quantify the spatial change in dp among treatments 3 results and discussions 3 1 irrigation scheduling a total of 359 and 293 mm rainfall was received during the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively one heavy rainfall event of 162 mm occurred on 20 july accounting for 45 of the seasonal rainfall in the 2016 season fig 2a a more even rainfall distribution was observed during the 2017 season fig 2b irrigation in the amount of 35 mm and 70 mm were applied for the rainfed treatment to aid fertilization in 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2016 the irrigation amount among irrigation treatments for z1 ranged from 175 to 215 mm and the maximum value was observed in the z1w1 treatment the irrigation applied for z2 ranged from 135 to 155 mm and both the z2w2 and z2w3 treatments received 155 mm of irrigation in 2017 the irrigation amounts for the w1 treatments in z1 z2 and z3 were 70 130 and 110 mm respectively the irrigation applied for the w2 and w3 treatments for the three management zones was 190 mm with the exception of the z2w3 treatment 186 mm compared with the swb method the swc method decreased the water applied by approximately 22 and this value was based on that previously reported by li et al 2018 in this field this finding suggests the possibility of overprediction of et however some researchers reported that there were no obvious differences between the two methods stone et al 2016 sui and vories 2020 3 2 daily deep percolation rates the daily deep percolation rate dp at 80 cm depth for all irrigation strategies in the three management zones during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons is shown in fig 2a and b in general dp fluctuated greatly with time in both seasons before late july and after early september when no irrigation event was triggered high dp values were observed for the three management zones especially in 2016 this result was consistent with that reported by li and shao 2014 indicating that high dp occurred in the initial and senescence stages this finding was mainly attributed to the fact that crop water requirements were relatively minimal during the initial and ending growth stages chilundo et al 2018 during the mid season both the maximum dp estimated for z2 8 8 mm d 1 and z3 7 6 mm d 1 was detected in the middle of august this finding might be attributed the largest rainfall of 162 mm observed on july 20 which generated the high soil water content in the deep layer considering that the standard rainfall and or irrigation amounts were generally less than 20 mm in 2017 the maximum dp of 2 mm d 1 for z1 and 0 6 mm d 1 for z2 were detected 4 and 6 days after the largest rainfall of 62 mm respectively the hysteresis was consistent with the results observed elsewhere cattan et al 2007 and was considered to be affected by synthetic factors such as the amount and pattern of rainfall wang et al 2020 initial soil water content sheikh et al 2010 wang et al 2014 soil hydraulic characteristics russo 1984 and soil physical properties bodman and colman 1944 3 3 cumulative deep percolation the seasonal dp for the 2016 and 2017 seasons are summarized in table 3 the mean dp for all the treatments in 2017 was 4 mm which was 80 lower than that in 2016 for the three soil profiles the minimum mean cumulative dp was observed in z2 in both seasons and it was 42 and 84 lower than that in z1 and z3 respectively this result again indicated that homogeneous soil properties had the potential to reduce dp compared with layered soils huang et al 2011 li et al 2019 compared to the irrigation treatments the dp for the rainfed treatment was 56 lower in 2016 but was 133 higher in 2017 demonstrating that the irrigation amounts did not always increase the risk of percolation for the three management zones the maximum dp was detected in different treatments in z1 the dp values in the swc treatments were 59 and 91 higher than those in the swb and rf treatments in 2016 and were 20 and 87 higher in 2017 in z2 and z3 the maximum dp values were detected in the swb treatments during both seasons this result revealed that the irrigation strategy considering the real time soil water content tended to increase the risk of dp in the field with greater sand content whereas the method considering weather conditions might increase this risk in the field with the lower sand content furthermore the results indicating that the maximum dp was not detected in the rf treatments in these management zones demonstrated that the combination of swb and rain forecasting decreased the risk of dp in sandy soil with different layered soil textures compared to the swc and swb treatments the mean dp values in the rf treatments were reduced by 3 and 36 in 2016 and 47 and 36 in 2017 respectively in contrast to the result that the dp tended to increase as the amount of water applied increased wang et al 2014 no deterministic relationship was noted between water received irrigation rainfall and dp in our study neither management zones nor irrigation strategies imposed significant effects p 0 05 on the dp in either season table 3 the specific irrigation time and amount for each management zone may be the main reason this finding might be related to the large spatial variability across the field table 4 the cv for each irrigation strategy and management zone ranged from 0 50 to 4 67 in 2016 and from 0 12 to 0 93 in 2017 demonstrating medium to strong variability as defined by lei et al 1988 the proportion of dp in water applied was 4 in 2016 and 1 in 2017 these values were lower than those reported by other researchers which ranged from 8 to 70 ji et al 2007 behera and panda 2009 li and shao 2014 liang et al 2019 this phenomenon verified that the amount of dp could be reduced through vri management in this study 80 cm is defined as the boundary of the deep percolation although most of the roots are in this layer the water in the lower layer still interacts with the upper layer to verify the contribution of soil water below the maize root zone layer of 80 cm the proportion of the soil water storage of 80 120 cm that accounts for the total water use was calculated this proportion was 2 4 and 4 4 in the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively 3 4 crop coefficient 3 4 1 variation of crop coefficients during the growing seasons the estimated values of kc1 and kc2 and the generalized kcr kc1 and kc2 curves for z2 in the 2016 and 2017 seasons are shown in fig 3a and b the variation in kc for other management zones exhibited a seasonal variation pattern similar to z2 this value increased from the initial stage reached a maximum value at the end of the rapid development stage and decreased until it reached a lower value at the end of the growing period this trend was similar to the variation in daily kc obtained from lysimeters on the north china plain liu and pereira 2000 su et al 2005 compared with the kcr curve kc1 and kc2 were reduced during the entire growing stage in 2016 and during the mid season in 2017 kc1 was lower than kc2 especially in 2016 when a large dp was observed crop coefficients for the three scenarios at the three growing stages for z1 z2 and z3 are presented in table 5 the average kc ranged from 0 66 to 0 85 and from 0 80 to 0 97 for the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively the kc value was lower than that reported by liu et al 2002 1 1 but was consistent with that reported by kang et al 2003 0 45 1 43 in their 10 year study the mean zone specific kc1 adjusted for dp values obtained from the two years at the initial mid season and end of the late season stages were 0 48 1 07 and 0 57 for z1 0 54 0 86 and 0 55 for z2 and 0 64 1 15 and 0 36 for z3 respectively similarly the mean zone specific kc2 values were 0 55 1 11 and 0 64 0 59 0 91 and 0 64 and 0 84 1 16 and 0 37 respectively considering the dp amount the mean values of kc for z1 z2 and z3 were reduced by 5 8 and 6 respectively for the three management zones the values of kc for z2 were always lower than those for z1 and z3 the values of kc1 and kc2 for z2 were 18 and 12 lower than those for z1 in 2016 respectively the value of kc1 for z2 was 13 and 12 lower and the value of kc2 was 13 lower than that for z1 and z3 in 2017 respectively compared with kc2 the difference in kc1 among management zones increased this result indicated that the difference in kc among management zones with variability in soil properties would increase after considering the value of dp especially when a large and uneven distribution of precipitation occurred 3 4 2 crop water requirements to improve the accuracy of swb using zone specific kc values the crop water requirements et1 and et2 were calculated using kc1 and kc2 respectively and et3 was calculated using the historical uniform kc3 in the field mentioned in the former section as shown in table 6 when considering the dp amount the average et1 was 24 mm and 36 mm less than that for et2 in 2016 and 2017 respectively among the management zones et1 based on kc1 in z2 was 37 mm less than that in z1 in 2016 and 44 mm and 59 mm less than that in z1 and z3 in 2017 respectively a similarly lower et2 was observed in z2 compared with that noted in z1 and z3 for both seasons the phenomenon that the low water requirement was again observed in z2 remained consistent with that reported by zhao et al 2017 and li et al 2018 in the same field when the zone specific kc was not considered the crop water requirement et3 was overestimated and was 408 and 371 mm for the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively in 2016 et1 and et2 were 60 and 42 mm less than et3 for z1 and 97 and 66 mm less than et3 for z2 respectively in 2017 et1 and et2 in z1 to z3 were greater than et3 except that et1 in z2 was 18 mm less than et3 in total the mean et1 was 78 mm less than the mean et3 in 2016 but was 16 mm greater in 2017 a similar annually varied et was also observed by nijbroek et al 2003 demonstrating that the irrigation amount fluctuated widely among different years when the irrigation strategy was based on 25 year meteorological data in a vri system these results indicated that it was feasible to enhance the water saving potential of the swb method by using zone specific kc values whereas its effect was greatly affected by interannual precipitation the water saving capacity of the vri system was observed especially in the year when the rainfall was unevenly distributed 4 conclusions the effects of irrigation strategies and soil properties on the characteristics of daily deep percolation were evaluated by field experiments in the semi humid climates of the north china plain furthermore the influence of the zone specific kc for the three management zones on the soil water balance method was studied the following conclusions are supported by this study 1 among the three irrigation strategies the mean two year cumulative dp amount for the treatment considering the rain forecast for the next three days rf was reduced by 10 and 36 compared to the swc and swb methods respectively when minimizing dp is the objective for vri management the rf method is recommended 2 affected by soil properties the minimum mean dp was observed in z2 with a uniform soil profile this value was 29 less than that in z1 where the soil sand content increased along the depth and was 42 less than that in z3 where a clay interface existed 3 incorporating deep percolation the mean values of kc could be reduced by 6 11 for the three management zones compared to those without considering the dp the mean crop water requirement was reduced by 6 when zone specific kc was used using zone specific kc derived by subtracting deep percolation would be helpful to enhance the water savings of variable rate irrigation managed under the

9890,reducing deep percolation dp across the field is one of the main objectives of a variable rate irrigation vri system under a semi humid climate a study was conducted in the north china plain during the 2016 and 2017 maize growing seasons in a 1 64 ha one quadrant plot irrigated by a vri centre pivot irrigation system the study was designed to quantify and compare the dp dynamics of three irrigation strategies including soil water balance swb measured soil water content swc and a combination of swb and rain forecasting for the next three days rf the area irrigated by the vri system was delineated into three management zones zones 1 2 and 3 based on the available soil water holding capacity awc based on the seasonal cumulative dp the zone specific crop coefficient kc for each zone was quantified to enhance the accuracy of the swb method the results indicated that high daily dp rates occurred during the initial and end growing seasons as well as following rainfall and irrigation events during the mid season the delay of dp after an intermittent large rainfall was observed in both seasons the cumulative dp in zone 2 with a medium awc and a uniform soil profile was 36 less than the mean values of dp for zones 1 and 3 compared to the swc and swb methods the cumulative dp for the rf treatment was reduced by 10 and 36 respectively during both seasons the maximum dp values were observed in zones 2 and 3 under the swb methods the swc method tended to increase the risk of dp for a coarse profile whereas a lower sandy content soil tended to increase the risk for the swb method the mean kc values derived based on dp for the initial mid season and end of the late season stages were 0 86 0 73 and 0 91 for zones 1 2 and 3 respectively with a 7 reduction compared to the kc without considering dp the seasonal crop water requirement determined by zone specific kc was reduced by 31 mm compared with the uniform kc in different management zones our results suggested that the rf method exhibited promise for reducing dp and the zone specific kc values were helpful to enhance the water savings of the swb method for a vri system keywords centre pivot precision irrigation semi

affects the availability of soil water to crops leading to nutrient leaching and groundwater pollution a reasonable irrigation decision should avoid a large amount of dp especially in semi humid climates at present the measurement of dp remains a challenge as a direct method in situ lysimeters are expensive and difficult to use on a large scale van der velde et al 2005 hatiye et al 2016 although it is not precise for monitoring the dynamics of water fluxes during 1 to 7 day interval hatiye et al 2016 especially for monitoring the peak flows of the percolation fluxes abbaspour et al 2001 a tensiometer system is commonly used to measure matric potential and thus provide indirect determinations of dp singh et al 1988 wang et al 2014 the applicability of richards equation models in predicting dp has also been evaluated stewart et al 2006 sella et al 2011 regardless of the calculation methods dp was reported to vary considerably over a field mainly due to the spatial variability of soil texture rice et al 1986 chen et al 2020 variable rate irrigation systems aim to identify and or reduce the spatial variability within large scale fields by dividing them into several management zones that are generally based on soil properties sui et al 2015 o shaughnessy et al 2016 li et al 2018 therefore these systems could potentially be used to reduce the dp value furthermore uncertainty in the amount and timing of precipitation leads to the risk of dp especially when rainfall occurs successively after an irrigation event wang et al 2014 2020 whether the coupling effects of irrigation dates for swc and swb methods and uncertain precipitation dates on the characteristics of dp differ in the management zones under a vri system requires further study the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of irrigation strategies swc swb and a combination of swb and rain forecasting for the next three days and soil properties on dp in three management zones with different available soil water holding capacities awcs and provide a dp optimization method for vri management in a semi humid climate and 2 determine the kc and crop water requirements based on the dp and obtain zone specific kc values to improve the accuracy of swb in vri management 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the study was conducted in the 2016 and 2017 maize growing seasons from june to september in zhuozhou 39 45 n and 115 85 e hebei province china the experimental region has a typical continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons the average annual precipitation is 563 mm with 400 mm occurring during the maize growing season the variable rate centre pivot irrigation system was retrofitted from a three span 140 m long centre pivot irrigation system with an overhang and mainly composed of a solenoid valve pressure regulator and a control unit zhao et al 2014 variable rate water application along the lateral and travel directions was achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the solenoid valve installed ahead of each sprinkler and the travel speed of the centre pivot respectively the experimental site was one 1 64 ha quadrant irrigated by the vri system in total 110 locations of a 12 m 12 m grid were sampled to calculate awc which was defined as the difference in volumetric water content between field capacity fc and wilting point for each grid three soil samples were collected from the upper 60 cm of the profile in 20 cm increments and the soil particle fractions sand silt and clay of each soil sample were determined using a granulometer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern uk then soil cores for 13 locations were collected from three soil depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm using 100 cm3 rings and fc was measured using the wilcox method wilcox 1962 a polynomial equation between fc and clay silt and sand percentiles was obtained for the 13 locations zhao et al 2017 the fc for other locations was interpolated using this equation the wilting point for each sampling location was estimated from the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 for the soil water pressure head h at 1500 kpa four management zones delineated with awc were arranged in this experimental site the areas of zone 1 z1 zone 2 z2 zone 3 z3 and zone 4 z4 were 0 33 0 76 0 17 and 0 28 ha respectively the main statistical characteristic values of the soil particle fractions awc and fc are listed in table 1 various soil profiles were detected in different management zones table 1 in z1 the soil sand content increased with increasing depth a small range of sand fractions and clay fractions were detected at different depths in z2 whereas an obvious clay layer at 20 40 cm depth was found in z3 zone 4 was the refilled soil after the burying of water pipelines with gravel in the 40 60 cm layer since it was difficult to monitor the dp at a depth of 80 cm it was not included in this paper the mean initial soil no3 n concentrations of the 0 100 cm layers were 6 1 8 4 and 9 1 mg kg 1 in 2016 and 11 2 7 7 and 6 0 mg kg 1 in 2017 for z1 z2 and z3 respectively additional details about the climate information soil parameters and vri system have been reported by zhao et al 2017 and li et al 2018 2 2 experimental design according to the areas of management zones z1 z2 and z3 were divided equally into four four and two subzones respectively in 2016 in these subzones the rainfed treatments w0 swc treatments w1 swb treatments w2 and rf treatments w3 were evaluated this experimental design resulted in 10 subzones z1w0 z1w1 z1w2 z1w3 z2w0 z2w1 z2w2 z2w3 z3w0 and z3w1 in 2017 two additional subzones of z3w2 and z3w3 were created and we found that the buffer zone between the adjacent zones was relatively small ranging from 0 to 2 m in the 2016 season resultantly there were 12 subzones in 2017 fig 1a during the two growing seasons an irrigation trigger point of 70 fc was used for the three irrigation strategies and a standard 20 mm was applied for an irrigation event for the w1 and w2 treatments in the w1 and w2 treatments the soil water content at depths of 0 40 cm measured at the beginning of the jointing stage was considered to be its initial value to trigger an irrigation event the soil water content for the w1 treatment was measured daily in the 20 40 cm layers to approximately represent the average soil water content in the top 60 cm layers in the 2016 season but the measured area was extended to the 0 40 cm layers to assess the layered texture in the soil profile during the 2017 season the soil water content for the w2 treatments was calculated daily based on the soil water balance equation allen et al 1998 to determine the irrigation date for the w3 treatments the irrigation depth was modified and 20 16 and 12 mm water was applied when light 10 mm moderate 10 25 mm and heavy 25 mm rainfall wang et al 2005 were forecasted for the following three days the weather reports were obtained from the national meteorological center of the china meteorological administration in the rainfed treatments additional irrigation was applied exclusively for seed emergence and to aid in fertilization in 2016 summer maize zea mays l qiangsheng no 928 was seeded on 16 june and harvested on 23 september for the rainfed treatments and on 6 october for the irrigated treatments due to the different maturation dates in 2017 summer maize zea mays l zhengdan no 958 was seeded on 14 june and was harvested on 27 september for all treatments in both seasons nitrogen n phosphorus p2o5 and potassium k2o fertilizers and pest and weed control were applied uniformly for all management zones based on local cultural practices for maximum yield potential 2 3 calculation of water flux at the bottom of root zone because 98 of roots for maize in the experimental region were concentrated in the 0 80 cm layer zhou et al 2008 the bottom of the root zone 80 cm depth served as the drainage interface the water flux at 80 cm depth q cm d 1 was estimated as follows 1 q k h h 70 h 90 20 where k h is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 h is the mean pressure head measured at depths of 70 and 90 cm and h70 and h90 cm are soil water potentials at 70 and 90 cm depths respectively which were obtained from the daily tensiometer readings at 8 00 h for each treatment two or three pairs of tensiometers soilspec australia near the selected trime t3 access tube were used to determine the water flux in total 28 pairs of tensiometers were installed fig 1b the van genuchten mualem model of soil hydraulic properties mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 was selected to calculate k h 2 k h k s θ h θ r θ s θ h 0 5 1 1 θ h θ r θ s θ h 1 m m 2 3 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 a h n m where ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 θr and θs are the residual and saturated water contents cm3 cm 3 α cm 1 n and m both dimensionless are empirical shape parameters and m 1 1 n the mean hydraulic parameters for each treatment including θr θs α m n and ks estimated by rosetta software schaap et al 2001 are summarized in table 2 for each sample point where the tensiometers were installed the bulk density soil particle fractions and soil water content at 33 and 1500 kpa at a depth of 80 cm were selected to calculate the parameters mentioned above the average daily dp for a treatment mm was calculated using the following equation 4 d p m q m 5 d p m 1 n d p m where dpm is the daily deep percolation rate at 80 cm depth for the mth monitoring point in a treatment mm qm is the daily water flux at 80 cm depth for the mth monitoring point mm and n is the number of monitoring points for a given treatment 2 4 determination of soil water content crop water requirements and crop coefficients for the swb method a tdr trime tube system trime t3 imko ltd ettlingen germany was used to monitor the soil water content to ensure that each access tube represents the same area three to ten probes were placed for each treatment fig 1b for the w2 treatments crop water requirements eta mm were calculated every 7 10 days using the following soil water balance equation allen et al 1998 6 e t a i p δ s d p r o c r where i is gross irrigation applied mm p is total rainfall mm δs is variation in soil water storage in the 0 80 cm soil depths between two consecutive measurements of soil water content mm dp is deep percolation mm which was the sum of water flux at the 80 cm depth ro is runoff caused by irrigation mm which was ignored due to the weak topographic variations and the low irrigation rate for each event 20 mm and cr was water transported upward by capillary rise from a shallow water table towards the root zone which was also ignored since the ground water table depth in the area is approximately 50 m below ground surface the kc for each management zone was defined as zone specific kc it was calculated every 7 10 days using the single crop coefficient approach recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 and the daily kc value was obtained by interpolation the values of kc were calculated as follows 7 k c e t a e t 0 where eta is the crop water requirement mm and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm daily climate parameters for calculating et0 and the total precipitation were collected from a weather station watchdog 2000 spectrum technologies inc aurora ill installed approximately 100 m from the study field based on the previous two years of study in the same field yang 2014 single kc values for the whole field in the development stage mid season stage and end of the late season stage were 0 97 1 28 and 0 51 respectively the kc values suggested by fao 56 adjusted for the relative humidity and wind speed conditions kcr estimated by eq 7 adjusted for the dp and management zone condition kc1 and estimated kc2 and adjusted for management zone condition were compared three point values for kc were estimated every 7 10 days in this study to construct and describe the kc curves the mean kc during the initial mid season and end of the late season stages approximately 1 25 55 80 and 90 100 days after sowing respectively were defined as kc ini kc mid and kc end respectively 2 5 data analysis all data were analysed using the statistical product and service solutions spss 16 0 software package one way analysis of variance anova was used to measure the effect of awc or irrigation strategy swc swb and rf on dp with significance set at p 0 05 the coefficient of variation cv was used to quantify the spatial change in dp among treatments 3 results and discussions 3 1 irrigation scheduling a total of 359 and 293 mm rainfall was received during the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively one heavy rainfall event of 162 mm occurred on 20 july accounting for 45 of the seasonal rainfall in the 2016 season fig 2a a more even rainfall distribution was observed during the 2017 season fig 2b irrigation in the amount of 35 mm and 70 mm were applied for the rainfed treatment to aid fertilization in 2016 and 2017 respectively in 2016 the irrigation amount among irrigation treatments for z1 ranged from 175 to 215 mm and the maximum value was observed in the z1w1 treatment the irrigation applied for z2 ranged from 135 to 155 mm and both the z2w2 and z2w3 treatments received 155 mm of irrigation in 2017 the irrigation amounts for the w1 treatments in z1 z2 and z3 were 70 130 and 110 mm respectively the irrigation applied for the w2 and w3 treatments for the three management zones was 190 mm with the exception of the z2w3 treatment 186 mm compared with the swb method the swc method decreased the water applied by approximately 22 and this value was based on that previously reported by li et al 2018 in this field this finding suggests the possibility of overprediction of et however some researchers reported that there were no obvious differences between the two methods stone et al 2016 sui and vories 2020 3 2 daily deep percolation rates the daily deep percolation rate dp at 80 cm depth for all irrigation strategies in the three management zones during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons is shown in fig 2a and b in general dp fluctuated greatly with time in both seasons before late july and after early september when no irrigation event was triggered high dp values were observed for the three management zones especially in 2016 this result was consistent with that reported by li and shao 2014 indicating that high dp occurred in the initial and senescence stages this finding was mainly attributed to the fact that crop water requirements were relatively minimal during the initial and ending growth stages chilundo et al 2018 during the mid season both the maximum dp estimated for z2 8 8 mm d 1 and z3 7 6 mm d 1 was detected in the middle of august this finding might be attributed the largest rainfall of 162 mm observed on july 20 which generated the high soil water content in the deep layer considering that the standard rainfall and or irrigation amounts were generally less than 20 mm in 2017 the maximum dp of 2 mm d 1 for z1 and 0 6 mm d 1 for z2 were detected 4 and 6 days after the largest rainfall of 62 mm respectively the hysteresis was consistent with the results observed elsewhere cattan et al 2007 and was considered to be affected by synthetic factors such as the amount and pattern of rainfall wang et al 2020 initial soil water content sheikh et al 2010 wang et al 2014 soil hydraulic characteristics russo 1984 and soil physical properties bodman and colman 1944 3 3 cumulative deep percolation the seasonal dp for the 2016 and 2017 seasons are summarized in table 3 the mean dp for all the treatments in 2017 was 4 mm which was 80 lower than that in 2016 for the three soil profiles the minimum mean cumulative dp was observed in z2 in both seasons and it was 42 and 84 lower than that in z1 and z3 respectively this result again indicated that homogeneous soil properties had the potential to reduce dp compared with layered soils huang et al 2011 li et al 2019 compared to the irrigation treatments the dp for the rainfed treatment was 56 lower in 2016 but was 133 higher in 2017 demonstrating that the irrigation amounts did not always increase the risk of percolation for the three management zones the maximum dp was detected in different treatments in z1 the dp values in the swc treatments were 59 and 91 higher than those in the swb and rf treatments in 2016 and were 20 and 87 higher in 2017 in z2 and z3 the maximum dp values were detected in the swb treatments during both seasons this result revealed that the irrigation strategy considering the real time soil water content tended to increase the risk of dp in the field with greater sand content whereas the method considering weather conditions might increase this risk in the field with the lower sand content furthermore the results indicating that the maximum dp was not detected in the rf treatments in these management zones demonstrated that the combination of swb and rain forecasting decreased the risk of dp in sandy soil with different layered soil textures compared to the swc and swb treatments the mean dp values in the rf treatments were reduced by 3 and 36 in 2016 and 47 and 36 in 2017 respectively in contrast to the result that the dp tended to increase as the amount of water applied increased wang et al 2014 no deterministic relationship was noted between water received irrigation rainfall and dp in our study neither management zones nor irrigation strategies imposed significant effects p 0 05 on the dp in either season table 3 the specific irrigation time and amount for each management zone may be the main reason this finding might be related to the large spatial variability across the field table 4 the cv for each irrigation strategy and management zone ranged from 0 50 to 4 67 in 2016 and from 0 12 to 0 93 in 2017 demonstrating medium to strong variability as defined by lei et al 1988 the proportion of dp in water applied was 4 in 2016 and 1 in 2017 these values were lower than those reported by other researchers which ranged from 8 to 70 ji et al 2007 behera and panda 2009 li and shao 2014 liang et al 2019 this phenomenon verified that the amount of dp could be reduced through vri management in this study 80 cm is defined as the boundary of the deep percolation although most of the roots are in this layer the water in the lower layer still interacts with the upper layer to verify the contribution of soil water below the maize root zone layer of 80 cm the proportion of the soil water storage of 80 120 cm that accounts for the total water use was calculated this proportion was 2 4 and 4 4 in the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively 3 4 crop coefficient 3 4 1 variation of crop coefficients during the growing seasons the estimated values of kc1 and kc2 and the generalized kcr kc1 and kc2 curves for z2 in the 2016 and 2017 seasons are shown in fig 3a and b the variation in kc for other management zones exhibited a seasonal variation pattern similar to z2 this value increased from the initial stage reached a maximum value at the end of the rapid development stage and decreased until it reached a lower value at the end of the growing period this trend was similar to the variation in daily kc obtained from lysimeters on the north china plain liu and pereira 2000 su et al 2005 compared with the kcr curve kc1 and kc2 were reduced during the entire growing stage in 2016 and during the mid season in 2017 kc1 was lower than kc2 especially in 2016 when a large dp was observed crop coefficients for the three scenarios at the three growing stages for z1 z2 and z3 are presented in table 5 the average kc ranged from 0 66 to 0 85 and from 0 80 to 0 97 for the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively the kc value was lower than that reported by liu et al 2002 1 1 but was consistent with that reported by kang et al 2003 0 45 1 43 in their 10 year study the mean zone specific kc1 adjusted for dp values obtained from the two years at the initial mid season and end of the late season stages were 0 48 1 07 and 0 57 for z1 0 54 0 86 and 0 55 for z2 and 0 64 1 15 and 0 36 for z3 respectively similarly the mean zone specific kc2 values were 0 55 1 11 and 0 64 0 59 0 91 and 0 64 and 0 84 1 16 and 0 37 respectively considering the dp amount the mean values of kc for z1 z2 and z3 were reduced by 5 8 and 6 respectively for the three management zones the values of kc for z2 were always lower than those for z1 and z3 the values of kc1 and kc2 for z2 were 18 and 12 lower than those for z1 in 2016 respectively the value of kc1 for z2 was 13 and 12 lower and the value of kc2 was 13 lower than that for z1 and z3 in 2017 respectively compared with kc2 the difference in kc1 among management zones increased this result indicated that the difference in kc among management zones with variability in soil properties would increase after considering the value of dp especially when a large and uneven distribution of precipitation occurred 3 4 2 crop water requirements to improve the accuracy of swb using zone specific kc values the crop water requirements et1 and et2 were calculated using kc1 and kc2 respectively and et3 was calculated using the historical uniform kc3 in the field mentioned in the former section as shown in table 6 when considering the dp amount the average et1 was 24 mm and 36 mm less than that for et2 in 2016 and 2017 respectively among the management zones et1 based on kc1 in z2 was 37 mm less than that in z1 in 2016 and 44 mm and 59 mm less than that in z1 and z3 in 2017 respectively a similarly lower et2 was observed in z2 compared with that noted in z1 and z3 for both seasons the phenomenon that the low water requirement was again observed in z2 remained consistent with that reported by zhao et al 2017 and li et al 2018 in the same field when the zone specific kc was not considered the crop water requirement et3 was overestimated and was 408 and 371 mm for the 2016 and 2017 seasons respectively in 2016 et1 and et2 were 60 and 42 mm less than et3 for z1 and 97 and 66 mm less than et3 for z2 respectively in 2017 et1 and et2 in z1 to z3 were greater than et3 except that et1 in z2 was 18 mm less than et3 in total the mean et1 was 78 mm less than the mean et3 in 2016 but was 16 mm greater in 2017 a similar annually varied et was also observed by nijbroek et al 2003 demonstrating that the irrigation amount fluctuated widely among different years when the irrigation strategy was based on 25 year meteorological data in a vri system these results indicated that it was feasible to enhance the water saving potential of the swb method by using zone specific kc values whereas its effect was greatly affected by interannual precipitation the water saving capacity of the vri system was observed especially in the year when the rainfall was unevenly distributed 4 conclusions the effects of irrigation strategies and soil properties on the characteristics of daily deep percolation were evaluated by field experiments in the semi humid climates of the north china plain furthermore the influence of the zone specific kc for the three management zones on the soil water balance method was studied the following conclusions are supported by this study 1 among the three irrigation strategies the mean two year cumulative dp amount for the treatment considering the rain forecast for the next three days rf was reduced by 10 and 36 compared to the swc and swb methods respectively when minimizing dp is the objective for vri management the rf method is recommended 2 affected by soil properties the minimum mean dp was observed in z2 with a uniform soil profile this value was 29 less than that in z1 where the soil sand content increased along the depth and was 42 less than that in z3 where a clay interface existed 3 incorporating deep percolation the mean values of kc could be reduced by 6 11 for the three management zones compared to those without considering the dp the mean crop water requirement was reduced by 6 when zone specific kc was used using zone specific kc derived by subtracting deep percolation would be helpful to enhance the water savings of variable rate irrigation managed under the

2016 and 22 8 2017 higher peanut yield than the conventional practice iwwbf0 treatment bf1 5 and bf0 75 produced similar peanut yields in all water treatments the enhanced peanut yield with biochar based fertilizer could be attributed to increases in main stem height leaf area chlorophyll content photosynthetic rate and total n and k uptake severe water stress decreased morpho physiological traits total n and k uptake and yield in peanut while moderate water stress maintained these traits compared to the well watered treatment thus peanuts can sustain growth under moderate water stress biochar based fertilizer alleviated the adverse effect of water stress on growth nutrient uptake and yield in peanut in conclusion a biochar based fertilizer rate of 0 75 t ha 1 under moderate water stress 60 65 field capacity improves growth and yield in peanut and could be recommended for peanut production in arid or semi arid areas keywords biochar based fertilizer water stress arachis hypogaea yield nutrient uptake 1 introduction peanut arachis hypogaea l is a globally important oil and cash crop that is widely cultivated in more than 100 countries in china peanut production accounts for 30 of oil crop production xiong et al 2013 china s average annual planting area and total peanut production are ranked first and second respectively in the world faostat 2018 however peanut in china is mostly planted in arid and semi arid areas where regional rainfall shortages and seasonal drought are limiting factors for peanut production zhang et al 2011 more than 93 of peanut crops in the liaoning province are grown in the western semi arid areas in 2015 peanut yield per unit area in liaoning was about 1 61 103 kg ha 1 of 45 2 of the average peanut yield in china national bureau of statistics 2016 hence there is potential for increasing peanut yield in liaoning drought reduces peanut yields by more than 20 in china and can decrease peanut quality zhang et al 2012 however the drought resistant nature of the plant can allow it to thrive under moderate water stress conditions liu et al 2009 yang et al 2015 indicated that higher peanut yields and water use efficiency were obtained when the soil moisture threshold was maintained at 60 field capacity relative to lower 50 field capacity levels during plant growth yao et al 2016 reported that peanut achieved higher photosynthetic rate yield and water use efficiency under moderate water stress than under severe water stress with the increasing water scarcity it is important to develop water saving irrigation techniques to maintain and even increase peanut yield in western liaoning especially in arid and semi arid areas low nutrient nitrogen potassium supply in the sandy loams sandy soils in arid and semi arid areas is another limiting factor for peanut production in recent years biochar has been intensively applied as an effective soil amendment to enhance soil nutrient and water retention capacity and increase crop productivity by improving soil physicochemical properties li et al 2018 biochar is a carbon rich by product generated from the pyrolysis of various organic materials under oxygen deficient conditions typically it has a well developed pore structure large surface area good adsorption and high degree of stability el naggar et al 2019 these properties determine its role in increasing soil c storage improving soil water and nutrient retention enhancing soil fertility and increasing crop yields however some studies reported that the effectiveness of biochar use depends on the nutrient status of the soil in poor nutrient soils biochar use had little to no positive effect on plants performance owning to its limited supply of nutrient to plants hussain et al 2016 el naggar et al 2019 most researchers agree that biochar used in combination with mineral fertilizer could act as a carrier to gradually release mineral fertilizers during the plant growing season matching plant nutrient requirements and reducing nutrient leaching thus improving fertilizer use efficiency and crop yields puga et al 2020 the combined application of biochar and mineral fertilizer also compensates for the nutrient deficiency associated with using biochar alone khan et al 2008 laird et al 2010 saha et al 2019 indicated that combined biochar and chemical fertilizer application performed better than biochar alone the mixture of biochar and mineral fertilizers applied in temperate soil conditions increased nitrogen use efficiency in wheat maize and rice by 21 44 and 74 respectively when compared with mineral fertilizers alone joseph et al 2013 zheng et al 2017 he et al 2018 liu et al 2013 reported that biochar based fertilizer applied in a peanut field significantly increased available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium contents in soil relative to mineral fertilizer alone khan et al 2008 demonstrated that wood derived biochar combined with mineral fertilizers gradually and stably released nutrients into the soil moreover biochar based fertilizers could still positively affect soil after the nutrients have fully been released however the application of biochar based fertilizer in agricultural soil can also have environmental risks alvarez et al 2021 as biochar could be produced from different kinds of raw materials including residues of livestock manure municipal sludge and polluted crops that often contain numerous heavy metals the heavy metals can be hard to volatilize during the high temperature carbonization and ultimately left in the carbonized products which may generate pollution schievano et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 it has also been reported that combined application of biochar 40 t ha 1 and fertilizer 240 kg n ha 1 reduced biomass and diversity of beneficial microbes in soil li et al 2020 the impact of biochar based fertilizer on the soil environment and microbes may be related to the feedstock type production conditions or application rate of biochar ibrahim et al 2020 akhtar et al 2014 reported that biochar application increased fruit yield and quality of tomato under moisture stress conditions in a sandy loam soil there are many reports in the literature regarding the effect of biochar or biochar based fertilizer application on peanut growth yield and nutrient uptake xu et al 2015 tan et al 2018 but the response of peanut to biochar based fertilizer application under water stress is not known batool et al 2015 reported that biochar use can mitigate drought stress in plants given its high carbon content about 80 that causes it to conserve moisture and nutrients for plants to use in drought stress conditions whether biochar based fertilizer application can alleviate the negative impact of water stress on peanuts by improving soil water and nutrient retention needs investigation given reports in the literature that the application of biochar resulted in improved plant growth haider et al 2015 photosynthetic traits akhtar et al 2014 plant nutrient uptake zoghi et al 2019 and conservation of soil moisture and nutrients batool et al 2015 we hypothesized that the application of biochar would improve the morpho physiological traits total n and k uptake water use efficiency and yield of peanut under water stress our focus on n and k is based on the notion that they are more prone to losses in the soil than p especially under conditions of water stress also given the impact of biochar on conserving soil nutrient we hypothesized it would have a positive impact on conserving soil n and k resulting in higher availability of the nutrients under conditions of water stress for these reasons we aimed to 1 evaluate the effect of combined biochar based fertilizer and irrigation managements on morpho physiological traits main stem height leaf area chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate total n and k uptake water use and yield of peanut and soil total n inorganic n and available k content 2 identify the alleviation effect of biochar based fertilizer on peanut under water stress conditions 3 assess how biochar based fertilizer affect peanut yield through impacting

field capacity fc until maturity field capacity was measured using the overnight free drainage method proposed by de melo carvalho et al 2014 and suliman et al 2017 this involved placing the saturated soil samples in plastic containers with meshed bottoms and para film covers to prevent evapotranspiration and allowed to drain for 24 h water retained in the soil was taken as the field capacity the ms pots were rewatered to 75 fc when the soil moisture reached 60 65 fc the ss pots were rewatered to 75 fc when the soil moisture reached 50 55 fc re watering took an average of four and eight days

reduced p 0 05 in the ss treatment but was not affected p 0 05 in the ms treatment relative to the ww treatment in both years irrigation regimes and the interaction of i b had significant p 0 05 effects on water use in both years table 3 irrigation regimes and biochar based fertilizer had significant p 0 05 effects on water use efficiency wue in both years in 2017 bf0 75 increased water use

regardless of biochar based fertilizer applications wue increased p 0 05 in the ms and ss treatments relative to the ww treatment in both years 3 4 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on total n and k uptake irrigation regimes and biochar based fertilizer had significant p 0 05 effects on total n and k uptake in peanut in both years table 4 in the ms treatment bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased p 0 05 total n uptake by 54 7 and 41 4 in 2016 and 50 0 and 52 4 in 2017 respectively relative to the control in the ss treatment the application of the biochar based fertilizer caused no significant p 0 05 changes to the plants n uptake levels in both years in the ww treatment bf0 75 increased total n uptake by 39 2 2016 and 35 3 2017 relative to the control irrespective of biochar

between peanut yield and total n uptake under the different irrigations and biochar based fertilizer rates in 2016 r 2 0 860 p 0 01 and 2017 r 2 0 882 p 0 01 indicating that peanut yield had a positive correlation with total n uptake at harvest in both years in the ms treatment bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased p 0 05 total k uptake by 238 and 341 in 2016 and 197 and 259 in 2017 respectively relative to the control in the ww treatment the corresponding increases for bf0 75 and bf1 5 were 194 and 230 in 2016 and 173 and 248 in 2017 respectively in the ss treatment bf1 5 increased total k

years relative to the ww treatment fig 5b shows the correlations between total k uptake and peanut yield under different irrigations and biochar based fertilizer treatments in 2016 r 2 0 665 p 0 01 and 2017 r 2 0 758 p 0 01 indicating that total k uptake in peanut was positively correlated with peanut yield in both years 3 5 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on soil total n inorganic n and available k content biochar based fertilizer application had significant p 0 05 effect on soil total n nh4 n and no3 n content in both years table 4 irrigation regimes had significant p 0 05 effect on soil nh4 n and no3 n content in both years in 2016 only bf1 5 increased p 0 05 soil total n content in the ww ms and ss treatments by 18 7 18 4 and 22 1 respectively compared to the control as for soil nh4 n content in the ms treatment bf1 5 increased p 0 05 nh4 n content by 93 7 2016 and 14 2 2017 compared to the control in the ww treatment the corresponding increases were 111 2 and 11 7 respectively bf1 5 increased p 0 05 soil no3 n content in the ww treatment by 80 8 in 2016 compared to the control irrespective of biochar based fertilizer application soil nh4 n content increased but no3 n content decreased with increasing water stress in both years irrigation regimes and biochar based fertilizer application had significant p 0 05 effects on soil available k content in both years table 4 bf1 5 increased p 0 05 soil available k content in the ww ms and ss treatments by 157 133 and 131 in 2016 and 65 7 63 7 and 53 2 in 2017 respectively relative to the control while bf0 75 had no significant effect on soil available k content table 4 regardless of biochar based fertilizer application the ss treatment decreased while the ms treatment maintained soil available k content compared to the ww treatment in both years 3 6 principal component analysis pca for the main traits principal component analysis pca was undertaken using the factoextra package in r studio software pca transforms the original measured variables into new uncorrelated variables called principal component the first principal component describes most of the variation in the data the second principal component is orthogonal and covers much of the remaining variation the analyzed data was standardized so that the responses and parameters contribute equally to the data set variance and the principal component calculation šamec et al 2016 pca was performed for 16 selected traits in response to different biochar based fertilizer application and irrigation treatments fig 6 two principal components pcs were identified with eigenvalues 1 11 6 and 2 5 explaining 88 2 of the total variation table 5 fig 6 the first component pc1 represented 72 4 of the variation and

and msh fig 6b in conclusion the combination of moderate water stress and 0 75 t ha 1 biochar based fertilizer imsbf0 75 treatment had relatively higher total n and k uptake and less water use than the conventional practice iwwbf0 treatment which enhanced morpho physiological traits and ultimately increased peanut yield and wue therefore the imsbf0 75 treatment is an appropriate irrigation and fertilizer management practice for achieving higher peanut yields with less water especially in water deficient areas 4 discussion 4 1 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on morpho physiological traits in peanut we found that biochar based fertilizer application at 0 75 and 1 5 t ha 1 increased msh in peanut compared to the control this is in accordance with the findings of oladele et al 2019 who reported that combined application of rice husk biochar and n fertilizer significantly increased plant height of rice relative to the control which was possibly a result of increased nutrient availability it might also be due to that biochar riched with carbon was capable of conserving water and nutrients for plants and thus improved plant growth in the drought conditions batool et al 2015 additionally greater differences between treatments fertilized vs control plants were observed in well watered ww or moderate water stress ms than in severe water stress ss this may be due to that msh of peanut was severely suppressed under extreme drought condition so that biochar based fertilizer exerted less alleviation effect on it similarly afshar et al 2016 reported no significant effect of biochar on plant height of milk thistle under severe drought stress relative to the control 50 fc water stress can adversely affect morpho physiological traits and the growth of plant ghanbary et al 2018 jafarnia et al 2018 in our study severe water stress reduced msh while moderate water stress had no change on it relative to the ww treatment which is in line with the findings of cao et al 2017 this indicated that the drought resistant nature of the chosen peanut variety aided in the plant s adaptability to moderate moisture stressful conditions the decreased main stem height with severe water stress might be attributed to that extreme water deficiency impacted cell division and cell enlargement thus reduced plant height sampathkumar et al 2013 in the present study compared with the no fertilizer control biochar based fertilizer applications increased leaf area of peanut under moderate water stress at the pod setting and pod filling stages table 1 this is consistent with studies in okra batool et al 2015 and maize tanure et al 2019 which attributed the increased leaf area with biochar based fertilizer to better nutrient accumulation resulted from enhanced soil fertility in addition the improved leaf area might do good to the constant supply of nutrient to the plants by alleviating water deficiency as the application of biochar based fertilizer might facilitate an expansion of the plant s leaf area to increase canopy cover so that soil moisture loss is reduced because of enhanced shading our findings also suggested that biochar based fertilizer could make the plant adjust to environmental stressful conditions through increasing leaf area in case of the presence of higher soil nutrient resources brought about by biochar based fertilizer application like msh leaf area in peanut declined under severe water stress but was not influenced under moderate water stress relative to the ww treatment table 1 afshar et al 2016 and li et al 2019 highlighted that root growth inhibition induced by severe water stress decreased leaf area in general biochar based fertilizer alleviated the adverse effects of drought on peanut growth by enhancing plant growth traits in water stressed treatments chlorophyll content has been widely used as an important indicator of photosynthetic activity in plants zou et al 2018 in this study biochar based fertilizer increased chlorophyll content of peanut at all measured growth stages in different water treatments this is in accordance with you et al 2021 who reported that wood chip biochar applied in combination with fertilizer increased chlorophyll content of ice plant leaves the improvement in chlorophyll content could be ascribed to that biochar based fertilizer improved water and nutrient availability to roots thus increased pigment synthesis and n uptake in plant leaves speratti et al 2018 as chlorophyll content is closely related to leaf n content in plant agegnehu et al 2015 found that biochar based fertilizer increased leaf chlorophyll content which might be resulted from that biochar improved soil fertility and the mineral fertilizers enhanced n supply under drought conditions thereby increasing soil available n and leaf n content drought decreased leaf chlorophyll content of different crops teixeira et al 2014 li et al 2019 in this study chlorophyll content declined under severe water stress relative to the ww treatment our findings are in accordance with alfi and azizi 2015 najafinezhad et al 2015 and cao et al 2017 who highlighted that reduced chlorophyll contents in drought conditions resulted from deficiencies in water and nitrogen or production of reactive oxygen species that might degrade chlorophyll pigments in addition the chlorophyll pigment is sensitive to increasing environmental stress especially to drought moran et al 1994 thomas and howarth 2000 biochar based fertilizer might improve soil water and nitrogen retention and prevent oxidative stress effects thus ameliorating the adverse impact of drought stress on leaf chlorophyll content of peanut photosynthesis is largely affected by nitrogen availability in plant as 57 of leaf nitrogen is contained in the chloroplasts and utilized to synthesize photosynthetic components and allied enzymes xu et al 2012 in the present study biochar based fertilizer application increased pn at the pod setting and pod filling stages in 2016 and all measured stages in 2017 relative to the control fig 3 xu et al 2015 and zainul et al 2017 also reported that biochar amendment added to soil improved leaf pn of peanut by enhancing leaf n and soil available n content the enhanced pn with biochar based fertilizer could be due to that higher availability of nitrogen contents can increase cell wall rigidity and photosynthetic capacity in plants chen et al 2016 moreover biochar increased water holding capacity and decreased bulk density of soil resulting in greater stomatal conductance and more co2 diffusion which lead to improved pn agegnehu et al 2017 in this study biochar based fertilizer application enhanced pn in moderate or severe water stress conditions which was supported by akhtar et al 2014 baronti et al 2014 and zoghi et al 2019 who suggested that combined application of biochar and fertilizer decreased the negative effects of dehydration on the photosynthetic system by increasing the soil water retention capacity the photosynthetic process in plant is prone to inhibition by moisture stress as moisture stress could facilitate leaf senescence as a plant s adaptive mechanism to ensure moisture loss is reduced and reduced number of leaf would affect a plant s photosynthesis cao et al 2017 reduction of pn with water stress has been reported for various crops which was mainly attributed to stomatal and non stomatal limitations álvarez and sánchez blanco 2013 in our study severe water stress reduced pn relative to the ww treatment zoghi et al 2019 found that pn significantly declined with increasing severity of water stress and suggested that plants in drought conditions closed stomata to reduce water loss and maintain water homeostasis thus decreasing the photosynthetic rate basu et al 2016 mannan et al 2016 4 2 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on yield and water use in peanut biochar based fertilizer has been frequently reported to increase crop yield saha et al 2019 yang et al 2021 in this study biochar based fertilizer applications of 0 75 and 1 5 t ha 1 to silty sandy loam soil increased peanut yields by 34 6 and 31 1 two year mean respectively relative to the control this is in line with yamato et al 2006 who reported that combined application of 10 t ha 1 biochar with 75 kg ha 1 of each npk significantly increased peanut yield up to 50 moreover in the ms or ss treatments biochar based fertilizer applications increased peanut yield compared to the control the yield improvement observed could be because biochar based fertilizer resulted in the continuous and prolonged supply of nutrients to plants under moisture stress conditions which compensated for nutrient losses from the soil and ensured better nutrient uptake thereby enhancing crop growth and yield haider et al 2017 biochar adsorbs nutrients from fertilizer and later releases them to provide nutrients for plant growth this could explain the persistent nutrients supply by biochar based fertilizer yang et al 2021 yamato et al 2006 and xu et al 2015 indicated that biochar increased peanut yields by stimulating the nodulation and biological n fixation process besides our study revealed significant positive correlations between peanut yield and total n uptake fig 5a and total k uptake fig 5b in both years suggesting that biochar based fertilizer might increase peanut yield through improving plant n and k uptake as nutrients uptake by plant play an important role in determining yield formation the improved morpho physiological traits and yield components pod number seed weight and kernel rate with biochar based fertilizer also contributed to the enhanced yields table 3 additionally in 2016 in the ww treatment bf0 75 had higher seed weight than bf1 5 which could be related to the higher total n uptake in bf0 75 table 4 as seed weight has a significant positive correlation with the total n uptake in peanut junjittakarn et al 2013 in this study severe water stress reduced peanut yield while moderate water stress had no change on it in both years as compared to the well watered treatment table 3 which is in agreement with cao et al 2017 the reduced total n and k uptake in the ss treatment than the ww treatment may be responsible for the decreased peanut yield with severe water stress table 4 in the ms and ss treatments bf0 75 and bf1 5 had higher peanut yields than bf0 in both years except the ss treatment in 2016 table 3 indicating that biochar based fertilizer application effectively alleviated the adverse impacts of water stress on peanut production in 2016 in the ww treatment bf0 75 had higher peanut yield than bf1 5 table 3 indicating that the effect of biochar based fertilizer application on peanut yield was not dose dependent excessive application of biochar based fertilizer might not continually improve plant growth as the high c n ratios might immobilize n and decrease plant n uptake table 4 xu et al 2021 reduced plant n uptake could decrease peanut yield fig 5a li et al 2018 reported that application of 60 t ha 1 biochar produced lower tomato yields than 40 t ha 1 biochar and suggested that excessive addition of biochar might decrease soil wettability resulting in uneven distribution of soil water in the root zone and impacting root water and nutrient uptake and crop growth in both years the imsbf0 75 and imsbf1 5 treatments produced relatively higher peanut yields than other treatments taking the benefit cost of biochar based fertilizer application into consideration we recommended biochar based fertilizer application rate of 0 75 t ha 1 in combination with moderate water stress as the best choice for peanut production in arid and semi arid areas in our study water use of bf0 75 and bf1 5 treatments did not significantly differ from bf0 under any water treatment in either year except under moderate water stress in 2017 table 3 it is reported that biochar increases soil water availability and water retention capacity due to its large specific surface area and porous structure ali et al 2017 zoghi et al 2019 on the contrary tanure et al 2019 reported that biochar based fertilizer treatments increased water use and suggested that it might be due to the greater biomass under biochar based fertilizer requiring more water for growth than the control treatment in our study the insignificant effect of biochar based fertilizer on water use might be due to the lack of water percolation as the pots had sealed bottoms therefore the water saving potential of biochar based fertilizer for peanut production needs to be furtherly validated under field conditions however under moderate or severe water stress biochar based fertilizer applications 0 75 and 1 5 t ha 1 increased wue as compared to the no fertilizer control table 3 because they produced relatively higher yields and comparable water use than the no fertilizer control in 2016 the imsbf0 75 treatment had the highest wue 2 63 g kg 1 among all treatments in 2017 though the issbf1 5 treatment had the highest wue 1 79 g kg 1 its peanut yield was relatively lower than the conventional practice iwwbf0 therefore considering improved peanut yield and water use efficiency the imsbf0 75 treatment is optimal for peanut production in water deficient areas 4 3 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on total n and k uptake in peanut in the present study bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased peanut n uptake compared to the control which is in agreement with previous study muhammed et al 2020 the increased total n uptake with biochar based fertilizer could be supported by the enhanced n retention total n nh4 n and no3 n in soil as more available n in soil could continuously supply nutrient for plant when required and therefore increase plant n uptake ibrahim et al 2020 suggested that biochar based fertilizer applied in soil could effectively act as slow release of n fertilizer after one time application which provide adequate n for plant growth in addition the increased n uptake is associated with improved soil cec by biochar as soil with a high cec are more likely to adsorb nh4 which can effectively improve the utilization of n in the soil liang et al 2006 it is also related to the supply of n from biochar itself and mineral fertilizer glaser et al 2002 indicated that ash in biochar contributes nutrients such as ca mg and k into soil solution increasing soil ph and enhancing nutrient availability and supply for plants this was confirmed by van zwieten et al 2010 who reported that biochar increased nutrient availability by impacting soil ph which plays an important role in regulating nutrient availability in this study in the ms treatment bf0 75 and bf1 5 had significantly higher total n uptake than bf0 in both years indicating that biochar based fertilizer alleviated the negative effect of moderate water stress on peanut n uptake zoghi et al 2019 reported that biochar improved soil nutrient availability and n uptake in water stressed treatments and attributed the results to that biochar increased soil water holding capacity and enhanced water availability to plants under moisture stress conditions so as to improve plant n uptake since drought is a limiting factor for plant n uptake however bf0 75 and bf1 5 in the ss treatment had relatively lower total n uptake than bf0 in the ww treatment in both years table 4 suggesting that the negative impact of severe water stress would suppress n uptake despite the application of biochar based fertilizer in 2016 in the ww treatment bf1 5 had lower total nitrogen uptake than bf0 75 which might be due to the higher biochar based fertilizer rates resulting in a higher c n ratio in soil enhancing n immobilization and decreasing plant n uptake tammeorg et al 2014 xu et al 2021 furthermore the effect of biochar based fertilizer on nodule traits and biological n fixation needs to be investigated using the 15n labeled technique to elucidate the contribution of biochar based fertilizer to peanut n uptake in the present study bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased peanut k uptake compared to the control this is in line with the findings of walter and rao 2015 who attributed the increased n uptake with biochar based fertilizer to presence of k in biochar itself and mineral fertilizer and enhanced k fertilizer use efficiency by biochar the increased k availability is vital for improving growth biological n fixation and the competitive ability of legume species as k is essential for biological n fixation mia et al 2014 oram et al 2014 in the ms and ss treatments the higher total k uptake in bf0 75 or bf1 5 than bf0 indicated that biochar based fertilizer alleviated the adverse impacts of water stress on peanut k uptake 4 4 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on soil n and k availability it has been previously reported that biochar based fertilizer could improve soil fertility by increasing the amounts of soil available n p k etc oladele et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 in our study irrespective of water treatments application of biochar based fertilizers significantly increased soil nh4 n and no3 n contents compared to the no fertilizer control which is consistent with previous study gao et al 2016 the increased soil nh4 n with biochar based fertilizer might be ascribed to that biochar particles adsorbed nh4 thereby reducing soil nh4 n loss and increasing its content in soil agegnehu et al 2016 in addition biochar applied in soil increased ammonia oxidation rate through impacting soil microorganisms which play a leading role in the nitrogen transformation process nguyen et al 2017 and thus enhanced nitrification and soil no3 n availability song et al 2014 however there are also reports indicating that biochar decreased soil inorganic n content which were mostly ascribed to that biochar immobilized soil mineral n due to the input of labile c and enhanced soil c n ratio agegnehu et al 2015 the inconsistent results have been attributed to feedstock type production condition and rate of biochar as well as the soil type hossain et al 2020 as for water treatments soil nh4 n content was increased while no3 n content was decreased with increasing water stress table 4 this was supported by morillas et al 2015 who reported that frequent drying rewetting cycles resulted in increases in soil nh4 n and reductions in soil no3 n levels this suggested that nitrifiers did not oxidize large amounts of nh4 n since nitrification rates decreased with decreasing water potential hartmann et al 2013 unlike soil inorganic n it is generally accepted that biochar could significantly increase soil k availability oram et al 2014 in our study biochar based fertilizer applications significantly increased soil available k content irrespective of water treatments which is consistent with previous studies yao et al 2012 liu et al 2013 oladele et al 2019 the increased soil available k with biochar based fertilizer might be due to that electrostatic attraction forces on the surface of biochar soil matrix enhanced k retention in soil yao et al 2012 furthermore the k contained in biochar based fertilizer itself could also help to improve soil k availability regardless of biochar based fertilizer application the ms and ss treatments had lower soil available k content than the ww treatment table 4 which was in line with jahan et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 this could be explained by that well watered conditions improved the release of k into the soil by facilitating the reduction of mn4 to mn2 and fe3 to fe2 which displaced k from cec sites patrick et al 1985 5 conclusions regardless of biochar based fertilizer morpho physiological traits main stem height leaf area chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate total n and k uptake and yield in peanut decreased with severe water stress but were maintained with moderate water stress relative to the well watered treatment this indicates the plants can adapt to moderate stressful conditions without a significant decline in performance however the performance of the plants was impaired by severe moisture stressful conditions the application of biochar based fertilizer at 0 75 or 1 5 t ha 1 increased the total n and k uptake and yield in peanut under different water treatments the enhanced peanut yield with biochar based fertilizer could be due to improved main stem height leaf area chlorophyll content photosynthetic rate and soil nutrients n and k availability moreover addition of biochar based fertilizer ameliorated the adverse effect of water stress on growth nutrient uptake and yield in peanut in conclusion the biochar based fertilizer application rate of 0 75 t ha 1 combined with moderate water stress 60 65 fc could increase peanut yield and be recommended for peanut production in arid or semi arid areas funding the current research was supported by the natural science foundation of liaoning province 20180550819 and the scientific research fund of liaoning provincial education

9891,biochar based fertilizers increase soil fertility nutrient uptake and crop yield however the response of peanut arachis hypogaea l growth to biochar based fertilizer under water stress and the

2016 and 22 8 2017 higher peanut yield than the conventional practice iwwbf0 treatment bf1 5 and bf0 75 produced similar peanut yields in all water treatments the enhanced peanut yield with biochar based fertilizer could be attributed to increases in main stem height leaf area chlorophyll content photosynthetic rate and total n and k uptake severe water stress decreased morpho physiological traits total n and k uptake and yield in peanut while moderate water stress maintained these traits compared to the well watered treatment thus peanuts can sustain growth under moderate water stress biochar based fertilizer alleviated the adverse effect of water stress on growth nutrient uptake and yield in peanut in conclusion a biochar based fertilizer rate of 0 75 t ha 1 under moderate water stress 60 65 field capacity improves growth and yield in peanut and could be recommended for peanut production in arid or semi arid areas keywords biochar based fertilizer water stress arachis hypogaea yield nutrient uptake 1 introduction peanut arachis hypogaea l is a globally important oil and cash crop that is widely cultivated in more than 100 countries in china peanut production accounts for 30 of oil crop production xiong et al 2013 china s average annual planting area and total peanut production are ranked first and second respectively in the world faostat 2018 however peanut in china is mostly planted in arid and semi arid areas where regional rainfall shortages and seasonal drought are limiting factors for peanut production zhang et al 2011 more than 93 of peanut crops in the liaoning province are grown in the western semi arid areas in 2015 peanut yield per unit area in liaoning was about 1 61 103 kg ha 1 of 45 2 of the average peanut yield in china national bureau of statistics 2016 hence there is potential for increasing peanut yield in liaoning drought reduces peanut yields by more than 20 in china and can decrease peanut quality zhang et al 2012 however the drought resistant nature of the plant can allow it to thrive under moderate water stress conditions liu et al 2009 yang et al 2015 indicated that higher peanut yields and water use efficiency were obtained when the soil moisture threshold was maintained at 60 field capacity relative to lower 50 field capacity levels during plant growth yao et al 2016 reported that peanut achieved higher photosynthetic rate yield and water use efficiency under moderate water stress than under severe water stress with the increasing water scarcity it is important to develop water saving irrigation techniques to maintain and even increase peanut yield in western liaoning especially in arid and semi arid areas low nutrient nitrogen potassium supply in the sandy loams sandy soils in arid and semi arid areas is another limiting factor for peanut production in recent years biochar has been intensively applied as an effective soil amendment to enhance soil nutrient and water retention capacity and increase crop productivity by improving soil physicochemical properties li et al 2018 biochar is a carbon rich by product generated from the pyrolysis of various organic materials under oxygen deficient conditions typically it has a well developed pore structure large surface area good adsorption and high degree of stability el naggar et al 2019 these properties determine its role in increasing soil c storage improving soil water and nutrient retention enhancing soil fertility and increasing crop yields however some studies reported that the effectiveness of biochar use depends on the nutrient status of the soil in poor nutrient soils biochar use had little to no positive effect on plants performance owning to its limited supply of nutrient to plants hussain et al 2016 el naggar et al 2019 most researchers agree that biochar used in combination with mineral fertilizer could act as a carrier to gradually release mineral fertilizers during the plant growing season matching plant nutrient requirements and reducing nutrient leaching thus improving fertilizer use efficiency and crop yields puga et al 2020 the combined application of biochar and mineral fertilizer also compensates for the nutrient deficiency associated with using biochar alone khan et al 2008 laird et al 2010 saha et al 2019 indicated that combined biochar and chemical fertilizer application performed better than biochar alone the mixture of biochar and mineral fertilizers applied in temperate soil conditions increased nitrogen use efficiency in wheat maize and rice by 21 44 and 74 respectively when compared with mineral fertilizers alone joseph et al 2013 zheng et al 2017 he et al 2018 liu et al 2013 reported that biochar based fertilizer applied in a peanut field significantly increased available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium contents in soil relative to mineral fertilizer alone khan et al 2008 demonstrated that wood derived biochar combined with mineral fertilizers gradually and stably released nutrients into the soil moreover biochar based fertilizers could still positively affect soil after the nutrients have fully been released however the application of biochar based fertilizer in agricultural soil can also have environmental risks alvarez et al 2021 as biochar could be produced from different kinds of raw materials including residues of livestock manure municipal sludge and polluted crops that often contain numerous heavy metals the heavy metals can be hard to volatilize during the high temperature carbonization and ultimately left in the carbonized products which may generate pollution schievano et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 it has also been reported that combined application of biochar 40 t ha 1 and fertilizer 240 kg n ha 1 reduced biomass and diversity of beneficial microbes in soil li et al 2020 the impact of biochar based fertilizer on the soil environment and microbes may be related to the feedstock type production conditions or application rate of biochar ibrahim et al 2020 akhtar et al 2014 reported that biochar application increased fruit yield and quality of tomato under moisture stress conditions in a sandy loam soil there are many reports in the literature regarding the effect of biochar or biochar based fertilizer application on peanut growth yield and nutrient uptake xu et al 2015 tan et al 2018 but the response of peanut to biochar based fertilizer application under water stress is not known batool et al 2015 reported that biochar use can mitigate drought stress in plants given its high carbon content about 80 that causes it to conserve moisture and nutrients for plants to use in drought stress conditions whether biochar based fertilizer application can alleviate the negative impact of water stress on peanuts by improving soil water and nutrient retention needs investigation given reports in the literature that the application of biochar resulted in improved plant growth haider et al 2015 photosynthetic traits akhtar et al 2014 plant nutrient uptake zoghi et al 2019 and conservation of soil moisture and nutrients batool et al 2015 we hypothesized that the application of biochar would improve the morpho physiological traits total n and k uptake water use efficiency and yield of peanut under water stress our focus on n and k is based on the notion that they are more prone to losses in the soil than p especially under conditions of water stress also given the impact of biochar on conserving soil nutrient we hypothesized it would have a positive impact on conserving soil n and k resulting in higher availability of the nutrients under conditions of water stress for these reasons we aimed to 1 evaluate the effect of combined biochar based fertilizer and irrigation managements on morpho physiological traits main stem height leaf area chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate total n and k uptake water use and yield of peanut and soil total n inorganic n and available k content 2 identify the alleviation effect of biochar based fertilizer on peanut under water stress conditions 3 assess how biochar based fertilizer affect peanut yield through impacting plant n and k uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and materials a pot experiment was conducted at the liaoning academy of agricultural sciences shenyang liaoning province china 41 53 n

field capacity fc until maturity field capacity was measured using the overnight free drainage method proposed by de melo carvalho et al 2014 and suliman et al 2017 this involved placing the saturated soil samples in plastic containers with meshed bottoms and para film covers to prevent evapotranspiration and allowed to drain for 24 h water retained in the soil was taken as the field capacity the ms pots were rewatered to 75 fc when the soil moisture reached 60 65 fc the ss pots were rewatered to 75 fc when the soil moisture reached 50 55 fc re watering took an average of four and eight days for the ms and ss treatments respectively deionized water was used for irrigation in both years the experiment comprised 27 pots 3 irrigations 3 fertilizer rates 3 replications the pots were 30 cm high with a 26 cm top diameter and 18 cm bottom diameter each pot was filled with 15 kg of sieved dry soil and watered to 100 fc the soil was a mixture of silty sandy loam and sand at a volumetric ratio of 3 1 when the soil moisture reached 70 fc five seeds were sown in each pot and thinned to two after germination water stress was not imposed until all seeds had germinated about 10 days after sowing the pots were placed in a rain shelter to prevent rainfall from affecting the soil moisture of pots seeds were sown on 20 may 2016 and 10 may 2017 and harvested on 30 september 2016 and 20 september 2017 respectively weeds insects and diseases were intensively controlled by chemicals or manual methods to avoid yield losses 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 calculation of water

during the seedling flowering pod setting and pod filling stages when the soil water content in the ww ms and ss treatments reached approximately 70 75 fc 60 65 fc and 50 55 fc respectively the uppermost and fully expanded leaves in each plant was selected for the measurement the measurement was done between 9 00 and 11 00 am on a clear and cloudless day during each growing stage each measurement was taken three times with three leaves measured on two plants per pot 2 3 3 plant n and k uptake measurement at harvest the plants from each pot were collected and separated into root stem leaf and pod oven dried at 70 to constant weight and weighed the dried samples were finely ground to pass through a 0 15 mm sieve to determine n and k concentration tissue n concentration was determined by micro kjeldahl digestion distillation and titration to compute total n uptake yoshida et al 1976 tissue k concentration was determined with a flame photometer m410 sherwood uk following the procedure as described by douglas et al 1980 for each plant part n and k uptake were calculated by multiplying the respective n and k concentrations by the dry weight of each plant organ and then summed for total n and k uptake respectively 2 3 4 soil total n inorganic n and available k measurement after harvest soil samples from 0 to 15 cm depth at three locations in each pot were collected for each pot the collected soil samples were mixed and taken back to the laboratory for total n nh4 n no3 n and available k content determination soil total n content was measured by the kjeldahl method soil nh4 n and no3 n contents were extracted with 2 m kcl and measured with a continuous flow analyzer aa3 seal germany a flame photometer m410 sherwood uk measured soil available k content after extraction with 1 m ammonium acetate following the procedure by zheng et al 2016 2 3 5 yield and yield components measurement at physiological maturity peanut yield from each pot was measured plants were manually threshed and the extracted pods were air dried until they attained 14 moisture content yield components including pod numbers seed weight and kernel rate were also measured pod numbers per pot were obtained by counting the numbers of pods of two plants in each pot seed weight g pot 1 was measured by the weight of all mature seeds of two plants in each pot kernel rate was the

affected the main stem height msh which varied with the water treatments the application of biochar based fertilizers caused significant p 0 05 increase in msh compared to the control bf0 in different water treatments in the ww treatment bf0 75 had higher main stem height than bf1 5 while the reverse was observed in the ms treatment interestingly the between treatment differences fertilized vs control plants observed on the ms and ss plants were larger than observations made on the ww plants especially in 2017 in 2016 the final msh measured at harvest in the ww ms and ss treatments were 23

setting stage by 29 2 compared to the control like the leaf area the chlorophyll content recorded for plants in the ms and ww treatment did not differ significantly p 0 05 from each other while plants in the ss treatment had significantly p 0 05 lower chlorophyll content than plants in the ww treatment table 2 in 2016 at the seedling and flowering stages there were no significant p 0 05 changes in

in any water treatments and bf1 5 increased p 0 05 water use in the ms and ww treatments compared to the control as for wue in the ms treatment bf0 75 increased p 0 05 wue by 53 8 2016 and 12 2 2017 relative to the control in the ss treatment bf1 5 increased p 0 05 wue by 18 5 in 2017 relative to the control in the ww treatment bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased wue by 14 7 and 12 6 in 2017 respectively regardless of biochar based fertilizer applications wue increased p 0 05 in the ms and ss treatments relative to the ww treatment in both years 3 4 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on total n and k uptake irrigation regimes and biochar based fertilizer had significant p 0 05 effects on total n and k uptake in peanut in both years table 4 in the ms treatment bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased p 0 05 total n uptake by 54 7 and 41 4 in 2016 and 50 0 and 52 4 in 2017 respectively relative to the control in the ss treatment the application of the biochar based fertilizer caused no significant p 0 05 changes to the plants n uptake levels in both years in the ww treatment bf0 75 increased total n uptake by 39 2 2016 and 35 3 2017 relative to the control irrespective of biochar

between peanut yield and total n uptake under the different irrigations and biochar based fertilizer rates in 2016 r 2 0 860 p 0 01 and 2017 r 2 0 882 p 0 01 indicating that peanut yield had a positive correlation with total n uptake at harvest in both years in the ms treatment bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased p 0 05 total k uptake by 238 and 341 in 2016 and 197 and 259 in 2017 respectively relative to the control in the ww treatment the corresponding increases for bf0 75 and bf1 5 were 194 and 230 in 2016 and 173 and 248 in 2017 respectively in the ss treatment bf1 5 increased total k

increased but no3 n content decreased with increasing water stress in both years irrigation regimes and biochar based fertilizer application had significant p 0 05 effects on soil available k content

while bf0 75 had no significant effect on soil available k content table 4 regardless of biochar based fertilizer application the ss treatment decreased while the ms treatment maintained soil available k content compared to the ww treatment in both years 3 6 principal component analysis pca for the main traits principal component analysis pca was undertaken using the factoextra package in r studio software pca transforms the original measured variables into new uncorrelated variables called principal component the first principal component describes most of the variation in the data the second principal component is orthogonal and covers much of the remaining variation the analyzed data was standardized so that the responses and parameters contribute equally to the data set variance and the principal component calculation šamec et al 2016 pca was performed for 16 selected traits in response to different biochar based fertilizer application and irrigation treatments fig 6 two principal components pcs were identified with eigenvalues 1 11 6 and 2 5 explaining 88 2 of the total variation table 5 fig 6 the first component pc1 represented 72 4 of the variation and

and msh fig 6b in conclusion the combination of moderate water stress and 0 75 t ha 1 biochar based fertilizer imsbf0 75 treatment had relatively higher total n and k uptake and less water use than the conventional practice iwwbf0 treatment which enhanced morpho physiological traits and ultimately increased peanut yield and wue therefore the imsbf0 75 treatment is an appropriate irrigation and fertilizer management practice for achieving higher peanut yields with less water especially in water deficient areas 4 discussion 4 1 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on morpho physiological traits in peanut we found that biochar based fertilizer application at 0 75 and 1 5 t ha 1 increased msh in peanut compared to the control this is in accordance with the findings of oladele et al 2019 who reported that combined application of rice husk biochar and n fertilizer significantly increased plant height of rice relative to the control which was possibly a result of increased nutrient availability it might also be due to that biochar riched with carbon was capable of conserving water and nutrients for plants and thus improved plant growth in the drought conditions batool et al 2015 additionally greater differences between treatments fertilized vs control plants were observed in well watered ww or moderate water stress ms than in severe water stress ss this may be due to that msh of peanut was severely suppressed under extreme drought condition so that biochar based fertilizer exerted less alleviation effect on it similarly afshar et al 2016 reported no significant effect of biochar on plant height of milk thistle under severe drought stress relative to the control 50 fc water stress can adversely affect morpho physiological traits and the growth of plant ghanbary et al 2018 jafarnia et al 2018 in our study severe water stress reduced msh while moderate water stress had no change on it relative to the ww treatment which is in line with the findings of cao et al 2017 this indicated that the drought resistant nature of the chosen peanut variety aided in the plant s adaptability to moderate moisture stressful conditions the decreased main stem height with severe water stress might be attributed to that extreme water deficiency impacted cell division and cell enlargement thus reduced plant height sampathkumar et al 2013 in the present study compared with the no fertilizer control biochar based fertilizer applications increased leaf area of peanut under moderate water stress at the pod setting and pod filling stages table 1 this is consistent with studies in okra batool et al 2015 and maize tanure et al 2019 which attributed the increased leaf area with biochar based fertilizer to better nutrient accumulation resulted from enhanced soil fertility in addition the improved leaf area might do good to the constant supply of nutrient to the plants by alleviating water deficiency as the application of biochar based fertilizer might facilitate an expansion of the plant s leaf area to increase canopy cover so that soil moisture loss is reduced because of enhanced shading our findings also suggested that biochar based fertilizer could make the plant adjust to environmental stressful conditions through increasing leaf area in case of the presence of higher soil nutrient resources brought about by biochar based fertilizer application like msh leaf area in peanut declined under severe water stress but was not influenced under moderate water stress relative to the ww treatment table 1 afshar et al 2016 and li et al 2019 highlighted that root growth inhibition induced by severe water stress decreased leaf area in general biochar based fertilizer alleviated the adverse effects of drought on peanut growth by enhancing plant growth traits in water stressed treatments chlorophyll content has been widely used as an important indicator of photosynthetic activity in plants zou et al 2018 in this study biochar based fertilizer increased chlorophyll content of peanut at all measured growth stages in different water treatments this is in accordance with you et al 2021 who reported that wood chip biochar applied in combination with fertilizer increased chlorophyll content of ice plant leaves the improvement in chlorophyll content could be ascribed to that biochar based fertilizer improved water and nutrient availability to roots thus increased pigment synthesis and n uptake in plant leaves speratti et al 2018 as chlorophyll content is closely related to leaf n content in plant agegnehu et al 2015 found that biochar based fertilizer increased leaf chlorophyll content which might be resulted from that biochar improved soil fertility and the mineral fertilizers enhanced n supply under drought conditions thereby increasing soil available n and leaf n content drought decreased leaf chlorophyll content of different crops teixeira et al 2014 li et al 2019 in this study chlorophyll content declined under severe water stress relative to the ww treatment our findings are in accordance with alfi and azizi 2015 najafinezhad et al 2015 and cao et al 2017 who highlighted that reduced chlorophyll contents in drought conditions resulted from deficiencies in water and nitrogen or production of reactive oxygen species that might degrade chlorophyll pigments in addition the chlorophyll pigment is sensitive to increasing environmental stress especially to drought moran et al 1994 thomas and howarth 2000 biochar based fertilizer might improve soil water and nitrogen retention and prevent oxidative stress effects thus ameliorating the adverse impact of drought stress on leaf chlorophyll content of peanut photosynthesis is largely affected by nitrogen availability in plant as 57 of leaf nitrogen is contained in the chloroplasts and utilized to synthesize photosynthetic components and allied enzymes xu et al 2012 in the present study biochar based fertilizer application increased pn at the pod setting and pod filling stages in 2016 and all measured stages in 2017 relative to the control fig 3 xu et al 2015 and zainul et al 2017 also reported that biochar amendment added to soil improved leaf pn of peanut by enhancing leaf n and soil available n content the enhanced pn with biochar based fertilizer could be due to that higher availability of nitrogen contents can increase cell wall rigidity and photosynthetic capacity in plants chen et al 2016 moreover biochar increased water holding capacity and decreased bulk density of soil resulting in greater stomatal conductance and more co2 diffusion which lead to improved pn agegnehu et al 2017 in this study biochar based fertilizer application enhanced pn in moderate or severe water stress conditions which was supported by akhtar et al 2014 baronti et al 2014 and zoghi et al 2019 who suggested that combined application of biochar and fertilizer decreased the negative effects of dehydration on the photosynthetic system by increasing the soil water retention capacity the photosynthetic process in plant is prone to inhibition by moisture stress as moisture stress could facilitate leaf senescence as a plant s adaptive mechanism to ensure moisture loss is reduced and reduced number of leaf would affect a plant s photosynthesis cao et al 2017 reduction of pn with water stress has been reported for various crops which was mainly attributed to stomatal and non stomatal limitations álvarez and sánchez blanco 2013 in our study severe water stress reduced pn relative to the ww treatment zoghi et al 2019 found that pn significantly declined with increasing severity of water stress and suggested that plants in drought conditions closed stomata to reduce water loss and maintain water homeostasis thus decreasing the photosynthetic rate basu et al 2016 mannan et al 2016 4 2 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on yield and water use in peanut biochar based fertilizer has been frequently reported to increase crop yield saha et al 2019 yang et al 2021 in this study biochar based fertilizer applications of 0 75 and 1 5 t ha 1 to silty sandy loam soil increased peanut yields by 34 6 and 31 1 two year mean respectively relative to the control this is in line with yamato et al 2006 who reported that combined application of 10 t ha 1 biochar with 75 kg ha 1 of each npk significantly increased peanut yield up to 50 moreover in the ms or ss treatments biochar based fertilizer applications increased peanut yield compared to the control the yield improvement observed could be because biochar based fertilizer resulted in the continuous and prolonged supply of nutrients to plants under moisture stress conditions which compensated for nutrient losses from the soil and ensured better nutrient uptake thereby enhancing crop growth and yield haider et al 2017 biochar adsorbs nutrients from fertilizer and later releases them to provide nutrients for plant growth this could explain the persistent nutrients supply by biochar based fertilizer yang et al 2021 yamato et al 2006 and xu et al 2015 indicated that biochar increased peanut yields by stimulating the nodulation and biological n fixation process besides our study revealed significant positive correlations between peanut yield and total n uptake fig 5a and total k uptake fig 5b in both years suggesting that biochar based fertilizer might increase peanut yield through improving plant n and k uptake as nutrients uptake by plant play an important role in determining yield formation the improved morpho physiological traits and yield components pod number seed weight and kernel rate with biochar based fertilizer also contributed to the enhanced yields table 3 additionally in 2016 in the ww treatment bf0 75 had higher seed weight than bf1 5 which could be related to the higher total n uptake in bf0 75 table 4 as seed weight has a significant positive correlation with the total n uptake in peanut junjittakarn et al 2013 in this study severe water stress reduced peanut yield while moderate water stress had no change on it in both years as compared to the well watered treatment table 3 which is in agreement with cao et al 2017 the reduced total n and k uptake in the ss treatment than the ww treatment may be responsible for the decreased peanut yield with severe water stress table 4 in the ms and ss treatments bf0 75 and bf1 5 had higher peanut yields than bf0 in both years except the ss treatment in 2016 table 3 indicating that biochar based fertilizer application effectively alleviated the adverse impacts of water stress on peanut production in 2016 in the ww treatment bf0 75 had higher peanut yield than bf1 5 table 3 indicating that the effect of biochar based fertilizer application on peanut yield was not dose dependent excessive application of biochar based fertilizer might not continually improve plant growth as the high c n ratios might immobilize n and decrease plant n uptake table 4 xu et al 2021 reduced plant n uptake could decrease peanut yield fig 5a li et al 2018 reported that application of 60 t ha 1 biochar produced lower tomato yields than 40 t ha 1 biochar and suggested that excessive addition of biochar might decrease soil wettability resulting in uneven distribution of soil water in the root zone and impacting root water and nutrient uptake and crop growth in both years the imsbf0 75 and imsbf1 5 treatments produced relatively higher peanut yields than other treatments taking the benefit cost of biochar based fertilizer application into consideration we recommended biochar based fertilizer application rate of 0 75 t ha 1 in combination with moderate water stress as the best choice for peanut production in arid and semi arid areas in our study water use of bf0 75 and bf1 5 treatments did not significantly differ from bf0 under any water treatment in either year except under moderate water stress in 2017 table 3 it is reported that biochar increases soil water availability and water retention capacity due to its large specific surface area and porous structure ali et al 2017 zoghi et al 2019 on the contrary tanure et al 2019 reported that biochar based fertilizer treatments increased water use and suggested that it might be due to the greater biomass under biochar based fertilizer requiring more water for growth than the control treatment in our study the insignificant effect of biochar based fertilizer on water use might be due to the lack of water percolation as the pots had sealed bottoms therefore the water saving potential of biochar based fertilizer for peanut production needs to be furtherly validated under field conditions however under moderate or severe water stress biochar based fertilizer applications 0 75 and 1 5 t ha 1 increased wue as compared to the no fertilizer control table 3 because they produced relatively higher yields and comparable water use than the no fertilizer control in 2016 the imsbf0 75 treatment had the highest wue 2 63 g kg 1 among all treatments in 2017 though the issbf1 5 treatment had the highest wue 1 79 g kg 1 its peanut yield was relatively lower than the conventional practice iwwbf0 therefore considering improved peanut yield and water use efficiency the imsbf0 75 treatment is optimal for peanut production in water deficient areas 4 3 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on total n and k uptake in peanut in the present study bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased peanut n uptake compared to the control which is in agreement with previous study muhammed et al 2020 the increased total n uptake with biochar based fertilizer could be supported by the enhanced n retention total n nh4 n and no3 n in soil as more available n in soil could continuously supply nutrient for plant when required and therefore increase plant n uptake ibrahim et al 2020 suggested that biochar based fertilizer applied in soil could effectively act as slow release of n fertilizer after one time application which provide adequate n for plant growth in addition the increased n uptake is associated with improved soil cec by biochar as soil with a high cec are more likely to adsorb nh4 which can effectively improve the utilization of n in the soil liang et al 2006 it is also related to the supply of n from biochar itself and mineral fertilizer glaser et al 2002 indicated that ash in biochar contributes nutrients such as ca mg and k into soil solution increasing soil ph and enhancing nutrient availability and supply for plants this was confirmed by van zwieten et al 2010 who reported that biochar increased nutrient availability by impacting soil ph which plays an important role in regulating nutrient availability in this study in the ms treatment bf0 75 and bf1 5 had significantly higher total n uptake than bf0 in both years indicating that biochar based fertilizer alleviated the negative effect of moderate water stress on peanut n uptake zoghi et al 2019 reported that biochar improved soil nutrient availability and n uptake in water stressed treatments and attributed the results to that biochar increased soil water holding capacity and enhanced water availability to plants under moisture stress conditions so as to improve plant n uptake since drought is a limiting factor for plant n uptake however bf0 75 and bf1 5 in the ss treatment had relatively lower total n uptake than bf0 in the ww treatment in both years table 4 suggesting that the negative impact of severe water stress would suppress n uptake despite the application of biochar based fertilizer in 2016 in the ww treatment bf1 5 had lower total nitrogen uptake than bf0 75 which might be due to the higher biochar based fertilizer rates resulting in a higher c n ratio in soil enhancing n immobilization and decreasing plant n uptake tammeorg et al 2014 xu et al 2021 furthermore the effect of biochar based fertilizer on nodule traits and biological n fixation needs to be investigated using the 15n labeled technique to elucidate the contribution of biochar based fertilizer to peanut n uptake in the present study bf0 75 and bf1 5 increased peanut k uptake compared to the control this is in line with the findings of walter and rao 2015 who attributed the increased n uptake with biochar based fertilizer to presence of k in biochar itself and mineral fertilizer and enhanced k fertilizer use efficiency by biochar the increased k availability is vital for improving growth biological n fixation and the competitive ability of legume species as k is essential for biological n fixation mia et al 2014 oram et al 2014 in the ms and ss treatments the higher total k uptake in bf0 75 or bf1 5 than bf0 indicated that biochar based fertilizer alleviated the adverse impacts of water stress on peanut k uptake 4 4 effect of biochar based fertilizer and water stress on soil n and k availability it has been previously reported that biochar based fertilizer could improve soil fertility by increasing the amounts of soil available n p k etc oladele et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 in our study irrespective of water treatments application of biochar based fertilizers significantly increased soil nh4 n and no3 n contents compared to the no fertilizer control which is consistent with previous study gao et al 2016 the increased soil nh4 n with biochar based fertilizer might be ascribed to that biochar particles adsorbed nh4 thereby reducing soil nh4 n loss and increasing its content in soil agegnehu et al 2016 in addition biochar applied in soil increased ammonia oxidation rate through impacting soil microorganisms which play a leading role in the nitrogen transformation process nguyen et al 2017 and thus enhanced nitrification and soil no3 n availability song et al 2014 however there are also reports indicating that biochar decreased soil inorganic n content which were mostly ascribed to that biochar immobilized soil mineral n due to the input of labile c and enhanced soil c n ratio agegnehu et al 2015 the inconsistent results have been attributed to feedstock type production condition and rate of biochar as well as the soil type hossain et al 2020 as for water treatments soil nh4 n content was increased while no3 n content was decreased with increasing water stress table 4 this was supported by morillas et al 2015 who reported that frequent drying rewetting cycles resulted in increases in soil nh4 n and reductions in soil no3 n levels this suggested that nitrifiers did not oxidize large amounts of nh4 n since nitrification rates decreased with decreasing water potential hartmann et al 2013 unlike soil inorganic n it is generally accepted that biochar could significantly increase soil k availability oram et al 2014 in our study biochar based fertilizer applications significantly increased soil available k content irrespective of water treatments which is consistent with previous studies yao et al 2012 liu et al 2013 oladele et al 2019 the increased soil available k with biochar based fertilizer might be due to that electrostatic attraction forces on the surface of biochar soil matrix enhanced k retention in soil yao et al 2012 furthermore the k contained in biochar based fertilizer itself could also help to improve soil k availability regardless of biochar based fertilizer application the ms and ss treatments had lower soil available k content than the ww treatment table 4 which was in line with jahan et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 this could be explained by that well watered conditions improved the release of k into the soil by facilitating the reduction of mn4 to mn2 and fe3 to fe2 which displaced k from cec sites patrick et al 1985 5 conclusions regardless of biochar based fertilizer morpho physiological traits main stem height leaf area chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate total n and k uptake and yield in peanut decreased with severe water stress but were maintained with moderate water stress relative to the well watered treatment this indicates the plants can adapt to moderate stressful conditions without a significant decline in performance however the performance of the plants was impaired by severe moisture stressful conditions the application of biochar based fertilizer at 0 75 or 1 5 t ha 1 increased the total n and k uptake and yield in peanut under different water treatments the enhanced peanut yield with biochar based fertilizer could be due to improved main stem height leaf area chlorophyll content photosynthetic rate and soil nutrients n and k availability moreover addition of biochar based fertilizer ameliorated the adverse effect of water stress on growth nutrient uptake and yield in peanut in conclusion the biochar based fertilizer application rate of 0 75 t ha 1 combined with moderate water stress 60 65 fc could increase peanut yield and be recommended for peanut production in arid or semi arid areas funding the current research was supported by the natural science foundation of liaoning province 20180550819 and the scientific research fund of liaoning provincial education

9892,the nutritional quality of crops is sensitive to the planting method and fertilization rate especially in fields threatened by drought and nutrient deficiencies ensuring that the nutrient content of crops is adequate is important in addition to obtaining a high yield in the current agricultural production in china thus a field experiment with two typical mulch planting methods full plastic film mulching rff half plastic film mulching rfh and five fertilization rates n 0 p2o5 0 kg ha 1 n 117 p2o5 59 kg ha 1 n 173 p2o5 87 kg ha 1 n 229 p2o5 115 kg ha 1 n 285 p2o5 143 kg ha 1 was conducted from 2014 to 2016 in a semiarid region china the potential effects of film mulching on maize nutritional quality and the differences under different fertilizer rates were studied the results showed that rff improved soil water and temperature conditions and significantly increased the maize grain yield by 17 2 38 0 and nutrients uptake by 14 0 22 3 in nitrogen 24 8 35 2 in phosphorus compared with rfh however the nutrient contents of plant organs decreased to different extents under rff compared with rfh indicating a dilution effect in particular the grain nutrient content decreased by up to 3 6 for nitrogen and 6 5 for phosphorus with fertilization up to n 160 p2o5 80 kg ha 1 but with an increasing tendency above this rate in addition fertilization significantly increased the maize grain yield and nutrient content but both did not increase significantly above n230 p2o5115 kg ha 1 and the nue gradually decreased especially nitrogen under rff thus rff significantly improved the maize yield and nutrients uptake compared with rfh but there was a risk of nutritional quality degradation and surprisingly this effect can be adjusted or even avoided by changing the amount of fertilizer applied for example in the study region both the maize yield and quality of rff were improved compared with rfh in the fertilization range of n 160 230 p2o5 80 115 kg ha 1 keywords nutritional quality fertilization maize nutrient dilution effect plastic film mulching 1 introduction plants are the ultimate sources of nutrition for humans and livestock ricachenevsky et al 2019 in crop production the focus has gradually shifted from the crop yield to crop its nutritional quality especially protein which is closely related to the nitrogen content and a more important nutritional component of cereals than carbohydrates and fats luo et al 2019 the protein content of crops but especially grains significantly determines the quality of food and feed by influencing various characteristics such as the rheological properties of dough and processing quality shewry 2007 drought and nutrient deficiencies especially nitrogen and phosphorus are major limiting factors in the loess plateau region of northwest china where they severely affect the production of various staple crops gan et al 2013 li et al 2009b the plastic film mulching technique was first introduced into china in the 1970s and research has been conducted into this method for more than 40 years and is now considered an effective agricultural response to drought in the loess plateau region gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 by greatly improving soil water and temperature conditions the technique can significantly increase the production of important food crops in the region such as maize mo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a 2019b wheat dong et al 2019 li et al 2017a 2017b and potatoes wang et al 2008 zhao et al 2014 indeed plastic mulch planting is essential for maize production in the loess plateau in order to avoid low yields and enhance food security liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 among the maize planting systems that use plastic film mulching technique ridge furrow with full film mulching and that with half film mulching are the most typical in the region as they both combine ridge furrow planting and plastic film mulching forming a production mode of multi technology integration zhang et al 2019b therefore research has focused on the selection of efficient mulch planting methods and the development of other agricultural techniques based on mulch planting to achieve efficient and sustainable maize production regulating nutrients is easier compared with the difficult task of improving the water availability and the application of chemical fertilizers is a general method for rapidly regulating the soil nutrient status to significantly improve the crop yield and nutrient contents liu et al 2014 wang and xing 2016 furthermore studies have shown that the furrow and ridge technique with plastic film mulching can promote the growth reproduction and activity of microorganisms improve the activity of soil enzymes accelerate the soil mineralization process significantly affect a number of material transformation and nutrient cycling processes and ultimately affect the soil nutrient status especially nitrogen to improve the soil nutrient availability and crop yield huang et al 2019 liu et al 2015 therefore in the semiarid loess plateau region combining mulching techniques with fertilization measures may potentially lead to further improvements in the crop yields and the efficient utilization of water and fertilizer the nutritional quality of crops is determined by the crop s genetic background environmental factors and their interactions as well as by the nitrogen and phosphorus contents and other nutrients luo et al 2018 however the nutrient concentrations in different crop organs are affected by the nutrient accumulation capacity and dry matter storage capacity of organs in an unpredictable manner li et al 2009a clearly this uncertainty is a concern and the subject of many studies previous studies have shown under greatly improved hydrothermal conditions crops planted with plastic film mulching generally exhibit aboveground growth and dry matter accumulation compared with those lacking mulching li et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2019b there are even differences in the ability of different planting methods to regulate soil water and temperature conditions which will inevitably lead to differences in plant growth and nutrient uptake and these trends may also vary with changes in fertilizer use thus if different planting methods have different environmental regulation ability and different nutrient supply level the plant nutrient content will be different due to the asynchronous change of dry matter accumulation and nutrient absorption showing dilution or concentration phenomenon which will affect its nutritional quality maize is one of the world s most important crops and it plays important roles in ensuring food security and social sustainability as a feed food and raw industrial material cimmyt 2011 however research into the nutritional qualities of maize especially nitrogen is limited compared with other cereal crops such as wheat and rice a potential decreasing trend in the protein content of dryland crops under plastic film mulching has been confirmed luo et al 2018 but further research is required to understand the absorption of nutrients under different mulching and fertilizer application treatments especially for maize in the semiarid region of the loess plateau where film mulching is applied widely to spring maize a better understanding of these problems may help to improve the mulch planting technique and the nutritional quality of maize thus the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the effects of different plastic film mulching methods and fertilization rates on soil water and temperature conditions and maize yield 2 to determine the plant nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus contents uptake and nutrient use efficiency nue in response to different plastic film mulching methods and fertilization rates and 3 to clarify the regulatory effect of fertilizer on the maize yield and nutrient contents under typical plastic film mulching methods in order to facilitate the development of a nutrient management scheme for maize production with high yield and quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site during 2014 2016 a three year field experiment was conducted at the dry farming experimental station of northwest a f university pengyang county ningxia hui autonomous region china this is a typical hilly region of the loess plateau with an average annual precipitation of 430 mm and temperature of 8 1 c during the maize growing seasons in 2014 2015 and 2016 the precipitation amounts were 381 4 mm 356 9 mm and 382 0 mm respectively and

transferred to a 100 ml volumetric bottle and the volume was fixed with distilled water after cooling to obtain solution for determining nitrogen and phosphorus contents next 25 ml of the prepared solution was used to determine the total nitrogen content of each plant sample with a kjeltec 8400 automatic instrument foss analytical ab hoganas sweden based on the distillation titration method in addition 5 ml of the prepared solution was used to determine the phosphorus content of each plant sample with the ammonium molybdate colorimetric method 2 3 4 nutrient uptake and utilization the nutrient uptake kg ha 1 by each organ was equal to the accumulated dry matter multiplied by its nutrient content the total nutrient absorption by a plant kg ha 1 was equal to the sum of the nutrient uptake for each organ the nutrient harvest index was determined as the ratio of the nutrient uptake by the grain relative to the total nutrient uptake by the plant in the physiological maturity stage for maize nutrient use efficiency nue was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield relative to the total nutrient uptake by the plant in the physiological maturity stage for maize 2 4 statistical analysis microsoft excel and spss 23 were used for data collation and analysis of variance where the least significant difference method was used for multiple comparisons at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil water and temperature both planting methods and fertilization significantly affected soil temperature and water conditions fig 3 compared with rfh rff improved soil water storage at seeding seedling emergence grain filling and harvest stages but failed at jointing and tasseling stages in addition rff showed higher soil temperature than rfh by 1 8 c at seedling stage 1 5 c at jointing stage 0 9 c at flowering stage and 1 0 c at grain filling stage fertilization significantly decreased soil water storage and soil temperature to some extent after jointing stage 3 2 yield during the three years rff increased the grain yield by 38 0 at ck 29 8 at l 31 6 at m 18 9 at h and 17 2 at sh on average the maize grain yields under rff and rfh tended to increase as the fertilization rate increased with increases of 12 0 20 9 188 5 352 8 and 321 0 538 9 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively and there were no significant differences between h and sh the fitted results indicates that rff achieved the maximum grain yield of 10554 5 kg ha 1 at n 282 5 p2o5 141 3 kg ha 1 whereas rfh achieved the maximum grain yield of 9550 2 kg ha 1 at n 392 6 p2o5 196 3 kg ha 1 fig 4 similar trends were found in the biomass yield and yield harvest index 3 3 nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus contents the nitrogen content of each maize organ was significantly affected by the mulching planting method and it also varied with the fertilization rate fig 5 the grain had the highest nitrogen content compared with the other organs and the nitrogen content under rff gradually changed from a decreasing tend to an increasing tend as the fertilization amount increased compared with rfh where the critical point was n 161 9 p2o5 81 0 kg ha 1 in the leaf stem and other organs rff consistently reduced the nitrogen content compared with rfh under ck without fertilization compared with rfh rff reduced the nitrogen content by 0 97 g kg 1 16 4 in the leaf 0 58 g kg 1 29 3 in the stem and 0 37 g kg 1 13 6 in the other organs where for each increase of n 50 p2o5 25 kg ha 1 the decreases given above were reduced by 0 12 g kg 1 0 11 g kg 1 and 0 15 g kg 1 respectively the grain had the highest phosphorus content compared with the other organs and the phosphorus content under rff gradually changed from decreasing to increasing as the fertilization amount increased compared with rfh where the critical point was n 58 4 p2o5 29 2 kg ha 1 fig 6 in the leaf stem and other organs the phosphorus content under rff decreased by 0 09 g kg 1 14 1 0 01 g kg 1 4 0 and 0 02 g kg 1 4 1 respectively compared with rfh over n 0 285 p2o5 0 143 kg ha 1 in addition the phosphorus content exhibited an upward parabolic response in each maize organ as the fertilizer amount increased 3 4 nutrient uptake and distribution rff significantly increased the uptake of nutrients by maize compared with rfh i e by 17 5 for nitrogen and by 27 8 for phosphorus table 2 as the fertilization rate increased the uptake of nutrients by maize plants gradually increased where the nitrogen uptake increased by 0 8 2 0 times and the phosphorus uptake increased by 0 5 1 3 times but no significant increase was observed from h to sh the distributions of the nutrients accumulated in various organs were ordered as follows grain nitrogen 62 phosphorus 72 leaf nitrogen 17 phosphorus 12 other organs nitrogen 12 phosphorus 10 stalk nitrogen 10 phosphorus 6 fig 7 compared with rfh rff significantly increased the nitrogen distribution ratio in the grain i e by 11 under ck 7 at l 11 at m 9 at h and 5 at sh thus compared with rfh rff reduced the nitrogen distribution ratio in the leaves by 3 5 stalk by 1 4 and other organs by 1 4 in addition the results showed that increasing the amount of fertilizer applied from l to sh reduced the nutrient distribution ratio in the grain thereby increasing the ratios in the leaves stems and other organs under rff the proportion decreased from 71 with l to 61 with sh and under rfh the proportion decreased from 65 with l to 56 with sh the trend in the phosphorus distribution ratio was affected by the planting method and fertilization amount in a similar manner to that of nitrogen 3 5 relationship between yield and nutrient contents as the grain yield increased the nitrogen content of the maize grain increased whereas the phosphorus content decreased initially and then increased fig 8 compared with rfh the nitrogen content increased more slowly as the grain yield increased under rff and that the phosphorus content decreased more slowly at low yield level and then increased more slowly as yield increased 3 6 nue as the amount of fertilizer increased the nitrogen use efficiency decreased whereas the phosphorus use efficiency increased initially and then decreased fig 9 compared with rfh rff increased the nitrogen use efficiency by 21 2 at ck 14 4 at l 11 6 at m 8 8 at h and 5 9 at sh however the phosphorus use efficiency was greater under rff than rfh when the fertilizer application rate was lower than n 110 8 p2o5 55 4 kg ha 1 and lower than that under rfh when the amount of fertilizer exceeded n 110 8 p2o5 55 4 kg ha 1 the nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies trended to increase initially before decreasing as the amount of fertilization increased where that under rff continued to increase compared with rfh with average increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies of 20 0 and 28 4 respectively in addition the contribution of fertilization to the grain yield was significantly lower under rff than rfh 4 discussion 4 1 yield in semiarid areas plastic film mulching can effectively improve the soil temperature and water conditions seed germination and canopy extension to intercept more solar radiation energy while maintaining a higher photosynthesis rate thereby significantly increasing the accumulated dry matter and grain yield in crops gan et al 2013 in our three year study rff significantly increased the maize yield compared with rfh mainly because rff provided a more favorable soil hydrothermal environment for maize growth zhang et al 2019b fertilization had a greater impact than the planting method on the maize yield in the present study where the impacts increased gradually each year table 1 during the three year study the maize grain yield decreased each year under ck whereas it remained relatively stable with the second highest yields under l and m and sustained high yields were obtained under h and sh thereby demonstrating that fertilization is necessary to achieve sustainable maize production especially high yields hou et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 however as the amount of fertilizer increased the increase in the maize grain yield capacity was greater under rff compared with rfh where the trend increased initially and then decreased with the maximum under m n 173 p2o5 87 kg ha 1 these results suggest that an optimum amount of fertilizer should be applied under rff planting mainly due to differences in the coupling effect between water and fertilizer under the two planting methods li et al 2009b zhang et al 2020 thus rff obtained a rapid increase in the yield as the amount of fertilizer increased whereas rfh resulted in a slower increase in the yield 4 2 nutrient contents and uptake in the current study rff significantly increased the uptake of nutrients compared with rfh but the nutritional quality especially nitrogen contents did not show a similar trend of improvement with greater amounts in the vegetative organs and less in the grains table 2 the degradation in crop nutritional quality is usually associated with the inability of the crop to absorb nutrients in sync with dry matter accumulation especially grain accumulation resulting in a relative dilution effect as reported in previous studies arduini et al 2006 luo et al 2018 triboi et al 2006 zheng et al 2009 the physiological interpretation findings obtained by luo et al 2018 showed that plastic film mulching reduced the nitrogen content of crops for example by about 7 8 in winter wheat compared with that without mulching mainly because the mulching reduced the re transport efficiency of nitrogen after anthesis and nitrogen absorption after anthesis thereby which resulting in a non synchronous increase in the grain yield and nutrient absorption and a dilution effect luo et al 2018 triboi et al 2006 in addition another potential cause may be the use of chemical fertilizers that release nutrients quickly and are applied to the field before sowing which may result in excessive nutrients consumption in the early stage of crop growth and thus the lower availability of fertilizer in the later stage li et al 2014 our study of maize supports these findings but we also observed an interesting phenomenon where the dilution effect in nitrogen and phosphorus caused by film mulching was more obvious at low fertilizer rates but not apparent at high fertilizer rates these results indicate that rff enhanced the transport of nutrients from the vegetative organs to the grains after flowering compared with rfh as shown by the significantly higher nutrient harvest index under rff compared with rfh however findings in the present study also demonstrated the poor capacity of mulching to improve the crop quality without adding sufficient exogenous nutrients n 161 9 p2o5 81 0 kg ha 1 thus it is necessity to optimize the nutrient supply in order to regulate the nutrient dilution effect and ameliorate the degradation of the nutrient quality in crops caused by mulching luo et al 2018 rational fertilizer application is one of the most widely adopted measures for increasing the crop yield and improving the nutritional quality of crops in crops chen et al 2015 shewry 2007 under an adequate nutrient supply crops can exhibit higher chlorophyll contents and photosynthesis and vigorous growth of the aboveground canopy and the underground root system may occur li et al 2009b ju et al 2009 the results obtained in the present study demonstrate that fertilization significantly increased the nutrient contents and total uptake by maize plants but the nutrient uptake did not increase significantly when the amount of fertilizer exceeded a certain range n 229 p2o5 115 kg ha 1 in addition we found that as the amount of fertilizer increased the nitrogen contents of each plant organ gradually increased but the phosphorus content trended to decrease initially before then increasing which may have been related to the severe phosphorus deficiency in the farmland in this area li et al 2019b in addition after applying p fertilizer the increase of phosphorus uptake by maize crop seems to fail to catch up with the rate of dry matter accumulation so the phosphorus content in the grains of plants in the later period does not increase significantly 4 3 nue and optimization management in the present study rff significantly increased the nue for nitrogen and phosphorus in maize compared with rfh similar results were also reported by liu and siddique 2015 who found that the uptake of nitrogen by crops was strongly related to the plant growth rate soil water content and nutrient availability in semiarid regions at high altitudes water shortages and low temperatures usually limit crop growth and the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients is inhibited by the low soil nutrient availability and photosynthesis rate li et al 2009b wang and xing 2016 we found that the nitrogen uptake and use efficiencies were higher under rff than rfh mainly because the soil water and temperature conditions under rff were superior to those under rfh which accelerated root growth maintained efficient photosynthesis and significantly enhanced the absorption and conversion of nitrogen and phosphorus in maize hou et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b zhao et al 2014 in addition previous studies have shown that soil temperature has an important effect on the nutrient harvest index because sufficient heat can accelerate crop maturation and stimulate the physiological processing of dry matter and nutrients in plant vegetative organs stems leaves sheaves etc to transport nutrients to grain li et al 2017a 2017b liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a which is also an important reason for the significant improvements in the nutrient harvest index and nue in rff compared with rfh in the present study physiologically rff significantly improved nue compared with rfh possibly due to differences in the responses of the grain yield and crop nutrient uptake to different planting methods where the grain yield exhibited a sensitive response to the planting method luo et al 2018 thus the grain yield was significantly higher under rff than rfh but the nutrient uptake was less sensitive to the planting method so the increase in the uptake of nutrients under rff did not have as great an effect on the grain yield compared with rfh which was also the main reason for the reduced nutrient content under rff compared with rfh fertilization can provide exogenous nutrients to increase the crop yield but another goal is the efficient use of resources the ideal nutrient management rate should significantly promote increases in the crop yield and maintain nue at a high level chen et al 2014 ju et al 2009 in the present study nue tended to decrease gradually as the amount of fertilizer increased thereby indicating that the grain yield was less responsive to increased fertilization than nutrient absorption although the phosphorus use efficiency tended to increase initially before then decreasing the uptake of nutrients by crops was affected by the grain yield and the nutrient contents of plant organs li et al 2009a in addition to increasing the grain yield and biomass yield fertilization increased the nutrient contents of the plant organs especially nitrogen to a certain extent and thus the uptake of nutrients had a more rapid impact on the grain yield after fertilization hou et al 2012 wang et al 2016 however when the amount of fertilizer was increased from m to h the nutrient utilization efficiency decreased rapidly therefore the amount of fertilizer should be controlled below h n 229 p2o5 115 kg ha 1 in order to maintain the nutrient utilization efficiency at a relatively high level 5 conclusion in a semiarid area of northwest china ridge furrow planting with full plastic film mulching obtained higher productivity compared with that with half plastic film mulching and it significantly increased the maize grain yield and nue however there was a potential risk of the plant nutritional quality degradation under the full mulching compared with the half mulching due to an obvious nutrient dilution effect which even affected the grain fertilization significantly improved the grain yield grain nutrient content and nue for maize in a certain range of n 0 230 p2o5 0 115 kg ha 1 but it also gradually weaked the nutrient dilution effect under the full mulching compared with the half mulching as the amount of fertilizer applied increased to n 160 p2o5 80 kg ha 1 where the nutrient dilution effect disappeared thus the full mulching only had an optimal effect on the grain yield quality and nue in the range of n 160 230 p2o5 80 115 kg ha 1 compared with the half mulching

9892,the nutritional quality of crops is sensitive to the planting method and fertilization rate especially in fields threatened by drought and nutrient deficiencies ensuring that the nutrient content of crops is adequate is important in addition to obtaining a high yield in the current agricultural production in china thus a field experiment with two typical mulch planting methods full plastic film mulching rff half plastic film mulching rfh and five fertilization rates n 0 p2o5 0 kg ha 1 n 117 p2o5 59 kg ha 1 n 173 p2o5 87 kg ha 1 n 229 p2o5 115 kg ha 1 n 285 p2o5 143 kg ha 1 was conducted from 2014 to 2016 in a semiarid region china the potential effects of film mulching on maize nutritional quality and the differences under different fertilizer rates were studied the results showed that rff improved soil water and temperature conditions and significantly increased the maize grain yield by 17 2 38 0 and nutrients uptake by 14 0 22 3 in nitrogen 24 8 35 2 in phosphorus compared with rfh however the nutrient contents of plant organs decreased to different extents under rff compared with rfh indicating a dilution effect in particular the grain nutrient content decreased by up to 3 6 for nitrogen and 6 5 for phosphorus with fertilization up to n 160 p2o5 80 kg ha 1 but with an increasing tendency above this rate in addition fertilization significantly increased the maize grain yield and nutrient content but both did not increase significantly above n230 p2o5115 kg ha 1 and the nue gradually decreased especially nitrogen under rff thus rff significantly improved the maize yield and nutrients uptake compared with rfh but there was a risk of nutritional quality degradation and surprisingly this effect can be adjusted or even avoided by changing the amount of fertilizer applied for example in the study region both the maize yield and quality of rff were improved compared with rfh in the fertilization range of n 160 230 p2o5 80 115 kg ha 1 keywords nutritional quality fertilization maize nutrient dilution effect plastic film mulching 1 introduction plants are the ultimate sources of nutrition for humans and livestock ricachenevsky et al 2019 in crop production the focus has gradually shifted from the crop yield to crop its nutritional quality especially protein which is closely related to the nitrogen content and a more important nutritional component of cereals than carbohydrates and fats luo et al 2019 the protein content of crops but especially grains significantly determines the quality of food and feed by influencing various characteristics such as the rheological properties of dough and processing quality shewry 2007 drought and nutrient deficiencies especially nitrogen and phosphorus are major limiting factors in the loess plateau region of northwest china where they severely affect the production of various staple crops gan et al 2013 li et al 2009b the plastic film mulching technique was first introduced into china in the 1970s and research has been conducted into this method for more than 40 years and is now considered an effective agricultural response to drought in the loess plateau region gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 by greatly improving soil water and temperature conditions the technique can significantly increase the production of important food crops in the region such as maize mo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a 2019b wheat dong et al 2019 li et al 2017a 2017b and potatoes wang et al 2008 zhao et al 2014 indeed plastic mulch planting is essential for maize production in the loess plateau in order to avoid low yields and enhance food security liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 among the maize planting systems that use plastic film mulching technique ridge furrow with full film mulching and that with half film mulching are the most typical in the region as they both combine ridge furrow planting and plastic film mulching forming a production mode of multi technology integration zhang et al 2019b therefore research has focused on the selection of efficient mulch planting methods and the development of other agricultural techniques based on mulch planting to achieve efficient and sustainable maize production regulating nutrients is easier compared with the difficult task of improving the water availability and the application of chemical fertilizers is a general method for rapidly regulating the soil nutrient status to significantly improve the crop yield and nutrient contents liu et al 2014 wang and xing 2016 furthermore studies have shown that the furrow and ridge technique with plastic film mulching can promote the growth reproduction and activity of microorganisms improve the activity of soil enzymes accelerate the soil mineralization process significantly affect a number of material transformation and nutrient cycling processes and ultimately affect the soil nutrient status especially nitrogen to improve the soil nutrient availability and crop yield huang et al 2019 liu et al 2015 therefore in the semiarid loess plateau region combining mulching techniques with fertilization measures may potentially lead to further improvements in the crop yields and the efficient utilization of water and fertilizer the nutritional quality of crops is determined by the crop s genetic background environmental factors and their interactions as well as by the nitrogen and phosphorus contents and other nutrients luo et al 2018 however the nutrient concentrations in different crop organs are affected by the nutrient accumulation capacity and dry matter storage capacity of organs in an unpredictable manner li et al 2009a clearly this uncertainty is a concern and the subject of many studies previous studies have shown under greatly improved hydrothermal conditions crops planted with plastic film mulching generally exhibit aboveground growth and dry matter accumulation compared with those lacking mulching li et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2019b there are even differences in the ability of different planting methods to regulate soil water and temperature conditions which will inevitably lead to differences in plant growth and nutrient uptake and these trends may also vary with changes in fertilizer use thus if different planting methods have different environmental regulation ability and different nutrient supply level the plant nutrient content will be different due to the asynchronous change of dry matter accumulation and nutrient absorption showing dilution or concentration phenomenon which will affect its nutritional quality maize is one of the world s most important crops and it plays important roles in ensuring food security and social sustainability as a feed food and raw industrial material cimmyt 2011 however research into the nutritional qualities of maize especially nitrogen is limited compared with other cereal crops such as wheat and rice a potential decreasing trend in the protein content of dryland crops under plastic film mulching has been confirmed luo et al 2018 but further research is required to understand the absorption of nutrients under different mulching and fertilizer application treatments especially for maize in the semiarid region of the loess plateau where film mulching is applied widely to spring maize a better understanding of these problems may help to improve the mulch planting technique and the nutritional quality of maize thus the objectives of the present study were 1 to investigate the effects of different plastic film mulching methods and fertilization rates on soil water and temperature conditions and maize yield 2 to determine the plant nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus contents uptake and nutrient use efficiency nue in response to different plastic film mulching methods and fertilization rates and 3 to clarify the regulatory effect of fertilizer on the maize yield and nutrient contents under typical plastic film mulching methods in order to facilitate the development of a nutrient management scheme for maize production with high yield and quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site during 2014 2016 a three year field experiment

increases of 12 0 20 9 188 5 352 8 and 321 0 538 9 in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively and there were no significant differences between h and sh the fitted results indicates that rff achieved the maximum grain yield of 10554 5 kg ha 1 at n 282 5 p2o5 141 3 kg ha 1 whereas rfh achieved the maximum grain yield of 9550 2 kg ha 1 at n 392 6 p2o5 196 3 kg ha 1 fig 4 similar trends were found in the biomass yield and yield harvest index 3 3 nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus contents the nitrogen content of each maize organ was significantly affected by the mulching planting method and it also varied with the fertilization rate fig 5 the grain had the highest nitrogen content compared with the other organs and the nitrogen content under rff gradually changed from a decreasing tend to an increasing tend as the fertilization amount increased compared with rfh where the critical point was n 161 9 p2o5 81 0 kg ha 1 in the leaf stem and other organs rff consistently reduced the nitrogen content compared with rfh under ck without fertilization compared with rfh rff reduced the nitrogen content by 0 97 g kg 1 16 4 in the leaf 0 58 g kg 1 29 3 in the stem and 0 37 g kg 1 13 6 in the other organs where for each increase of n 50 p2o5 25 kg ha 1 the decreases given above were reduced by 0 12 g kg 1 0 11 g kg 1 and 0 15 g kg 1 respectively the grain had the highest phosphorus content compared with the other organs and the phosphorus content under rff gradually changed from decreasing to increasing as the fertilization amount increased compared with rfh where the critical point was n 58 4 p2o5 29 2 kg ha 1 fig 6 in the leaf stem and other organs the phosphorus content under rff decreased by 0 09 g kg 1 14 1 0 01 g kg 1 4 0 and 0 02 g kg 1 4 1 respectively compared with rfh over n 0 285 p2o5 0 143 kg ha 1 in addition the phosphorus content exhibited an upward parabolic response in each maize organ as the fertilizer amount increased 3 4 nutrient uptake and distribution rff significantly increased the uptake of nutrients by maize compared with rfh i e by 17 5 for nitrogen and by 27 8 for phosphorus table 2 as the fertilization rate increased the uptake of nutrients by maize plants gradually increased where the nitrogen uptake increased by 0 8 2 0 times and the phosphorus uptake increased by 0 5 1 3 times but no significant increase was observed from h to sh the distributions of the nutrients accumulated in various organs were ordered as follows grain nitrogen 62 phosphorus 72 leaf nitrogen 17 phosphorus 12 other organs nitrogen 12 phosphorus 10 stalk nitrogen 10 phosphorus 6 fig 7 compared with rfh rff significantly increased the nitrogen distribution ratio in the grain i e by 11 under ck 7 at l 11 at m 9 at h and 5 at sh thus compared with rfh rff reduced the nitrogen distribution ratio in the leaves by 3 5 stalk by 1 4 and other organs by 1 4 in addition the results showed that increasing the amount of fertilizer applied from l to sh reduced the nutrient distribution ratio in the grain thereby increasing the ratios in the leaves stems and other organs under rff the proportion decreased from 71 with l to 61 with sh and under rfh the proportion decreased from 65 with l to 56 with sh the trend in the phosphorus distribution ratio was affected by the planting method and fertilization amount in a similar manner to that of nitrogen 3 5 relationship between yield and nutrient contents as the grain yield increased the nitrogen content of the maize grain increased whereas the phosphorus content decreased initially and then increased fig 8 compared with rfh the nitrogen content increased more slowly as the grain yield increased under rff and that the phosphorus content decreased more slowly at low yield level and then increased more slowly as yield increased 3 6 nue as the amount of fertilizer increased the nitrogen use efficiency decreased whereas the phosphorus use efficiency increased initially and then decreased fig 9 compared with rfh rff increased the nitrogen use efficiency by 21 2 at ck 14 4 at l 11 6 at m 8 8 at h and 5 9 at sh however the phosphorus use efficiency was greater under rff than rfh when the fertilizer application rate was lower than n 110 8 p2o5 55 4 kg ha 1 and lower than that under rfh when the amount of fertilizer exceeded n 110 8 p2o5 55 4 kg ha 1 the nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies trended to increase initially before decreasing as the amount of fertilization increased where that under rff continued to increase compared with rfh with average increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies of 20 0 and 28 4 respectively in addition the contribution of fertilization to the grain yield was significantly lower under rff than rfh 4 discussion 4 1 yield in semiarid areas plastic film mulching can effectively improve the soil temperature and water conditions seed germination and canopy extension to intercept more solar radiation energy while maintaining a higher photosynthesis rate thereby significantly increasing the accumulated dry matter and grain yield in crops gan et al 2013 in our three year study rff significantly increased the maize yield compared with rfh mainly because rff provided a more favorable soil hydrothermal environment for maize growth zhang et al 2019b fertilization had a greater impact than the planting method on the maize yield in the present study where the impacts increased gradually each year table 1 during the three year study the maize grain yield decreased each year under ck whereas it remained relatively stable with the second highest yields under l and m and sustained high yields were obtained under h and sh thereby demonstrating that fertilization is necessary to achieve sustainable maize production especially high yields hou et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 however as the amount of fertilizer increased the increase in the maize grain yield capacity was greater under rff compared with rfh where the trend increased initially and then decreased with the maximum under m n 173 p2o5 87 kg ha 1 these results suggest that an optimum amount of fertilizer should be applied under rff planting mainly due to differences in the coupling effect between water and fertilizer under the two planting methods li et al 2009b zhang et al 2020 thus rff obtained a rapid increase in the yield as the amount of fertilizer increased whereas rfh resulted in a slower increase in the yield 4 2 nutrient contents and uptake in the current study rff significantly increased the uptake of nutrients compared with rfh but the nutritional quality especially nitrogen contents did not show a similar trend of improvement with greater amounts in the vegetative organs and less in the grains table 2 the degradation in crop nutritional quality is usually associated with the inability of the crop to absorb nutrients in sync with dry matter accumulation especially grain accumulation resulting in a relative dilution effect as reported in previous studies arduini et al 2006 luo et al 2018 triboi et al 2006 zheng et al 2009 the physiological interpretation findings obtained by luo et al 2018 showed that plastic film mulching reduced the nitrogen content of crops for example by about 7 8 in winter wheat compared with that without mulching mainly because the mulching reduced the re transport efficiency of nitrogen after anthesis and nitrogen absorption after anthesis thereby which resulting in a non synchronous increase in the grain yield and nutrient absorption and a dilution effect luo et al 2018 triboi et al 2006 in addition another potential cause may be the use of chemical fertilizers that release nutrients quickly and are applied to the field before sowing which may result in excessive nutrients consumption in the early stage of crop growth and thus the lower availability of fertilizer in the later stage li et al 2014 our study of maize supports these findings but we also observed an interesting phenomenon where the dilution effect in nitrogen and phosphorus caused by film mulching was more obvious at low fertilizer rates but not apparent at high fertilizer rates these results indicate that rff enhanced the transport of nutrients from the vegetative organs to the grains after flowering compared with rfh as shown by the significantly higher nutrient harvest index under rff compared with rfh however findings in the present study also demonstrated the poor capacity of mulching to improve the crop quality without adding sufficient exogenous nutrients n 161 9 p2o5 81 0 kg ha 1 thus it is necessity to optimize the nutrient supply in order to regulate the nutrient dilution effect and ameliorate the degradation of the nutrient quality in crops caused by mulching luo et al 2018 rational fertilizer application is one of the most widely adopted measures for increasing the crop yield and improving the nutritional quality of crops in crops chen et al 2015 shewry 2007 under an adequate nutrient supply crops can exhibit higher chlorophyll contents and photosynthesis and vigorous growth of the aboveground canopy and the underground root system may occur li et al 2009b ju et al 2009 the results obtained in the present study demonstrate that fertilization significantly increased the nutrient contents and total uptake by maize plants but the nutrient uptake did not increase significantly when the amount of fertilizer exceeded a certain range n 229 p2o5 115 kg ha 1 in addition we found that as the amount of fertilizer increased the nitrogen contents of each plant organ gradually increased but the phosphorus content trended to decrease initially before then increasing which may have been related to the severe phosphorus deficiency in the farmland in this area li et al 2019b in addition after applying p fertilizer the increase of phosphorus uptake by maize crop seems to fail to catch up with the rate of dry matter accumulation so the phosphorus content in the grains of plants in the later period does not increase significantly 4 3 nue and optimization management in the present study rff significantly increased the nue for nitrogen and phosphorus in maize compared with rfh similar results were also reported by liu and siddique 2015 who found that the uptake of nitrogen by crops was strongly related to the plant growth rate soil water content and nutrient availability in semiarid regions at high altitudes water shortages and low temperatures usually limit crop growth and the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients is inhibited by the low soil nutrient availability and photosynthesis rate li et al 2009b wang and xing 2016 we found that the nitrogen uptake and use efficiencies were higher under rff than rfh mainly because the soil water and temperature conditions under rff were superior to those under rfh which accelerated root growth maintained efficient photosynthesis and significantly enhanced the absorption and conversion of nitrogen and phosphorus in maize hou et al 2012 zhang et al 2019b zhao et al 2014 in addition previous studies have shown that soil temperature has an important effect on the nutrient harvest index because sufficient heat can accelerate crop maturation and stimulate the physiological processing of dry matter and nutrients in plant vegetative organs stems leaves sheaves etc to transport nutrients to grain li et al 2017a 2017b liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2019a which is also an important reason for the significant improvements in the nutrient harvest index and nue in rff compared with rfh in the present study physiologically rff significantly improved nue compared with rfh possibly due to differences in the responses of the grain yield and crop nutrient uptake to different planting methods where the grain yield exhibited a sensitive response to the planting method luo et al 2018 thus the grain yield was significantly higher under rff than rfh but the nutrient uptake was less sensitive to the planting method so the increase in the uptake of nutrients under rff did not have as great an effect on the grain yield compared with rfh which was also the main reason for the reduced nutrient content under rff compared with rfh fertilization can provide exogenous nutrients to increase the crop yield but another goal is the efficient use of resources the ideal nutrient management rate should significantly promote increases in the crop yield and maintain nue at a high level chen et al 2014 ju et al 2009 in the present study nue tended to decrease gradually as the amount of fertilizer increased thereby indicating that the grain yield was less responsive to increased fertilization than nutrient absorption although the phosphorus use efficiency tended to increase initially before then decreasing the uptake of nutrients by crops was affected by the grain yield and the nutrient contents of plant organs li et al 2009a in addition to increasing the grain yield and biomass yield fertilization increased the nutrient contents of the plant organs especially nitrogen to a certain extent and thus the uptake of nutrients had a more rapid impact on the grain yield after fertilization hou et al 2012 wang et al 2016 however when the amount of fertilizer was increased from m to h the nutrient utilization efficiency decreased rapidly therefore the amount of fertilizer should be controlled below h n 229 p2o5 115 kg ha 1 in order to maintain the nutrient utilization efficiency at a relatively high level 5 conclusion in a semiarid area of northwest china ridge furrow planting with full plastic film mulching obtained higher productivity compared with that with half plastic film mulching and it significantly increased the maize grain yield and nue however there was a potential risk of the plant nutritional quality degradation under the full mulching compared with the half mulching due to an obvious nutrient dilution effect which even affected the grain fertilization significantly improved the grain yield grain nutrient content and nue for maize in a certain range of n 0 230 p2o5 0 115 kg ha 1 but it also gradually weaked the nutrient dilution effect under the full mulching compared with the half mulching as the amount of fertilizer applied increased to n 160 p2o5 80 kg ha 1 where the nutrient dilution effect disappeared thus the full mulching only had an optimal effect on the grain yield quality and nue in the range of n 160 230 p2o5 80 115 kg ha 1 compared with the half mulching

in karst areas in china are important for economic reasons and for restoring the ecological environment however the lack of water resources in karst areas will affect the growth of zanthoxylum bungeanum and the restoration of the ecological environment studying the influence of zanthoxylum bungeanum on soil hydraulic properties and soil moisture in karst areas is important to optimize management of zanthoxylum bungeanum planting and for ecosystem vegetation restoration in this study 4 year old and 11 year old zanthoxylum bungeanum forest sampling sites were selected and abandoned land was used as a control site 0 50 cm undisturbed soil samples were collected to determine the soil hydraulic properties as well as the basic physical and chemical properties soil volumetric water content sensors were installed at 10 25 40 and 55 cm depths in the soil profile at each sampling site to measure the soil moisture dynamics from may 12 2018 to october 3 2018 the results showed that zanthoxylum bungeanum had a significant impact on the shallow soil hydraulic properties i e reduced soil bulk density increased field moisture capacity porosity and soil moisture and enhanced soil water holding capacity these changes increased with the time since planting additionally the rainfall responses and rainfall replenishment of soil water at the three sites were significantly different the dynamic change in soil moisture in the shallow layer was mainly affected by precipitation and atmospheric temperature evaporation which resulted in rapid changes under dry and wet conditions while soil moisture in the deep layer was mainly affected by precipitation recharge which resulted in a long retention time with the increase in time since the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum the hysteresis of the soil moisture response to rainfall strengthened and the soil water storage and stability improved this study shows that the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum improved the shallow soil hydraulic properties in karst areas and can play a positive role in water conservation keywords zanthoxylum bungeanum soil hydraulic properties soil moisture rainfall event karst 1 introduction in karst areas the soil forming ability of soluble rock is low and the exposure rate of bedrock is high in addition the strong long term karst process has formed a two layer spatial structure of soil and water resources on the one hand shallow soil has a low water holding capacity and high permeability which promotes the rapid downward transport of soil water bonacci et al 2009 on the other hand due to the development of bedrock fissures porous karst terrain gives the underground pipeline network a higher infiltration rate and faster water movement speed resulting in a large amount of precipitation directly infiltrating into the karst fissures through the soil layer and the slope runoff is very low gregory et al 2009 peng and wang 2012 green et al 2014 qin et al 2015 therefore although the rainfall in this area is abundant the special hydrogeological background leads to the poor function of soil hydrological regulation and storage as well as frequent droughts and even rocky desertification zhang et al 2013 classified soil layers into active layers subactive layers and relatively stable layers according to the characteristics of soil water changes in karst areas the change in soil moisture in the active layer is affected by rainfall temperature soil evaporation plant transpiration and rapid infiltration the subactive layer is mainly affected by crop transpiration and slow infiltration and the relatively stable layer is mainly affected by the soil s physical structure capillary force and bedrock fissure infiltration in the whole soil layer the soil moisture is accompanied by vertical movement and the displacement velocity decreases with increasing depth chen et al 2017 surface soil is affected by the spatial variability in the regional soil climate vegetation topography and other factors which indicates more spatiotemporal variability than deep soil water zhang et al 1988 therefore the karst area is different from the dry climate area in terms of a water deficit but can mean a temporary drought with a humid climate background based on this background drought caused by a soil water deficit has been a key obstacle for vegetation restoration and reconstruction of karst ecosystems čustović et al 2014 resulting in a serious threat to agricultural water resources in recent years vegetation restoration has become a research hotspot in karst rocky desertification areas and the optimal regulation of water and soil resources is the main focus of attention jiang et al 2014 tong et al 2018 reasonable tillage management strategies play a positive role in maintaining the hydrological function of karst soil yang et al 2016 because different land use types management measures and tillage methods have a great impact on the hydraulic characteristics of soil yang et al 2016 for example according to the investigation by yang et al 2017 in huang jiang guangxi province china the impact of different vegetation types on soil hydrologic functions is obvious through a comparison they found that artistic grassland napier grass has a positive effect on soil hydrologic functions and is more suitable for vegetation restoration in karst areas soil hydraulic properties are a research hotspot in the field of agricultural production schwen et al 2011 which plays an important guiding role in water resource utilization agricultural management and agricultural hydrological model construction generally speaking the soil moisture content soil saturated hydraulic conductivity soil bulk density field moisture capacity and soil porosity are important parameters reflecting soil hydraulic properties chen et al 2008 wang et al 2017 valdes abellan et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 adopted a robust micro genetic algorithm and an inverse technique for estimating soil hydraulic properties at a field scale some scholars use a direct method measurement or an indirect method empirical formula for modeling combined with multiple meteorological parameters to accurately predict evaporation ghorbani et al 2018 shamshirband et al 2020 which is of great significance for agricultural management in arid areas feki et al 2018 considered the variability of the soil water retention curve evaporation measurement and saturated hydraulic conductivity and used the fest wb model to simulate soil water these authors improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided guidance for precision irrigation zanthoxylum bungeanum hereafter zanthoxylum as a kind of calcium loving drought tolerant light loving shallow root vegetation is very suitable for growth in karst environments ai et al 2014 the planting area of zanthoxylum bungeanum in china is 1087 667 ha the total output of chinese zanthoxylum bungeanum is 380 000 tons with an output value of 14 8 billion yuan benefiting 45 million people showed on website of huajiao cn in china in the grain to green program the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum not only realized the restoration of the ecological environment but has also resulted in industrial transformation providing opportunities for the extremely poor in rural areas to become rich therefore this practice is widely promoted in karst rocky desertification control areas based on numerous recent research reports zanthoxylum bungeanum has the potential to restore severely degraded soils in the karst region of southwestern china millions of hectares of farmland in the karst region of guizhou province have been converted into zanthoxylum bungeanum plantations in order to stop and reverse rocky desertification cheng 2015 planting zanthoxylum bungeanum is beneficial for increasing nutrient content bao et al 2017 and carbon sequestration capacity zhang et al 2015 long et al 2018 in karst rocky desertification areas which effectively improves the ecological environment and increases economic benefits so it is widely promoted in rocky desertification control areas cheng et al 2017 however existing studies mainly focus on the effect of planting zanthoxylum bungeanum on soil fertility and few reports have studied the effect of planting zanthoxylum bungeanum on soil hydraulic properties does planting zanthoxylum bungeanum have the effect of soil moisture conservation in rocky desertification therefore the purpose of this study is to explore 1 the effect of planting zanthoxylum bungeanum on soil hydraulic properties in karst areas 2 the influence of soil hydraulic properties on rainfall response and supply the results of this study are helpful to guide the planting and management strategies of zanthoxylum bungeanum and can be used as a reference for ecological vegetation restoration in rocky desertification areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study area is a small catchment with an area of approximately 0 52 km2 located in the eco hydrological observation station of state engineering technology institute for karst desertification control in zhenfeng county guizhou province southwest china this area is dominated by a middle subtropical climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1052 mm mainly from may to october a mean annual temperature of 18 4 and an altitude of 400 1100 m which is a typical type of the karst plateau gorge landform the gorge landform has the function of blocking cold and wet air flow and producing foehn forming a dry and hot gorge the lithology is dolomitic limestone of the middle triassic system and the soil type is calcareous soil throughout history unreasonable farming activities significant human made destruction serious soil erosion high rock exposure rates and thin and discontinuous soil layers have resulted in severe rocky desertification the exposed rocks heat up rapidly after absorbing solar radiation which further increases the degree of dry heat in the study area in 1996 the area was established as a national demonstration area of rocky desertification control with the terracing project as the main measure to prevent and control soil erosion however the area has a high temperature high evaporation dry soil and limited water for crop growth due to water shortages the yield of zea mays l and ipomoea batatas l lam in the area is low which is difficult to ensure the survival of farmers moreover the planting of zea mays l and ipomoea batatas l lam greatly disturbs the soil destroying the soil structure and aggravating soil erosion therefore the planting of perennial species with good soil and water conservation effects as well as drought tolerance is the best way to slow down the surface evaporation and restore the ecological environment zanthoxylum bungeanum has the characteristics of drought resistance calcareous soil resistance and fast growth with a shallow taproot and many lateral roots which can prevent soil erosion cheng et al 2015 therefore scientific researchers forest managers and policy makers chose zanthoxylum bungeanum as a suitable tree species for ecological restoration of the grain to green program in beipanjiang town zhenfeng county guizhou province china generally local zanthoxylum bungeanum begins to seed approximately 3 years after cultivation zanthoxylum bungeanum enters the vigorous fruit bearing period by age 4 5 years the diameter of the base of the stem is 4 1 4 5 cm the fruit setting percentage is 30 37 and the average yield of zanthoxylum bungeanum fresh zanthoxylum bungeanum per plant is 5 7 kg the yield of zanthoxylum bungeanum reaches a peak in 10 13 years the diameter of the base of the stem is 5 6 cm the fruit setting percentage is 40 48 and the average yield of zanthoxylum bungeanum fresh zanthoxylum bungeanum is 9 13 kg per plant local farmers will prune the plants when they grows eliminating apical dominance the mean height of zanthoxylum bungeanum is 2 2 5 m and the crown is basically the same a 4 year old zanthoxylum bungeanum forest zb4 and an 11 year old zanthoxylum bungeanum forest zb11 were selected in the study area and land that had been abandoned al for 5 years was used as the reference sampling site fig 1 zhou et al 2018 found that under the condition of natural recovery in karst rocky desertification areas a herb community structure could be formed in 5 years a shrub community could be formed in 25 years and a tree community could be formed in 53 years therefore there were no shrubs or trees in the 5 year abandoned land in the study area and this area can be used as a reference sample for 4 and 11 year old zanthoxylum bungeanum forests to avoid the interaction among the three sampling sites the selected sampling sites are 30 40 m apart from each other all of which are distributed at the same elevation 713 m of terraced fields with a mean soil depth of 62 cm there was no irrigation fertilization or soil disturbance in the two zanthoxylum bungeanum fields the vegetation coverage and height of zanthoxylum bungeanum are similar 2 2 sampling and measurements we selected five zanthoxylum bungeanum trees of the same age from zb4 and zb11 before the experiment the dropped objects and weeds on the ground surface should be removed to avoid the influence of the mulch on the experimental results a five point sampling method was used in al in the five point sampling method a square quadrat is selected from the sampling plot the intersection of the square diagonal is used as the central sample and four points equidistant from the central point are selected on the diagonal as the sample the individual distribution of vegetation in the al area was uniform which conforms to the application requirements of the five point sampling method cutting rings 5 cm height and 5 cm diameter were used to repeatedly collect the 0 50 cm soil profile of each sampling site from top to bottom three times at a height of 5 cm in each layer and the soil bulk density field moisture capacity total porosity capillary porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured at 15 cm in each sampling site infiltration was measured three times by an infiltrometer mini disk infiltrometer meter group inc pullman wa usa specific measurement and calculation methods were based on dohnal et al 2010 approximately 10 15 and 20 25 cm of undisturbed soil was collected a pressure transducer tensiometer t5 meter group inc pullman wa usa and balances eu c 2002 gibertini elettronica srl mi ita were used to measure the soil tension and soil moisture every 10 min in the laboratory and the soil water characteristic curve was drawn at the same time soil samples were collected in each 5 cm layer and then divided into two sub samples after air drying one sub sample was passed through a 2 mm sieve to analyze soil particle composition using a laser particle size analyzer eyetech ankersmid group inc nijverdal dh ned the other sub sample was passed through a 0 25 mm sieve the total nitrogen tn content was determined by the kjeldahl method the total phosphorus tp content was determined by the perchloric sulfuric acid digestion method and the soil organic carbon soc content was determined by the dichromate oxidation method the test results are shown in table 1 one zanthoxylum bungeanum tree was selected in zb4 and zb11 and a soil volumetric water content sensor ech2o 5te meter group inc pullman wa usa was installed vertically at 10 25 40 and 55 cm away from a 20 cm area of the zanthoxylum bungeanum root zone the sensor was installed in the same position at the al the sensor is a capacitance sensor that takes advantage of the high permittivity of water and calculates the apparent moist soil dielectric constant or relative permittivity e the relative permittivity value for water is about 80 for air it is 1 and for mineral soils the value ranges from 3 to 7 thus a higher soil water content translates into a higher e value the volumetric soil water content hv can be calculated using the following empirical calibration equation decagon devices inc 2010 1 θ v m 3 m 3 4 3 10 6 ε 3 5 5 10 4 ε 2 2 92 10 2 ε 5 3 10 2 where θv is the volumetric soil water content measured in m3 m 3 and ε represents dielectric units obtained by dividing the sensor output by 50 soil moisture was recorded on the data logger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa every 10 min from may 12 2018 to october 3 2018 the main rainfall period in the region the weather station atmos meter group inc pullman wa usa is located less than 50 m away from the soil moisture monitoring sites and the collected data including air temperature precipitation barometer and relative humidity were recorded every 10 min 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 soil water storage sws the soil water storage was calculated using the following equation 2 s w s θ v h v where sws is the soil water storage mm θ v is the soil volumetric water content and h v is the soil layer mm in this study sws was calculated for 4 layers 0 100 100 250 250 400 and 400 550 mm 2 3 2 soil water replenishment in each rainfall event soil water replenishment yang et al 2018 was calculated using the following equation 3 δ s w s w max s w 0 where δsw is soil water replenishment at each rainfall event mm sw max is the highest value of sws after a rainfall event mm and sw 0 is the antecedent sws before a rainfall event mm 2 3 3 rainfall replenishment rate to soil water zanthoxylum bungeanum are shallow rooted plants and their main range of water absorption by roots is 0 30 cm zhou et al 2019 therefore the time when soil water began to increase at the 25 cm depth was regarded as the beginning of the effective replenishment of soil water in this study the rainfall replenishment rate to soil water yang et al 2018 was defined as the ratio of the maximum soil water replenishment volume over time from the start of the soil water content increase at a depth of 25 cm to the time when sws reached the highest value at a depth of 0 55 cm 4 v δ s w t max t 1 where v is the rainfall replenishment rate of the soil water mm h 1 t max is the time when the sws 0 55 cm reached the highest value during a rainfall event h and t 1 is the time when the soil water at a depth of 25 cm started to increase h 2 3 4 wavelet coherency analysis generally soil water has high spatiotemporal variability which is caused by different factors and processes acting together traditional correlation analysis spearman rank correlation analysis and pearson correlation analysis has been widely used in the identification of overall similarity at the measurement scale however these analyses lose information about scale and timing at different scales the factors controlling soil water are different which cannot be identified by traditional correlation analysis in addition one factor may have a different correlation across different scales and times and factors may cancel each other at the whole measurement scale biswas and si 2011 spectral analysis and spatial coherence can reveal the scale dependence of variables but only for stationary systems si 2008 the soil water sequence behavior is generally a non stationary system however wavelet coherence can deal with non stationary data series which provides an opportunity to analyze the temporal pattern of soil moisture at multiple scales wavelet coherence based on wavelet transform can solve the problem of data variability in spatial series it can be used for analysis of the correlation coefficients of two time series in the time and frequency domains and can identify the similarity of spatial patterns between two spatial series therefore it is widely used to study the correlation between soil moisture and drought variability and precipitation tang and piechota 2009 parent et al 2009 in recent years li et al 2017 and liu et al 2017 used the wavelet coherency of two temporal series of soil moisture across the soil profile to describe the depth persistence of the temporal pattern the wavelet coherence of two time series is defined as follows torrence and compo 1998 torrence and webster 1999 grinsted et al 2004 5 r n 2 s s s 1 w n x y s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where w n x y s is the interactive wavelet power of the time series x and y w n x s and w n y s are the wavelet transforms of time series x and y respectively and s is a smoothing operator the wtc value is 0 1 which represents the local information of the linear relationship between the two processes a detailed introduction on the theory and application cases of wavelet coherency can be found in previous studies si and zeleke 2005 salerno and tartari 2009 biswas and si 2011 li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 in this study we use the morlet wavelet transform ω 6 and wavelet coherence toolbox provided by grinsted et al 2004 and the code is available at http noc ac uk using science crosswavelet wavelet coherence the morlet wavelet analysis method used in this study is a non orthogonal complex function torrence and compo 1998 compared with the orthogonal wavelet function the non orthogonal wavelet function has many advantages first the analysis of time series based on the non orthogonal wavelet function is continuous which conforms to the continuous change in soil water over time second non orthogonal wavelet analysis can provide information on the wave amplitude and phase while orthogonal wavelet analysis cannot provide phase information furthermore non orthogonal wavelet functions are arbitrary with respect to the choice of the time scale it is worth mentioning that the wavelet function of the mexican hat wavelet analysis method is also non orthogonal although it has the advantage of separating positive and negative oscillations mexican hat wavelet analysis captures less oscillation information than the morlet wavelet analysis method of complex functions therefore the morlet wavelet analysis method was selected in this study in the significance testing for wavelet coherency the significance of the wavelet power spectrum was tested at the 95 level using the red noise of the soil property as the background spectrum si 2008 2 4 statistical analysis in this study figure drawing was conducted by origin 2017 originlab inc northampton ma usa imb spss statistics 22 ibm inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the data and spearman rank correlation test of soil moisture in different soil layers vachaud et al

moisture capacity total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks among the three sites are significantly different table 1 while these values show similar changes in the soil profile distribution as a whole fig 2 among them the trends of total porosity field moisture capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity are similar the maximum value appears at 0 15 cm in the soil layer the bulk density is the opposite and the minimum value appears at 0 15 cm in the soil layer this shows that the infiltration of shallow soil is strong the difference in the soil hydraulic change in the profile is mainly reflected in the 0 20 cm soil layer the mean value of the 0 20 cm soil layer of bulk density is al 1 22 g cm 3 zb4 1 18 g cm 3 zb11 1 17 g cm 3 the field moisture capacity is zb11 32 95 zb4 32 00 al 25 71 the total porosity is al 54 93 zb11 54 63 zb4 53 11 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is al 11 27 mm min 1 zb4 8 38 mm min 1 zb11 7 52 mm min 1 the variation in soil bulk density field moisture capacity total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity was small under 20 cm at all sites in addition we know from the field penetration test results fig 3 that the average permeability at the 0 15 cm depth in the three sample plots was al 2 70 ml zb4 2 43 ml zb11 2 18 ml indicating that al had better permeability on the soil surface therefore we studied the water holding capacity of shallow soil at 10 15 and 20 25 cm fig 4 the results showed that the soil water holding capacity of the 20 25 cm soil layer was better than that of the 10 15 cm soil layer at all sites in comparison with the increase in water potential the decrease rate for the soil water content was the fastest in the 10 15 cm and 20 25 cm soil layers at the al indicating that the al has the worst water holding capacity in contrast zb11 has the best water holding capacity 3 2 daily dynamic characteristics of soil moisture during the monitoring period the mean daily precipitation was 7 2 mm the temperature was 28 5 and the relative humidity was 92 3 table 2 with the deepening of the soil layer the soil moisture increased and the coefficient of variation decreased at al the soil moisture coefficient of variation in the 0 25 cm soil layer was higher than that in the 25 55 cm soil layer at zb4 and the soil moisture coefficient of variation in the 0 10 cm soil layer was lower than that in the 10 25 cm soil layer at zb11 fig 5 shows the soil moisture profile dynamics of the al zb4 and zb11 reflecting that there are significant differences in the daily variations in soil moisture among the three sites the soil moisture in the 0 25 cm soil layer at the al changed rapidly and the alternation of dry and wet conditions was obvious the variations in soil moisture in the 0 25 cm soil layer at zb4 were relatively stable while the variation in soil moisture in the 0 25 cm soil layer at zb11 was relatively small and the soil moisture was the highest in comparison the soil moisture of the 0 25 cm soil layer at zb11 was significantly higher than that at the al and zb4 and the retention time of soil moisture below 30 cm was longer after rainfall when the daily rainfall was more than 100 mm 110 8 mm on june 21 2018 102 8 mm on august 7 2018 the soil profile of the three sites showed a significant increase in soil moisture the results show that the daily variations in shallow soil moisture were mainly affected by precipitation and external temperature evaporation while those of deep soil moisture were mainly affected by precipitation zhu et al 2021 and wu et al 2011 also agree with this view and believe that evaporation rainfall time and rainfall are the main factors affecting soil water deficit 3 3 the response of soil moisture to rainfall events fig 6 represents the 10 min monitoring results of the sensor the deeper the soil layer is the stronger the hysteresis response of the soil moisture to rainfall at the three sites in comparison the soil moisture of the al soil profile is more sensitive to rainfall response and the variation is more obvious to clarify the rainfall response characteristics of soil moisture at different depths at the three sites we counted the data changes of soil moisture sensors for different soil layers in six typical rainfall events 30 mm according to the first increase in soil moisture sensor data after rainfall table 3 the soil moisture of the 0 10 cm soil layer at the three sites was sensitive to rainfall while the soil moisture of the 10 55 cm soil layers increased only when the mean rainfall accumulated to more than 20 mm in contrast the rainfall required for the response of soil moisture in each layer at zb11 is higher than that at the al and zb4 the mean precipitation required for the response of soil moisture in the 0 10 10 25 25 40 and 40 55 cm soil layers at zb11 increased by 45 11 5 13 5 and 12 8 compared with the al and increased by 16 9 13 0 4 9 and 6 4 compared with zb4 therefore the response of the soil moisture in the zb11 soil profile to rainfall has a strong hysteresis 3 4 the response of soil water recharge to rainfall events as shown in fig 7 the sws of the three sites is significantly different during the monitoring period and the mean value exhibits the following order zb11 16 86 mm zb4 16 04 mm al 14 07 mm and the cv exhibits the following order al 12 0 zb4 9 1 zb11 8 3 the dynamic variations in sws at al zb4 and zb11 all responded significantly to rainfall events fig 8 in the absence of rainfall events sws exhibits the following order zb11 zb4 al during rainfall events the sws of the al can be rapidly higher than that at zb4 and zb11 we analyzed the soil water replenishment and rainfall replenishment rate of soil water in the main rainfall events the relationship between soil water replenishment and precipitation was constructed by a one dimensional linear regression equation fig 9 which showed that the al zb4 and zb11 had a good linear relationship with precipitation indicating that rainfall had a direct impact on soil water replenishment in the main rainfall events the soil water replenishment and rainfall replenishment rate of soil water at the al were higher than those at zb4 and zb11 indicating that the al has the greatest advantage of rainfall replenishment efficiency for soil water table 4 3 5 wavelet coherence analysis of soil moisture at various soil depths as shown in table 5 the spearman rank correlation coefficients of soil moisture between different soil layers at the three sites were statistically significant p 0 01 indicating that the dynamic variations in the soil layers at different depths were similar during the monitoring period for the same site the correlation coefficients between two adjacent soil layers were higher but decreased with increasing soil depth for example the correlation coefficient between 0 and 10 cm and 10 25 cm at the al was 0 735 and the correlation coefficient between 0 and 10 cm and 40 55 cm was reduced to 0 607 zb4 and zb11 also show similar regularity we used a wavelet coherence analysis to study the correlation between soil moisture and precipitation at al zb4 and zb11 on different time scales according to the monitoring time series we divide the time scale into three scales including small 2 4 d medium 4 16 d and large 16 d scales as shown in fig 10 the area of significant correlation increased with the soil depth but on a small scale the correlation between soil moisture and precipitation was low in continuous rainfall events there are significant correlations at small medium and large scales for any site it is worth mentioning that the significant correlation of the three sites at the scale of 2 8 d was low from june 27 2018 to july 23 2018 which may be caused by relatively high temperatures and relatively dry soil due to fewer rainfall events during this period for example we can see from fig 5 that there were fewer rainfall events and soil water recharge was negligible during this period however high temperatures can cause sustained drought and reduced soil water storage fig 8 leading to the significant correlation between soil moisture and precipitation on the scale of 2 8 d is low during this period which is similar to our previous research li et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 effects of zanthoxylum bungeanum planting on soil hydraulic properties in this study it is indicated that planting zanthoxylum bungeanum has a significant impact on shallow soil hydraulic properties in karst areas which is also one of the main factors affecting the difference in soil moisture soil structure determines soil hydraulic properties and the vertical variations in soil moisture in the soil profile mainly depend on the vertical distribution of soil texture yang et al 2016 2019 gaur et al 2016 canton et al 2016 yang et al 2019 believed that short term soil moisture change may be more controlled by the impact of soil physical properties mainly water holding capacity rather than precipitation soil infiltration capacity is significantly related to soil porosity the smaller the soil bulk density is the higher the porosity is which is conducive to the infiltration of soil water famiglietti et al 1998 fu et al 2015a 2015b canton et al 2016 our study shows that the al zb4 and zb11 fields had strong permeability in the 0 15 cm fig 2 in karst areas the soil structure is loose the infiltration speed of soil water is fast and the phenomenon of soil preferential flow is common bonacci et al 2009 canton et al 2016 suggesting that the high content of gravel in karst soil is an important characteristic that is different from that in non karst areas gravel increases the soil surface temperature and promotes evaporation cousin et al 2003 a high gravel content is accompanied by a high infiltration capacity of soil which makes the water more likely to move to the deep layer and this phenomenon is similar to that at the al sampling site in this study according to the above permeability test results al had better permeability on the soil surface fig 3 which may be related to the relatively high sand content and relatively low clay content of al table 1 therefore compared with the zanthoxylum bungeanum fields the shallow soil of al had better permeability and poor water holding capacity fig 3 fig 4 which led to rapid changes in soil moisture in the 0 25 cm soil layer of al fig 5 compared with noncultivated soil the permeability of cultivated soil is relatively weak fu et al 2015b wang et al 2016 further explained the preferential flow characteristics of noncultivated and cultivated soil in karst areas by dye tracing experiments the results showed that the intensity of preferential flow in noncultivated regions was significantly higher than that in farmlands and preferential flow was more likely to occur on the one hand the cultivated soil is affected by root growth and human disturbance which increases the loose degree of shallow soil on the other hand the difference in physical and chemical properties between the shallow soil and the underlying soil with a stable structure limits the connectivity of infiltration hinders the preferential flow generation of the underlying soil and thus shows the enhancement of the horizontal flow permeability of the shallow soil water nie et al 2014 supported the above view and believed that plant roots only exist in loose shallow soil and develop laterally in karst areas so the impact of plant roots on soil physical properties is limited to shallow soil and not deep soil the root zone of zanthoxylum bungeanum is basically distributed in the shallow 0 30 cm soil and the growth of roots promotes an increase in capillary number and porosity in the shallow soil the amount of roots in the lower layer decreases so the soil structure is relatively dense peng et al 2007 similarly in this study we found that the changes in the soil hydraulic properties caused by the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum mainly occurred in the shallow soil 0 20 cm compared with al the average field moisture capacity of the 0 20 cm soil layers of zb4 and zb11 increased by 19 66 and 21 97 respectively and the average saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased by 34 49 and 49 87 respectively fig 2 in addition the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum increased the clay content table 1 thus reducing soil permeability as mentioned above the analysis of the soil water characteristic curve of the 10 15 cm and 20 25 cm soil layers at the three sites showed that the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum increased the soil water holding capacity fig 4 the soil water holding capacity of the 0 25 cm soil layer of zb11 was strong the soil moisture content was significantly higher than that of al and zb4 and the retention time of soil water below the 30 cm layer was longer after a rainfall event fig 5 in addition the sws at the three sites was ranked as zb11 zb4 al fig 7 and this order supports the above view therefore this study shows that with an increase in the time since planting for zanthoxylum bungeanum the bulk density of the shallow soil decreased the field moisture capacity and porosity increased the soil infiltration rate decreased and the water holding capacity of the soil increased with a positive effect on the water conservation function and an improvement in the ecological effects of soil and water 4 2 response of soil moisture to rainfall events this study found that the daily variations in shallow soil moisture were mainly affected by rainfall and external temperature while those of deep soil moisture were mainly affected by rainfall the response of soil moisture to rainfall at different depths is a complex process that is affected by rainfall intensity amount of precipitation dry interval vegetation type and soil structure he et al 2012 bodner et al 2007 ding et al 2021 previous studies have shown that the rainfall pattern of a series of small rainfall events cannot easily provide effective soil water recharge because during the period of small rainfall events more soil water will be lost due to the impact of soil evaporation and plant transpiration wythers et al 1999 he et al 2012 heavy rainfall events will provide more infiltration and less soil evaporation and the rainfall replenishment efficiency to soil water is higher schwinning and sala 2004 for example he et al 2012 showed that small rainfall events can only affect the accumulation of surface sws and the effect of a single large rainfall event on sws is better than that of a continuous small rainfall event which increases the stability time of soil moisture moreover according to yang et al 2019 when precipitation is a certain amount the soil moisture is determined by the soil water holding capacity of the corresponding soil layer as a constant determined by the soil texture rather than by the precipitation during the monitoring period of this study rainfall is frequent and the dry interval is generally less than ten days therefore rainfall intensity does not have a direct impact on the replenishment and replenishment rate of soil water rainfall directly affected soil water recharge at the three sites because of the difference in soil hydraulic properties and vegetation coverage planting zanthoxylum bungeanum has an obvious influence on the rainfall response and rainfall replenishment characteristics of soil water in this study the sampling sites are all located on terraced fields and there is basically no surface runoff so the rainfall will infiltrate vertically into the soil the sensitivity of the shallow soil moisture to rainfall events is greater than that of the lower layer heavy rainfall events can significantly increase soil moisture especially for the deep layer below 25 cm we found that the sws a zb11 was significantly higher than that at zb4 when there was no rainfall event the sws at zb4 was higher than that at zb11 when a rainfall event occurred the rainfall response rate of soil moisture and sws at the al was significantly faster than that of the zanthoxylum bungeanum fields and the longer the planting years of zanthoxylum bungeanum were the stronger the hysteresis of the rainfall response of soil moisture and sws figs 6 and 8 table 3 which was corresponded to the above mentioned soil water holding capacity characteristics in the three sites among the six main rainfall events we selected the soil water replenishment and replenishment rate to soil water at the al was the best among the three sites the soil water replenishment of the zanthoxylum bungeanum field was affected by canopy interception resulting in less soil water replenishment and longer infiltration time however at the al the low vegetation coverage promoted the infiltration capacity of precipitation and the shallow soil was more affected by evaporation so the alternation of dry and wet soil was rapid in conclusion strong permeability and evaporation led to a decrease in soil moisture in the later period at the al therefore we believe that although the al has the best infiltration and water replenishment the hydrological characteristics of karst soil will lead to wasted water infiltration and the soil cannot effectively hold water which is not conducive to water conservation this view is similar to the conclusions of our previous work li et al 2020 and supported by the conclusions of nie et al 2011 in guangxi southwest china according to the comparison of sws among the three sites we think that long term planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum improves the soil water holding capacity coupled with the influence of crown width which seems to form a cover on the soil surface effectively reducing soil evaporation vachaud et al 1985 pointed out that the variation characteristics of soil moisture can be explained by the change characteristics of soil structure when there is a close relationship between the variation in soil moisture and the determined factors such as soil structure and topography the temporal stability of soil moisture may appear zhang and berndtsson 1988 observed the variations in soil moisture for ten years and found that the evaporation and agricultural activities of the upper soil layer had a stable spatial distribution structure over time due to the similar rainfall input during the observations we found that there was a significant positive correlation between the soil moisture in each soil layer at the three sites indicating that there was temporal stability in the soil moisture during rainfall events and this stability increased with increasing soil depth table 5 in a continuous rainfall event there were significant correlations for small medium and large scales in the wavelet coherence analysis fig 10 according to gomez plaza et al 2000 when the factors affecting soil moisture were limited to geographical location and topography the soil moisture presented a relatively stable spatial distribution structure over time when vegetation factors also affect soil moisture the spatial distribution structure of soil moisture became unstable nie et al 2011 believed that although the precipitation in the rainy season is large it is accompanied by the vigorous growth of plants and a high temperature environment which makes the soil water consumption large the soil moisture loss caused by small rainfall events is more obvious due to soil evaporation and plant transpiration wythers et al 1999 therefore we think that not only does soil structure have an effect on soil water loss but zanthoxylum bungeanum of different ages also has different demands for soil water the water consumption of young zanthoxylum bungeanum in the growing period is large which accelerates soil water consumption and leads to a decrease in soil moisture 4 3 implications for future planting activities the impact of precipitation on shallow soil water in karst areas can only last for 6 11 days and most of the precipitation infiltrating the soil layer will evaporate transpire or transport downward in two weeks and dry up yang et al 2019 zanthoxylum bungeanum is a kind of shallow root and drought resistant vegetation and its water absorption by roots mainly depends on the shallow soil water serious water shortages will lead to a reduction in the yield and quality of fruit the study area is located in the plateau gorge area although the precipitation is sufficient but the temperature is high the shallow soil water evaporation loss is rapid which leads to most crops seriously lacking water the water consumption of zanthoxylum bungeanum in the growing season is large which poses a large challenge for the local zanthoxylum bungeanum growth water supply based on the above understanding we think that the irrigation strategy of local zanthoxylum bungeanum should be as follows young zanthoxylum bungeanum need a large amount of water and the soil has a strong permeability with less water frequent irrigation as the main strategy for mature and old zanthoxylum bungeanum because the soil has a strong water holding capacity more water less irrigation is the main strategy it is worth mentioning that no tillage was performed in the planting process of zanthoxylum bungeanum litter mulching improved soil physical properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing porosity liao et al 2021 the humus formed by litter accumulates in the surface soil promotes microbial activity in the root zone cheng et al 2015 bao et al 2017 increases the soil nutrient content table 1 and improves the soil structure however we need to realize that there are two risks after long time planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum the first risk is soc reduction according to long et al 2018 soc decreased more than 30 years after planting zanthoxylum bungeanum the reason is that the soil structure characteristics and hydrothermal conditions in karst mountain areas accelerate the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic matter once zanthoxylum bungeanum reaches its peak production period a large amount of soil organic matter is required to maintain its growth thus accelerating the consumption of soil organic matter zhang et al 2015 the second risk is the possibility of soil compaction due to the geomorphic and climatic characteristics in the study area the dry and wet alternation of the surface soil in the rainy season is rapid and the high temperature makes the surface water evaporate rapidly the soil becomes drier and the soil compaction in the surface soil becomes obvious hamza et al 2005 in addition long term monoculture can cause continuous cropping obstacles and allelopathy of zanthoxylum bungeanum roots can accelerate soil compaction the karst ecological environment is more suitable for planting zanthoxylum bungeanum which can be used as an important way to restore the karst soil ecological environment however if the planting method is singular the management is poor and the cultivation measures are unreasonable the development of the local zanthoxylum bungeanum industry and the land productivity will be adversely affected therefore the improvement of planting management technology is very important for sustainable agricultural development based on the local environmental conditions we believe that adopting agroforestry planting rotation or intercropping is a relatively effective method that helps to improve the hydraulic properties of soil and increase soil nutrients which has been confirmed in relevant studies akdemir et al 2016 yin et al 2020 in the next step we should study the effect of the agroforestry planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum on the soil hydraulic properties in addition we should also pay attention to the relationship between the soil hydraulic properties and the water use efficiency of zanthoxylum bungeanum at different tree ages 5 conclusions the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum had a significant effect on the shallow soil hydraulic properties zanthoxylum bungeanum reduced the shallow soil bulk density increased the field moisture capacity porosity and soil moisture and enhanced the soil water holding capacity soil water remained in the lower layer below 30 cm for a relatively long time after rainfall which played a positive role in the water conservation function due to differences in soil hydraulic properties root systems and vegetation coverage the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum had a significant impact on the rainfall response and rainfall replenishment of soil water in general the dynamic variations in shallow soil water were mainly affected by precipitation and atmospheric temperature evaporation leading to rapid dry and wet changes while deep soil water was mainly affected by precipitation recharge and the retention time was longer in terms of rainfall response rates the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum increased the response hysteresis of soil moisture to rainfall and enhanced the sws and stability therefore we suggest that young zanthoxylum bungeanum should be subjected to less water frequent irrigation as the main irrigation strategy for mature and old zanthoxylum bungeanum the main strategy should be more water less irrigation however this work did not observe zanthoxylum bungeanum in multiple different years which has some limitations the next study needs to pay attention to the relationship between the soil hydraulic properties and the water use efficiency of zanthoxylum bungeanum at different ages declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

in karst areas in china are important for economic reasons and for restoring the ecological environment however the lack of water resources in karst areas will affect the growth of zanthoxylum bungeanum and the restoration of the ecological environment studying the influence of zanthoxylum bungeanum on soil hydraulic properties and soil moisture in karst areas is important to optimize management of zanthoxylum bungeanum planting and for ecosystem vegetation restoration in this study 4 year old and 11 year old zanthoxylum bungeanum forest sampling sites were selected and abandoned land was used as a control site 0 50 cm undisturbed soil samples were collected to determine the soil hydraulic properties as well as the basic physical and chemical properties soil volumetric water content sensors were installed at 10 25 40 and 55 cm depths in the soil profile at each sampling site to measure the soil moisture dynamics from may 12 2018 to october 3 2018 the results showed that zanthoxylum bungeanum had a significant impact on the shallow soil hydraulic properties i e reduced soil bulk density increased field moisture capacity porosity and soil moisture and enhanced soil water holding capacity these changes increased with the time since planting additionally the rainfall responses and rainfall replenishment of soil water at the three sites were significantly different the dynamic change in soil moisture in the shallow layer was mainly affected by precipitation and atmospheric temperature evaporation which resulted in rapid changes under dry and wet conditions while soil moisture in the deep layer was mainly affected by precipitation recharge which resulted in a long retention time with the increase in time since the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum the hysteresis of the soil moisture response to rainfall strengthened and the soil water storage and stability improved this study shows that the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum improved the shallow soil hydraulic properties in karst areas and can play a positive role in water conservation keywords zanthoxylum bungeanum soil hydraulic properties soil moisture rainfall event karst 1 introduction in karst areas the soil forming ability of soluble rock is low and the exposure rate of bedrock is high in addition the strong long term karst process has formed a two layer spatial structure of soil and water resources on the one hand shallow soil has a low water holding capacity and high permeability which promotes the rapid downward transport of soil water bonacci et al 2009 on the other hand due to the development of bedrock fissures porous karst terrain gives the underground pipeline network a higher infiltration rate and faster water movement speed resulting in a large amount of precipitation directly infiltrating into the karst fissures through the soil layer and the slope runoff is very low gregory et al 2009 peng and wang 2012 green et al 2014 qin et al 2015 therefore although the rainfall in this area is abundant the special hydrogeological background leads to the poor function of soil hydrological regulation and storage as well as frequent droughts and even rocky desertification zhang et al 2013 classified soil layers into active layers subactive layers and relatively stable layers according to the characteristics of soil water changes in karst areas the change in soil moisture in the active layer is affected by rainfall temperature soil evaporation plant transpiration and rapid infiltration the subactive layer is mainly affected by crop transpiration and slow infiltration and the relatively stable layer is mainly affected by the soil s physical structure capillary force and bedrock fissure infiltration in the whole soil layer the soil moisture is accompanied by vertical movement and the displacement velocity decreases with increasing depth chen et al 2017 surface soil is affected by the spatial variability in the regional soil climate vegetation topography and other factors which indicates more spatiotemporal variability than deep soil water zhang et al 1988 therefore the karst area is different from the dry climate area in terms of a water deficit but can mean a temporary drought with a humid climate background based on this background drought caused by a soil water deficit has been a key obstacle for vegetation restoration and reconstruction of karst ecosystems čustović et al 2014 resulting in a serious threat to agricultural water resources in recent years vegetation restoration has become a research hotspot in karst rocky desertification areas and the optimal regulation of water and soil resources is the main focus of attention jiang et al 2014 tong et al 2018 reasonable tillage management strategies play a positive role in maintaining the hydrological function of karst soil yang et al 2016 because different land use types management measures and tillage methods have a great impact on the hydraulic characteristics of soil yang et al 2016 for example according to the investigation by yang et al 2017 in huang jiang guangxi province china the impact of different vegetation types on soil hydrologic functions is obvious through a comparison they found that artistic grassland napier grass has a positive effect on soil hydrologic functions and is more suitable for vegetation restoration in karst areas soil hydraulic properties are a research hotspot in the field of agricultural production schwen et al 2011 which plays an important guiding role in water resource utilization agricultural management and agricultural hydrological model construction generally speaking the soil moisture content soil saturated hydraulic conductivity soil bulk density field moisture capacity and soil porosity are important parameters reflecting soil hydraulic properties chen et al 2008 wang et al 2017 valdes abellan et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 adopted a robust micro genetic algorithm and an inverse technique for estimating soil hydraulic properties at a field scale some scholars use a direct method measurement or an indirect method empirical formula for modeling combined with multiple meteorological parameters to accurately predict evaporation ghorbani et al 2018 shamshirband et al 2020 which is of great significance for agricultural management in arid areas feki et al 2018 considered the variability of the soil water retention curve evaporation measurement and saturated hydraulic conductivity and used the fest wb model to simulate soil water these authors improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided guidance for precision irrigation zanthoxylum bungeanum hereafter zanthoxylum as a kind of calcium loving drought tolerant light loving shallow root vegetation is very suitable for growth in karst environments ai et al 2014 the planting area of zanthoxylum bungeanum in china is 1087 667 ha the total output of chinese zanthoxylum bungeanum is 380 000 tons with an output value of 14 8 billion yuan benefiting 45 million people showed on website of huajiao cn in china in the grain to green program the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum not only realized the restoration of the ecological environment but has also resulted in industrial transformation providing opportunities for the extremely poor in rural areas to become rich therefore this practice is widely promoted in karst rocky desertification control areas based on numerous recent research reports zanthoxylum bungeanum has the potential to restore severely degraded soils in the karst region of southwestern china millions of hectares of farmland in the karst region of guizhou province have been converted into zanthoxylum bungeanum plantations in order to stop and reverse rocky desertification cheng 2015 planting zanthoxylum bungeanum is beneficial for increasing nutrient content bao et al 2017 and carbon sequestration capacity zhang et al 2015 long et al 2018 in karst rocky desertification areas which effectively improves the ecological environment and increases economic benefits so it is widely promoted in rocky desertification control areas cheng et al 2017 however existing studies mainly focus on the effect of planting zanthoxylum bungeanum on soil fertility and few reports have studied the effect of planting zanthoxylum bungeanum on soil hydraulic properties does planting zanthoxylum bungeanum have the effect of soil moisture conservation in rocky desertification therefore the purpose of this study is to explore 1 the effect of planting zanthoxylum bungeanum on soil hydraulic properties in karst areas 2 the influence of soil hydraulic properties on rainfall response and supply the results of this study are helpful to guide the planting and management strategies of zanthoxylum bungeanum and can be used as a reference for ecological vegetation restoration in rocky desertification areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study area is a small catchment with an area of approximately 0 52 km2 located in the eco hydrological observation station of state engineering technology institute for karst desertification control in zhenfeng county guizhou province southwest china this area is dominated by a middle subtropical climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1052 mm mainly from may to october a mean annual temperature of 18 4 and an altitude of 400 1100 m which is a typical type of the karst plateau gorge landform the gorge landform has the function of blocking cold and wet air flow and producing foehn forming a dry and hot gorge the lithology is dolomitic limestone of the middle triassic system and the soil type is calcareous soil throughout history unreasonable farming activities significant human made destruction serious soil erosion high rock exposure rates and thin and discontinuous soil layers have resulted in severe rocky desertification the exposed rocks heat up rapidly after absorbing solar radiation which further increases the degree of dry heat in the study area in 1996 the area was established as a national demonstration area of rocky desertification control with the terracing project as the main measure to prevent and control soil erosion however the area has a high temperature high evaporation dry soil and limited water for crop growth due to water shortages the yield of zea mays l and ipomoea batatas l lam in the area is low which is difficult to ensure the survival of farmers moreover the planting of zea mays l and ipomoea batatas l lam greatly disturbs the soil destroying the soil structure and aggravating soil erosion therefore the planting of perennial species with good soil and water conservation effects as well as drought tolerance is the best way to slow down the surface evaporation and restore the ecological environment zanthoxylum bungeanum has the characteristics of drought resistance calcareous soil resistance and fast growth with a shallow taproot and many lateral roots which can prevent soil erosion cheng et al 2015 therefore scientific researchers forest managers and policy makers chose zanthoxylum bungeanum as a suitable tree species for ecological restoration of the grain to green program in beipanjiang town zhenfeng county guizhou province china generally local zanthoxylum bungeanum begins to seed approximately 3 years after cultivation zanthoxylum bungeanum enters the vigorous fruit bearing period by age 4 5 years the diameter of the base of the stem is 4 1 4 5 cm the fruit setting percentage is 30 37 and the average yield of zanthoxylum bungeanum fresh zanthoxylum bungeanum per plant is 5 7 kg the yield of zanthoxylum bungeanum reaches a peak in 10 13 years the diameter of the base of the stem is 5 6 cm the fruit setting percentage is 40 48 and the average yield of zanthoxylum bungeanum fresh zanthoxylum bungeanum is 9 13 kg per plant local farmers will prune the plants when they grows eliminating apical dominance the mean height of zanthoxylum bungeanum is 2 2 5 m and the crown is basically the same a 4 year old zanthoxylum bungeanum forest zb4 and an 11 year old zanthoxylum bungeanum forest zb11 were selected in the study area and land that had been abandoned al for 5 years was used as the reference sampling site fig 1 zhou et al 2018 found that under the condition of natural recovery in karst rocky desertification areas a herb community structure could be formed in 5 years a shrub community could be formed in 25 years and a tree community could be formed in 53 years therefore there were no shrubs or trees in the 5 year abandoned land in the study area and this area can be used as a reference sample for 4 and 11 year old zanthoxylum bungeanum forests to avoid the interaction among the three sampling sites the selected sampling sites are 30 40 m apart from each other all of which are distributed at the same elevation 713 m of terraced fields with a mean soil depth of 62 cm there was no irrigation fertilization or soil disturbance in the two zanthoxylum bungeanum fields the vegetation coverage and height of zanthoxylum bungeanum are similar 2 2 sampling and measurements we selected five zanthoxylum bungeanum trees of the same age from zb4 and zb11 before the experiment the dropped objects and weeds on the ground surface should be removed to avoid the influence of the mulch on the experimental results a five point sampling method was used in al in the five point sampling method a square quadrat is selected from the sampling plot the intersection of the square diagonal is used as the central sample and four points equidistant from the central point are selected on the diagonal as the sample the individual distribution of vegetation in the al area was uniform which conforms to the application requirements of the five point sampling method cutting rings 5 cm height and 5 cm diameter were used to repeatedly collect the 0 50 cm soil profile of each sampling site from top to bottom three times at a height of 5 cm in each layer and the soil bulk density field moisture capacity total porosity capillary porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured at 15 cm in each sampling site infiltration was measured three times by an infiltrometer mini disk infiltrometer meter group inc pullman wa usa specific measurement and calculation methods were based on dohnal et al 2010 approximately 10 15 and 20 25 cm of undisturbed soil was collected a pressure transducer tensiometer t5 meter group inc pullman wa usa and balances eu c 2002 gibertini elettronica srl mi ita were used to measure the soil tension and soil moisture every 10 min in the laboratory and the soil water characteristic curve was drawn at the same time soil samples were collected in each 5 cm layer and then divided into two sub samples after air drying one sub sample was passed through a 2 mm sieve to analyze soil particle composition using a laser particle size analyzer eyetech ankersmid group inc nijverdal dh ned the other sub sample was passed through a 0 25 mm sieve the total nitrogen tn content was determined by the kjeldahl method the total phosphorus tp content was determined by the perchloric sulfuric acid digestion method and the soil organic carbon soc content was determined by the dichromate oxidation method the test results are shown in table 1 one zanthoxylum bungeanum tree was selected in zb4 and zb11 and a soil volumetric water content sensor ech2o 5te meter group inc pullman wa usa was installed vertically at 10 25 40 and 55 cm away from a 20 cm area of the zanthoxylum bungeanum root zone the sensor was installed in the same position at the al the sensor is a capacitance sensor that takes advantage of the high permittivity of water and calculates the apparent moist soil dielectric constant or relative permittivity e the relative permittivity value for water is about 80 for air it is 1 and for mineral soils the value ranges from 3 to 7 thus a higher soil water content translates into a higher e value the volumetric soil water content hv can be calculated using the following empirical calibration equation decagon devices inc 2010 1 θ v m 3 m 3 4 3 10 6 ε 3 5 5 10 4 ε 2 2 92 10 2 ε 5 3 10 2 where θv is the volumetric soil water content measured in m3 m 3 and ε represents dielectric units obtained by dividing the sensor output by 50 soil moisture was recorded on the data logger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa every 10 min from may 12 2018 to october 3 2018 the main rainfall period in the region the weather station atmos meter group inc pullman wa usa is located less than 50 m away from the soil moisture monitoring sites and the collected data including air temperature precipitation barometer and relative humidity were recorded every 10 min 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 soil water storage sws the soil water storage was calculated using the following equation 2 s w s θ v h v where sws is the soil water storage mm θ v is the soil volumetric water content and h v is the soil layer mm in this study sws was calculated for 4 layers 0 100 100 250 250 400 and 400 550 mm 2 3 2 soil water replenishment in each rainfall event soil water replenishment yang et al 2018 was calculated using the following equation 3 δ s w s w max s w 0 where δsw is soil water replenishment at each rainfall event mm sw max is the highest value of sws after a rainfall event mm and sw 0 is the antecedent sws before a rainfall event mm 2 3 3 rainfall replenishment rate to soil water zanthoxylum bungeanum are shallow rooted plants and their main range of water absorption by roots is 0 30 cm zhou et al 2019 therefore the time when soil water began to increase at the 25 cm depth was regarded as the beginning of the effective replenishment of soil water in this study the rainfall replenishment rate to soil water yang et al 2018 was defined as the ratio of the maximum soil water replenishment volume over time from the start of the soil water content increase at a depth of 25 cm to the time when sws reached the highest value at a depth of 0 55 cm 4 v δ s w t max t 1 where v is the rainfall replenishment rate of the soil water mm h 1 t max is the time when the sws 0 55 cm reached the highest value during a rainfall event h and t 1 is the time when the soil water at a depth of 25 cm started to increase h 2 3 4 wavelet coherency analysis generally soil water has high spatiotemporal variability which is caused by different factors and processes acting together traditional correlation analysis spearman rank correlation analysis and pearson correlation analysis has been widely used in the identification of overall similarity at the measurement scale however these analyses lose information about scale and timing at different scales the factors controlling soil water are different which cannot be identified by traditional correlation analysis in addition one factor may have a different correlation across different scales and times and factors may cancel each other at the whole measurement scale biswas and si 2011 spectral analysis and spatial coherence can reveal the scale dependence of variables but only for stationary systems si 2008 the soil water sequence behavior is generally a non stationary system however wavelet coherence can deal with non stationary data series which provides an opportunity to analyze the temporal pattern of soil moisture at multiple scales wavelet coherence based on wavelet transform can solve the problem of data variability in spatial series it can be used for analysis of the correlation coefficients of two time series in the time and frequency domains and can identify the similarity of spatial patterns between two spatial series therefore it is widely used to study the correlation between soil moisture and drought variability and precipitation tang and piechota 2009 parent et al 2009 in recent years li et al 2017 and liu et al 2017 used the wavelet coherency of two temporal series of soil moisture across the soil profile to describe the depth persistence of the temporal pattern the wavelet coherence of two time series is defined as follows torrence and compo 1998 torrence and webster 1999 grinsted et al 2004 5 r n 2 s s s 1 w n x y s 2 s s 1 w n x s 2 s s 1 w n y s 2 where w n x y s is the interactive wavelet power of the time series x and y w n x s and w n y s are the wavelet transforms of time series x and y respectively and s is a smoothing operator the wtc value is 0 1 which represents the local information of the linear relationship between the two processes a detailed introduction on the theory and application cases of wavelet coherency can be found in previous studies si and zeleke 2005 salerno and tartari 2009 biswas and si 2011 li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 in this study we use the morlet wavelet transform ω 6 and wavelet coherence toolbox provided by grinsted et al 2004 and the code is available at http noc ac uk using science crosswavelet wavelet coherence the morlet wavelet analysis method used in this study is a non orthogonal complex function torrence and compo 1998 compared with the orthogonal wavelet function the non orthogonal wavelet function has many advantages first the analysis of time series based on the non orthogonal wavelet function is continuous which conforms to the continuous change in soil water over time second non orthogonal wavelet analysis can provide information on the wave amplitude and phase while orthogonal wavelet analysis cannot provide phase information furthermore non orthogonal wavelet functions are arbitrary with respect to the choice of the time scale it is worth mentioning that the wavelet function of the mexican hat wavelet analysis method is also non orthogonal although it has the advantage of separating positive and negative oscillations mexican hat wavelet analysis captures less oscillation information than the morlet wavelet analysis method of complex functions therefore the morlet wavelet analysis method was selected in this study in the significance testing for wavelet coherency the significance of the wavelet power spectrum was tested at the 95 level using the red noise of the soil property as the background spectrum si 2008 2 4 statistical analysis in this study figure drawing was conducted by origin 2017 originlab inc northampton ma usa imb spss statistics 22 ibm inc chicago il usa was used to analyze the data and spearman rank correlation test of soil moisture in different soil layers vachaud et al 1985 li et al 2017 the wavelet coherency analysis was implemented with matlab r2016a mathworks inc natick ma usa 3 results 3 1 soil hydraulic properties the mean values of soil bulk density field moisture capacity total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks among the three sites are significantly different table 1 while these values show similar changes in the soil profile distribution as a whole fig 2 among them the trends of total porosity field moisture capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity are similar the maximum value appears at 0 15 cm in the soil layer the bulk density is the opposite and the minimum value appears at 0 15 cm in the soil layer this shows that the infiltration of shallow soil is strong the difference in the soil hydraulic change in the profile is mainly reflected in the 0 20 cm soil layer the mean value of the 0 20 cm soil layer of bulk density is al 1 22 g cm 3 zb4 1 18 g cm 3 zb11 1 17 g cm 3 the field moisture capacity is zb11 32 95 zb4 32 00 al 25 71 the total porosity is al 54 93 zb11 54 63 zb4 53 11 and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is al 11 27 mm min 1 zb4 8 38 mm min 1 zb11 7 52 mm min 1 the variation in soil bulk density field moisture capacity total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity was small under 20 cm at all sites in addition we know from the field penetration test results fig 3 that the average permeability at the 0 15 cm depth in the three sample plots was al 2 70 ml zb4 2 43 ml zb11 2 18 ml indicating that al had better permeability on the soil surface therefore we studied the water holding capacity of shallow soil at 10 15 and 20 25 cm fig 4 the results showed that the soil water holding capacity of the 20 25 cm soil layer was better than that of the 10 15 cm soil layer at all sites in comparison with the increase in water potential the decrease rate for the soil water content was the fastest in the 10 15 cm and 20 25 cm soil layers at the al indicating that the al has the worst water holding capacity in contrast zb11 has the best water holding capacity 3 2 daily dynamic characteristics of soil moisture during the monitoring period the mean daily precipitation was 7 2 mm the temperature was 28 5 and the relative humidity was 92 3 table 2 with the deepening of the soil layer the soil moisture increased and the coefficient of variation decreased at al the soil moisture coefficient of variation in the 0 25 cm soil layer was higher than that in the 25 55 cm soil layer at zb4 and the soil moisture coefficient of variation in the 0 10 cm soil layer was lower than that in the 10 25 cm soil layer at zb11 fig 5 shows the soil moisture profile dynamics of the al zb4 and zb11 reflecting that there are significant differences in the daily variations in soil moisture among the three sites the soil moisture in the 0 25 cm soil layer at the al changed rapidly and the alternation of dry and wet conditions was obvious the variations in soil moisture in the 0 25 cm soil layer at zb4 were relatively stable while the variation in soil moisture in the 0 25 cm soil layer at zb11 was relatively small and the soil moisture was the highest in comparison the soil moisture of the 0 25 cm soil layer at zb11 was significantly higher than that at the al and zb4 and the retention time of soil moisture below 30 cm was longer after rainfall when the daily rainfall was more than 100 mm 110 8 mm on june 21 2018 102 8 mm on august 7 2018 the soil profile of the three sites showed a significant increase in soil moisture the results show that the daily variations in shallow soil moisture were mainly affected by precipitation and external temperature evaporation while those of deep soil moisture were mainly affected by precipitation zhu et al 2021 and wu et al 2011 also agree with this view and believe that evaporation rainfall time and rainfall are the main factors affecting soil water deficit 3 3 the response of soil moisture to rainfall events fig 6 represents the 10 min monitoring results of the sensor the deeper the soil layer is the stronger the hysteresis response of the soil moisture to rainfall at the three sites in comparison the soil moisture of the al soil profile is more sensitive to rainfall response and the variation is more obvious to clarify the rainfall response characteristics of soil moisture at different depths at the three sites we counted the data changes of soil moisture sensors for different soil layers in six typical rainfall events 30 mm according to the first increase in soil moisture sensor data after rainfall table 3 the soil moisture of the 0 10 cm soil layer at the three sites was sensitive to rainfall while the soil moisture of the 10 55 cm soil layers increased only when the mean rainfall accumulated to more than 20 mm in contrast the rainfall required for the response of soil moisture in each layer at zb11 is higher than that at the al and zb4 the mean precipitation required for the response of soil moisture in the 0 10 10 25 25 40 and 40 55 cm soil layers at zb11 increased by 45 11 5 13 5 and 12 8 compared with the al and increased by 16 9 13 0 4 9 and 6 4 compared with zb4 therefore the response of the soil moisture in the zb11 soil profile to rainfall has a strong hysteresis 3 4 the response of soil water recharge to rainfall events as shown in fig 7 the sws of the three sites is significantly different during the monitoring period and the mean value exhibits the following order zb11 16 86 mm zb4 16 04 mm al 14 07 mm and the cv exhibits the following order al 12 0 zb4 9 1 zb11 8 3 the dynamic variations in sws at al zb4 and zb11 all responded significantly to rainfall events fig 8 in the absence of rainfall events sws exhibits the following order zb11 zb4 al during rainfall events the sws of the al can be rapidly higher than that at zb4 and zb11 we analyzed the soil water replenishment and rainfall replenishment rate of soil water in the main rainfall events the relationship between soil water replenishment and precipitation was constructed by a one dimensional linear regression equation fig 9 which showed that the al zb4 and zb11 had a good linear relationship with precipitation indicating that rainfall had a direct impact on soil water replenishment in the main rainfall events the soil water replenishment and rainfall replenishment rate of soil water at the al were higher than those at zb4 and zb11 indicating that the al has the greatest advantage of rainfall replenishment efficiency for soil water table 4 3 5 wavelet coherence analysis of soil moisture at various soil depths as shown in table 5 the spearman rank correlation coefficients of soil moisture between different soil layers at the three sites were statistically significant p 0 01 indicating that the dynamic variations in the soil layers at different depths were similar during the monitoring period for the same site the correlation coefficients between two adjacent soil layers were higher but decreased with increasing soil depth for example the correlation coefficient between 0 and 10 cm and 10 25 cm at the al was 0 735 and the correlation coefficient between 0 and 10 cm and 40 55 cm was reduced to 0 607 zb4 and zb11 also show similar regularity we used a wavelet coherence analysis to study the correlation between soil moisture and precipitation at al zb4 and zb11 on different time scales according to the monitoring time series we divide the time scale into three scales including small 2 4 d medium 4 16 d and large 16 d scales as shown in fig 10 the area of significant correlation increased with the soil depth but on a small scale the correlation between soil moisture and precipitation was low in continuous rainfall events there are significant correlations at small medium and large scales for any site it is worth mentioning that the significant correlation of the three sites at the scale of 2 8 d was low from june 27 2018 to july 23 2018 which may be caused by relatively high temperatures and relatively dry soil due to fewer rainfall events during this period for example we can see from fig 5 that there were fewer rainfall events and soil water recharge was negligible during this period however high temperatures can cause sustained drought and reduced soil water storage fig 8 leading to the significant correlation between soil moisture and precipitation on the scale of 2 8 d is low during this period which is similar to our previous research li et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 effects of zanthoxylum bungeanum planting on soil hydraulic properties in this study it is indicated that planting zanthoxylum bungeanum has a significant impact on shallow soil hydraulic properties in karst areas which is also one of the main factors affecting the difference in soil moisture soil structure determines soil hydraulic properties and the vertical variations in soil moisture in the soil profile mainly depend on the vertical distribution of soil texture yang et al 2016 2019 gaur et al 2016 canton et al 2016 yang et al 2019 believed that short term soil moisture change may be more controlled by the impact of soil physical properties mainly water holding capacity rather than precipitation soil infiltration capacity is significantly related to soil porosity the smaller the soil bulk density is the higher the porosity is which is conducive to the infiltration of soil water famiglietti et al 1998 fu et al 2015a 2015b canton et al 2016 our study shows that the al zb4 and zb11 fields had strong permeability in the 0 15 cm fig 2 in karst areas the soil structure is loose the infiltration speed of soil water is fast and the phenomenon of soil preferential flow is common bonacci et al 2009 canton et al 2016 suggesting that the high content of gravel in karst soil is an important characteristic that is different from that in non karst areas gravel increases the soil surface temperature and promotes evaporation cousin et al 2003 a high gravel content is accompanied by a high infiltration capacity of soil which makes the water more likely to move to the deep layer and this phenomenon is similar to that at the al sampling site in this study according to the above permeability test results al had better permeability on the soil surface fig 3 which may be related to the relatively high sand content and relatively low clay content of al table 1 therefore compared with the zanthoxylum bungeanum fields the shallow soil of al had better permeability and poor water holding capacity fig 3 fig 4 which led to rapid changes in soil moisture in the 0 25 cm soil layer of al fig 5 compared with noncultivated soil the permeability of cultivated soil is relatively weak fu et al 2015b wang et al 2016 further explained the preferential flow characteristics of noncultivated and cultivated soil in karst areas by dye tracing experiments the results showed that the intensity of preferential flow in noncultivated regions was significantly higher than that in farmlands and preferential flow was more likely to occur on the one hand the cultivated soil is affected by root growth and human disturbance which increases the loose degree of shallow soil on the other hand the difference in physical and chemical properties between the shallow soil and the underlying soil with a stable structure limits the connectivity of infiltration hinders the preferential flow generation of the underlying soil and thus shows the enhancement of the horizontal flow permeability of the shallow soil water nie et al 2014 supported the above view and believed that plant roots only exist in loose shallow soil and develop laterally in karst areas so the impact of plant roots on soil physical properties is limited to shallow soil and not deep soil the root zone of zanthoxylum bungeanum is basically distributed in the shallow 0 30 cm soil and the growth of roots promotes an increase in capillary number and porosity in the shallow soil the amount of roots in the lower layer decreases so the soil structure is relatively dense peng et al 2007 similarly in this study we found that the changes in the soil hydraulic properties caused by the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum mainly occurred in the shallow soil 0 20 cm compared with al the average field moisture capacity of the 0 20 cm soil layers of zb4 and zb11 increased by 19 66 and 21 97 respectively and the average saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased by 34 49 and 49 87 respectively fig 2 in addition the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum increased the clay content table 1 thus reducing soil permeability as mentioned above the analysis of the soil water characteristic curve of the 10 15 cm and 20 25 cm soil layers at the three sites showed that the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum increased the soil water holding capacity fig 4 the soil water holding capacity of the 0 25 cm soil layer of zb11 was strong the soil moisture content was significantly higher than that of al and zb4 and the retention time of soil water below the 30 cm layer was longer after a rainfall event fig 5 in addition the sws at the three sites was ranked as zb11 zb4 al fig 7 and this order supports the above view therefore this study shows that with an increase in the time since planting for zanthoxylum bungeanum the bulk density of the shallow soil decreased the field moisture capacity and porosity increased the soil infiltration rate decreased and the water holding capacity of the soil increased with a positive effect on the water conservation function and an improvement in the ecological effects of soil and water 4 2 response of soil moisture to rainfall events this study found that the daily variations in shallow soil moisture were mainly affected by rainfall and external temperature while those of deep soil moisture were mainly affected by rainfall the response of soil moisture to rainfall at different depths is a complex process that is affected by rainfall intensity amount of precipitation dry interval vegetation type and soil structure he et al 2012 bodner et al 2007 ding et al 2021 previous studies have shown that the rainfall pattern of a series of small rainfall events cannot easily provide effective soil water recharge because during the period of small rainfall events more soil water will be lost due to the impact of soil evaporation and plant transpiration wythers et al 1999 he et al 2012 heavy rainfall events will provide more infiltration and less soil evaporation and the rainfall replenishment efficiency to soil water is higher schwinning and sala 2004 for example he et al 2012 showed that small rainfall events can only affect the accumulation of surface sws and the effect of a single large rainfall event on sws is better than that of a continuous small rainfall event which increases the stability time of soil moisture moreover according to yang et al 2019 when precipitation is a certain amount the soil moisture is determined by the soil water holding capacity of the corresponding soil layer as a constant determined by the soil texture rather than by the precipitation during the monitoring period of this study rainfall is frequent and the dry interval is generally less than ten days therefore rainfall intensity does not have a direct impact on the replenishment and replenishment rate of soil water rainfall directly affected soil water recharge at the three sites because of the difference in soil hydraulic properties and vegetation coverage planting zanthoxylum bungeanum has an obvious influence on the rainfall response and rainfall replenishment characteristics of soil water in this study the sampling sites are all located on terraced fields and there is basically no surface runoff so the rainfall will infiltrate vertically into the soil the sensitivity of the shallow soil moisture to rainfall events is greater than that of the lower layer heavy rainfall events can significantly increase soil moisture especially for the deep layer below 25 cm we found that the sws a zb11 was significantly higher than that at zb4 when there was no rainfall event the sws at zb4 was higher than that at zb11 when a rainfall event occurred the rainfall response rate of soil moisture and sws at the al was significantly faster than that of the zanthoxylum bungeanum fields and the longer the planting years of zanthoxylum bungeanum were the stronger the hysteresis of the rainfall response of soil moisture and sws figs 6 and 8 table 3 which was corresponded to the above mentioned soil water holding capacity characteristics in the three sites among the six main rainfall events we selected the soil water replenishment and replenishment rate to soil water at the al was the best among the three sites the soil water replenishment of the zanthoxylum bungeanum field was affected by canopy interception resulting in less soil water replenishment and longer infiltration time however at the al the low vegetation coverage promoted the infiltration capacity of precipitation and the shallow soil was more affected by evaporation so the alternation of dry and wet soil was rapid in conclusion strong permeability and evaporation led to a decrease in soil moisture in the later period at the al therefore we believe that although the al has the best infiltration and water replenishment the hydrological characteristics of karst soil will lead to wasted water infiltration and the soil cannot effectively hold water which is not conducive to water conservation this view is similar to the conclusions of our previous work li et al 2020 and supported by the conclusions of nie et al 2011 in guangxi southwest china according to the comparison of sws among the three sites we think that long term planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum improves the soil water holding capacity coupled with the influence of crown width which seems to form a cover on the soil surface effectively reducing soil evaporation vachaud et al 1985 pointed out that the variation characteristics of soil moisture can be explained by the change characteristics of soil structure when there is a close relationship between the variation in soil moisture and the determined factors such as soil structure and topography the temporal stability of soil moisture may appear zhang and berndtsson 1988 observed the variations in soil moisture for ten years and found that the evaporation and agricultural activities of the upper soil layer had a stable spatial distribution structure over time due to the similar rainfall input during the observations we found that there was a significant positive correlation between the soil moisture in each soil layer at the three sites indicating that there was temporal stability in the soil moisture during rainfall events and this stability increased with increasing soil depth table 5 in a continuous rainfall event there were significant correlations for small medium and large scales in the wavelet coherence analysis fig 10 according to gomez plaza et al 2000 when the factors affecting soil moisture were limited to geographical location and topography the soil moisture presented a relatively stable spatial distribution structure over time when vegetation factors also affect soil moisture the spatial distribution structure of soil moisture became unstable nie et al 2011 believed that although the precipitation in the rainy season is large it is accompanied by the vigorous growth of plants and a high temperature environment which makes the soil water consumption large the soil moisture loss caused by small rainfall events is more obvious due to soil evaporation and plant transpiration wythers et al 1999 therefore we think that not only does soil structure have an effect on soil water loss but zanthoxylum bungeanum of different ages also has different demands for soil water the water consumption of young zanthoxylum bungeanum in the growing period is large which accelerates soil water consumption and leads to a decrease in soil moisture 4 3 implications for future planting activities the impact of precipitation on shallow soil water in karst areas can only last for 6 11 days and most of the precipitation infiltrating the soil layer will evaporate transpire or transport downward in two weeks and dry up yang et al 2019 zanthoxylum bungeanum is a kind of shallow root and drought resistant vegetation and its water absorption by roots mainly depends on the shallow soil water serious water shortages will lead to a reduction in the yield and quality of fruit the study area is located in the plateau gorge area although the precipitation is sufficient but the temperature is high the shallow soil water evaporation loss is rapid which leads to most crops seriously lacking water the water consumption of zanthoxylum bungeanum in the growing season is large which poses a large challenge for the local zanthoxylum bungeanum growth water supply based on the above understanding we think that the irrigation strategy of local zanthoxylum bungeanum should be as follows young zanthoxylum bungeanum need a large amount of water and the soil has a strong permeability with less water frequent irrigation as the main strategy for mature and old zanthoxylum bungeanum because the soil has a strong water holding capacity more water less irrigation is the main strategy it is worth mentioning that no tillage was performed in the planting process of zanthoxylum bungeanum litter mulching improved soil physical properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing porosity liao et al 2021 the humus formed by litter accumulates in the surface soil promotes microbial activity in the root zone cheng et al 2015 bao et al 2017 increases the soil nutrient content table 1 and improves the soil structure however we need to realize that there are two risks after long time planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum the first risk is soc reduction according to long et al 2018 soc decreased more than 30 years after planting zanthoxylum bungeanum the reason is that the soil structure characteristics and hydrothermal conditions in karst mountain areas accelerate the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic matter once zanthoxylum bungeanum reaches its peak production period a large amount of soil organic matter is required to maintain its growth thus accelerating the consumption of soil organic matter zhang et al 2015 the second risk is the possibility of soil compaction due to the geomorphic and climatic characteristics in the study area the dry and wet alternation of the surface soil in the rainy season is rapid and the high temperature makes the surface water evaporate rapidly the soil becomes drier and the soil compaction in the surface soil becomes obvious hamza et al 2005 in addition long term monoculture can cause continuous cropping obstacles and allelopathy of zanthoxylum bungeanum roots can accelerate soil compaction the karst ecological environment is more suitable for planting zanthoxylum bungeanum which can be used as an important way to restore the karst soil ecological environment however if the planting method is singular the management is poor and the cultivation measures are unreasonable the development of the local zanthoxylum bungeanum industry and the land productivity will be adversely affected therefore the improvement of planting management technology is very important for sustainable agricultural development based on the local environmental conditions we believe that adopting agroforestry planting rotation or intercropping is a relatively effective method that helps to improve the hydraulic properties of soil and increase soil nutrients which has been confirmed in relevant studies akdemir et al 2016 yin et al 2020 in the next step we should study the effect of the agroforestry planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum on the soil hydraulic properties in addition we should also pay attention to the relationship between the soil hydraulic properties and the water use efficiency of zanthoxylum bungeanum at different tree ages 5 conclusions the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum had a significant effect on the shallow soil hydraulic properties zanthoxylum bungeanum reduced the shallow soil bulk density increased the field moisture capacity porosity and soil moisture and enhanced the soil water holding capacity soil water remained in the lower layer below 30 cm for a relatively long time after rainfall which played a positive role in the water conservation function due to differences in soil hydraulic properties root systems and vegetation coverage the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum had a significant impact on the rainfall response and rainfall replenishment of soil water in general the dynamic variations in shallow soil water were mainly affected by precipitation and atmospheric temperature evaporation leading to rapid dry and wet changes while deep soil water was mainly affected by precipitation recharge and the retention time was longer in terms of rainfall response rates the planting of zanthoxylum bungeanum increased the response hysteresis of soil moisture to rainfall and enhanced the sws and stability therefore we suggest that young zanthoxylum bungeanum should be subjected to less water frequent irrigation as the main irrigation strategy for mature and old zanthoxylum bungeanum the main strategy should be more water less irrigation however this work did not observe zanthoxylum bungeanum in multiple different years which has some limitations the next study needs to pay attention to the relationship between the soil hydraulic properties and the water use efficiency of zanthoxylum bungeanum at different ages declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9894,available soil water is considered the most important water resource for food production in agricultural ecosystems and sustainable vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid regions compared to soil water content plant available soil water storage asws directly indicates the amount of soil water that can be used by plants understanding the spatial characteristics and controlling factors of asws can aid in improving the ability of the agricultural ecosystem to resist extreme natural disasters and stabilise grain production in china in this study asws in the 0 5 0 m profile was measured in an area of approximately 36 9 104 km2 in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin the total asws in the 0 5 0 m profile of the study area was 113 1010 m3 85 of which was stored in the 450 mm rainfall zones the spatial variation in asws was mainly controlled by climate and edaphic properties of the 0 1 0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone regarding the 1 0 5 0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone edaphic properties were the dominant factors determining the spatial characteristics of asws based on the spatial characteristics of asws the shallow soil water 0 1 0 m in the middle region and deep soil moisture 1 0 5 0 m in the southern region of the study area can support the rational use of soil water in agricultural and vegetation restoration activities large scale revegetation activities using trees or shrubs might not be the optimal choice in regions with mean annual precipitation 450 mm knowledge of the spatial characteristics and contributions of the asws

campaigns including the grain for green program have been initiated by the chinese government since the 1990s jia et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 it is widely reported that soil water storage in both the top and deep soil layers generally decreases due to enhanced evapotranspiration after planting exotic deep root species such as robinia pseudoacacia caragana korshinskii and medicago sativa li and huang 2008 a decrease in soil water content could jeopardise the sustainability of fragile ecosystems for example some 30 year old forest trees grow only to approximately 20 of their normal height due to prolonged soil drought jia et al 2017 the rational use of soil water resources the most important water resources for plant growth and ecosystem health in the region for sustaining ecosystems is increasingly becoming a concern in science and government practice gao et al 2011 spatiotemporal variations in soil water content and the related driving factors have been extensively studied at the

regional scale are determined by combined effects of climate soil topography and vegetation wang et al 2012b zhao et al 2019b as it is time consuming and laborious intensive to obtain asws earlier studies have predominantly focused on the spatiotemporal variations in soil water content at various scales while the availability of soil water has often been overlooked bosch et al 2006 zehe et al 2010 cho and choi 2014 although soil water content can reflect the water conditions of soil the role of asws in agricultural regionalisation vegetation restoration and sustainable soil water management is irreplaceable asws is spatially and temporally highly variable depending on the soil properties climate and topographic factors and hydrological and evapotranspiration processes aller et al 2017 jia et al 2020 in middle reaches of the yellow river basin a comprehensive understanding of the spatial characteristics and main controlling factors of asws are extremely important because of the limited water resources thus the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial asws distribution across the middle reaches of the yellow river basin 2 quantify asws within different soil layers and rainfall zones and 3 determine the factors that control the regional asws spatial patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted across the middle reaches of the yellow river basin fig 1 which is located in northwest china and covers a total area of 36 9 104 km2 this region is dominated by a continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation map ranges between 150 mm in the northwest and 800 mm in the southeast approximately 55 78 of which occurs between june and september the mean annual temperature mat ranges between 14 3 c in the southeast and 3 6 c in the northwest based on the 1951 2016 data from 64 stations the soils are mainly derived from loess and are sandy in texture in the northwest and more clayey in the southeast the main geomorphic landforms of the region are yuan a large flat surface with little or no erosion ridges hills and various gullies jia et al 2020 the type of lu generally changed from cropland to forest and subsequently to grassland from the southeast to the northwest of the study area non native species such as robinia pseudoacacia pinus tabuliformis caragana korshinskii armeniaca sibirica hippophae rhamnoides and medicago sativa have been widely introduced in the study area wang et al 2012b 2 2 field sampling and data collection to obtain soil water data and accurately determine asws spatial variations in the study area we devised an intensive soil sampling strategy before field sampling the gis software was used to load a 40 40 km grid on a digital topographic map as a basic guide for relatively frequent sampling the road transportation system was subsequently used to select the sampling routes across the region the interval between two adjacent sites was thus designed to be approximately 40 km in the field the actual sampling sites were randomly selected to represent the main lus and topographical features within the range of sight for grids with complex surface landscapes and geomorphology the sampling distance was reduced by half to include at least one additional site for better representation all sampling areas were at least 200 m away from the roads to reduce their impact on the collected data a total of 243 sampling sites across the study area were investigated between june and october 2013 fig 1 a global positioning system gps receiver garmin etrex 30 was used to identify the latitude longitude and elevation ele of each site the slope gradient sg and aspect sa of each site were measured using a geological compass lus were divided into cropland grassland and forest there were 46 88 and 109 sites of cropland grassland and forest respectively previous studies have shown that land use greatly controls soil water variations at a regional scale yao et al 2012 wang et al 2017 to analyse the correlation between asws and lu typical ordinal categorical variables were used lu was represented by three ordinal numerically coded variables 1 cropland 2 grassland and 3 forest zhao et al 2017 for the cropland in the study no irrigation was applied and precipitation was the only source of soil water at each site disturbed soil samples from different soil layers 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 and 4 0 5 0 m were collected using a soil auger 5 cm in diameter subsequently one aluminium neutron probe access tube 5 2 m in depth was installed the disturbed soil samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm mesh sieve to measure the soil particle size clay content clay silt content silt sand content sand distribution using laser diffraction mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments to determine the soil water retention curve saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks and bulk density bd another 40 cm deep pit was excavated to obtain intact soil cores at 0 5 10 15 and 30 35 cm soil layers using metal cylinders 5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length the ks was determined using the constant head method subsequently bd was determined from the volume dry mass relationship for each core sample the soil water content at the wilting point i e volumetric soil water content at 1 5 mpa was derived from the soil water retention curve to obtain the dataset of volumetric soil water content neutron counts were taken at 0 2 m intervals until 5 0 m depth at all 243 sites between may and june 2015 and the calibration curve was given as 1 θ 0 5891 cr 0 0089 r2 0 93 p 0 001 where θ cm3 cm 3 is the volumetric soil water content and cr is the slow neutron count rate in the study a polyethylene surface tray 30 cm in diameter and 4 cm in thickness was used when probe measurements were made near the surface 0 0 2 m based on the results of previous studies the precipitation infiltration depth in the study area is generally shallower than 1 m and the average coefficient of variation in soil water was only 10 for the deep soil layer 1 0 5 0 m wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2019a thus only one time soil water measurements were conducted in the current study the asws is calculated using the following equation 2 asws i sws i sws wp where aswsi is the asws at depth i swsi is the measured soil water storage at depth i and swswp is the soil water storage at the wilting point the aswsi was considered to be equal to zero when swsi was less than swswp the asws in each pixel was assigned according to the data surface using arcgis 10 2 the total asws in the 0 5 0 m profile across the study area was calculated by summing the asws in each pixel the mean annual climate data such as map and mat from 1951 to 2016 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing system http data cma cn which included data from 64 meteorological stations in the study area we interpolated the station specific data using the ordinary kriging method at 100 100 m2 resolution to create a continuous data surface for these climate parameters re sampling was conducted using arcgis 10 2 to extract the specific climate factors for each sampling site the study area was divided into three rainfall zones based on map that is 450 450 550 and 550 mm rainfall zones to examine the spatial variations of asws among different rainfall zones 2 3 statistical analysis descriptive statistics including the mean minimum maximum standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv of asws in diverse soil layers were calculated using matlab version r2015a skewness kurtosis and kolmogorov smirnov tests were used to examine the normality of the data and the non normally distributed data were log transformed structural equation modelling sem was performed using ibm spss amos 21 the goodness of fit was assessed using chi square tests χ2 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea rose et al 2019 a non significant χ2 value p 0 05 where there is no significant difference between the observed and expected covariance matrices and rmsea lower than 0 1 were used to indicated good model fit 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial asws characteristics the asws in the 0 5 0 m soil layer ranged between 0 and 1110 4 mm with a mean of 305 7 mm table 1 the mean asws followed a decreasing order of 448 9 362 4 and 141 7 mm for the 550 450 550 and 450 mm rainfall zones respectively indicating a close relationship between asws and precipitation at the regional scale which is in agreement with earlier studies in this region jin et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 the asws dataset from the 243 sampling sites was interpolated via the ordinary kriging method at a resolution of 1 km2 to create a continuous asws data surface available soil water resources stored in the 0 5 0 m soil layer reached 113 1010 m3 across the study area while the asws accounted for approximately 28 5 45 8 and 48 8 of the total soil water storage in the 450 450 550 and 550 mm rainfall zones respectively fig 2 the mean values of asws in the 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 and 4 0 5 0 m layers were 69 2 65 3 57 6 58 3 and 59 9 mm respectively table 1 asws in the 0 1 0 m soil layer was significantly higher p 0 05 than that in deeper soil layers possibly due to the combined effects of rainwater infiltration upward water movement and deep soil water absorption by roots zhao et al 2019b the infiltration of rainwater was mostly limited to the upper 1 0 m soil layer in the study area in both normal and wet years hu et al 2010 after a long period of excessive depletion of soil water by plant evapotranspiration and scarce precipitation recharge the asws in the deeper soil layers 1 0 5 0 m remained at a lower level than that in the upper soil layer 0 1 0 m jia et al 2020 zhao et al 2019b dried soil layers were formed for the same reason and this is a common phenomenon in northwest china wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2020 based on the vertical asws characteristics in the 0 5 0 m profile two soil layers were thus defined for further analysis a shallow 0 1 0 m and a deep 1 0 5 0 m soil layers the gradient of spatial asws variation generally increased with increasing soil depth in the 0 4 0 m soil layer while it decreased thereafter until a 5 0 m soil depth table 1 this trend was characteristic of asws in different rainfall zones and across the entire study area except in the 550 mm zone where the cv in the 0 5 0 m soil layer 51 8 was lower with no obvious trend table 1 studies have shown that under certain water conditions precipitation can lead to decreased spatial soil moisture heterogeneity teuling et al 2007 vereecken et al 2007 for regions with relatively low soil water content the effects of topography soil texture and plants on soil water distribution were diminished with an increase in precipitation vereecken et al 2007 vivoni et al 2010 teuling and troch 2005 for example plants take up water from the soil thereby reducing the soil water content compared to that in the surrounding soils the spatial variability in soil water content may thus increase for the spatial variation in plant root distribution however in regions with increased precipitation water absorbed by plant roots can be replenished soon from the still wet adjacent soil rosenbaum et al 2012 western et al 2004 3 2 application and validation of structural equation modelling fig 3 shows the pearson correlation coefficients between asws and selected parameters for the 0 5 0 m soil layers among the 11 environmental parameters clay silt sand ks bd map mat ele sg sa and lu sand mat and ks conformed to a normal distribution after logarithmic transformation for the 0 5 0 m soil layer asws was positively correlated p 0 01 with clay and silt bd map and mat and negatively correlated p 0 01 with sand ks ele and sg generally there is a significant correlation between clay silt and sand wang et al 2010 and when analysing the relationship between soil texture and other soil physical and or chemical properties only one or two of the three types of particles are usually included zhao et al 2019b in this study clay was the most correlated with the asws thus silt and sand were not included in the sem because of their close correlations with clay fig 3 the correlation between ks and asws was weaker 0 01 p 0 05 hence it was also excluded from further analysis although the selected parameters exhibited significant positive or negative correlations with asws the interactions among parameters were better supported in the sem model than in the pearson correlation analyses a statistical summary of the parameters included in the sem model is presented in table 2 table 3 provides details of the goodness of fit parameters of the models for each soil layer and rainfall zone 3 3 paths and contributions of factors affecting asws the direct or indirect paths and their contribution coefficients to the factors affecting asws are presented in fig 4 asws is affected by a changing and interacting set of climate geographic plant and edaphic properties the results showed that clay bd map and lu directly affect asws and lu map mat ele and sg indirectly affect asws clay bd and map positively affected asws p 0 01 whereas lu negatively affected asws p 0 01 in the 0 5 0 m soil layer fig 4 the sem results indicated that edaphic property was an important factor that directly controlled asws in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin soil texture and bd are critical parameters of the spatial soil water patterns at both small and large scales fang et al 2016 wang et al 2010 fields with increased clay have increased soil capillary porosity the dominant pores holding soil water and therefore increased asws zare et al 2021 both pearson correlation and sem analysis confirmed the significant positive relationship between bd and asws while sem analysis revealed that asws could be directly affected by bd figs 3 and 4 this is because bd is closely related to soil texture and generally larger in areas with increased sand li et al 2019 wang et al 2012b for example coarse textured soil has a lower water potential than the fine textured soil with the same water content volumetric water content and facilitates soil water absorption by plant roots thus improving soil water availability jia et al 2020 santra et al 2018 precipitation in the region is the only source of soil water as groundwater levels are generally 30 100 m below the land surface turkeltaub et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 thus map exhibited a direct positive effect on asws fig 4 in the middle reaches of the yellow river where the loss deposit is thick soil water hardly percolates to the groundwater and evapotranspiration is the dominant method of soil water consumption li and huang 2008 in the cropland of the study area agricultural practices could interrupt the capillary soil pores and reduce water loss by evaporation wang et al 2010 according to an earlier study daily water loss in cropland from july to august by evapotranspiration was only 1 mm which was only half as much water that is lost in forest and grassland wang et al 2012a therefore asws under different lus followed the order of cropland forest grassland and lu exhibited a negative effect on asws p 0 01 fig 4 3 4 contribution change of main factors with soil depth and rainfall zone the paths and contributions of climate geography plant and edaphic properties of asws varied among different soil depths and rainfall zones figs 5 and 6 for different soil layers the contribution of map decreased with increasing soil depth r 0 34 and 0 19 in the 0 1 0 and 1 0 5 0 m soil layers respectively fig 5 the contribution of clay and bd to asws was positive however it increased with increasing soil depth the precipitation infiltration depth in the study area was generally shallower than 1 0 m especially in dry years wang et al 2010 thus the upper soil layer was the main site of precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration when the conditions were permissible as a result water in the deep soil layer 1 0 5 0 m was insulated by the upper soil layer 0 1 0 m and was not as sensitive to changes in climate choi and jacobs 2007 hu et al 2010 zhao et al 2019b contrary to the case in the upper layers lu exhibited a significant direct effect on asws in the deep layers likely due to differences in root distributions and water uptake in cropland forest and grassland areas fang et al 2016 jia and shao 2014 wheat is widely grown in the cropland of the yellow river basin and has a shallow rooting depth usually less than 1 m compared with the root distribution of annual crops in the cropland the root distribution of plants in the grassland and forest was deeper it has previously been reported that grass roots e g medicago sativa could use soil water found as deep as 3 0 m while the depth of soil water accessible by trees e g robinia pseudoacacia was in some cases twice as deep as that of grass wang et al 2010 for different rainfall zones the paths and number of factors controlling asws were the lowest and map r 0 57 was the dominant factor controlling asws in the 450 mm rainfall zone fig 6 with increasing precipitation the effect of clay and lu on asws strengthened while the effect of map on asws faded in the area with map 550 mm map exhibited a negative contribution to asws r 0 27 fig 6 in the 450 mm rainfall zone vegetation coverage was low and the terrain was relatively gentle wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 thus lu and sg hardly affected the asws variation and distribution in the 450 mm rainfall zone as map increased to 450 550 mm the amount of precipitation was adequate for infiltration and was no longer the main limiting factor for soil moisture laio et al 2001 teuling et al 2007 under these circumstances the influence of edaphic factors on water redistribution and plant soil water uptake as well as the subsequent transpiration determines the asws teuling and troch 2005 turkeltaub et al 2018 the antagonistic effects of map on asws in the 450 and 550 mm rainfall zones could be attributed to the strong effect of clay on asws and reverse distribution trends between clay and map excessive precipitation leads to runoff and deep migration of fine particles in the surface layer zehe et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 demonstrated that the spatial map distribution is negatively correlated with clay therefore as map increases the effect of precipitation on the asws is masked by the water redistribution dominated by edaphic properties 3 5 implications for soil water management and agricultural regionalisation strategies as one of the cradles of east asian agriculture the middle reaches of the yellow river constitute an important grain producing area with a long history of crop cultivation kuzmin et al 2009 wang et al 2018 recent studies however have shown that the barycentre of grain production in china has moved northward and crossed the yellow river wang et al 2018 seed and fertiliser quality did not increase in the same way grain output increased therefore the only possible cause of grain output doubling in the yellow river basin is the expansion of cropland zheng et al 2021 however owing to the poor natural conditions and fragile ecosystems in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin any small mistakes during land reclamation may put china s vulnerable grain output at risk especially when considering exposure to natural disasters guo et al 2006 yu et al 2018 in this context rational agricultural regionalisation and lu reform based on asws are essential for stabilising china s grain production and maintaining food security the root system of the crop is mainly distributed within the first metre of soil therefore the asws in the 0 1 0 m soil layer which is controlled by climate factors is crucial for grain production li et al 2019 in the mid section of the middle reaches of the yellow river the 0 1 0 m soil layer had higher levels of asws 90 mm and received sufficient levels of rainfall approximately 450 550 mm for appropriately land reclamation table 1 in areas with higher clay in the southern part of the study area the asws in the deep soil layer 1 0 5 0 m was mainly controlled by edaphic and climate factors fig 5 therefore the rational use of deep soil moisture 1 0 5 0 m in agricultural activities can be supported among the different rainfall zones asws in the 550 mm zone was mainly affected by edaphic factors fig 6 from the perspective of soil moisture to ensure the stability of food production and improve the ability of the agricultural ecosystem to endure extreme natural disasters land reclamation in areas with coarser textured soil was not recommended asws is one of the most important indicators that needs to be considered in agricultural regionalisation other agricultural natural resources socio economic and agricultural production characteristics of the region were also indispensable additionally vegetation construction in the middle reaches of the yellow river should acknowledge the spatial distribution characteristics and asws controlling factors jia et al 2017 estimated the regional net soil water losses in the forest and found that soil water in the 1 0 5 0 m profile generally decreased at a rate of 8 5 15 5 and 19 7 mm yr 1 in the 450 450 550 and 550 mm rainfall zones respectively based on the spatial asws distribution in this study table 1 converting the lu to forest will deplete the asws in the 1 0 5 0 m profile in 12 18 and 19 years for the three rainfall zones the depleted soil moisture below 1 m will be difficult to replenish by rainfall even in normal or wet year in the study area li and huang 2008 appropriate forest management practices such as thinning should thus be required regarding 12 to 19 year old stands to maintain a balance in soil water availability and water use by plants from the perspective of soil water management and vegetation sustainability large scale revegetation activities with trees or shrubs might not be the optimal solution for vegetation restoration in regions with map 450 mm in the middle reaches of the yellow river jia and shao 2014 according to the spatial asws and precipitation conditions optimal plant density or biomass can be determined using water balance models or soil water carrying capacity for vegetation models to guide revegetation strategies in the middle reaches of the yellow river fu et al 2012 jia et al 2019 4 conclusions across the middle reaches of the yellow river the mean asws in the upper 5 0 m soil layer was 305 7 mm and followed a decreasing order of 448 9 362 4 and 141 7 mm for the 550 450 550 and 450 mm rainfall zones respectively asws generally decreased from southeast to northwest of the basin with 85 of the total asws stored in the 450 mm rainfall zone the spatial asws variation was mainly controlled by climate and edaphic properties for the 0 1 0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone for the 1 0 5 0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone edaphic properties were the dominant factors that determined the spatial asws characteristics in the mid section of the middle reaches of the yellow river basin the 0 1 0 m soil layer received sufficient rainfall and had high levels of asws the rational use of deep soil moisture 1 0 5 0 m in agricultural and vegetation restoration activities can be supported in areas with high soil clay content in the

9894,available soil water is considered the most important water resource for food production in agricultural ecosystems and sustainable vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid regions compared to soil water content plant available soil water storage asws directly indicates the amount of soil water that can be used by plants understanding the spatial characteristics and controlling factors of asws can aid in improving the ability of the agricultural ecosystem to resist extreme natural disasters and stabilise grain production in china in this study asws in the 0 5 0 m profile was measured in an area of approximately 36 9 104 km2 in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin the total asws in the 0 5 0 m profile of the study area was 113 1010 m3 85 of which was stored in the 450 mm rainfall zones the spatial variation in asws was mainly controlled by climate and edaphic properties of the 0 1 0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone regarding the 1 0 5 0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone edaphic properties were the dominant factors determining the spatial characteristics of asws based on the spatial characteristics of asws the shallow soil water 0 1 0 m in the middle region and deep soil moisture 1 0 5 0 m in the southern region of the study area can support the rational use of soil water in agricultural and vegetation restoration activities large scale revegetation activities using trees or shrubs might not be the optimal choice in regions with mean annual precipitation 450 mm knowledge of the spatial characteristics and contributions of the asws controlling factors is indispensable for reasonable agricultural regionalisation and vegetation restoration as well as for an invulnerable and stable grain output system keywords plant available soil water water management structural equation modelling yellow river basin 1 introduction soil water availability is essential in ensuring grain production stability and the sustainability of restored ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions gao et al 2011 gouveia et al 2017 agriculture manages more water than any other sector globally accounting for over 70 of the world s freshwater consumption penna et al 2020 currently many of the world s intensive agricultural production areas are facing water scarcity diffenbaugh et al 2015 zhuang et al 2018 although soil water represents only a small fraction of the world s available freshwater resources mccoll et al 2017 it is the central junction of the water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and a direct water source for most crops otkin et al 2016 the term plant available soil water generally refers to the water between the permanent wilting point and field capacity it is equivalent to the amount of stored water useful to plants zare et al 2021 compared with soil water content plant available soil water storage asws is a primary regulator of ecohydrological processes and has wide practical applications in agricultural water management aller et al 2017 regarding agricultural regionalisation asws is also pivotal for evaluating the potential impacts of land use lu changes on local and regional water balances and water resource management laio et al 2001 seyfried and wilcox 2006 the middle reaches of the yellow river basin constitute an important grain producing area in china and are well known for the presence of thick loess deposits and severe soil erosion to control soil erosion reconvert croplands to forests shrubs and grass and improve ecosystem services in the region several vegetation restoration campaigns including the grain for green program have been initiated by the chinese government since the 1990s jia et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 it is widely reported that soil water storage in both the top and deep soil layers generally decreases due to enhanced evapotranspiration after planting exotic deep root species such as robinia pseudoacacia caragana korshinskii and medicago sativa li and huang 2008 a decrease in soil water content could jeopardise the sustainability of fragile ecosystems for example some 30 year old forest trees grow only to approximately 20 of their normal height due to prolonged soil drought jia et al 2017 the rational use of soil water resources the most important water resources for plant growth and ecosystem health in the region for sustaining ecosystems is increasingly becoming a concern in science and government practice gao et al 2011 spatiotemporal variations in soil water content and the related driving factors have been extensively studied at the plot jia and shao 2014 liu and shao 2014 slope fu et al 2012 jia and shao 2014 watershed fang et al 2016 fu et al 2003 and regional wang et al 2012b zhao et al 2017 scales for example jia and shao 2014 reported that the dynamics of deep soil water at the plot scale are driven by variations in vegetation type at the hillslope scale spatial soil water variations increase with increasing soil depth spatial variations in soil water content at the watershed scale are mainly controlled by soil texture elevation and type of lu hu et al 2010 yu et al 2018 soil water content variations at the regional scale are determined by combined effects of climate soil topography and vegetation wang et al 2012b zhao et al 2019b as it is time consuming and laborious intensive to obtain asws earlier studies have predominantly focused on the spatiotemporal variations in soil water content at various scales while the availability of soil water has often been overlooked bosch et al 2006 zehe et al 2010 cho and choi 2014 although soil water content can reflect the water conditions of soil the role of asws in agricultural regionalisation vegetation restoration and sustainable soil water management is irreplaceable asws is spatially and temporally highly variable depending on the soil properties climate and topographic factors and hydrological and evapotranspiration processes aller et al 2017 jia et al 2020 in middle reaches of the yellow river basin a comprehensive understanding of the spatial characteristics and main controlling factors of asws are extremely important because of the limited water resources thus the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the spatial asws distribution across the middle reaches of the yellow river basin 2 quantify asws within different soil layers and rainfall zones and 3 determine the factors that control the regional asws spatial patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted across the middle reaches of the yellow river basin fig 1 which is located in northwest china and covers a total area of 36 9 104 km2 this region is dominated by a continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation map ranges between 150 mm in the northwest and 800 mm in the southeast approximately 55 78 of which occurs between june and september the mean annual temperature mat ranges between 14 3 c in the southeast and 3 6 c in the northwest based on the 1951 2016 data from 64 stations the soils are mainly derived from loess and are sandy in texture in the northwest and more clayey in the southeast the main geomorphic landforms of the region are yuan a large flat surface with little or no erosion ridges hills and various gullies jia et al 2020 the type of lu generally changed from cropland to forest and subsequently to grassland from the southeast to the northwest of the study area non native species such as robinia pseudoacacia pinus tabuliformis caragana korshinskii armeniaca sibirica hippophae rhamnoides and medicago sativa have been widely introduced in the study area wang et al 2012b 2 2 field sampling and data collection to obtain soil water data and accurately determine asws spatial variations in the study area we devised an intensive soil sampling strategy before field sampling the gis software was used to load a 40 40 km grid on a digital topographic map as a basic guide for relatively frequent sampling the road transportation system was subsequently used to select the sampling routes across the region the interval between two adjacent sites was thus designed to be approximately 40 km in the field the actual sampling sites were randomly selected to represent the main lus and topographical features within the range of sight for grids with complex surface landscapes and geomorphology the sampling distance was reduced by half to include at least one additional site for better representation all sampling areas were at least 200 m away from the roads to reduce their impact on the collected data a total of 243 sampling sites across the study area were investigated between june and october 2013 fig 1 a global positioning system gps receiver garmin etrex 30 was used to identify the latitude longitude and elevation ele of each site the slope gradient sg and aspect sa of each site were measured using a geological compass lus were divided into cropland grassland and forest there were 46 88 and 109 sites of cropland grassland and forest respectively previous studies have shown that land use greatly controls soil water variations at a regional scale yao et al 2012 wang et al 2017 to analyse the correlation between asws and lu typical ordinal categorical variables were used lu was represented by three ordinal numerically coded variables 1 cropland 2 grassland and 3 forest zhao et al 2017 for the cropland in the study no irrigation was applied and precipitation was the only source of soil water at each site disturbed soil samples from different soil layers 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 1 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 and 4 0 5 0 m were collected using a soil auger 5 cm in diameter subsequently one aluminium neutron probe access tube 5 2 m in depth was installed the disturbed soil samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm mesh sieve to measure the soil particle size clay content clay silt content silt sand content sand distribution using laser diffraction mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments to determine the soil water retention curve saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks and bulk density bd another 40 cm deep pit was excavated to obtain intact soil cores at 0 5 10 15 and 30 35 cm soil layers using metal cylinders 5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length the ks was determined using the constant head method subsequently bd was determined from the volume dry mass relationship for each core sample the soil water content at the wilting point i e volumetric soil water content at 1 5 mpa was derived from the soil water retention curve to obtain the dataset of volumetric soil water content neutron counts were taken at 0 2 m intervals until 5 0 m depth at all 243 sites between may and june 2015 and the calibration curve was given as 1 θ 0 5891 cr 0 0089 r2 0 93 p 0 001 where θ cm3 cm 3 is the volumetric soil water content and cr is the slow neutron count rate in the study a polyethylene surface tray 30 cm in diameter and 4 cm in thickness was used when probe measurements were made near the surface 0 0 2 m based on the results of previous studies the precipitation infiltration depth in the study area is generally shallower than 1 m and the average coefficient of variation in soil water was only 10 for the deep soil layer 1 0 5 0 m wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2019a thus only one time soil water measurements were conducted in the current study the asws is calculated using the following equation 2 asws i sws i sws wp where aswsi is the asws at depth i swsi is the measured soil water storage at depth i and swswp is the soil water storage at the wilting point the aswsi was considered to be equal to zero when swsi was less than swswp the asws in each pixel was assigned according to the data surface using arcgis 10 2 the total asws in the 0 5 0 m profile across the study area was calculated by summing the asws in each pixel the mean annual climate data such as map and mat from 1951 to 2016 were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing system http data cma cn which included data from 64 meteorological stations in the study area we interpolated the station specific data using the ordinary kriging method at 100 100 m2 resolution to create a continuous data surface for these climate parameters re sampling was conducted using arcgis 10 2 to extract the specific climate factors for each sampling site the study area was divided into three rainfall zones based on map that is 450 450 550 and 550 mm rainfall zones to examine the spatial variations of asws among different rainfall zones 2 3 statistical analysis descriptive statistics including the mean minimum maximum standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv of asws in diverse soil layers were calculated using matlab version r2015a skewness kurtosis and kolmogorov smirnov tests were used to examine the normality of the data and the non normally distributed data were log transformed structural equation modelling sem was performed using ibm spss amos 21 the goodness of fit was assessed using chi square tests χ2 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea rose et al 2019 a non significant χ2 value p 0 05 where there is no significant difference between the observed and expected covariance matrices and rmsea lower than 0 1 were used to indicated good model fit 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial asws characteristics the asws in the 0 5 0 m soil layer ranged between 0 and 1110 4 mm with a mean of 305 7 mm table 1 the mean asws followed a decreasing order of 448 9 362 4 and 141 7 mm for the 550 450 550 and 450 mm rainfall zones respectively indicating a close relationship between asws and precipitation at the regional scale which is in agreement with earlier studies in this region jin et al 2011 zhao et al 2017 the asws dataset from the 243 sampling sites was interpolated via the ordinary kriging method at a resolution of 1 km2 to create a continuous asws data surface available soil water resources stored in the 0 5 0 m soil layer reached 113 1010 m3 across the study area while the asws accounted for approximately 28 5 45 8 and 48 8 of the total soil water storage in the 450 450 550 and 550 mm rainfall zones respectively fig 2 the mean values of asws in the 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 and 4 0 5 0 m layers were 69 2 65 3 57 6 58 3 and 59 9 mm respectively table 1 asws in the 0 1 0 m soil layer was significantly higher p 0 05 than that in deeper soil layers possibly due to the combined effects of rainwater infiltration upward water movement and deep soil water absorption by roots zhao et al 2019b the infiltration of rainwater was mostly limited to the upper 1 0 m soil layer in the study area in both normal and wet years hu et al 2010 after a long period of excessive depletion of soil water by plant evapotranspiration and scarce precipitation recharge the asws in the deeper soil layers 1 0 5 0 m remained at a lower level than that in the upper soil layer 0 1 0 m jia et al 2020 zhao et al 2019b dried soil layers were formed for the same reason and this is a common phenomenon in northwest china wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2020 based on the vertical asws characteristics in the 0 5 0 m profile two soil layers were thus defined for further analysis a shallow 0 1 0 m and a deep 1 0 5 0 m soil layers the gradient of spatial asws variation generally increased with increasing soil depth in the 0 4 0 m soil layer while it decreased thereafter until a 5 0 m soil depth table 1 this trend was characteristic of asws in different rainfall zones and across the entire study area except in the 550 mm zone where the cv in the 0 5 0 m soil layer 51 8 was lower with no obvious trend table 1 studies have shown that under certain water conditions precipitation can lead to decreased spatial soil moisture heterogeneity teuling et al 2007 vereecken et al 2007 for regions with relatively low soil water content the effects of topography soil texture and plants on soil water distribution were diminished with an increase in precipitation vereecken et al 2007 vivoni et al 2010 teuling and troch 2005 for example plants take up water from the soil thereby reducing the soil water content compared to that in the surrounding soils the spatial variability in soil water content may thus increase for the spatial variation in plant root distribution however in regions with increased precipitation water absorbed by plant roots can be replenished soon from the still wet adjacent soil rosenbaum et al 2012 western et al 2004 3 2 application and validation of structural equation modelling fig 3 shows the pearson correlation coefficients between asws and selected parameters for the 0 5 0 m soil layers among the 11 environmental parameters clay silt sand ks bd map mat ele sg sa and lu sand mat and ks conformed to a normal distribution after logarithmic transformation for the 0 5 0 m soil layer asws was positively correlated p 0 01 with clay and silt bd map and mat and negatively correlated p 0 01 with sand ks ele and sg generally there is a significant correlation between clay silt and sand wang et al 2010 and when analysing the relationship between soil texture and other soil physical and or chemical properties only one or two of the three types of particles are usually included zhao et al 2019b in this study clay was the most correlated with the asws thus silt and sand were not included in the sem because of their close correlations with clay fig 3 the correlation between ks and asws was weaker 0 01 p 0 05 hence it was also excluded from further analysis although the selected parameters exhibited significant positive or negative correlations with asws the interactions among parameters were better supported in the sem model than in the pearson correlation analyses a statistical summary of the parameters included in the sem model is presented in table 2 table 3 provides details of the goodness of fit parameters of the models for each soil layer and rainfall zone 3 3 paths and contributions of factors affecting asws the direct or indirect paths and their contribution coefficients to the factors affecting asws are presented in fig 4 asws is affected by a changing and interacting set of climate geographic plant and edaphic properties the results showed that clay bd map and lu directly affect asws and lu map mat ele and sg indirectly affect asws clay bd and map positively affected asws p 0 01 whereas lu negatively affected asws p 0 01 in the 0 5 0 m soil layer fig 4 the sem results indicated that edaphic property was an important factor that directly controlled asws in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin soil texture and bd are critical parameters of the spatial soil water patterns at both small and large scales fang et al 2016 wang et al 2010 fields with increased clay have increased soil capillary porosity the dominant pores holding soil water and therefore increased asws zare et al 2021 both pearson correlation and sem analysis confirmed the significant positive relationship between bd and asws while sem analysis revealed that asws could be directly affected by bd figs 3 and 4 this is because bd is closely related to soil texture and generally larger in areas with increased sand li et al 2019 wang et al 2012b for example coarse textured soil has a lower water potential than the fine textured soil with the same water content volumetric water content and facilitates soil water absorption by plant roots thus improving soil water availability jia et al 2020 santra et al 2018 precipitation in the region is the only source of soil water as groundwater levels are generally 30 100 m below the land surface turkeltaub et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 thus map exhibited a direct positive effect on asws fig 4 in the middle reaches of the yellow river where the loss deposit is thick soil water hardly percolates to the groundwater and evapotranspiration is the dominant method of soil water consumption li and huang 2008 in the cropland of the study area agricultural practices could interrupt the capillary soil pores and reduce water loss by evaporation wang et al 2010 according to an earlier study daily water loss in cropland from july to august by evapotranspiration was only 1 mm which was only half as much water that is lost in forest and grassland wang et al 2012a therefore asws under different lus followed the order of cropland forest grassland and lu exhibited a negative effect on asws p 0 01 fig 4 3 4 contribution change of main factors with soil depth and rainfall zone the paths and contributions of climate geography plant and edaphic properties of asws varied among different soil depths and rainfall zones figs 5 and 6 for different soil layers the contribution of map decreased with increasing soil depth r 0 34 and 0 19 in the 0 1 0 and 1 0 5 0 m soil layers respectively fig 5 the contribution of clay and bd to asws was positive however it increased with increasing soil depth the precipitation infiltration depth in the study area was generally shallower than 1 0 m especially in dry years wang et al 2010 thus the upper soil layer was the main site of precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration when the conditions were permissible as a result water in the deep soil layer 1 0 5 0 m was insulated by the upper soil layer 0 1 0 m and was not as sensitive to changes in climate choi and jacobs 2007 hu et al 2010 zhao et al 2019b contrary to the case in the upper layers lu exhibited a significant direct effect on asws in the deep layers likely due to differences in root distributions and water uptake in cropland forest and grassland areas fang et al 2016 jia and shao 2014 wheat is widely grown in the cropland of the yellow river basin and has a shallow rooting depth usually less than 1 m compared with the root distribution of annual crops in the cropland the root distribution of plants in the grassland and forest was deeper it has previously been reported that grass roots e g medicago sativa could use soil water found as deep as 3 0 m while the depth of soil water accessible by trees e g robinia pseudoacacia was in some cases twice as deep as that of grass wang et al 2010 for different rainfall zones the paths and number of factors controlling asws were the lowest and map r 0 57 was the dominant factor controlling asws in the 450 mm rainfall zone fig 6 with increasing precipitation the effect of clay and lu on asws strengthened while the effect of map on asws faded in the area with map 550 mm map exhibited a negative contribution to asws r 0 27 fig 6 in the 450 mm rainfall zone vegetation coverage was low and the terrain was relatively gentle wang et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 thus lu and sg hardly affected the asws variation and distribution in the 450 mm rainfall zone as map increased to 450 550 mm the amount of precipitation was adequate for infiltration and was no longer the main limiting factor for soil moisture laio et al 2001 teuling et al 2007 under these circumstances the influence of edaphic factors on water redistribution and plant soil water uptake as well as the subsequent transpiration determines the asws teuling and troch 2005 turkeltaub et al 2018 the antagonistic effects of map on asws in the 450 and 550 mm rainfall zones could be attributed to the strong effect of clay on asws and reverse distribution trends between clay and map excessive precipitation leads to runoff and deep migration of fine particles in the surface layer zehe et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 demonstrated that the spatial map distribution is negatively correlated with clay therefore as map increases the effect of precipitation on the asws is masked by the water redistribution dominated by edaphic properties 3 5 implications for soil water management and agricultural regionalisation strategies as one of the cradles of east asian agriculture the middle reaches of the yellow river constitute an important grain producing area with a long history of crop cultivation kuzmin et al 2009 wang et al 2018 recent studies however have shown that the barycentre of grain production in china has moved northward and crossed the yellow river wang et al 2018 seed and fertiliser quality did not increase in the same way grain output increased therefore the only possible cause of grain output doubling in the yellow river basin is the expansion of cropland zheng et al 2021 however owing to the poor natural conditions and fragile ecosystems in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin any small mistakes during land reclamation may put china s vulnerable grain output at risk especially when considering exposure to natural disasters guo et al 2006 yu et al 2018 in this context rational agricultural regionalisation and lu reform based on asws are essential for stabilising china s grain production and maintaining food security the root system of the crop is mainly distributed within the first metre of soil therefore the asws in the 0 1 0 m soil layer which is controlled by climate factors is crucial for grain production li et al 2019 in the mid section of the middle reaches of the yellow river the 0 1 0 m soil layer had higher levels of asws 90 mm and received sufficient levels of rainfall approximately 450 550 mm for appropriately land reclamation table 1 in areas with higher clay in the southern part of the study area the asws in the deep soil layer 1 0 5 0 m was mainly controlled by edaphic and climate factors fig 5 therefore the rational use of deep soil moisture 1 0 5 0 m in agricultural activities can be supported among the different rainfall zones asws in the 550 mm zone was mainly affected by edaphic factors fig 6 from the perspective of soil moisture to ensure the stability of food production and improve the ability of the agricultural ecosystem to endure extreme natural disasters land reclamation in areas with coarser textured soil was not recommended asws is one of the most important indicators that needs to be considered in agricultural regionalisation other agricultural natural resources socio economic and agricultural production characteristics of the region were also indispensable additionally vegetation construction in the middle reaches of the yellow river should acknowledge the spatial distribution characteristics and asws controlling factors jia et al 2017 estimated the regional net soil water losses in the forest and found that soil water in the 1 0 5 0 m profile generally decreased at a rate of 8 5 15 5 and 19 7 mm yr 1 in the 450 450 550 and 550 mm rainfall zones respectively based on the spatial asws distribution in this study table 1 converting the lu to forest will deplete the asws in the 1 0 5 0 m profile in 12 18 and 19 years for the three rainfall zones the depleted soil moisture below 1 m will be difficult to replenish by rainfall even in normal or wet year in the study area li and huang 2008 appropriate forest management practices such as thinning should thus be required regarding 12 to 19 year old stands to maintain a balance in soil water availability and water use by plants from the perspective of soil water management and vegetation sustainability large scale revegetation activities with trees or shrubs might not be the optimal solution for vegetation restoration in regions with map 450 mm in the middle reaches of the yellow river jia and shao 2014 according to the spatial asws and precipitation conditions optimal plant density or biomass can be determined using water balance models or soil water carrying capacity for vegetation models to guide revegetation strategies in the middle reaches of the yellow river fu et al 2012 jia et al 2019 4 conclusions across the middle reaches of the yellow river the mean asws in the upper 5 0 m soil layer was 305 7 mm and followed a decreasing order of 448 9 362 4 and 141 7 mm for the 550 450 550 and 450 mm rainfall zones respectively asws generally decreased from southeast to northwest of the basin with 85 of the total asws stored in the 450 mm rainfall zone the spatial asws variation was mainly controlled by climate and edaphic properties for the 0 1 0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone for the 1 0 5 0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone edaphic properties were the dominant factors that determined the spatial asws characteristics in the mid section of the middle reaches of the yellow river basin the 0 1 0 m soil layer received sufficient rainfall and had high levels of asws the rational use of deep soil moisture 1 0 5 0 m in agricultural and vegetation restoration activities can be supported in areas with high soil clay content in the southern regions of the study area agricultural regionalisation and land use reform based on the spatial characteristics and controlling factors of asws are essential for improving the ability of the
